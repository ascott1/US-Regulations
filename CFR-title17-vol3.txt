                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, April 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

    (a) General. (1) At the time of filing a disclosure document 
described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section relating to 
certain acquisitions, dispositions, business combinations, 
consolidations or similar transactions, the person filing the specified 
document shall pay a fee payable to the Commission to be calculated as 
set forth in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.
    (2) Only one fee per transaction is required to be paid. A required 
fee shall be reduced in an amount equal to any fee paid with respect to 
such transaction pursuant to either section 6(b) of the Securities Act 
of 1933 or any applicable provision of this rule; the fee requirements 
under section 6(b) shall be reduced in an amount equal to the fee paid 
the Commission with respect to a transaction under this regulation. No 
part of a filing fee is refundable.
    (3) If at any time after the initial payment the aggregate 
consideration offered is increased, an additional filing fee based upon 
such increase shall be paid with the required amended filing.

[[Page 18]]

    (4) When the fee is based upon the market value of securities, such 
market value shall be established by either the average of the high and 
low prices reported in the consolidated reporting system (for exchange 
traded securities and last sale reported over-the-counter securities) or 
the average of the bid and asked price (for other over-the-counter 
securities) as of a specified date within 5 business days prior to the 
date of the filing. If there is no market for the securities, the value 
shall be based upon the book value of the securities computed as of the 
latest practicable date prior to the date of the filing, unless the 
issuer of the securities is in bankruptcy or receivership or has an 
accumulated capital deficit, in which case one-third of the principal 
amount, par value or stated value of the securities shall be used.
    (5) The cover page of the filing shall set forth the calculation of 
the fee in tabular format, as well as the amount offset by a previous 
filing and the identification of such filing, if applicable.
    (b) Section 13(e)(1) filings. At the time of filing such statement 
as the Commission may require pursuant to section 13(e)(1) of the 
Exchange Act, a fee of one-fiftieth of one percent of the value of the 
securities proposed to be acquired by the acquiring person. The value of 
the securities proposed to be acquired shall be determined as follows:
    (1) The value of the securities to be acquired solely for cash shall 
be the amount of cash to be paid for them:
    (2) The value of the securities to be acquired with securities or 
other non-cash consideration, whether or not in combination with a cash 
payment for the same securities, shall be based upon the market value of 
the securities to be received by the acquiring person as established in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (c) Proxy and information statement filings. At the time of filing a 
preliminary proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-6(a) or preliminary 
information statement pursuant to Rule 14c-5(a) that concerns a merger, 
consolidation, acquisition of a company, or proposed sale or other 
disposition of substantially all the assets of the registrant (including 
a liquidation), the following fee:
    (1) For preliminary material involving a vote upon a merger, 
consolidation or acquisition of a company, a fee of one-fiftieth of one 
percent of the proposed cash payment or of the value of the securities 
and other property to be transferred to security holders in the 
transaction. The fee is payable whether the registrant is acquiring 
another company or being acquired.
    (i) The value of securities or other property to be transferred to 
security holders, whether or not in combination with a cash payment for 
the same securities, shall be based upon the market value of the 
securities to be received by the acquiring person as established in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (ii) Notwithstanding the above, where the acquisition, merger or 
consolidation is for the sole purpose of changing the registrant's 
domicile, no filing fee is required to be paid.
    (2) For preliminary material involving a vote upon a proposed sale 
or other disposition of substantially all the assets of the registrant, 
a fee of one-fiftieth of one percent of the aggregate of the cash and 
the value of the securities (other than its own) and other property to 
be received by the registrant. In the case of a disposition in which the 
registrant will not receive any property, such as at liquidation or 
spin-off, the fee shall be one-fiftieth of one percent of the aggregate 
of the cash and the value of the securities and other property to be 
distributed to security holders.
    (i) The value of the securities to be received (or distributed in 
the case of a spin-off or liquidation) shall be based upon the market 
value of such securities as established in accordance with paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section.
    (ii) The value of other property shall be a bona fide estimate of 
the fair market value of such property.
    (3) Where two or more companies are involved in the transaction, 
each shall pay a proportionate share of such fee, determined by the 
persons involved.
    (4) Notwithstanding the above, the fee required by this paragraph 
(c) shall not be payable for a proxy statement

[[Page 19]]

filed by a company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
    (d) Schedule 14D-1 filings. At the time of filing a Schedule 14D-1, 
a fee of one-fiftieth of one percent of the aggregate of the cash or of 
the value of the securities or other property offered by the bidder. 
Where the bidder is offering securities or other non-cash consideration 
for some or all of the securities to be acquired, whether or not in 
combination with a cash payment for the same securities, the value of 
the consideration to be offered for such securities shall be based upon 
the market value of the securities to be received by the bidder as 
established in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

this material during the period covered by the amendment, a statement to 
that effect shall be set forth in the amendment.

    (iii) If a national securities exchange keeps the information 
required in Exhibits L and M up to date and makes it available to the

a national securities exchange may certify that the information is kept 
up to date and is available to the Commission and the public upon 
request.
    (b) Unless exempted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, on or 
before June 30, 1983, and every three years thereafter each exchange

date on which these exhibits are filed, except that:
    (1) If a national securities exchange publishes or cooperates in the 
publication of the information required in these exhibits on an annual 
or more frequent basis, in lieu of filing such an exhibit a national 
securities exchange may:
    (i) Identify the publication in which such information is available, 
the name, address, and telephone number of the person from whom such 
publication may be obtained, and the price thereof; and
    (ii) Certify to the accuracy of such information as of its date;

registration statement, as amended, that either (1) is listed in 
response to Item 7 of the registration statement, as amended, of one or 
more other national securities exchanges; or (2) was an inactive 
subsidiary throughout the subsidiary's latest fiscal year. The 
Commission may grant such exemptions upon such terms and conditions as 
it deems are necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors 
and the public interest, provided, however, that at least one national 
securities exchange shall be required to make the periodic amendments 
required by this rule for an affiliate or subsidiary described in (c)(1)

Sec. 240.7c2-1  [Reserved]

                 Hypothecation of Customers' Securities


<R05>
Sec. 240.8c-1   Hypothecation of customers' securities.

    (a) General provisions. No member of a national securities exchange, 
and no broker or dealer who transacts a business in securities through 
the medium of any such member shall, directly or indirectly, hypothecate 
or arrange for or permit the continued hypothecation of any securities 
carried for the account of any customer under circumstances:
    (1) That will permit the commingling of securities carried for the 
account of any such customer with securities carried for the account of 
any other customer, without first obtaining the written consent of each 
such customer to such hypothecation;
    (2) That will permit such securities to be commingled with 
securities carried for the account of any person other than a bona fide 
customer of such member, broker or dealer under a lien for a loan made 
to such member, broker or dealer; or
    (3) That will permit securities carried for the account of customers 
to be hypothecated or subjected to any lien or liens or claim or claims 
of the pledges or pledgees, for a sum which exceeds the aggregate 
indebtedness of all customers in respect of securities carried for their 
accounts; except that this clause shall not be deemed to be violated by 
reason of an excess arising on any day through the reduction of the 
aggregate indebtedness of customers on such day, provided that funds or 
securities in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess are paid or 
placed in transfer to pledgees for the purpose of reducing the sum of 
the liens or claims to which securities carried for the account of 
customers are subjected as promptly as practicable after such reduction 
occurs, but before the lapse of one-half hour after the commencement of 
banking hours on the next banking day at the place where the largest 
principal amount of loans of such member, broker or dealer are payable 
and, in any event, before such member, broker or dealer on such day has 
obtained or increased any bank loan collateralized by securities carried 
for the account of customers.
    (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
    (1) The term customer shall not be deemed to include any general or 
special partner or any director or officer of such member, broker, or 
dealer, or any participant, as such, in any joint group or syndicate 
account with such member, broker, or dealer or with any partner, officer 
or director thereof;
    (2) The term securities carried for the account of any customer 
shall be deemed to mean:
    (i) Securities received by or on behalf of such member, broker or 
dealer for the account of any customer;
    (ii) Securities sold and appropriated by such member, broker or 
dealer to a customer, except that if such securities were subject to a 
lien when appropriated to a customer they shall not be deemed to be 
``securities carried for the account of any customer'' pending their 
release from such lien as promptly as practicable:
    (iii) Securities sold, but not appropriated, by such member, broker 
or dealer to a customer who has made any payment therefor, to the extent 
that such member, broker or dealer owns and has received delivery of 
securities of like kind, except that if such securities were subject to 
a lien when such payment was made they shall not be deemed to be 
``securities carried for the account of any customer'' pending their 
release from such lien as promptly as practicable:
    (3) ``Aggregate indebtedness'' shall not be deemed to be reduced by 
reason of uncollected items. In computing aggregate indebtedness, 
related guaranteed and guarantor accounts shall be treated as a single 
account and considered on a consolidated basis, and balances in accounts 
carrying both long and short positions shall be adjusted by

[[Page 36]]

treating the market value of the securities required to cover such short 
positions as though such market value were a debit; and
    (4) In computing the sum of the liens or claims to which securities 
carried for the account of customers of a member, broker or dealer are 
subject, any rehypothecation of such securities by another member, 
broker or dealer who is subject to this section or to Sec. 240.15c2-1 
shall be disregarded.
    (c) Exemption for cash accounts. The provisions of paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section shall not apply to any hypothecation of securities 
carried for the account of a customer in a special cash account within 
the meaning of 12 CFR 220.4(c): Provided, That at or before the 
completion of the transaction of purchase of such securities for, or of 
sale of such securities to, such customer, written notice is given or 
sent to such customer disclosing that such securities are or may be 
hypothecated under circumstances which will permit the commingling 
thereof with securities carried for the account of other customers. The 
term the completion of the transaction shall have the meaning given to 
such term by Sec. 240.15c1-1(b).
    (d) Exemption for clearinghouse liens. The provisions of paragraphs 
(a)(2), (a)(3), and (f) of this section shall not apply to any lien or 
claim of the clearing corporation, or similar department or association, 
of a national securities exchange or a registered national securities 
association for a loan made and to be repaid on the same calendar day, 
which is incidental to the clearing of transactions in securities or 
loans through such corporation, department, or association: Provided, 
however, That for the purpose of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, 
``aggregate indebtedness of all customers in respect of securities 
carried for their accounts'' shall not include indebtedness in respect 
of any securities subject to any lien or claim exempted by this 
paragraph.
    (e) Exemption for certain liens on securities of noncustomers. The 
provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall not be deemed to 
prevent such member, broker or dealer from permitting securities not 
carried for the account of a customer to be subjected (1) to a lien for 
a loan made against securities carried for the account of customers, or 
(2) to a lien for a loan made and to be repaid on the same calendar day. 
For the purpose of this exemption, a loan shall be deemed to be ``made 
against securities carried for the account of customers'' if only 
securities carried for the account of customers are used to obtain or to 
increase such loan or as substitutes for other securities carried for 
the account of customers.
    (f) Notice and certification requirements. No person subject to this 
section shall hypothecate any security carried for the account of a 
customer unless at or prior to the time of each such hypothecation, he 
gives written notice to the pledgee that the security pledged is carried 
for the account of a customer and that such hypothecation does not 
contravene any provision of this section, except that in the case of an 
omnibus account the members, broker or dealer for whom such account is 
carried may furnish a signed statement to the person carrying such 
account that all securities carried therein by such member, broker or 
dealer will be securities carried for the account of his customers and 
that the hypothecation thereof by such member, broker or dealer will not 
contravene any provision of this section. The provisions of this 
paragraph shall not apply to any hypothecation of securities under any 
lien or claim of a pledgee securing a loan made and to be repaid on the 
same calendar day.
    (g) The fact that securities carried for the accounts of customers 
and securities carried for the accounts of others are represented by one 
or more certificates in the custody of a clearing corporation or other 
subsidiary organization of either a national securities exchange or of a 
registered national securities association, or of a custodian bank, in 
accordance with a system for the central handling of securities 
established by a national securities exchange or a registered national 
securities association, pursuant to which system the hypothecation of 
such securities is effected by bookkeeping entries without physical 
delivery of such securities, shall not, in and of itself, result in a 
commingling of securities prohibited by paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of 
this section, whenever a participating

[[Page 37]]

member, broker or dealer hypothecates securities in accordance with such 
system: Provided, however, That (1) any such custodian of any securities 
held by or for such system shall agree that it will not for any reason, 
including the assertion of any claim, right or lien of any kind, refuse 
to refrain from promptly delivering any such securities (other than 
securities then hypothecated in accordance with such system) to such 
clearing corporation or other subsidiary organization or as directed by 
it, except that nothing in such agreement shall be deemed to require the 
custodian to deliver any securities in contravention of any notice of 
levy, seizure or similar notice, or order or judgment, issued or 
directed by a governmental agency or court, or officer thereof, having 
jurisdiction over such custodian, which on its face affects such 
securities; (2) such systems shall have safeguards in the handling, 
transfer and delivery of securities and provisions for fidelity bond 
coverage of the employees and agents of the clearing corporation or 
other subsidiary organization and for periodic examinations by 
independent public accountants; and (3) the provisions of this paragraph 
shall not be effective with respect to any particular system unless the 
agreement required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section and the 
safeguards and provisions required by paragraph (g)(2) of this section 
shall have been deemed adequate by the Commission for the protection of 
investors, and unless any subsequent amendments to such agreement, 
safeguards or provisions shall have been deemed adequate by the 
Commission for the protection of investors.

foreign securities exchange on which standardized options are traded.
    (2) Options class means all options contracts covering the same 
underlying instrument.
    (3) Options disclosure document means a document prepared by one or 
more options markets which contains the information required by this 
rule with respect to the options classes covered by the document.
    (4) Standardized options are options contracts trading on a national 
securities exchange, an automated quotation system of a registered 
securities association, or a foreign securities exchange which relate to 
options classes the terms of which are limited to specific expiration 
dates and exercise prices, or such other securities as the Commission 
may, by order, designate.
    (b)(1) Five preliminary copies of an options disclosure document 
containing the information specified in paragraph (c) of this section 
shall be filed with the Commission by an options market at least 60 days 
prior to the date definitive copies are furnished to customers, unless 
the commission determines otherwise having due regard to the adequacy of 
the information disclosed and the public interest and protection of 
investors. Five copies of the definitive options disclosure document 
shall be filed with the Commission not later than the date the options 
disclosure document is furnished to customers. Notwithstanding the 
above, the use of an options disclosure document shall not be permitted 
unless the options class to which such document relates is the subject 
of an effective registration statement on Form S-20 under the Securities 
Act.
    (2)(i) If the information contained in the options disclosure 
document becomes or will become materially inaccurate or incomplete or 
there is or will be an omission of material information necessary to 
make the disclosure document not misleading, the options market shall 
amend its options disclosure document by filing five copies of an 
amendment to such document with the Commission at least 30 days prior to

[[Page 38]]

the date definitive copies are furnished to customers, unless the 
Commission determines otherwise having due regard to the adequacy of the 
information disclosed and the public interest and protection of 
investors. Five copies of the definitive options disclosure document, as 
amended, shall be filed with the Commission not later than the date the 
amended options disclosure document is furnished to customers.
    (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, an options 
market may distribute such materials prior to such 30-day period if it 
determines, in good faith, that such delivery is necessary to ensure 
timely and accurate disclosure with respect to the subject standardized 
options contracts. Five copies of any amendment distributed pursuant to 
this paragraph shall be filed with the Commission at the time of 
distribution. In that instance, if the Commission determines, having 
given due regard to the adequacy of the information disclosed and the 
public interest and the protection of investors, it may require refiling 
of the amendment pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this Rule.
    (c) Information required in an options disclosure document. An 
options disclosure document shall contain the following information,

an order from a customer to purchase or sell an option contract relating 
to an options class that is the subject of an options disclosure 
document, or approve the customer's account for the trading of such 
option, unless the broker or dealer furnishes or has furnished to the 
customer the options disclosure document.
    (2) If an options disclosure document is amended, each broker and 
dealer shall promptly send the information contained in the definitive 
amendment to each customer whose account is approved for trading the 
options class(es) to which the options disclosure document relates.

                               Short Sales


<R05>
Sec. 240.10a-1  Short sales.

    (a)(1)(i) No person shall, for his own account or for the account of 
any other person, effect a short sale of any security registered on, or 
admitted to unlisted trading privileges on, a national securities 
exchange, if trades in such security are reported pursuant to an 
``effective transaction reporting plan'' as defined in Sec. 240.11Aa3-1 
(Rule 11Aa3-1 under the Act), and information as to such trades is made 
available in accordance with such plan on a real-time basis to vendors 
of market transaction information, (A) below the price at which the last 
sale thereof, regular way, was reported pursuant to an effective 
transaction reporting plan; or (B) at such price unless such price is 
above the next proceeding different price at which a sale of such 
security, regular way, was reported pursuant to an effective transaction 
reporting plan.
    (ii) The provisions of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section hereof 
shall not apply to transactions by any person in NASDAQ securities as 
defined in

[[Page 39]]

Sec. 240.11Aa3-1 (Rule 11Aa3-1 under the Act) except for those NASDAQ 
securities for which transaction reports are collected, processed, and 
made available pursuant to the plan originally submitted to the 
Commission pursuant to Rule 17a-15 (subsequently amended and 
redesignated as Rule 11Aa3-1) under the Act, which plan was declared 
effective as of May 17, 1974.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, any exchange, 
by rule, may require that no person shall, for his own account or the 
account of any other person, effect a short sale of any such security on 
that exchange (i) below the price at which the last sale thereof, 
regular way, was effected on such exchange, or (ii) at such price unless 
such price is above the next preceding different price at which a sale 
of such securities, regular way, was effected on such exchange, if that 
exchange determines that such action is necessary or appropriate in its 
market in the public interest or for the protection of investors; and, 
if an exchange adopts such a rule, no person shall, for his own account 
or for the account of any other person, effect a short sale of any such 
security on such exchange otherwise than in accordance with such rule, 
and compliance with any such rule of an exchange shall constitute 
compliance with this paragraph (a).
    (3) In determining the price at which a short sale may be effected 
after a security goes ex-dividend, ex-right, or ex-any other 
distribution, all sale prices prior to the ``ex'' date may be reduced by 
the value of such distribution.
    (b) No person shall, for his own account or for the account of any 
other person, effect on a national securities exchange a short sale of 
any security not covered by paragraph (a) of this rule, (1) below the 
price at which the last sale thereof, regular way, was effected on such 
exchange, or (2) at such price unless such price is above the next 
preceding different price at which a sale of such security, regular way, 
was effected on such exchange. In determining the price at which a short 
sale may be effected after a security goes ex-dividend, ex-right, or ex-
any other distribution, all sale prices prior to the ``ex'' date may be 
reduced by the value of such distribution.
    (c) No broker or dealer shall, by the use of any facility of a 
national securities exchange, or any means or instrumentality of 
interstate commerce, or of the mails, effect any sell order for a 
security registered on, or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on, a 
national securities exchange unless such order is marked either ``long'' 
or ``short.''
    (d) No broker or dealer shall mark any order to sell a security 
registered on, or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on, a national 
securities exchange ``long'' unless (1) the security to be delivered 
after sale is carried in the account for which the sale is to be 
effected, or (2) such broker or dealer is informed that the seller owns 
the security ordered to be sold and, as soon as is possible without 
undue inconvenience or expense, will deliver the security owned to the

    (e) The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section (and of 
any exchange rule adopted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this 
section) shall not apply to:
    (1) Any sale by any person, for an account in which he has an 
interest, if such person owns the security sold and intends to deliver

expense;
    (2) Any broker or dealer in respect of a sale, for an account in 
which he has no interest, pursuant to an order to sell which is marked

registered for such security, or any over-the-counter sale by a third 
market maker to offset odd-lot orders of customers;

dealer or such market maker by more than the unit of trading;
    (5) Any sale of a security covered by paragraph (a) of this section 
(except a sale to a stabilizing bid complying with Sec. 242.104 of this 
chapter) by a registered

specialist or registered exchange market maker for its own account on 
any exchange with which it is registered for such security, or by a 
third market maker for its own account over-the-counter,
    (i) Effected at a price equal to or above the last sale, regular 
way, reported for such security pursuant to an effective transaction 
reporting plan; or
    (ii) Effected at a price equal to the most recent offer communicated 
for the security by such registered specialist, registered exchange 
market maker or third market maker to an exchange or a national

if such offer, when communicated, was equal to or above the last sale, 
regular way, reported for such security pursuant to an effective 
transaction reporting plan:

Provided, however, That any exchange, by rule, may prohibit its 
registered specialist and registered exchange market makers from 
availing themselves of the exemption afforded by this paragraph (e)(5) 
if that exchange determines that such action is necessary or appropriate 
in its market in the public interest or for the protection of investors;
    (6) Any sale of a security covered by paragraph (b) of this section 
on a national securities exchange (except a sale to a stabilizing bid 
complying with Sec. 242.104 of this chapter) effected with the approval

security thereon with the current price of such security on another 
national securities exchange which is the principal exchange market for 
such security;
    (7) Any sale of a security for a special arbitrage acccount by a 
person who then owns another security by virtue of which he is, or 
presently will be, entitled to acquire an equivalent number of 
securities of the same class as the securities sold; provided such sale, 
or the purchase with such sale offsets, is effected for the bona fide 
purpose of profitting from a current difference between the price of 
security sold and the security owned and that such right of acquisition 
was originally attached to or represented by another security or was 
issued to all the holders of any such class of securities of the issuer.
    (8) Any sale of a security registered on, or admitted to unlisted 
trading privileges on, a national securities exchange effected for a 
special international arbitrage account for the bona fide purpose of 
profitting from a current difference between the price of such security 
on a securities market not within or subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States and on a securities market subject to the jurisdiction of 
the United States; provided the seller at the time of such sale knows 
or, by virtue of information currently received, has reasonable grounds 
to believe that an offer enabling him to cover such sale is then 
available to him such foreign securities market and intends to accept 
such offer immediately;
    (9)  [Reserved]
    (10) Any sale by an underwriter, or any member of a syndicate or 
group participating in the distribution of a security, in connection 
with an over-allotment of securities, or any lay-off sale by such a 
person in connection with a distribution of securities through rights or 
a standby underwriting commitment; or
    (11) Any sale of a security covered by paragraph (a) of this section 
(except a sale to a stabilizing bid complying with Sec. 242.104 of this 
chapter) by any broker or dealer, for his own account or for the account 
of any other person, effected at a price to the most recent offer 
communicated by such broker or dealer to an exchange or association 
pursuant to Sec. 240.11Ac1-1 in an amount less than or equal to the 
quotation size associated with such offer, if such offer, when 
communicated, was (i) above the price at which the last sale, regular 
way, for such security was reported pursuant to an effective transaction 
reporting plan; or (ii) at such last sale price, if such last sale price 
is above the next preceding different price at which a sale of such 
security, regular way, was reported pursuant to an effective transaction 
reporting plan.
    (12) For the purposes of paragraph (e)(8) of this section, a 
depositary receipt of a security shall be deemed to be the same security 
as the security represented by such receipt. For the purposes of 
paragraphs (e)(3), (4) and (5)

[[Page 41]]

of this section, the term ``third market maker'' shall mean any broker 
or dealer who holds itself out as being willing to buy and sell a 
reported security for its own account on a regular and continuous basis 
otherwise than on an exchange in amounts of less than block size.
    (13) A broker-dealer that has acquired a security while acting in 
the capacity of a block positioner shall be deemed to own such security 
for the purposes of Rule 3b-3 (Sec. 240.3b-3) and of this section not 
withstanding that such broker-dealer may not have a net long position in 
such security if and to the extent that such broker-dealer's short 
position in such security is the subject of one or more offsetting 
positions created in the course of bona fide arbitrage, risk arbitrage, 
or bona fide hedge activities.
    (f) This rule shall not prohibit any transaction or transactions 
which the Commission, upon written request or upon its own motion, 
exempts, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions.

Sec. 240.10a-2   Requirements for covering purchases.

    (a) No broker or dealer shall lend, or arrange for the loan of, any 
security registered on, or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on, a 
national securities exchange for delivery to the broker for the 
purchaser after sale, or shall fail to deliver a security on the date 
delivery is due, if such broker or dealer knows or has reasonable 
grounds to believe that the sale was effected, or will be effected, 
pursuant to an order marked ``long,'' unless such broker or dealer 
knows, or has been informed by the seller (1) that the security sold has 
been forwarded to the account for which the sale was effected, or (2) 
that the seller owns the security sold, that it is then impracticable to 
deliver to such account the security owned and that he will deliver such 
security to such account as soon as it is possible without undue 
inconvenience or expense.
    (b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply 
(1) to the lending of a security registered on, or admitted to unlisted 
trading privileges on, a national securities exchange by a broker or 
dealer through the medium of a loan to another broker or dealer, or (2) 
to any loan, or arrangement for the loan, of any such security, or to 
any failure to deliver any such security if, prior to such loan, 
arrangement or failure to deliver, a national securities exchange, in 
the case of a sale effected thereon, or a national securities 
association, in the case of a sale not effected on an exchange, finds 
(i) that such sale resulted from a mistake made in good faith, (ii) that 
due diligence was used to ascertain that the circumstances specified in 
Sec. 240.10a-1(d)(1) existed or to obtain the information specified in 
clause (2) thereof, and (iii) either that the condition of the market at 
the time the mistake was discovered was such that undue hardship would 
result from covering the transaction by a ``purchase for cash'' or that 
the mistake was made by the seller's broker and the sale was at a price 
permissible for a short sale under Sec. 240.10a-1 (a) or (b).

will be furnished upon written request of such customer; and

broker from such customer in connection with the transaction unless 
remuneration paid by such customer is determined pursuant to written 
agreement with such customer, otherwise than on a transaction basis; and

Sec. 240.11Ac1-2 or a security authorized for quotation on an automated

the underlying receivables or other financial assets are prepaid and a 
statement of the fact that information concerning the factors that 
affect yield (including at a minimum estimated yield, weighted average 
life, and the prepayment assumptions underlying yield) will be furnished 
upon written request of such customer; and

such securities and that the source and nature of the compensation 
received in connection with the particular transaction will be furnished 
upon written request of the customer; and
    (iv) The source and amount of any other remuneration received or to 
be received by him in connection with the transaction: Provided,

Sec. 240.10b-13   Prohibiting other purchases during tender offer or exchange offer.

    (a) No person who makes a cash tender offer or exchange offer for

arrangement to purchase, any such security (or any other security which 
is immediately convertible into or exchangeable for such security), 
otherwise than pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer, from the 
time such tender offer or exchange offer is publicly announced or 
otherwise made known by

[[Page 48]]

such person to holders of the security to be acquired until the 
expiration of the period, including any extensions thereof, during which 
securities tendered pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer may 
by the terms of such offer be accepted or rejected: Provided, however, 
That if such person is the owner of another security which is 
immediately convertible into or exchangeable for the security which is 
the subject of the offer, his subsequent exercise of his right of 
conversion or exchange with respect to such other security shall not be 
prohibited by this section.
    (b) The term exchange offer as used in this section shall include a 
tender offer for, or request or invitation for tenders of, any security

    (c) The provisions of this section shall not apply to a purchase of 
a security of the same class as that which is the subject of a cash 
tender offer or exchange offer (or of any other security which is 
immediately convertible into or exchangeable for such security) if such 
purchase is made by the issuer, by participating employees of the issuer 
or the employees of its subsidiaries, or by the trustee or other person 
acquiring such security for the account of such employees, pursuant to 
(1) a stock option plan involving only ``qualified stock options,'' or 
qualifying as an ``employee stock purchase plan'' as those terms are 
defined in sections 422 and 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as 
amended, or ``restricted stock options'' as defined in section 424(b) of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended: Provided, however, That

pension or other stock purchase plan providing for both (i) periodic 
payments (or payroll deductions) for acquisition of securities by or on

if the Commission, upon written request or upon its own motion, exempts

Sec. 240.10b-16   Disclosure of credit terms in margin transactions.

    (a) It shall be unlawful for any broker or dealer to extend credit, 
directly or indirectly, to any customer in connection with any

    (1) Is given or sent at the time of opening the account, a written 
statement or statements disclosing (i) the conditions under which an 
interest charge will be imposed; (ii) the annual rate or rates of 
interest that can be imposed; (iii) the method of computing interest; 
(iv) if rates of interest are subject to change without prior notice,

accounts; (vi) what other charges resulting from the extension of 
credit, if any, will be made and under what conditions; and (vii) the 
nature of any interest or lien retained by the broker or dealer in the 
security or other property held as collateral and the conditions under 
which additional collateral can be required: Provided, however, That the 
requirements of this subparagraph will be met in any case where the 
account is opened by telephone if the information required to be 
disclosed is orally communicated to the customer at that time and the 
required written statement or statements are sent to the customer 
immediately thereafter: And provided, further, That in the case of 
customers to whom credit is already being extended on the effective date 
of this section, the written statement or statements required hereunder 
must be

[[Page 49]]

given or sent to said customers within 90 days after the effective date 
of this section; and
    (2) Is given or sent a written statement or statements, at least 
quarterly, for each account in which credit was extended, disclosing (i) 
the balance at the beginning of the period; the date, amount and a brief 
description of each debit and credit entered during such period; the 
closing balance; and, if interest is charged for a period different from 
the period covered by the statement, the balance as of the last day of 
the interest period; (ii) the total interest charge for the period 
during which interest is charged (or, if interest is charged separately 
for separate accounts, the total interest charge for each such account), 
itemized to show the dates on which the interest period began and ended; 
the annual rate or rates of interest charged and the interest charge for 
each such different annual rate of interest; and either each different 
debit balance on which an interest calculation was based or the average 
debit balance for the interest period, except that if an average debit 
balance is used, a separate average debit balance must be disclosed for 
each interest rate applied; and (iii) all other charges resulting from 
the extension of credit in that account: Provided, however, That if the 
interest charge disclosed on a statement is for a period different from 
the period covered by the statement, there must be printed on the 
statement appropriate language to the effect that it should be retained 
for use in conjunction with the next statement containing the remainder 
of the required information: And provided further, That in the case of 
``equity funding programs'' registered under the Securities Act of 1933, 
the requirements of this paragraph will be met if the broker or dealer 
furnishes to the customer, within 1 month after each extension of 
credit, a written statement or statements containing the information 
required to be disclosed under this paragraph.
    (b) It shall be unlawful for any broker or dealer to make any 
changes in the terms and conditions under which credit charges will be 
made (as described in the initial statement made under paragraph (a) of 
this section), unless the customer shall have been given not less than 
thirty (30) days written notice of such changes, except that no such 
prior notice shall be necessary where such changes are required by law: 
Provided, however, That if any change for which prior notice would 
otherwise be required under this paragraph results in a lower interest 
charge to the customer than would have been imposed before the change, 
notice of such change may be given within a reasonable time after the 
effective date of the change.

    (a) No member of a national securities exchange, while on the floor 
of such exchange, shall initiate, directly or indirectly, any 
transaction in any security admitted to trading on such exchange, for 
any account in which such member has an interest, or for any such 
account with respect to which such member has discretion as to the time

which he is so registered on such exchange;
    (2) Any transaction for the account of an odd-lot dealer in a 
security in which he is so registered on such exchange;
    (3) Any stabilizing transaction effected in compliance with 
Sec. 242.104 of this chapter to facilitate a distribution of such 
security in which such member is participating;
    (4) Any bona fide arbitrage transaction;
    (5) Any transaction made with the prior approval of a floor official

to reverse any such transaction;
    (6) Any transaction to offset a transaction made in error; or
    (7) Any transaction effected in conformity with a plan designed to 
eliminate floor trading activities which are not beneficial to the 
market and which plan has been adopted by an exchange and declared

with the Commission by a national securities exchange shall not become 
effective unless the Commission, having due regard for the maintenance 
of fair and orderly markets, for the public interest, and for the 
protection of investors, declares the plan to be effective.

exchange'' shall include the trading floor; the rooms, lobbies, and 
other premises immediately adjacent thereto for use of members 
generally; other rooms, lobbies and premises made available primarily 
for use by members generally;

    Editorial Note 1: The Commission finding that the floor trading plan 
of the New York Stock Exchange filed on May 25, 1964 is designed to 
eliminate floor trading activities not beneficial to the market hereby 
declares such plan effective August 3, 1964 subject to suspension or 
termination on sixty days written notice from the Commission, 29 FR 
7381, June 6, 1964.

    Editorial Note 2: The text of the Commission's action declaring 
effective the amendments to the Floor Trading Plan of the American Stock 
Exchange is as follows, 33 FR 1073, Jan. 27, 1968:
    The Securities and Exchange Commission acting pursuant to the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, particularly sections 11(a) and 23(a) 
thereof, and Rule 11a-1 (17 CFR 240.11a-1) under the Act, deeming it 
necessary for the exercise of the functions vested in it, and having due 
regard for the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, for the public 
interest, and for the protection of investors, hereby declares the Floor 
Trading Plan of the American Stock Exchange, as amended by amendments 
filed on May 11, 1967, effective January 31, 1968. If at any time it 
appears to the Commission to be necessary or appropriate in the public 
interest, for the protection of investors, or for the maintenance of 
fair and orderly markets, or that floor trading activities which are not 
beneficial to the market have not been eliminated by the Floor Trading 
Plan of the American Stock Exchange, the Commission may suspend or 
terminate the effectiveness of the plan by sending at least 60 days 
written notice to the American Stock Exchange. The American Stock 
Exchange shall have the opportunity to submit any written data, facts, 
arguments, or modifications in its plan within such 60-day period in 
such form as the Commission deems appropriate under the circumstances. 
The Commission has been informed that all persons subject to the Floor 
Trading Plan of the American Stock Exchange, as amended, have had actual 
notice thereof, and the Commission finds that notice and procedure 
pursuant to section 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 
section 553) are impracticable and unnecessary and that such Plan, as 
amended, may be, and is hereby, declared effective on January 31, 1968.

Sec. 240.11a1-1(T)   Transactions yielding priority, parity, and precedence.

    (a) A transaction effected on a national securities exchange for the 
account of a member which meets the requirements of section 
11(a)(1)(G)(i) of the Act shall be deemed, in accordance with the 
requirements of section 11(a)(1)(G)(ii), to be not inconsistent with the 
maintenance of fair and orderly markets and to yield priority, parity, 
and precedence in execution to orders for the account of persons who are 
not members or associated with members of the exchange if such 
transaction is effected in compliance with each of the following 
requirements:
    (1) A member shall disclose that a bid or offer for its account is 
for its account to any member with whom such bid or offer is placed or 
to whom it is communicated, and any such member through whom that bid or 
offer is communicated shall disclose to others participating in 
effecting the order that it is for the account of a member.
    (2) Immediately before executing the order, a member (other than the 
specialist in such security) presenting any order for the account of a 
member on the exchange shall clearly announce or otherwise indicate to 
the specialist and to other members then present for the trading in such 
security on the exchange that he is presenting an order for the account 
of a member.
    (3) Notwithstanding rules of priority, parity, and precedence 
otherwise applicable, any member presenting for execution a bid or offer 
for its own account or for the account of another member shall grant 
priority to any bid or offer at the same price for the account of a 
person who is not, or is not associated with, a member, irrespective of 
the size of any such bid or offer or the time when entered.
    (b) A member shall be deemed to meet the requirements of section 
11(a)(1)(G)(i) of the Act if during its preceding fiscal year more than 
50 percent of its gross revenues was derived from one or more of the 
sources specified in that section. In addition to any revenue which 
independently meets the requirements of section 11(a)(1)(G)(i), revenue 
derived from any transaction specified in paragraph (A), (B), or (D) of 
section 11(a)(1) of the Act or specified

or more of the sources specified in section 11(a)(1)(G)(i). A member may 
rely on a list of members which are stated to meet the requirements of 
section 11(a)(1)(G)(i) if such list is prepared, and updated at least 
annually, by the exchange. In preparing any such list, an exchange may 
rely on a report which sets forth a statement of gross revenues of a 
member if covered by a report of independent accountants for such member 
to the effect that such report has been prepared in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles.

          Exemption of Certain Securities From section 11(d)(1)


<R05>
Sec. 240.11d1-1   Exemption of certain securities from section 11(d)(1).

    A security shall be exempt from the provisions of section 11(d)(1) 
with respect to any transaction by a broker and dealer who, directly or 
indirectly extends or maintains or arranges for the extension or 
maintenance of credit on the security to or for a customer if:
    (a) The broker and dealer has not sold the security to the customer 
or bought the security for the customer's account; or
    (b) The security is acquired by the customer in exchange with the 
issuer thereof for an outstanding security of the same issuer on which 
credit was lawfully maintained for the customer at the time of the 
exchange; or

[[Page 60]]

    (c) The customer is a broker or dealer or bank; or
    (d) The security is acquired by the customer through the exercise of 
a right evidenced by a warrant or certificate expiring within 90 days 
after issuance, provided such right was originally issued to the 
customer as a stockholder of the corporation issuing the security upon 
which credit is to be extended, or as a stockholder of a company 
distributing such security in order to effectuate the provisions of 
section 11 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. The right 
shall be deemed to be issued to the customer as a stockholder if he 
actually owned the stock giving rise to the right when such right 
accrued, even though such stock was not registered in his name; and in 
determining such fact the broker and dealer may rely upon a signed 
statement of the customer which the broker and dealer accepts in good 
faith; or
    (e) Such broker and dealer would otherwise be subject to the 
prohibition of section 11(d)(1) with respect to 50 percent or less of 
all the securities of the same class which are outstanding or currently 
being distributed, and such broker and dealer sold the security to the 
customer or bought the security for the customer's account on a day when 
he was not participating in the distribution of any new issue of such 
security. A brokerdealer shall be deemed to be participating in a 
distribution of a new issue if (1) he owns, directly or indirectly, any 
undistributed security of such issue, or (2) he is engaged in any 
stabilizing activities to facilitate a distribution of such issue, or 
(3) he is a party to any syndicate agreement under which such 
stabilizing activities are being or may be undertaken, or (4) he is a 
party to an executory agreement to purchase or distribute such issue.

shall be exempted from the provisions of section 11(d)(1) with respect 
to any transaction by a person who is a broker and a dealer who, 
directly or indirectly, extends or maintains or arranges for the 
extension or maintenance of credit on such security, provided such 
security has been owned by the person to whom credit would be provided 
for more than 30 days, or purchased by such person pursuant to a plan 
for the automatic reinvestment of the dividends of such company or 
trust.

mechanisms of, a national market system or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act.
    (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, a proposed amendment may be put into effect summarily upon 
publication of notice of such amendment, on a temporary basis not to 
exceed 120 days, if the Commission finds that such action is necessary 
or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors 
or the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to remove impediments 
to, and perfect mechanisms of, a national market system or otherwise in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
    (5) Any plan (or amendment thereto) in connection with:
    (i) The planning, development, operation or regulation of a national

facilities designed to achieve compliance by self-regulatory 
organizations and/or their members of any section of this subpart

Commission pursuant to section 11A of the Act (or pursuant to any rule 
or regulation thereunder) prior to the effective date of this section

been filed and approved pursuant to this section and no additional 
filing need be made by the sponsors with respect to such plan or 
amendment; Provided, however,  That all terms and conditions associated 
with any such approval (including time limitations) shall continue to be 
applicable; and, Provided, further, That any amendment to such plan 
filed with or approved by the Commission on or after the effective date 
of this section shall be subject to the provisions of, and considered in 
accordance with the procedures specified in, this section.
    (d) Compliance with terms of national market system plans. Each 
self-regulatory organization shall comply with the terms of any 
effective national market system plan of which it is a sponsor or a 
participant. Each self-regulatory organization also shall, absent 
reasonable justification or excuse, enforce compliance with any such 
plan by its members and persons associated with its members.

[[Page 66]]

    (e) Appeals. The Commission may, in its discretion, entertain 
appeals in connection with the implementation or operation of any 
effective national market system plan as follows:
    (1) Any action taken or failure to act by any person in connection 
with an effective national market system plan (other than a prohibition 
or limitation of access reviewable by the Commission pursuant to section 
11A(b)(5) or section 19(d) of the Act) shall be subject to review by the 
Commission, on its own motion or upon application by any person 
aggrieved thereby (including, but not limited to, self-regulatory 
organizations, brokers, dealers, issuers, and vendors), filed not later 
than 30 days after notice of such action or failure to act or within 
such longer period as the Commission may determine.
    (2) Application to the Commission for review, or the institution of 
review by the Commission on its own motion, shall not operate as a stay 
of any such action unless the Commission determines otherwise, after 
notice and opportunity for hearing on the question of a stay (which 
hearing may consist only of affidavits or oral arguments).
    (3) In any proceedings for review, if the Commission, after 
appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing (which hearing may 
consist solely of consideration of the record of any proceedings 
conducted in connection with such action or failure to act and an 
opportunity for the presentation of reasons supporting or opposing such 
action or failure to act) and upon consideration of such other data, 
views and arguments as it deems relevant, finds that the action or 
failure to act is in accordance with the applicable provisions of such 
plan and that the applicable provisions are, and were, applied in a 
manner consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, 
the maintenance of fair and orderly markets and the removal of 
impediments to, and perfection of the mechanisms of, a national market 
system, the Commission, by order, shall dismiss the proceeding. If the 
Commission does not make any such finding, or if it finds that such 
action or failure to act imposes any burden on competition not necessary 
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, the 
Commission, by order, shall set aside such action and/or require such 
action with respect to the matter reviewed as the Commission deems 
necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of 
investors, and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, or to remove 
impediments to, and perfect the mechanisms of, a national market system.
    (f) Exemptions. The Commission may exempt from the provisions of

security listed or admitted to unlisted trading privileges which is 
communicated on any exchange by any responsible broker or dealer, but

made such bid or offer and the quotation size associated with it.
    (3)(i) If, at any time an exchange is open for trading, such 
exchange determines, pursuant to rules approved by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act (15 U.S.C.

unusual market conditions is such that the exchange is incapable of 
collecting,

[[Page 70]]

processing, and making available to quotation vendors the data for a 
subject security required to be made available pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section in a manner that accurately reflects the current

    (ii) During any period an exchange, or any responsible broker or 
dealer that is a member of that exchange, is relieved of any obligation 
imposed by this section for any subject security by virtue of a 
notification made pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, such 
exchange shall monitor the activity or conditions which formed the basis 
for such notification and shall immediately renotify all specified 
persons when that exchange is once again capable of collecting, 
processing, and making available to quotation vendors the data for that 
security required to be made available pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section in a manner that accurately reflects the current state of 
the market on such exchange. Upon such renotification, any exchange or 
responsible broker or dealer which had been relieved of any obligation 
imposed by this section as a consequence of the prior notification shall 
again be subject to such obligation.
    (4) Nothing in this section shall preclude any exchange or 
association from making available to quotation vendors indications of 
interest or bids and offers for a subject security at any time such 
exchange or association is not required to do so pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section.
    (5)(i) Any exchange may make an election for purposes of paragraph 
(a)(25)(i)(B) of this section for any covered security, by collecting, 
processing, and making available bids, offers, quotation sizes, and 
aggregate quotation sizes in that security; except that for any covered 
security previously listed or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on 
only one exchange and not traded by any OTC market maker, such election 
shall be made by notifying all specified persons, and shall be effective 
at the opening of trading on the business day following notification.
    (ii) Any member of an association acting in the capacity of an OTC 
market maker may make an election for purposes of paragraph 
(a)(25)(ii)(B) of this section for any covered security, by 
communicating to its association bids, offers, and quotation sizes in 
that security; except that for any other covered security listed or 
admitted to unlisted trading privileges on only one exchange and not 
traded by any other OTC market maker, such election shall be made by 
notifying its association and all specified persons, and shall be 
effective at the opening of trading on the business day following 
notification.
    (iii) The election of an exchange or member of an association for 
any covered security pursuant to this paragraph (b)(5) shall cease to be 
in effect if such exchange or member ceases to make available or 
communicate bids, offers, and quotation sizes in such security.
    (c) Obligations of responsible brokers and dealers. (1) Each 
responsible broker or dealer shall promptly communicate to its exchange 
or association, pursuant to the procedures established by that exchange 
or association, its best bids, best offers, and quotation sizes for any 
subject security.
    (2) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, 
each responsible broker or dealer shall be obligated to execute any 
order to buy or sell a subject security, other than an odd-lot order, 
presented to it by another broker or dealer, or any other person 
belonging to a category of persons with whom such responsible broker or 
dealer customarily deals, at a price at least as favorable to such

[[Page 71]]

buyer or seller as the responsible broker's or dealer's published bid or 
published offer (exclusive of any commission, commission equivalent or 
differential customarily charged by such responsible broker or dealer in 
connection with execution of any such order) in any amount up to its 
published quotation size.
    (3)(i) No responsible broker or dealer shall be obligated to execute 
a transaction for any subject security as provided in paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section to purchase or sell that subject security in an amount 
greater than such revised quotation if:
    (A) Prior to the presentation of an order for the purchase or sale 
of a subject security, a responsible broker or dealer has communicated 
to its exchange or association, pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, a revised quotation size; or
    (B) At the time an order for the purchase or sale of a subject 
security is presented, a responsible broker or dealer is in the process 
of effecting a transaction in such subject security, and immediately 
after the completion of such transaction, it communicates to its 
exchange or association a revised quotation size, such responsible 
broker or dealer shall not be obligated by paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section to purchase or sell that subject security in an amount greater 
than such revised quotation size.
    (ii) No responsible broker or dealer shall be obligated to execute a 
transaction for any subject security as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section if:
    (A) Before the order sought to be executed is presented, such 
responsible broker or dealer has communicated to its exchange or 
association pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a revised bid 
or offer; or
    (B) At the time the order sought to be executed is presented, such 
responsible broker or dealer is in the process of effecting a 
transaction in such subject security, and, immediately after the 
completion of such transaction, such responsible broker or dealer 
communicates to its exchange or association pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section, a revised bid or offer; provided, however, That such 
responsible broker or dealer shall nonetheless be obligated to execute 
any such order in such subject security as provided in paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section at its revised bid or offer in any amount up to its 
published quotation size or revised quotation size.
    (4) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(4) of this section:
    (i) No exchange or OTC market maker may make available, disseminate 
or otherwise communicate to any quotation vendor, directly or 
indirectly, for display on a terminal or other display device any bid, 
offer, quotation size, or aggregate quotation size for any covered 
security which is not a subject security with respect to such exchange 
or OTC market maker; and
    (ii) No quotation vendor may disseminate or display on a terminal or 
other display device any bid, offer, quotation size, or aggregate 
quotation size from any exchange or OTC market maker for any covered 
security which is not a subject security with respect to such exchange 
or OTC market maker.
    (5)(i) Entry of any priced order for a covered security by an 
exchange market maker or OTC market maker in that security into an 
electronic communications network that widely disseminates such order 
shall be deemed to be:

market maker's exchange or association pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section for at least the minimum quotation size that is required by the 
rules of the market maker's exchange or association if the priced order 
is for the account of a market maker, or the actual size of the order up 
to the minimum quotation size required if the priced order is for the 
account of a customer; and
    (B) A communication of a bid or offer to a quotation vendor for 
display on a display device for purposes of paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section.
    (ii) An exchange market maker or OTC market maker that has entered a 
priced order for a covered security into an electronic communications 
network that widely disseminates such order shall be deemed to be in 
compliance

[[Page 72]]

with paragraph (c)(5)(i)(A) of this section if the electronic 
communications network:
    (A) Provides to an exchange or association (or an exclusive 
processor acting on behalf of one or more exchanges or associations) the 
prices and sizes of the orders at the highest buy price and the lowest 
sell price for such security entered in, and widely disseminated by, the 
electronic communications network by exchange market makers and OTC 
market makers for the covered security, and such prices and sizes are 
included in the quotation data made available by the exchange, 
association, or exclusive processor to quotation vendors pursuant to 
this section; and
    (B) Provides, to any broker or dealer, the ability to effect a 
transaction with a priced order widely disseminated by the electronic 
communications network entered therein by an exchange market maker or 
OTC market maker that is:
    (1) Equivalent to the ability of any broker or dealer to effect a 
transaction with an exchange market maker or OTC market maker pursuant 
to the rules of the exchange or association to which the electronic 
communications network supplies such bids and offers; and
    (2) At the price of the highest priced buy order or lowest priced 
sell order, or better, for the lesser of the cumulative size of such 
priced orders entered therein by exchange market makers or OTC market 
makers at such price, or the size of the execution sought by the broker 
or dealer, for the covered security.
    (d) Exemptions. The Commission may exempt from the provisions of 
this section, either unconditionally or on specified terms and 
conditions, any responsible broker or dealer, electronic communications 
network, exchange, or association if the Commission determines that such 
exemption is consistent with the public interest, the protection of 
investors and the removal of impediments to and perfection of the 
mechanism of a national market system.

consolidated last sale display up to three categories of information if 
such deletion is necessary to accommodate the display of any market 
identifiers required by this section.
    (vii) Transaction reports and last sale data from all reporting 
market centers which are third market makers may be identified in a

requirement, a vendor may provide on that device both the consolidated 
quotation display and any individual market center display of quotation 
information provided for such security by means of retrieval 
instructions involving an equal number of key strokes if the information 
request or transmit key for the consolidated quotation display is the 
most prominent.
    (iii) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this 
section, a vendor may provide on an interrogation device
    (A) An individual market center display of quotation information for 
a particular subject security for any reporting market center in such 
security; or
    (B) Either separately or as the consolidated quotation display, a 
quotation montage for that security.
    (iv) No consolidated quotation display or separate quotation montage 
provided on an interrogation device may exclude any quotation

[[Page 76]]

Provided, however, That for purposes of providing the consolidated 
quotation display or a separate quotation montage for any reported 
security, quotation information from all reporting market centers which 
are third market makers may be consolidated to derive a best bid and 
offer for all such market centers if such interrogation device is 
capable of displaying, either separately or as part of the consolidated 
quotation display or separate quotation montage, (A) identifiers 
indicating the reporting market center making available such best bid 
and the reporting market center making available such best offer, and 
(B) the quotation size associated with both such best bid and best 
offer.
    (v) Each individual market center display of quotation information 
or separate quotation montage for a particular reported security shall 
include the quotation size or aggregate quotation size associated with 
each bid or offer disseminated as part of such display or montage.

    (1) The registrant's and its other subsidiaries' investments in and 
advances to the subsidiary exceed 10 percent of the total assets of the 
registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated as of the end of the most 
recently completed fiscal year (for a proposed business combination to 
be accounted for as a pooling of interests, this condition is also met 
when the number of common shares exchanged or to be exchanged by the 
registrant exceeds 10 percent of its total common shares outstanding at 
the date the combination is initiated); or
    (2) The registrant's and its other subsidiaries' proportionate share 
of the total assets (after intercompany eliminations) of the subsidiary

[[Page 84]]

percent of such income of the registrant and its subsidiaries 
consolidated for the most recently completed fiscal year.

    Computational note: For purposes of making the prescribed income 
test the following guidance should be applied:
    1. When a loss has been incurred by either the parent and its 
subsidiaries consolidated or the tested subsidiary, but not both, the 
equity in the income or loss of the tested subsidiary should be excluded 
from the income of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for 
purposes of the computation.
    2. If income of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for 
the most recent fiscal year is at least 10 percent lower than the 
average of the income for the last five fiscal years, such average 
income should be substituted for purposes of the computation. Any loss 
years should be omitted for purposes of computing average income.

    Small Business Issuer. The term ``small business issuer'' means an 
entity that meets the following criteria:
    (1) has revenues of less than $25,000,000;
    (2) is a U.S. or Canadian issuer;
    (3) is not an investment company; and
    (4) if a majority owned subsidiary, the parent corporation is also a 
small business issuer.
    Provided however, that an entity is not a small business issuer if 
it has a public float (the aggregate market value of the issuer's 
outstanding securities held by non-affiliates) of $25,000,000 or more.

    Note: The public float of a reporting company shall be computed by 
use of the price at which the stock was last sold, or the average of the 
bid and asked prices of such stock, on a date within 60 days prior to 
the end of its most recent fiscal year. The public float of a company 
filing an initial registration statement under the Exchange Act shall be 
determined as of a date within 60 days of the date the registration 
statement is filed. In the case of an initial public offering of 
securities, public float shall be computed on the basis of the number of 
shares outstanding prior to the offering and the estimated public 
offering price of the securities.
    Subsidiary. A ``subsidiary'' of a specified person is an affiliate 
controlled by such person directly, or indirectly through one or more 
intermediaries. (See also ``majority-owned subsidiary,'' ``significant 
subsidiary,'' and ``totally-held subsidiary.'')
    Succession. The term ``succession'' means the direct acquisition of 
the assets comprising a going business, whether by merger, 
consolidation, purchase, or other direct transfer. The term does not 
include the acquisition of control of a business unless followed by the 
direct acquisition of its assets. The terms ``succeed'' and 
``successor'' have meanings correlative to the foregoing.
    Totally held subsidiary. The term ``totally held subsidiary'' means 
a subsidiary (1) substantially all of whose outstanding securities are 
owned by its parent and/or the parent's other totally held subsidiaries, 
and (2) which is not indebted to any person other than its parent and/or 
the parent's other totally held subsidiaries in an amount which is 
material in relation to the particular subsidiary, excepting 
indebtedness incurred in the ordinary course of business which is not 
overdue and which matures within one year from the date of its creation, 
whether evidenced by securities or not.
    Voting securities. The term ``voting securities'' means securities 
the holders of which are presently entitled to vote for the election of 
directors.
    Wholly-owned subsidiary. The term ``wholly-owned subsidiary'' means 
a subsidiary substantially all of whose outstanding voting securities 
are owned by its parent and/or the parent's other wholly-owned 
subsidiaries.

    Information required need be given only insofar as it is known or 
reasonably available to the registrant. If any required information is 
unknown and not reasonably available to the registrant, either because

    (a) The registrant shall give such information on the subject as it 
possesses or can acquire without unreasonable effort or expense, 
together with the sources thereof.
    (b) The registrant shall include a statement either showing that 
unreasonable effort or expense would be involved or indicating the

incorporated by reference shall be clearly identified in the reference 
by page, paragraph, caption or otherwise. Where only certain pages of a

document from which the material is taken shall be clearly identified in 
the reference. An express statement that the specified matter is 
incorporated by reference shall be made at the particular place in the 
statement or report where the information is required. Matter shall not 
be incorporated by reference in any case where such incorporation would 
render the statement or report incomplete, unclear or confusing.

semi-annual, annual or transition report on Form N-SAR required to be 
filed pursuant to section 30 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and

such report, the registrant, no later than one business day after the 
due date for such report, shall file a Form 12b-25 (17 CFR 249.322) with 
the Commission which shall contain disclosure of its inability to file 
the report timely and the reasons therefor in reasonable detail.
    (b) With respect to any report or portion of any report described in 
paragraph (a) of this section which is not timely filed because the 
registrant is unable to do so without unreasonable effort or expense, 
such report shall be deemed to be filed on the prescribed due date for 
such report if:
    (1) The registrant files the Form 12b-25 in compliance with 
paragraph (a) of this section and, when applicable, furnishes the 
exhibit required by paragraph (c) of this section;
    (2) The registrant represents in the Form 12b-25 that:
    (i) The reason(s) causing the inability to file timely could not be 
eliminated by the registrant without unreasonable effort or expense; and
    (ii) Either the subject annual report, semi-annual report or 
transition report on Form 10-K, 10-KSB, 20-F, 11-K or N-SAR, or portion 
thereof, will be filed no later than the fifteenth calendar day 
following the prescribed due date or the subject quarterly report or 
transition report on Form 10-Q or 10-QSB, or portion thereof, will be 
filed no later than the fifth calendar day following the prescribed due 
date; and
    (3) The report/portion thereof is actually filed within the period 
specified by paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (c) If paragraph (b) of this section is applicable and the reason 
the subject report/portion thereof cannot be filed timely without 
unreasonable effort or expense relates to the inability of any person, 
other than the registrant, to furnish any required opinion, report or

certification, the Form 12b-25 shall have attached as an exhibit a 
statement signed by such person stating the specific reasons why such 
person is unable to furnish the required opinion, report or 
certification on or before the date such report must be filed.
    (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, a registrant will

    (e) If a Form 12b-25 filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this sectin 
relates only to a portion of a subject report, the registrant shall:

accordance with General Instruction A to form 10-K.
    (g) Electronic filings. The provisions of this section shall not 
apply to reports required to be filed in electronic format if the sole 
reason the report is not filed within the time period prescribed is that 
the filer is unable to file the report in electronic format. Filers 
unable to submit a report in electronic format within the time period 
prescribed solely due to difficulties with electronic filing should 
comply with either Rule 201 or 202 of Regulation S-T (Sec. 232.201 and

Sec. 240.12d2-2   Removal from listing and registration.

    (a) A national securities exchange shall file with the Commission an 
application on Form 25 to strike a security from listing and 
registration thereon within a reasonable time after the exchange is 
reliably informed that any of the following conditions exist with 
respect to such a security:
    (1) The entire class of the security has been called for redemption, 
maturity or retirement; appropriate notice thereof has been given; funds 
sufficient for the payment of all such securities have been deposited 
with an agency authorized to make such payments; and such funds have 
been made available to security holders.
    (2) The entire class of the security has been redeemed or paid at 
maturity or retirement.
    (3) The instruments representing the securities comprising the 
entire class have come to evidence, by operation of law or otherwise, 
other securities in substitution therefor and represent no other right, 
except, if such be the fact, the right to receive an immediate cash 
payment (the right of dissenters to receive the appraised or fair value 
of their holdings shall not prevent the application of this provision).
    (4) All rights pertaining to the entire class of the security have 
been extinguished: Provided, however, That where such an event occurs as 
the result of an order of a court or other governmental authority, the 
order shall be final, all applicable appeal periods shall have expired, 
and no appeals shall be pending.

    Effective Date: Such an application shall be deemed to be granted 
and shall become effective at the opening of business on such date as 
the exchange shall specify in said application, but not less than 10 
days following the date on which said application is filed with the 
Commission; Provided, however, That in the event removal is being 
effected under paragraph (a)(3) of this section and the exchange has 
admitted or intends to admit a successor security to trading under the 
temporary exemption provided for by Sec. 240.12a-5, such date shall not 
be earlier than the date on which the successor security is removed from 
its exempt status.

    (b)(1) A national securities exchange may strike a security from 
listing and registration thereon if (i) trading in such security has 
been terminated pursuant to a rule of such exchange requiring such 
termination whenever the security is admitted to trading on another 
exchange; and (ii) listing and registration of such security has become 
effective on such other exchange.
    (2) A national securities exchange which has striken a security from 
listing and registration under the provisions of this paragraph shall 
send written notice of such action to the Commission within 3 days from 
the date thereof.
    (c) In cases not provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section, a national securities exchange may file an application to 
strike a security from listing and registration, in accordance with its 
rules, on a date specified in the application, which date shall be not 
less than 10 days after it is filed with the Commission. The Commission 
will enter an order granting such application on the date specified in 
the application unless the Commission, by written notice to the 
exchange, postpones the effective date for a period of not more than 60 
days thereafter: Provided, however, That the Commission, by written 
notice to the exchange on or before the effective date, may order a 
hearing to determine whether the application to strike the security from 
listing and registration has been made in accordance with the rules of 
the exchange, or what terms should be imposed by the Commission for the 
protection of investors.
    (d) The issuer of a security listed and registered on a national 
securities exchange may file an application to withdraw such security 
from listing and registration on such exchange in accordance with the 
rules of such exchange. Notice of the filing of such an application 
shall be published by the Commission in the Federal Register, and such 
notice shall provide that any interested person may, on or before a date 
specified, submit to the Commission in writing, all facts bearing upon 
whether the application to withdraw the security from listing and 
registration has been made in accordance with the rules of the exchange 
and what terms should be imposed by the Commission for the protection of 
investors. An order disposing of the matter will be issued by the 
Commission on the

[[Page 93]]

basis of the application and any other information furnished to the 
Commission unless prior thereto the Commission orders a hearing on the 
matter.
    (e) An application by an issuer or by a national securities exchange 
to withdraw or strike a security from listing and registration pursuant 
to the provisions of paragraph (c) or (d) of this section shall comply 
with the following requirements:
    (1) The application shall be filed in triplicate, the original of 
which shall be dated and signed by an authorized official of the 
exchange, or of the issuer, as the case may be.
    (2) If the applicant is the exchange it shall promptly deliver a 
copy of the application to the issuer and if the applicant is the issuer 
it shall promptly deliver a copy of the application to the exchange.
    (3) The application shall set forth a description of the security 
involved together with a statement of all material facts relating to the 
reasons for filing such application for withdrawal or striking from 
listing and registration.
    (4) The application shall set forth the steps taken by the applicant 
to comply with the rules of the exchange governing the delisting of 
securities.
    (f) If within 30 days after the publication of any rule or 
regulation which substantially alters or adds to the obligations, or 
detracts from the rights, of an issuer of a security registered pursuant 
to application under section 12 (b) or (c), or of its officers, 
directors, or security holders, or of persons soliciting or giving any 
proxy or consent or authorization with respect to such security, the 
issuer shall file with the Commission a request that such registration 
shall expire and shall accompany such request with a written explanation 
of the reasons why the publication of such rule or regulation leads the 
issuer to make such request, such registration shall expire immediately 
upon receipt of such request or immediately before such rule or 
regulation becomes effective, whichever date is later. The absence of an 
express reservation, in an application for registration, of the rights 
herein granted shall not be deemed a waiver thereof.

be deemed to be ``held of record'' by each person who is identified as 
the owner of such securities on records of security holders maintained 
by or on behalf of the issuer, subject to the following:
    (1) In any case where the records of security holders have not been 
maintained in accordance with accepted practice, any additional person 
who would be identified as such an owner on such records if they had 
been maintained in accordance with accepted practice shall be included 
as a holder of record.
    (2) Securities identified as held of record by a corporation, a 
partnership, a trust whether or not the trustees are named, or other 
organization shall be included as so held by one person.
    (3) Securities identified as held of record by one or more persons 
as trustees, executors, guardians, custodians or in other fiduciary 
capacities with respect to a single trust, estate or account shall be 
included as held of record by one person.
    (4) Securities held by two or more persons as coowners shall be 
included as held by one person.
    (5) Each outstanding unregistered or bearer certificate shall be 
included as held of record by a separate person, except to the extent 
that the issuer can establish that, if such securities were registered, 
they would be held of record, under the provisions of this rule, by a 
lesser number of persons.
    (6) Securities registered in substantially similar names where the 
issuer has reason to believe because of the address or other indications 
that such names represent the same person, may be included as held of 
record by one person.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section:
    (1) Securities held, to the knowledge of the issuer, subject to a 
voting trust, deposit agreement or similar arrangement shall be included 
as held of record by the record holders of the voting trust 
certificates, certificates of deposit, receipts or similar evidences of 
interest in such securities: Provided, however, That the issuer may rely 
in good faith on such information as is received in response to its 
request from a non-affiliated issuer of the certificates or evidences of 
interest.
    (2) Whole or fractional securities issued by a savings and loan 
association, building and loan association, cooperative bank, homestead 
association, or similar institution for the sole purpose of qualifying a 
borrower for membership in the issuer, and which are to be redeemed or 
repurchased by the issuer when the borrower's loan is terminated, shall 
not be included as held of record by any person.
    (3) If the issuer knows or has reason to know that the form of 
holding securities of record is used primarily to circumvent the 
provisions of section 12(g) or 15(d) of the Act, the beneficial owners 
of such securities shall be deemed to be the record owners thereof.

solely to fund such plans;
    (b) Any interest or participation in any common trust fund or 
similar fund maintained by a bank exclusively for the collective 
investment and reinvestment of monies contributed thereto by the bank in 
its capacity as a trustee, executor, administrator, or guardian. For 
purposes of this paragraph (b), the term ``common trust fund'' shall 
include a common trust fund which is maintained by a bank which is a 
member of an affiliated group, as defined in section 1504(a) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 1504(a)), and which is 
maintained exclusively for the investment and reinvestment of monies 
contributed thereto by one or more bank members of such affilated group 
in the capacity of trustee, executor, administrator, or guardian; 
Provided, That:
    (1) The common trust fund is operated in compliance with the same 
state and Federal regulatory requirements as would apply if the bank 
maintaining such fund as any other contributing banks were the same 
entity; and
    (2) The rights of persons for whose benefit a contributiong bank 
acts as trustee, executor, administrator or guardian would not be 
diminished by reason of the maintenance of such common trust fund by 
another bank member of the affiliated group; and
    (c) Any class of equity security which would not be outstanding 60 
days after a registration statement would be required to be filed with 
respect thereto.

<R05>
Sec. 240.12h-3  Suspension of duty to file reports under section 15(d).

    (a) Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the duty 
under section 15(d) to file reports required by section 13(a) of the Act 
with respect to a class of securities specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section shall be suspended for such class of securities immediately upon 
filing with the Commission a certification on Form 15 (17 CFR 249.323) 
if the issuer of such class has filed all reports required by section 
13(a), without regard to Rule 12b-25 (17 CFR 249.322), for the shorter 
of its most recent three fiscal years and the portion of the current 
year preceding the date of filing Form 15, or the period since the 
issuer became subject to such reporting obligation. If the certification 
on Form 15 is subsequently withdrawn or denied, the issuer shall, within 
60 days, file with the Commission all reports which would have been 
required if such certification had not been filed.
    (b) The classes of securities eligible for the suspension provided 
in paragraph (a) of this section are:
    (1) Any class of securites held of record by:
    (i) Less than 300 persons; or
    (ii) By less then 500 persons, where the total assets of the issuer 
have not exceeded $10 million on the last day of each of the issuer's 
three most recent fiscal years;
    (2) Any class of securities of a foreign private issuer, as defined 
in Rule 3b-4 (Sec. 240.3b-4), held of record by:
    (i) Less than 300 persons resident in the United States or
    (ii) Less than 500 persons resident in the United States where the 
total assets of the issuer have not exceeded $10 million on the last day 
of each of the issuer's three most recent fiscal years.


[[Page 101]]


For purposes of this paragraph, the number of persons resident in the 
United States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of 
Rule 12g3-2(a) (Sec. 240.12g3-2(a)); and
    (3) Any class or securities deregistered pursuant to section 12(d) 
of the Act if such class would not thereupon be deemed registered under 
section 12(g) of the Act or the rules thereunder.
    (c) This section shall not be available for any class of securities 
for a fiscal year in which a registration statement relating to that 
class becomes effective under the Securities Act of 1933, or is required 
to be updated pursuant to section 10(a)(3) of the Act, and, in the case 
of paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (2)(ii), the two succeeding fiscal years; 
Provided, however, That this paragraph shall not apply to the duty to 
file reports which arises solely from a registration statement filed by 
an issuer with no significant assets, for the reorganization of a non-
reporting issuer into a one subsidiary holding company in which equity 
security holders receive the same proportional interest in the holding 
company as they held in the non-reporting issuer, except for changes 
resulting from the exercise of dissenting shareholder rights under state 
law.
    (d) The suspension provided by this rule relates only to the 
reporting obligation under section 15(d) with respect to a class of 
securities, does not affect any other duties imposed on that class of 
securities, and shall continue as long as criteria (i) and (ii) in 
either paragraph (b)(1) or (2) is met on the first day of any subsequent 
fiscal year; Provided, however, That such criteria need not be met if 
the duty to file reports arises solely from a registration statement 
filed by an issuer with no significant assets in a reorganization of a 
non-reporting company into a one subsidiary holding company in which 
equity security holders receive the same proportional interest in the 
holding company as they held in the non-reporting issuer except for 
changes resulting from the exercise of dissenting shareholder rights 
under state law.
    (e) If the suspension provided by this rule is discontinued because 
a class of securities does not meet the eligibility criteria of 
paragraph (b) on the first day of an issuer's fiscal year, then the 
issuer shall resume periodic reporting pursuant to section 15(d) by 
filing an annual report on Form 10-K and Form 10-KSB for its preceding 
fiscal year, not later than 120 days after the end of such fiscal year.

                              Other Reports


<R05>
Sec. 240.13a-10  Transition reports.

    (a) Every issuer that changes its fiscal closing date shall file a 
report covering the resulting transition period between the closing date 
of its most recent fiscal year and the opening date of its new fiscal 
year; Provided, however, that an issuer shall file an annual report for 
any fiscal year that ended before the date on which the issuer 
determined to change its fiscal year end. In no event shall the 
transition report cover a period of 12 or more months.
    (b) The report pursuant to this section shall be filed for the 
transition period not more than 90 days after either the close of the 
transition period or the date of the determination to change the fiscal 
closing date, whichever is later. The report shall be filed on the form 
appropriate for annual reports of the issuer, shall cover the period 
from the close of the last fiscal year end and shall indicate clearly 
the period covered. The financial statements for the transition period 
filed therewith shall be audited. Financial statements, which may be 
unaudited, shall be filed for the comparable period of the prior year, 
or a footnote, which may be unaudited, shall state for the comparable 
period of the prior year, revenues, gross profits, income taxes, income 
or loss from continuing operations before extraordinary items and 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles and net income or 
loss. The effects of any discontinued operations and/or extraordinary 
items as classified under the provisions of generally accepted 
accounting principles also shall be shown, if applicable. Per share data 
based upon such income or loss and net income or loss shall be presented 
in conformity with applicable accounting standards. Where called for by 
the time span to be covered, the comparable period financial statements 
or footnote shall be included in subsequent filings.
    (c) If the transition period covers a period of less than six 
months, in lieu of the report required by paragraph (b) of this section, 
a report may be filed for the transition period on Form 10-Q and Form 
10-QSB (Sec. 249.308a of this chapter) not more than 45 days after 
either the close of the transition period or the date of the 
determination to change the fiscal closing date, whichever is later. The 
report on Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB shall cover the period from the 
close of the last fiscal year end and shall indicate clearly the period 
covered. The financial statements filed therewith need not be audited 
but, if they are not audited, the issuer shall file with the first 
annual report for the newly adopted fiscal year separate audited 
statements of income and cash flows covering the transition period. The 
notes to financial statements for the transition period included in such 
first annual report may be integrated with the notes to financial 
statements for the full fiscal period. A separate audited balance sheet 
as of the end of the transition period shall be filed in the annual 
report only if the audited balance sheet as of the end of the fiscal 
year prior to the transition period is not filed. Schedules need not be 
filed in transition reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB.

[[Page 103]]

    (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of 
this section, if the transition period covers a period of one month or 
less, the issuer need not file a separate transition report if either:
    (1) The first report required to be filed by the issuer for the 
newly adopted fiscal year after the date of the determination to change 
the fiscal year end is an annual report, and that report covers the 
transition period as well as the fiscal year; or
    (2)(i) The issuer files with the first annual report for the newly 
adopted fiscal year separate audited statements of income and cash flows 
covering the transition period; and
    (ii) The first report required to be filed by the issuer for the 
newly adopted fiscal year after the date of the determination to change 
the fiscal year end is a quarterly report on Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB; 
and
    (iii) Information on the transition period is included in the 
issuer's quarterly report on Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB for the first 
quarterly period (except the fourth quarter) of the newly adopted fiscal 
year that ends after the date of the determination to change the fiscal 
year. The information covering the transition period required by Part II 
and Item 2 of Part I may be combined with the information regarding the 
quarter. However, the financial statements required by Part I, which may 
be unaudited, shall be furnished separately for the transition period.
    (e) Every issuer required to file quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and 
Form 10-QSB pursuant to Sec. 240.13a-13 of this chapter that changes its 
fiscal year end shall:
    (1) File a quarterly report on Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB within the 
time period specified in General Instruction A.1. to that form for any 
quarterly period (except the fourth quarter) of the old fiscal year that 
ends before the date on which the issuer determined to change its fiscal 
year end, except that the issuer need not file such quarterly report if 
the date on which the quarterly period ends also is the date on which 
the transition period ends;
    (2) File a quarterly report on Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB within the 
time specified in General Instruction A.1. to that form for each 
quarterly period of the old fiscal year within the transition period. In 
lieu of a quarterly report for any quarter of the old fiscal year within 
the transition period, the issuer may file a quarterly report on Form 
10-Q and Form 10-QSB for any period of three months within the 
transition period that coincides with a quarter of the newly adopted 
fiscal year if the quarterly report is filed within 45 days after the 
end of such three month period, provided the issuer thereafter continues 
filing quarterly reports on the basis of the quarters of the newly 
adopted fiscal year;
    (3) Commence filing quarterly reports for the quarters of the new 
fiscal year no later than the quarterly report for the first quarter of 
the new fiscal year that ends after the date on which the issuer 
determined to change the fiscal year end; and
    (4) Unless such information is or will be included in the transition 
report, or the first annual report on Form 10-K and Form 10-KSB for the 
newly adopted fiscal year, include in the initial quarterly report on 
Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB for the newly adopted fiscal year information 
on any period beginning on the first day subsequent to the period 
covered by the issuer's final quarterly report on Form 10-Q and Form 10-
QSB or annual report on Form 10-K and Form 10-KSB for the old fiscal 
year. The information covering such period required by Part II and Item 
2 of Part I may be combined with the information regarding the quarter. 
However, the financial statements required by Part I, which may be 
unaudited, shall be furnished separately for such period.

    Note to paragraphs (c) and (e): If it is not practicable or cannot 
be cost-justified to furnish in a transition report on Form 10-Q and 
Form 10-QSB or a quarterly report for the newly adopted fiscal year 
financial statements for corresponding periods of the prior year where 
required, financial statements may be furnished for the quarters of the 
preceding fiscal year that most nearly are comparable if the issuer 
furnishes an adequate discussion of seasonal and other factors that 
could affect the comparability of information or trends reflected, an 
assessment of the comparability of the data, and a representation as to 
the reason recasting has not been undertaken.


[[Page 104]]


    (f) Every successor issuer with securities registered under Section 
12 of this Act that has a different fiscal year from that of its 
predecessor(s) shall file a transition report pursuant to this section, 
containing the required information about each predecessor, for the 
transition period, if any, between the close of the fiscal year covered 
by the last annual report of each predecessor and the date of 
succession. The report shall be filed for the transition period on the 
form appropriate for annual reports of the issuer not more than 90 days 
after the date of the succession, with financial statements in 
conformity with the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this 
section. If the transition period covers a period of less than six 
months, in lieu of a transition report on the form appropriate for the 
issuer's annual reports, the report may be filed for the transition 
period on Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB not more than 45 days after the date 
of the succession, with financial statements in conformity with the 
requirements set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, if the transition period covers a period of one month or 
less, the successor issuer need not file a separate transition report if 
the information is reported by the successor issuer in conformity with 
the requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (g)(1) Paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section shall not apply to 
foreign private issuers.
    (2) Every foreign private issuer that changes its fiscal closing 
date shall file a report covering the resulting transition period 
between the closing date of its most recent fiscal year and the opening 
date of its new fiscal year. In no event shall a transition report cover 
a period longer than 12 months.
    (3) The report for the transition period shall be filed on Form 20-F 
responding to all items to which such issuer is required to respond when 
Form 20-F is used as an annual report. Such report shall be filed within 
six months after either the close of the transition period or the date 
on which the issuer made the determination to change the fiscal closing 
date, whichever is later. The financial statements for the transition 
period filed therewith shall be audited.
    (4) If the transition period covers a period of six or fewer months, 
in lieu of the report required by paragraph (g)(3) of this section, a 
report for the transition period may be filed on Form 20-F responding to 
Items 3, 9, 15, 16, and 17 or 18 within three months after either the 
close of the transition period or the date on which the issuer made the 
determination to change the fiscal closing date, whichever is later. The 
financial statements required by either Item 17 or Item 18 shall be 
furnished for the transition period. Such financial statements may be 
unaudited and condensed as permitted in Article 10 of Regulation S-X 
(Sec. 210.10-01 of this chapter), but if the financial statements are 
unaudited and condensed, the issuer shall file with the first annual 
report for the newly adopted fiscal year separate audited statements of 
income and cash flows covering the transition period.
    (5) Notwithstanding the foregoing in paragraphs (g)(2), (g)(3), and 
(g)(4) of this section, if the transition period covers a period of one 
month or less, a foreign private issuer need not file a separate 
transition report if the first annual report for the newly adopted 
fiscal year covers the transition period as well as the fiscal year.
    (h) The provisions of this rule shall not apply to investment 
companies required to file reports pursuant to Rule 30b1-1 
(Sec. 270.30b1-1 of this chapter) under the Investment Company Act of 
1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.).
    (i) No filing fee shall be required for a transition report filed 
pursuant to this section.

    Note.--In addition to the report or reports to be filed pursuant to 
this section, every issuer, except a foreign private issuer or an 
investment company required to file reports pursuant to Rule 30b1-1 
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, that changes its fiscal 
closing date is required to file a report on Form 8-K responding to Item 
8 thereof within the period specified in General Instruction B. 1. to 
that form.

every issuer that has securities registered pursuant to section 12 of 
the Act and is required to file annual reports pursuant to section 13 of 
the Act, and has filed or intends to file such reports on Form 10-K and 
Form 10-KSB (Sec. 249.310 of this chapter) or U5S (Sec. 259.5s of this

statements were included in the registration statement, or, if the 
registration statement included financial statements for an interim 
period subsequent to the most recent fiscal year end meeting the 
requirements of Article 10 of Regulation S-X, for the first fiscal 
quarter subsequent to the quarter reported upon in the registration 
statement. The first quarterly report of the issuer shall be filed 
either within 45 days after the effective date of the registration 
statement or on or before the date on which such report would have been 
required to be filed if the issuer has been required to file reports on 
Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB as of its last fiscal quarter, whichever is 
later.
    (b) The provisions of this rule shall not apply to the following 
issuers:

primarily in the exploration for the development of mineral deposits 
other than oil, gas or coal, if all of the following conditions are met:
    (i) The registrant has not been in production during the current 
fiscal year or the two years immediately prior thereto; except that 
being in production for an aggregate period of not more than eight 
months over the three-year period shall not be a violation of this 
condition.
    (ii) Receipts from the sale of mineral products or from the 
operations of mineral producing properties by the registrant and its 
subsidiaries combined have not exceeded $500,000 in any of the most 
recent six years and have not aggregated more than $1,500,000 in the

<R05>
Sec. 240.13d-1  Filing of Schedules 13D and 13G.

    (a) Any person who, after acquiring directly or indirectly the 
beneficial ownership of any equity security of a class which is 
specified in paragraph (d) of this section, is directly or indirectly 
the beneficial owner of more than 5 percent of such class shall, within 
10 days after such acquisition, send to the issuer of the security at 
its principal executive office, by registered or certified mail, and to 
each exchange where the security is traded, and file with the 
Commission, a statement containing the information required by Schedule 
13D (Sec. 240.13d-101). Six copies of the statement, including all 
exhibits, shall be filed with the Commission.
    (b)(1) A person who would otherwise be obligated under paragraph (a) 
of this section to file a statement on Schedule 13D may, in lieu 
thereof, file with the Commission, within 45 days after the end of the 
calendar year in which such person became so obligated, six copies, 
including all exhibits, of a short form statement on Schedule 13G and 
send one copy each of such schedule to the issuer of the security at its 
principal executive office, by registered or certified mail, and to the 
principal national securities exchange where the security is traded: 
Provided, That it shall not be necessary to file a Schedule 13G unless 
the percentage of the class of equity security specified in paragraph 
(d) of this section beneficially owned as of the end of the calendar 
year is more than 5 percent: And provided further, That:
    (i) Such person has acquired such securities in the ordinary course 
of his business and not with the purpose nor with the effect of changing 
or influencing the control of the issuer, nor in connection with or as a 
participant in any transaction having such purpose or effect, including 
any transaction subject to Rule 13d-3(b) (Sec. 240.13d-3(b)); and
    (ii) Such person is:
    (A) A broker or dealer registered under section 15 of the Act;
    (B) A bank as defined in section 3(a)(6) of the Act;
    (C) An insurance company as defined in section 3(a)(19) of the Act;
    (D) An investment company registered under section 8 of the 
Investment Company Act of 1940;
    (E) An investment adviser registered under section 203 of the 
Investment Advisers Act of 1940;
    (F) An employee benefit plan, or pension fund which is subject to 
the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 
(``ERISA'') or an endowment fund;
    (G) A parent holding company, provided the aggregate amount held 
directly by the parent, and directly and indirectly by its subsidiaries 
which are not persons specified in rule 13d-1(b)(ii) (A) through (F), 
does not exceed one percent of the securities of the subject class;
    (H) A group, provided that all the members are persons specified in 
Rule 13d-1(b)(1)(ii) (A) through (G); and
    (iii) Such person has promptly notified any other person (or group 
within the meaning of section 13(d)(3) of the Act) on whose behalf it 
holds, on a discretionary basis, securities exceeding five percent of 
the class, of any acquisition or transaction on behalf of such other 
person which might be reportable by that person under section 13(d) of 
the Act. This paragraph only requires notice to the account owner of 
information which the filing person reasonably should be expected to 
know and which would advise the account owner of an obligation he may 
have to file a statement pursuant to section 13(d) of the Act or an 
amendment thereto.
    (2) Any person relying on Rules 13d-1(b)(1) and 13d-2(b) shall, in 
addition to filing any statements required thereunder, file a statement 
on Schedule 13G, within ten days after the end of the first month in 
which such person's direct or indirect beneficial ownership exceeds ten 
percent of a class of equity

[[Page 108]]

securities specified in Rule 13d-1(c) computed as of the last day of the 
month, and thereafter within ten days after the end of any month in 
which such person's beneficial ownership of securities of such class, 
computed as of the last day of the month, increases or decreases by more 
than five percent of such class of equity securities. Six copies of such 
statement, including all exhibits, shall be filed with the Commission 
and one each sent, by registered or certified mail, to the issuer of the 
security at its principal executive office and to the principal national 
securities exchange where the security is traded. Once an amendment has 
been filed reflecting beneficial ownership of five percent or less of 
the class of securities, no additional filings are required by this 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section unless the person thereafter becames 
the beneficial owner of more than ten percent of the class and is 
required to file pursuant to this provision.
    (3)(i) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section 
and Rule 13d-2(b) (Sec. 240.13d-2(b)), a person shall immediately become 
subject to Rules 13d-1(a) and 13d-2(a) and shall promptly, but not more 
than 10 days later, file a statement on Schedule 13D if such person:
    (A) Has reported that it is the beneficial owner of more than five 
percent of a class of equity securities in a statement on Schedule 13G 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, or is required to 
report such acquisition but has not yet filed the schedule;
    (B) Determines that it no longer has acquired or holds such 
securities in the ordinary course of business or not with the purpose 
nor with the effect of changing or influencing the control of the 
issuer, nor in connection with or as a participant in any transaction 
having such purpose or effect, including any transaction subject to Rule 
13d-3(b) (Sec. 240.13d-3(b)); and
    (C) Is at that time the beneficial owner of more than five percent 
of a class of equity securities described in Rule 13d-1(c).
    (ii) For the ten day period immediately following the date of the 
filing of a Schedule 13D pursuant to this paragraph (b)(3), such person 
shall not:
    (A) Vote or direct the voting of the securities described in 
paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A); nor,
    (B) Acquire an additional beneficial ownership interest in any 
equity securities of the issuer of such securities, nor of any person 
controlling such issuer.
    (4) Any person who has reported an acquisition of securities in a 
statement on Schedule 13G pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this 
section and thereafter ceases to be a person specified in paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii) of this section shall immediately become subject to Rules 
13d-1(a) and 13d-2(a) and shall file, within ten days thereafter, a 
statement on Schedule 13D, in the event such person is a beneficial 
owner at that time of more than five percent of the class of equity 
securities.
    (c) Any person who, as of December 31, 1978, or as of the end of any 
calendar year thereafter, is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner 
of more than 5 percent of any equity security of a class specified in 
paragraph (d) of this section and who is not required to file a 
statement under paragraph (a) of this section by virtue of the exemption 
provided by section 13(d)(6) (A) or (B) of the Act, or because such 
beneficial ownership was acquired prior to December 22, 1970, or because 
such person otherwise (except for the exemption provided by section 
13(d)(6)(c) of the Act) is not required to file such statement, shall, 
within 45 days after the end of the calendar year in which such person 
became obligated to report under this paragraph, send to the issuer of 
the security at its principal executive office, by registered or 
certified mail, and file with the Commission a statement containing the 
information required by Schedule 13G (Sec. 240.13d-102). Six copies of 
the statement, including all exhibits, shall be filed with the 
Commission.
    (d) For the purpose of this regulation, the term ``equity security'' 
means any equity security of a class which is registered pursuant to 
section 12 of that Act, or any equity security of any insurance company 
which would have been required to be so registered except for the 
exemption contained in section

[[Page 109]]

12(g)(2)(G) of the Act, or any equity security issued by a closed-end 
investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940; 
Provided, Such term shall not include securities of a class of non-
voting securities.
    (e) For the purpose of sections 13(d) and 13(g), any person, in 
determining the amount of outstanding securities of a class of equity 
securities, may rely upon information set forth in the issuer's most 
recent quarterly or annual report, and any current report subsequent 
thereto, filed with the Commission pursuant to this Act, unless he knows 
or has reason to believe that the information contained therein is 
inaccurate.
    (f)(1) Whenever two or more persons are required to file a statement 
containing the information required by Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G with 
respect to the same securities, only one statement need be filed: 
Provided, That:
    (i) Each person on whose behalf the statement is filed is 
individually eligible to use the Schedule on which the information is 
filed;
    (ii) Each person on whose behalf the statement is filed is 
responsible for the timely filing of such statement and any amendments 
thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information 
concerning such person contained therein; such person is not responsible 
for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other 
persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to 
believe that such information is inaccurate; and
    (iii) Such statement identifies all such persons, contains the 
required information with regard to each such person, indicates that 
such statement is filed on behalf of all such persons, and includes, as 
an exhibit, their agreement in writing that such a statement is filed on 
behalf of each of them.
    (2) A group's filing obligation may be satisfied either by a single 
joint filing or by each of the group's members making an individual 
filing. If the group's members elect to make their own filings, each 
such filing should identify all members of the group but the information 
provided concerning the other persons making the filing need only 
reflect information which the filing person knows or has reason to know.

Sec. 240.13d-2  Filing of amendments to Schedules 13D or 13G.

    (a) Schedule 13D--If any material change occurs in the facts set 
forth in the statement required by Rule 13d-1(a) (Sec. 240.13d-1(a)), 
including, but not limited to, any material increase or decrease in the 
percentage of the class beneficially owned, the person or persons who 
were required to file such statement shall promptly file or cause to be 
filed with the Commission and send or cause to be sent to the issuer at 
its principal executive office, by registered or certified mail, and to 
each exchange on which the security is traded an amendment disclosing 
such change. An acquisition or disposition of beneficial ownership of 
securities in an amount equal to one percent or more of the class of 
securities shall be deemed ``material'' for purposes of this rule; 
acquisitions or dispositions of less than such amounts may be material, 
depending upon the facts and circumstances. Six copies of each such 
amendment shall be filed with the Commission.
    (b) Schedule 13G--Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this rule, and 
provided that the person or persons filing a statement pursuant to Rule 
13d-1(b) continues to meet the requirements set forth therein, any 
person who has filed a short form statement on Schedule 13G shall amend 
such statement within forty-five days after the end of each calendar 
year if, as of the end of such calendar year, there are any changes in 
the information reported in the previous filing on that Schedule; 
Provided, however, That such amendment need not be filed with respect to 
a change in

[[Page 110]]

the percent of class outstanding previously reported if such change 
results solely from a change in the aggregate number of securities 
outstanding. Six copies of such amendment, including all exhibits, shall 
be filed with the Commission and one each sent, by registered or 
certified mail, to the issuer of the security at its principal executive 
office and to the principal national securities exchange where the 
security is traded. Once an amendment has been filed reflecting 
beneficial ownership of five percent or less of the class of securities, 
no additional filings are required unless the person thereafter becomes 
the beneficial owner of more than five percent of the class and is 
required to file pursuant to Rule 13d-1 (Sec. 240.13d-1).
    (c) The first electronic amendment to a paper format Schedule 13D 
(Sec. 240.13d-101) or Schedule 13G (Sec. 240.13d-102) shall restate the 
entire text of the Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G, but previously filed 
paper exhibits to such Schedules are not required to be restated 
electronically. See Rule 102 of Regulation S-T (Sec. 232.102 of this 
chapter) regarding amendments to exhibits filed in electronic format.

    Note to Sec. 240.13d-2: For persons filing a short form statement

<R05>
Sec. 240.13d-3  Determination of beneficial owner.

    (a) For the purposes of sections 13(d) and 13(g) of the Act a 
beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or 
indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, 
relationship, or otherwise has or shares:
    (1) Voting power which includes the power to vote, or to direct the 
voting of, such security; and/or,
    (2) Investment power which includes the power to dispose, or to 
direct the disposition of, such security.
    (b) Any person who, directly or indirectly, creates or uses a trust, 
proxy, power of attorney, pooling arrangement or any other contract, 
arrangement, or device with the purpose of effect of divesting such 
person of beneficial ownership of a security or preventing the vesting 
of such beneficial ownership as part of a plan or scheme to evade the 
reporting requirements of section 13(d) or (g) of the Act shall be 
deemed for purposes of such sections to be the beneficial owner of such 
security.
    (c) All securities of the same class beneficially owned by a person, 
regardless of the form which such beneficial ownership takes, shall be 
aggregated in calculating the number of shares beneficially owned by 
such person.
    (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (c) of this 
rule:
    (1)(i) A person shall be deemed to be the beneficial owner of a 
security, subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this rule, if 
that person has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of such 
security, as defined in Rule 13d-3(a) (Sec. 240.13d-3(a)) within sixty 
days, including but not limited to any right to acquire: (A) Through the 
exercise of any option, warrant or right; (B) through the conversion of 
a security; (C) pursuant to the power to revoke a trust, discretionary 
account, or similar arrangement; or (D) pursuant to the automatic 
termination of a trust, discretionary account or similar arrangement; 
provided, however, any person who acquires a security or power specified 
in paragraphs (d)(1)(i)(A), (B) or (C), of this section, with the 
purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control of the issuer, 
or in connection with or as a participant in any transaction having such 
purpose or effect, immediately upon such acquisition shall be deemed to 
be the beneficial owner of the securities which may be acquired through 
the exercise or conversion of such security or power. Any securities not 
outstanding which are subject to such options, warrants,

[[Page 111]]

rights or conversion privileges shall be deemed to be outstanding for 
the purpose of computing the percentage of outstanding securities of the 
class owned by such person but shall not be deemed to be outstanding for 
the purpose of computing the percentage of the class by any other 
person.
    (ii) Paragraph (i) remains applicable for the purpose of determining 
the obligation to file with respect to the underlying security even 
though the option, warrant, right or convertible security is of a class 
of equity security, as defined in Rule 13d-1(c), and may therefore give 
rise to a separate obligation to file.
    (2) A member of a national securities exchange shall not be deemed 
to be a beneficial owner of securities held directly or indirectly by it 
on behalf of another person solely because such member is the record 
holder of such securities and, pursuant to the rules of such exchange, 
may direct the vote of such securities, without instruction, on other 
than contested matters or matters that may affect substantially the 
rights or privileges of the holders of the securities to be voted, but 
is otherwise precluded by the rules of such exchange from voting without 
instruction.
    (3) A person who in the ordinary course of his business is a pledgee 
of securities under a written pledge agreement shall not be deemed to be 
the beneficial owner of such pledged securities until the pledgee has 
taken all formal steps necessary which are required to declare a default 
and determines that the power to vote or to direct the vote or to 
dispose or to direct the disposition of such pledged securities will be 
exercised, provided, that:
    (i) The pledgee agreement is bona fide and was not entered into with 
the purpose nor with the effect of changing or influencing the control 
of the issuer, nor in connection with any transaction having such 
purpose or effect, including any transaction subject to Rule 13d-3(b);
    (ii) The pledgee is a person specified in Rule 13d-1(b)(ii), 
including persons meeting the conditions set forth in paragraph (G) 
thereof; and
    (iii) The pledgee agreement, prior to default, does not grant to the 
pledgee;
    (A) The power to vote or to direct the vote of the pledged 
securities; or
    (B) The power to dispose or direct the disposition of the pledged 
securities, other than the grant of such power(s) pursuant to a pledge 
agreement under which credit is extended subject to regulation T (12 CFR 
220.1 to 220.8) and in which the pledgee is a broker or dealer 
registered under section 15 of the act.
    (4) A person engaged in business as an underwriter of securities who 
acquires securities through his participation in good faith in a firm 
commitment underwriting registered under the Securities Act of 1933

Sec. 240.13d-5  Acquisition of securities.

    (a) A person who becomes a beneficial owner of securities shall be 
deemed to have acquired such securities for purposes of section 13(d)(1) 
of the Act, whether such acquisition was through purchase or otherwise. 
However, executors or administrators of a decedent's estate generally 
will be presumed not to have acquired beneficial ownership of the 
securities in the decedent's estate until such time as such

[[Page 112]]

executors or administrators are qualified under local law to perform 
their duties.
    (b)(1) When two or more persons agree to act together for the 
purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of equity securities 
of an issuer, the group formed thereby shall be deemed to have acquired 
beneficial ownership, for purposes of sections 13(d) and (g) of the Act, 
as of the date of such agreement, of all equity securities of that 
issuer beneficially owned by any such persons.
    (2) Notwithstanding the previous paragraph, a group shall be deemed 
not to have acquired any equity securities beneficially owned by the 
other members of the group solely by virtue of their concerted actions 
relating to the purchase of equity securities directly from an issuer in 
a transaction not involving a public offering: Provided, That:
    (i) All the members of the group are persons specified in Rule 13d-
1(b)(1)(ii);
    (ii) The purchase is in the ordinary course of each member's 
business and not with the purpose nor with the effect of changing or 
influencing control of the issuer, nor in connection with or as a 
participant in any transaction having such purpose or effect, including 
any transaction subject to Rule 13d-3(b);
    (iii) There is no agreement among, or between any members of the 
group to act together with respect to the issuer or its securities 
except for the purpose of facilitating the specific purchase involved; 
and
    (iv) The only actions among or between any members of the group with 
respect to the issuer or its securities subsequent to the closing date 
of the non-public offering are those which are necessary to conclude 
ministerial matters directly related to the completion of the offer or 
sale of the securities.

    The acquisition of securities of an issuer by a person who, prior to 
such acquisition, was a beneficial owner of more than five percent of 
the outstanding securities of the same class as those acquired shall be 
exempt from section 13(d) of the Act: Provided, That:
    (a) The acquisition is made pursuant to preemptive subscription 
rights in an offering made to all holders of securities of the class to 
which the preemptive subscription rights pertain;
    (b) Such person does not acquire additional securities except 
through the exercise of his pro rata share of the preemptive 
subscription rights; and
    (c) The acquisition is duly reported, if required, pursuant to 
section 16(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

    Notes: Attach as many copies of the second part of the cover page as 
are needed, one reporting person per page.

    Filing persons may, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication, 
answer items on the schedules (Schedule 13D, 13G, or 14D-1) by 
appropriate cross references to an item or items on the cover page(s). 
This approach may only be used where the cover page item or items 
provide all the disclosure required by the schedule item. Moreover, such 
a use of a cover page item will result in the item becoming a part of 
the schedule and accordingly being considered as ``filed'' for purposes 
of section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act or otherwise subject to the 
liabilities of that section of the Act.
    Reporting persons may comply with their cover page filing 
requirements by filing either completed copies of the blank forms 
available from the Commission, printed or typed facsimiles, or computer 
printed facsimiles, provided the documents filed have identical formats 
to the forms prescribed in the Commission's regulations and meet 
existing Securities Exchange Act rules as to such matters as clarity and 
size (Securities Exchange Act Rule 12b-12).

          Special Instructions for Complying With Schedule 13D

    Under sections 13(d) and 23 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
and the rules and regulations thereunder, the Commission is authorized 
to solicit the information required to be supplied by this schedule by 
certain security holders of certain issuers.
    Disclosure of the information specified in this schedule is 
mandatory, except for Social Security or I.R.S. identification numbers, 
disclosure of which is voluntary. The information will be used for the 
primary purpose of determining and disclosing the holdings of

[[Page 116]]

certain beneficial owners of certain equity securities. This statement 
will be made a matter of public record. Therefore, any information given 
will be available for inspection by any member of the public.
    Because of the public nature of the information, the Commission can 
utilize it for a variety of purposes, including referral to other 
governmental authorities or securities self-regulatory organizations for 
investigatory purposes or in connection with litigation involving the 
Federal securities laws or other civil, criminal or regulatory 
statements or provisions. Social Security or I.R.S. identification 
numbers, if furnished, will assist the Commission in identifying 
security holders and, therefore, in promptly processing statements of 
beneficial ownership of securities.
    Failure to disclose the information requested by this schedule, 
except for Social Security or I.R.S. identification numbers, may resuly 
in civil or criminal action against the persons involved for violation 
of the Federal securities laws and rules promulgated thereunder.

    Instructions. A. The item numbers and captions of the items shall be 
included but the text of the items is to be omitted. The answers to the 
items shall be so prepared as to indicate clearly the coverage of the 
items without referring to the text of the items. Answer every item. If 
an item is inapplicable or the answer is in the negative, so state.
    B. Information contained in exhibits to the statement may be 
incorporated by reference in answer or partial answer to any item or 
sub-item of the statement unless it would render such answer misleading, 
incomplete, unclear or confusing. Material incorporated by reference 
shall be clearly identified in the reference by page, paragraph, caption 
or otherwise. An express statement that the specified matter is 
incorporated by reference shall be made at the particular place in the 
statement where the information is required. A copy of any information 
or a copy of the pertinent pages of a document containing such 
information which is incorporated by reference shall be submitted with 
this statement as an exhibit and shall be deemed to be filed with the 
Commission for all purposes of the Act.
    C. If the statement is filed by a general or limited partnership, 
syndicate, or other group, the information called for by Items 2-6, 
inclusive, shall be given with respect to (i) each partner of such 
general partnership; (ii) each partner who is denominated as a general 
partner or who functions as a general partner of such limited 
partnership; (iii) each member of such syndicate or group; and (iv) each 
person controlling such partner or member. If the statement is filed by 
a corporation or if a person referred to in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of 
this Instruction is a corporation, the information called for by the 
above mentioned items shall be given with respect to (a) each executive 
officer and director of such corporation; (b) each person controlling 
such corporation; and (c) each executive officer and director of any 
corporation or other person ultimately in control of such corporation.
    Item 1. Security and Issuer. State the title of the class of equity 
securities to which this statement relates and the name and address of 
the principal executive offices of the issuer of such securities.
    Item 2. Identity and Background. If the person filing this statement 
or any person enumerated in Instruction C of this statement is a 
corporation, general partnership, limited partnership, syndicate or 
other group of persons, state its name, the state or other place of its 
organization, its principal business, the address of its principal 
office and the information required by (d) and (e) of this Item. If the 
person filing this statement or any person enumerated in Instruction C 
is a natural person, provide the information specified in (a) through 
(f) of this Item with respect to such person(s).
    (a) Name;

convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or 
similar misdemeanors) and, if so, give the dates, nature of conviction, 
name and location of court, any penalty imposed, or other disposition of 
the case;
    (e) Whether or not, during the last five years, such person was a 
party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of 
competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is 
subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations 
of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state 
securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws; and, 
if so, identify and describe such proceedings and summarize the terms of 
such judgment, decree or final order; and
    (f) Citizenship.
    Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration. State the 
source and the amount of funds or other consideration used or to be used 
in making the purchases, and if any part of the purchase price is or 
will be represented by funds or other consideration borrowed or 
otherwise obtained for the purpose of acquiring, holding, trading or 
voting the securities, a description of the transaction and the names of 
the parties thereto. Where material, such information should

[[Page 117]]

also be provided with respect to prior acquisitions not previously 
reported pursuant to this regulation. If the source of all or any part 
of the funds is a loan made in the ordinary course of business by a 
bank, as defined in section 3(a)(6) of the Act, the name of the bank 
shall not be made available to the public if the person at the time of 
filing the statement so requests in writing and files such request, 
naming such bank, with the Secretary of the Commission. If the 
securities were acquired other than by purchase, describe the method of 
acquisition.
    Item 4. Purpose of Transaction. State the purpose or purposes of the

policy of the issuer;
    (f) Any other material change in the issuer's business or corporate

    (g) Changes in the issuer's charter, bylaws or instruments 
corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the acquisition 
of control of the issuer by any person;

in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities 
association;
    (i) A class of equity securities of the issuer becoming eligible for 
termination of registration pursuant to section 12(g)(4) of the Act; or
    (j) Any action similar to any of those enumerated above.
    Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer. (a) State the 
aggregate number and percentage of the class of securities identified 
pursuant to Item 1 (which may be based on the number of securities 
outstanding as contained in the most recently available filing with the 
Commission by the issuer unless the filing person has reason to believe 
such information is not current) beneficially owned (identifying those 
shares which there is a right to acquire) by each person named in Item 
2. The above mentioned information should also be furnished with respect 
to persons who, together with any of the persons named in Item 2, 
comprise a group within the meaning of section 13(d)(3) of the Act;
    (b) For each person named in response to paragraph (a), indicate the 
number of shares as to which there is sole power to vote or to direct 
the vote, sole power to dispose or to direct the disposition, or shared 
power to dispose or to direct the disposition. Provide the applicable 
information required by Item 2 with respect to each person with whom the 
power to vote or to direct the vote or to dispose or direct the 
disposition is shared;
    (c) Describe any transactions in the class of securities reported on 
that were effected during the past sixty days or since the most recent 
filing of Schedule 13D (Sec. 240.13d-101), whichever is less, by the 
persons named in response to paragraph (a).
    Instruction. The description of a transaction required by Item 5(c) 
shall include, but not necessarily be limited to: (1) The identity of 
the person covered by Item 5(c) who effected the transaction; (2) the 
date of transaction; (3) the amount of securities involved; (4) the 
price per share or unit; and (5) where and how the transaction was

power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the 
sale of, such securities, a statement to that effect should be included 
in response to this item and, if such interest relates to more than five 
percent of the class, such person should be identified. A listing of the 
shareholders of an investment company registered under the Investment 
Company Act of 1940 or the beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan, 
pension fund or endowment fund is not required.
    (e) If applicable, state the date on which the reporting person 
ceased to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of the class 
of securities.
    Instruction. For computations regarding securities which represent a 
right to acquire an underlying security, see Rule 13d-3(d)(1) and the 
note thereto.
    Item 6. Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships 
With Respect to Securities of the Issuer. Describe any contracts,

transfer or voting of any of the securities, finder's fees, joint 
ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of 
profits, division of profits or loss, or the giving or withholding of 
proxies, naming the

[[Page 118]]

persons with whom such contracts, arrangements, understandings or 
relationships have been entered into. Include such information for any 
of the securities that are pledged or otherwise subject to a contingency 
the occurrence of which would give another person voting power or 
investment power over such securities except that disclosure of standard 
default and similar provisions contained in loan agreements need not be 
included.
    Item 7. Material to be Filed as Exhibits. The following shall be 
filed as exhibits: Copies of written agreements relating to the filing 
of joint acquisition statements as required by Rule 13d-1(f)

permit securities tendered pursuant to the issuer tender offer to be

all of the outstanding equity securities of a class, and if a greater 
number of securities is tendered pursuant thereto than the issuer or 
affiliate is bound or willing to take up and pay for, the securities 
taken up and paid for shall be taken up and paid for as nearly as may be 
pro rata, disregarding fractions, according to the number of securities 
tendered by each security holder during the period such offer remains 
open; Provided, however, That this provision shall not prohibit the 
issuer or affiliate making the issuer tender offer from:
    (i) Accepting all securities tendered by persons who own, 
beneficially or of record, an aggregate of not more than a specified 
number which is less than one hundred shares of such security and who 
tender all their securities, before prorating securities tendered by 
others; or
    (ii) Accepting by lot securities tendered by security holders who 
tender all securities held by them and who, when tendering their

amount or none accepted, if the issuer or affiliate first accepts all 
securities tendered by security holders who do not so elect;
    (4) In the event the issuer or affiliate making the issuer tender 
increases the consideration offered after the issuer tender offer has 
commenced, such issuer or affiliate shall pay such increased 
consideration to all security holders whose tendered securities are 
accepted for payment by such issuer or affiliate.
    (5) The issuer or affiliate making the tender offer shall either pay 
the consideration offered, or return the tendered securities, promptly

    (7) The time periods for the minimum offering periods pursuant to 
this section shall be computed on a concurrent as opposed to a

    (i) The tender offer is open to all security holders of the class of 
securities subject to the tender offer; and
    (ii) The consideration paid to any security holder pursuant to the 
tender offer is the highest consideration paid to any other security 
holder during such tender offer.
    (9) Paragraph (f)(8)(i) of this section shall not:
    (i) Affect dissemination under paragraph (e) of this section; or
    (ii) Prohibit an issuer or affiliate from making a tender offer 
excluding all security holders in a state where the issuer or affiliate 
is prohibited from making the tender offer by administrative or judicial 
action pursuant to a state statute after a good faith effort by the 
issuer or affiliate to comply with such statute.
    (10) Paragraph (f)(8)(ii) of this section shall not prohibit the 
offer of more than one type of consideration in a tender offer, provided 
that:
    (i) Security holders are afforded equal right to elect among each of 
the types of consideration offered; and
    (ii) The highest consideration of each type paid to any security 
holder is paid to any other security holder receiving that type of 
consideration.
    (11) If the offer and sale of securities constituting consideration 
offered in an issuer tender offer is prohibited by the appropriate 
authority of a state after a good faith effort by the issuer or 
affiliate to register or qualify the offer and sale of such securities 
in such state:
    (i) The issuer or affiliate may offer security holders in such state 
an alternative form of consideration; and
    (ii) Paragraph (f)(10) of this section shall not operate to require 
the issuer or affiliate to offer or pay the alternative form of 
consideration to security holders in any other state.
    (12) Electronic filings. If the issuer or affiliate is an electronic 
filer, the minimum offering periods set forth in paragraph (f)(1) of 
this section shall be tolled for any period during which it fails to

Statement (Sec. 240.13e-101), the tender offer material specified in 
paragraph (a) of Item 9 of that Schedule, and any amendments thereto. If 
such documents were filed in paper pursuant to a temporary hardship 
exemption (see Sec. 232.201 of this chapter), the minimum offering 
periods shall be tolled for any period during which a required 
confirming electronic copy of such Schedule and tender offer material is 
delinquent.
    (g) The requirements of section 13(e) (1) of the Act and Rule 13e-4 
and Schedule 13E-4 thereunder shall be deemed satisfied with respect to 
any issuer tender offer, including any exchange offer, where the issuer 
is incorporated or organized under the laws of Canada or any Canadian 
province or territory, is a foreign private issuer, and is not an 
investment company registered or required to be registered under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940, if less than 40 percent of the class of 
securities that is the subject of the tender offer is held by U. S. 
holders, and the tender offer is subject to, and the issuer complies 
with, the laws, regulations and policies of Canada and/or any of its 
provinces or territories governing the conduct of the offer (unless the 
issuer has received an exemption(s) from, and the issuer tender offer 
does not comply with, requirements that otherwise would be prescribed by 
this section), provided that:
    (1) Where the consideration for an issuer tender offer subject to 
this paragraph consists solely of cash, the entire disclosure document 
or documents required to be furnished to holders of the class of 
securities to be acquired shall be filed with the Commission on Schedule 
13E-4F (Sec. 240.13e-102) and disseminated to shareholders residing in 
the United States in accordance with such Canadian laws, regulations and 
policies; or
    (2) Where the consideration for an issuer tender offer subject to 
this paragraph includes securities to be issued pursuant to the offer, 
any registration statement and/or prospectus relating

[[Page 132]]

thereto shall be filed with the Commission along with the Schedule 13E-
4F referred to in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, and shall be 
disseminated, together with the home jurisdiction document(s) 
accompanying such Schedule, to shareholders of the issuer residing in 
the United States in accordance with such Canadian laws, regulations and 
policies.

    Note: Notwithstanding the grant of an exemption from one or more of 
the applicable Canadian regulatory provisions imposing requirements that 
otherwise would be prescribed by this section, the issuer tender offer 
will be eligible to proceed in accordance with the requirements of this 
section if the Commission by order determines that the applicable 
Canadian regulatory provisions are adequate to protect the interest of 
investors.
    (h) This section shall not apply to:
    (1) Calls or redemptions of any security in accordance with the 
terms and conditions of its governing instruments;
    (2) Offers to purchase securities evidenced by a scrip certificate, 
order form or similar document which represents a fractional interest in 
a share of stock or similar security;
    (3) Offers to purchase securities pursuant to a statutory procedure 
for the purchase of dissenting security holders' securities;
    (4) Any tender offer which is subject to section 14(d) of the Act;
    (5) Offers to purchase from security holders who own an aggregate of 
not more than a specified number of shares that is less than one 
hundred: Provided, however, That:
    (i) The offer complies with paragraph (f)(8)(i) of this section with 
respect to security holders who own a number of shares equal to or less 
than the specified number of shares, except that an issuer can elect to 
exclude participants in a plan as that term is defined in Sec. 242.100 
of this chapter, or to exclude security holders who do not own their 
shares as of a specified date determined by the issuer; and
    (ii) The offer complies with paragraph (f)(8)(ii) of this section or 
the consideration paid pursuant to the offer is determined on the basis 
of a uniformly applied formula based on the market price of the subject 
security;
    (6) An issuer tender offer made solely to effect a rescission offer: 
Provided, however, That the offer is registered under the Securities Act 
of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.), and the consideration is equal to the 
price paid by each security holder, plus legal interest if the issuer 
elects to or is required to pay legal interest;
    (7) Offers by closed-end management investment companies to 
repurchase equity securities pursuant to Sec. 270.23c-3 of this chapter; 
or
    (8) Any other transaction or transactions, if the Commission, upon

transactions, either unconditionally, or on specified terms and 
conditions, as not constituting a fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative 
act or practice comprehended within the purpose of this section.

         I. Eligibility Requirements for Use of Schedule 13E-4F

    A. Schedule 13E-4F may be used by any foreign private issuer if: (1) 
The issuer is incorporated or organized under the laws of Canada or any 
Canadian province or territory; (2) the issuer is making a cash tender 
or exchange offer for the issuer's own securities; and (3) less than 40 
percent of the class of such issuer's securities outstanding that is the 
subject of the tender offer is held by U.S. holders. The calculation of 
securities held by U.S. holders shall be made as of the end of the 
issuer's last quarter or, if such quarter terminated within 60 days of 
the filing date, as of the end of the issuer's preceding quarter.

                              Instructions

    1. For purposes of this Schedule, ``foreign private issuer'' shall 
be construed in accordance with Rule 405 under the Securities Act.
    2. For purposes of this Schedule, the term ``U.S. holder'' shall 
mean any person whose address appears on the records of the issuer, any 
voting trustee, any depositary, any share transfer agent or any person 
acting in a similar capacity on behalf of the issuer as being located in 
the United States.
    3. If this Schedule is filed during the pendency of one or more 
ongoing cash tender or exchange offers for securities of the class 
subject to this offer that was commenced or was eligible to be commenced 
on Schedule 14D-1F and/or Form F-8 or Form F-80, the date for 
calculation of U.S. ownership for purposes of this Schedule shall be the 
same as that date used by the initial bidder or issuer.
    4. For purposes of this Schedule, the class of subject securities 
shall not include any securities that may be converted into or are 
exchangeable for the subject securities.
    B. Any issuer using this Schedule must extend the cash tender or 
exchange offer to U.S. holders of the class of securities subject to the 
offer upon terms and conditions not less favorable than those extended 
to any other holder of the same class of such securities, and must 
comply with the requirements of any Canadian federal, provincial and/or 
territorial law, regulation or policy relating to the terms and 
conditions of the offer.
    C. This Schedule shall not be used if the issuer is an investment 
company registered or required to be registered under the Investment 
Company Act of 1940.

                    II. Filing Instructions and Fees

    A. Five copies of this Schedule and any amendment thereto (see part

[[Page 144]]

document filed as part of the Schedule, shall be filed with the 
Commission at its principal office. Each copy shall be bound, stapled or 
otherwise compiled in one or more parts, without stiff covers. The 
binding shall be made on the side or stitching margin in such manner as 
to leave the reading matter legible. Three additional copies of the 
Schedule and any amendment thereto, similarly bound, also shall be 
filed. No exhibits are required to accompany such additional copies.
    B. The original and at least one copy of this Schedule and any 
amendments thereto shall be signed manually by the persons specified 
herein. Unsigned copies shall be conformed.
    C. At the time of filing this Schedule with the Commission, the 
issuer shall pay to the Commission in accordance with Rule 0-11 of the 
Exchange Act, a fee in U.S. dollars in the amount prescribed by section 
13(e)(3) of the Exchange Act. See also Rule 0-9 of the Exchange Act.
    (1) The value of the securities to be acquired solely for cash shall 
be the amount of cash to be paid for them, calculated into U.S. dollars.
    (2) The value of the securities to be acquired with securities or 
other non-cash consideration, whether or not in combination with a cash 
payment for the same securities, shall be based on the market value of 
the securities to be acquired by the issuer as established in accordance 
with paragraph (3) of this section.
    (3) When the fee is based upon the market value of the securities, 
such market value shall be established by either the average of the high 
and low prices reported on the consolidated reporting system (for 
exchange-traded securities and last sale reported for over-the-counter 
securities) or the average of the bid and asked price (for other over-
the-counter securities) as of a specified date within 5 business days 
prior to the date of filing the Schedule. If there is no market for the 
securities to be acquired by the issuer, the value shall be based upon 
the book value of such securities computed as of the latest practicable 
date prior to the date of filing of the Schedule, unless the issuer of 
the securities is in bankruptcy or receivership or has an accumulated 
capital deficit, in which case one-third of the principal amount, par 
value or stated value of such securities shall be used.
    D. If at any time after the initial payment of the fee the aggregate 
consideration offered is increased, an additional filing fee based upon 
such increase shall be paid with the required amended filing.

shareholders is in a language other than English, it shall be

schedule, is in a foreign language, it shall be accompanied by a 
substantive summary, version or translation in the English language.
    F. The manually signed original of the Schedule or any amendment 
thereto shall be numbered sequentially (in addition to any internal 
numbering which otherwise may be present) by handwritten, typed, printed 
or other legible form of notation from the first page of the document 
through the last page of that document and any exhibits or attachments 
thereto. Further, the total number of pages contained in a numbered 
original shall be set forth on the first page of the document.

                  III. Compliance with the Exchange Act

    A. Pursuant to Rule 13e-4(g) under the Exchange Act, the issuer 
shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of section 13(e)(1) of 
the Exchange Act and Rule 13e-4 and Schedule 13E-4 thereunder in 
connection with a cash tender or exchange offer for securities that may 
be made pursuant to this Schedule, provided that, if an exemption has 
been granted from the requirements of Canadian federal, provincial and/
or territorial laws, regulations or policies, and the tender offer does 
not comply with requirements that otherwise would be prescribed by Rule 
13e-4, the issuer (absent an order from the Commission) shall comply 
with the provisions of section 13(e)(1) and Rule 13e-4 and Schedule 13E-
4 thereunder.
    B. Any cash tender or exchange offer made pursuant to this Schedule 
is not exempt from the antifraud provisions of section 10(b) of the

Act and Rule 14e-3 thereunder, and this Schedule shall be deemed 
``filed'' for purposes of section 18 of the Exchange Act.
    C. The issuer's attention is directed to Regulation M (Secs. 242.100 
through 242.105 of this chapter), in the case of an issuer exchange 
offer, and to Rule 10b-13 under the Exchange Act (Sec. 240.10b-13), in 
the case of an issuer cash tender offer or issuer exchange offer. [See

face roman type at least as high as ten-point modern type and at least 
two-points leaded:
    ``This tender offer is made by a foreign issuer for its own 
securities, and while the offer is subject to disclosure requirements of 
the country in which the issuer is incorporated or organized, investors 
should be aware that these requirements are different from those of the 
United States. Financial statements included herein, if any, have been 
prepared in accordance with foreign generally accepted accounting 
principles and thus may not be comparable to financial statements of 
United States companies.
    ``The enforcement by investors of civil liabilities under the 
federal securities laws may be affected adversely by the fact that the 
issuer is located in a foreign country, and that some or all of its 
officers and directors are residents of a foreign country.
    ``Investors should be aware that the issuer or its affiliates, 
directly or indirectly, may bid for or make purchases of the securities 
of the issuer subject to the offer, or of its related securities, during 
the period of the issuer tender offer, as permitted by applicable 
Canadian laws or provincial laws or regulations.''

    Note to Item 2. If the home jurisdiction document(s) are delivered 
through an electronic medium, the issuer may satisfy the legibility 
requirements for the required legends relating to type size and fonts by 
presenting the legend in any manner reasonably calculated to draw 
security holder attention to it.

<R05>
Sec. 240.13f-1  Reporting by institutional investment managers of information with respect to accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.

    (a) Every institutional investment manager which exercises 
investment discretion with respect to accounts holding section 13(f) 
securities, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, having an 
aggregate fair market value on the last trading day of any month of any 
calendar year of at least $100,000,000 shall file a report on Form 13F 
(Sec. 249.325 of this chapter) with the Commission within 45 days after 
the last day of such calendar year and within 45 days after the last day 
of each of the first three calendar quarters of the subsequent calendar 
year.
    (b) For the purposes of this rule, ``investment descretion'' has the 
meaning set forth in section 3(a)(35) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(35)). 
An institutional investment manager shall also be deemed to exercise 
``investment discretion'' with respect to all accounts over which any 
person under its control exercises investment discretion.
    (c) For purposes of this rule ``section 13(f) securities'' shall 
mean equity securities of a class described in section 13(d)(1) of the 
Act that are admitted to trading on a national securities exchange or 
quoted on the automated quotation system of a registered securities 
association. In determining what classes of securities are section 13(f) 
securities, an institutional investment manager may rely on the most 
recent list of such securities published by the Commission pursuant to 
section 13(f)(3) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78m(f)(3)). Only securities of a 
class on such list shall be counted in determining whether an 
institutional investment manager must file a report under this rule 
(Sec. 240.13f-1(a)) and only those securities shall be reported in such 
report. Where a person controls the issuer of a class of equity 
securities which are ``section 13(f) securities'' as defined in this 
rule, those securities shall not be deemed to be ``section 13(f) 
securities'' with respect to the controlling person, provided that such 
person does not otherwise exercise investment descretion with respect to 
accounts with fair market value of at least $100,000,000 within the 
meaning of paragraph (a) of this section.

(Secs. 3(b), 13(f) and 23 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(b), 78m(f) 
and 78w))

chapter) under, the Exchange Act of 1934 to file a report on Form 13F

<R05>
Sec. 240.14a-3  Information to be furnished to security holders.

    (a) No solicitation subject to this regulation shall be made unless 
each person solicited is concurrently furnished or has previously been 
furnished with a publicly-filed preliminary or definitive written proxy 
statement containing the information specified in Schedule 14A 
(Sec. 240.14a-101) or with a preliminary or definitive written proxy 
statement included in a registration statement filed under the 
Securities Act of 1933 on Form S-4 or F-4 (Sec. 239.25 or Sec. 239.34 of 
this chapter) or Form N-14 (Sec. 239.23) and containing the information 
specified in such Form.
    (b) If the solicitation is made on behalf of the registrant, other 
than an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act 
of 1940, and relates to an annual (or special meeting in lieu of the 
annual) meeting of security holders, or written consent in lieu of such 
meeting, at which directors are to be elected, each proxy statement 
furnished pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be accompanied 
or preceded by an annual report to security holders as follows:

    Note to Small Business Issuers--A ``small business issuer,'' defined 
under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act (Sec. 240.12b-2), shall refer to 
the disclosure items in Regulation S-B (Sec. 228.10--702 of this 
chapter) rather than Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.10--702 of this chapter). 
If there is no comparable disclosure item in

[[Page 151]]

Regulation S-B, a small business issuer need not provide the information 
requested. A small business issuer shall provide the information in Item 
310(a) of Regulation S-B in lieu of the financial information required 
by Rule 14a-3(b)(1) (Sec. 240.14a-3(b)(1)). Small business issuers using 
the transitional small business issuers disclosure format in the filing 
of their most recent annual report on Form 10-KSB (Sec. 249.310b of this 
chapter) need not provide the information specified below. Rather, those 
small business issuers shall provide only the financial statements 
required to be filed in their most recent Form 10-KSB. The inclusion of 
additional information, including information required of non-
transitional small business issuers, in the annual report to security 
holders will not cause the issuer to be ineligible for the transitional 
disclosure forms.

    (1) The report shall include, for the registrant and its 
subsidiaries consolidated, audited balance sheets as of the end of each 
of the two most recent fiscal years and audited statements of income and 
cash flows for each of the three most recent fiscal years prepared in 
accordance with Regulation S-X (part 210 of this chapter), except that 
the provisions of Article 3 (other than Secs. 210.3-03(e), 210.3-04 and 
210.3-20) and Article 11 shall not apply. Any financial statement 
schedules or exhibits or separate financial statements which may 
otherwise be required in filings with the Commission may be omitted. If 
the financial statements of the registrant and its subsidiaries 
consolidated in the annual report filed or to be filed with the 
Commission are not required to be audited, the financial statements 
required by this paragraph may be unaudited.

    Note 1--If the financial statements for a period prior to the most 
recently completed fiscal year have been examined by a predecessor 
accountant, the separate report of the predecessor accountant may be 
omitted in the report to security holders provided the registrant has 
obtained from the predecessor accountant a reissued report covering the 
prior period presented and the successor accountant clearly indicates in 
the scope paragraph of his report (a) that the financial statements of 
the prior period were examined by other accountants, (b) the date of 
their report, (c) the type of opinion expressed by the predecessor 
accountant and (d) the substantive reasons therefor, if it was other 
than unqualified. It should be noted, however, that the separate report 
of any predecessor accountant is required in filings with the 
Commission. If, for instance, the financial statements in the annual 
report to security holders are incorporated by reference in a Form 10-K 
and Form 10-KSB, the separate report of a predecessor accountant shall 
be filed in Part II or in Part IV as a financial statement schedule.
    Note 2--For purposes of complying with Sec. 240.14a-3, if the 
registrant has changed its fiscal closing date, financial statements 
covering two years and one period of 9 to 12 months shall be deemed to 
satisfy the requirements for statements of income and cash flows for the 
three most recent fiscal years.

    (2)(i) Financial statements and notes thereto shall be presented in 
roman type at least as large and as legible as 10-point modern type. If 
necessary for convenient presentation, the financial statements may be 
in roman type as large and as legible as 8-point modern type. All type 
shall be leaded at least 2 points.
    (ii) Where the annual report to security holders is delivered 
through an electronic medium, issuers may satisfy legibility 
requirements applicable to printed documents, such as type size and 
font, by presenting all required information in a format readily 
communicated to investors.
    (3) The report shall contain the supplementary financial information 
required by item 302 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.302 of this chapter).
    (4) The report shall contain information concerning changes in and 
disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 
required by Item 304 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.304 of this chapter).
    (5)(i) The report shall contain the selected financial data required 
by Item 301 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.301 of this chapter).
    (ii) The report shall contain management's discussion and analysis 
of financial condition and results of operations required by Item 303 of 
Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.303 of this chapter) or, if applicable, a plan 
of operation required by Item 303(a) of Regulation S-B (Sec. 228.303(a) 
of this chapter).
    (iii) The report shall contain the quantitative and qualitative 
disclosures about market risk required by Item 305 of Regulation S-K 
(Sec. 229.305 of this chapter).
    (6) The report shall contain a brief description of the business 
done by the

[[Page 152]]

registrant and its subsidiaries during the most recent fiscal year which 
will, in the opinion of management, indicate the general nature and 
scope of the business of the registrant and its subsidiaries.
    (7) The report shall contain information relating to the 
registrant's industry segments, classes of similar products or services, 
foreign and domestic operations and exports sales required by paragraphs 
(b), (c)(1)(i) and (d) of Item 101 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.101 of 
this chapter).
    (8) The report shall identify each of the registrant's directors and 
executive officers, and shall indicate the principal occupation or 
employment of each such person and the name and principal business of 
any organization by which such person is employed.
    (9) The report shall contain the market price of and dividends on 
the registrant's common equity and related security holder matters 
required by Item 201 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.201 of this chapter).
    (10) The registrant's proxy statement, or the report, shall contain 
an undertaking in bold face or otherwise reasonably prominent type to 
provide without charge to each person solicited upon the written request 
of any such person, a copy of the registrant's annual report on Form 10-
K and Form 10-KSB, including the financial statements and the financial 
statement schedules, required to be filed with the Commission pursuant 
to Rule 13a-1 under the Act for the registrant's most recent fiscal 
year, and shall indicate the name and address (including title or 
department) of the person to whom such a written request is to be 
directed. In the discretion of management, a registrant need not 
undertake to furnish without charge copies of all exhibits to its Form 
10-K and Form 10-KSB provided the that copy of the annual report on Form 
10-K and Form 10-KSB furnished without charge to requesting security 
holders is accompanied by a list briefly describing all the exhibits not 
contained therein and indicating that the registrant will furnish any 
exhibit upon the payment of a specified reasonable fee which fee shall 
be limited to the registrant's reasonable expenses in furnishing such 
exhibit. If the registrant's annual report to security holders complies 
with all of the disclosure requirements of Form 10-K and Form 10-KSB and 
is filed with the Commission in satisfaction of its Form 10-K and Form 
10-KSB filing requirements, such registrant need not furnish a separate 
Form 10-K and Form 10-KSB to security holders who receive a copy of such 
annual report.

    Note: Pursuant to the undertaking required by paragraph (b)(10) of 
this section, a registrant shall furnish a copy of its annual report on 
Form 10-K and Form 10-KSB (Sec. 249.310 of this chapter) to a beneficial 
owner of its securities upon receipt of a written request from such 
person. Each request must set forth a good faith representation that, as 
of the record date for the solicitation requiring the furnishing of the 
annual report to security holders pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section, the person making the request was a beneficial owner of 
securities entitled to vote.

    (11) Subject to the foregoing requirements, the report may be in any 
form deemed suitable by management and the information required by 
paragraphs (b)(5) to (10) of this section may be presented in an 
appendix or other separate section of the report, provided that the 
attention of security holders is called to such presentation.

    Note: Registrants are encouraged to utilize tables, schedules, 
charts and graphic illustrations of present financial information in an 
understandable manner. Any presentation of financial information must be 
consistent with the data in the financial statements contained in the 
report and, if appropriate, should refer to relevant portions of the 
financial statements and notes thereto.

    (12) [Reserved]
    (13) Paragraph (b) of this section shall not apply, however, to 
solicitations made on behalf of the registrant before the financial 
statements are available if a solicitation is being made at the same 
time in opposition to the registrant and if the registrant's proxy 
statement includes an undertaking in bold face type to furnish such 
annual report to all persons being solicited at least 20 calendar days 
before the date of the meeting or, if the solicitation refers to a 
written consent or authorization in lieu of a meeting, at least 20 
calendar days prior to the earliest date on which it may be used to 
effect corporate action.

[[Page 153]]

    (c) Seven copies of the report sent to security holders pursuant to 
this rule shall be mailed to the Commission, solely for its information, 
not later than the date on which such report is first sent or given to 
security holders or the date on which preliminary copies, or definitive 
copies, if preliminary filing was not required, of solicitation material 
are filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 14a-6, whichever date is 
later. The report is not deemed to be ``soliciting material'' or to be 
``filed'' with the Commission or subject to this regulation otherwise 
than as provided in this Rule, or to the liabilities of section 18 of 
the Act, except to the extent that the registrant specifically requests 
that it be treated as a part of the proxy soliciting material or 
incorporates it in the proxy statement or other filed report by 
reference.
    (d) An annual report to security holders prepared on an integrated 
basis pursuant to General Instruction H to Form 10-K and Form 10-KSB 
(Sec. 249.310) may also be submitted in satisfaction of this rule. When 
filed as the annual report on Form 10-K and Form 10-KSB, responses to 
the Items of that form are subject to section 18 of the Act 
notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section.
    (e) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:
    (1) A registrant is not required to send an annual report to a 
security holder of record having the same address as another security 
holder of record, provided that:
    (i) Such security holders are not holding such registrant's 
securities in nominee name,
    (ii) At least one report is sent to a holder of record at that 
address and
    (iii) The holders of record to whom a report is not sent agree 
thereto in writing; and
    (2) Unless state law requires otherwise, a registrant is not 
required to send an annual report or proxy statement to a security 
holder if:
    (i) An annual report and a proxy statement for two consecutive 
annual meetings; or
    (ii) All, and at least two, payments (if sent by first class mail) 
of dividends or interest on securities, or dividend reinvestment 
confirmations, during a twelve month period, have been mailed to such 
security holder's address and have been returned as undeliverable. If 
any such security holder delivers or causes to be delivered to the 
registrant written notice setting forth his then current address for 
security holder communications purposes, the registrant's obligation to 
deliver an annual report or a proxy statement under this section is 
reinstated.
    (f) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply 
to a communication made by means of speeches in public forums, press 
releases, published or broadcast opinions, statements, or advertisements 
appearing in a broadcast media, newspaper, magazine or other bona fide 
publication disseminated on a regular basis, provided that:
    (1) No form of proxy, consent or authorization or means to execute 
the same is provided to a security holder in connection with the 
communication; and
    (2) At the time the communication is made, a definitive proxy 
statement is on file with the Commission pursuant to Sec. 240.14a-6(b).

<R05>
Sec. 240.14a-4  Requirements as to proxy.

    (a) The form of proxy (1) shall indicate in bold-face type whether 
or not the proxy is solicited on behalf of the registrant's board of 
directors or, if provided other than by a majority of the board of 
directors, shall indicate in bold-face type on whose behalf the 
solicitation is made;

[[Page 154]]

    (2) Shall provide a specifically designated blank space for dating 
the proxy card; and
    (3) Shall identify clearly and impartially each separate matter 
intended to be acted upon, whether or not related to or conditioned on 
the approval of other matters, and whether proposed by the registrant or 
by security holders. No reference need be made, however, to proposals as 
to which discretionary authority is conferred pursuant to paragraph (c) 
of this section.
    Note to paragraph (a)(3) (Electronic filers): Electronic filers 
shall satisfy the filing requirements of Rule 14a-6(a) or (b) 
(Sec. 240.14a-6(a) or (b)) with respect to the form of proxy by filing 
the form of proxy as an appendix at the end of the proxy statement. 
Forms of proxy shall not be filed as exhibits or separate documents 
within an electronic submission.
    (b)(1) Means shall be provided in the form of proxy whereby the 
person solicited is afforded an opportunity to specify by boxes a choice 
between approval or disapproval of, or abstention with respect to each 
separate matter referred to therein as intended to be acted upon, other 
than elections to office. A proxy may confer discretionary authority 
with respect to matters as to which a choice is not specified by the 
security holder provided that the form of proxy states in bold-face type 
how it is intended to vote the shares represented by the proxy in each 
such case.
    (2) A form of proxy which provides for the election of directors 
shall set forth the names of persons nominated for election as 
directors. Such form of proxy shall clearly provide any of the following 
means for security holders to withhold authority to vote for each 
nominee:
    (i) A box opposite the name of each nominee which may be marked to 
indicate that authority to vote for such nominee is withheld; or
    (ii) An instruction in bold-face type which indicates that the 
security holder may withhold authority to vote for any nominee by lining 
through or otherwise striking out the name of any nominee; or
    (iii) Designated blank spaces in which the security holder may enter 
the names of nominees with respect to whom the security holder chooses 
to withhold authority to vote; or
    (iv) Any other similar means, provided that clear instructions are 
furnished indicating how the security holder may withhold authority to 
vote for any nominee.

Such form of proxy also may provide a means for the security holder to 
grant authority to vote for the nominees set forth, as a group, provided 
that there is a similar means for the security holder to withhold 
authority to vote for such group of nominees. Any such form of proxy 
which is executed by the security holder in such manner as not to 
withhold authority to vote for the election of any nominee shall be 
deemed to grant such authority, provided that the form of proxy so 
states in bold-face type.

    Instructions. 1. Paragraph (2) does not apply in the case of a 
merger, consolidation or other plan if the election of directors is an 
integral part of the plan.
    2. If applicable state law gives legal effect to votes cast against 
a nominee, then in lieu of, or in addition to, providing a means for 
security holders to withhold authority to vote, the registrant should 
provide a similar means for security holders to vote against each 
nominee.

    (c) A proxy may confer discretionary authority to vote with respect 
to any of the following matters:
    (1) Matters which the persons making the solicitation do not know, a 
reasonable time before the solicitation, are to be presented at the 
meeting, if a specific statement to that effect is made in the proxy 
statement or form of proxy;
    (2) Approval of the minutes of the prior meeting if such approval 
does not amount to ratification of the action taken at that meeting;
    (3) The election of any person to any office for which a bona fide 
nominee is named in the proxy statement and such nominee is unable to 
serve or for good cause will not serve.
    (4) Any proposal omitted from the proxy statement and form of proxy 
pursuant to Sec. 240.14a-8 or Sec. 240.14a-9 of this chapter.
    (5) Matters incident to the conduct of the meeting.
    (d) No proxy shall confer authority:

[[Page 155]]

    (1) To vote for the election of any person to any office for which a 
bona fide nominee is not named in the proxy statement,
    (2) To vote at any annual meeting other than the next annual meeting 
(or any adjournment thereof) to be held after the date on which the 
proxy statement and form of proxy are first sent or given to security 
holders,
    (3) To vote with respect to more than one meeting (and any 
adjournment thereof) or more than one consent solicitation or
    (4) To consent to or authorize any action other than the action 
proposed to be taken in the proxy statement, or matters referred to in 
paragraph (c) of this rule. A person shall not be deemed to be a bona 
fide nominee and he shall not be named as such unless he has consented 
to being named in the proxy statement and to serve if elected. Provided, 
however, That nothing in this section 240.14a-4 shall prevent any person 
soliciting in support of nominees who, if elected, would constitute a 
minority of the board of directors, from seeking authority to vote for 
nominees named in the registrant's proxy statement, so long as the 
soliciting party:
    (i) Seeks authority to vote in the aggregate for the number of 
director positions then subject to election;
    (ii) Represents that it will vote for all the registrant nominees, 
other than those registrant nominees specified by the soliciting party;
    (iii) Provides the security holder an opportunity to withhold 
authority with respect to any other registrant nominee by writing the 
name of that nominee on the form of proxy; and
    (iv) States on the form of proxy and in the proxy statement that 
there is no assurance that the registrant's nominees will serve if 
elected with any of the soliciting party's nominees.
    (e) The proxy statement or form of proxy shall provide, subject to 
reasonable specified conditions, that the shares represented by the 
proxy will be voted and that where the person solicited specifies by 
means of a ballot provided pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section a 
choice with respect to any matter to be acted upon, the shares will be 
voted in accordance with the specifications so made.
    (f) No person conducting a solicitation subject to this regulation 
shall deliver a form of proxy, consent or authorization to any security 
holder unless the security holder concurrently receives, or has 
previously received, a definitive proxy statement that has been filed 
with, or mailed for filing to, the Commission pursuant to Sec. 240.14a-
6(b).

<R05>
Sec. 240.14a-5   Presentation of information in proxy statement.

    (a) The information included in the proxy statement shall be clearly 
presented and the statements made shall be divided into groups according 
to subject matter and the various groups of statements shall be preceded 
by appropriate headings. The order of items and sub-items in the 
schedule need not be followed. Where practicable and appropriate, the 
information shall be presented in tabular form. All amounts shall be 
stated in figures. Information required by more than one applicable item 
need not be repeated. No statement need be made in response to any item 
or sub-item which is inapplicable.
    (b) Any information required to be included in the proxy statement 
as to terms of securities or other subject matter which from a 
standpoint of practical necessity must be determined in the future may 
be stated in terms of present knowledge and intention. To the extent 
practicable, the authority to be conferred concerning each such matter 
shall be confined within limits reasonably related to the need for 
discretionary authority. Subject to the foregoing, information which is 
not known to the persons on whose behalf the solicitation is to be made 
and which it is not reasonably within the power of such persons to 
ascertain or

[[Page 156]]

procure may be omitted, if a brief statement of the circumstances 
rendering such information unavailable is made.
    (c) Any information contained in any other proxy soliciting material 
which has been furnished to each person solicited in connection with the 
same meeting or subject matter may be omitted from the proxy statement, 
if a clear reference is made to the particular document containing such 
information.
    (d)(1) All printed proxy statements shall be in roman type at least 
as large and as legible as 10-point modern type, except that to the 
extent necessary for convenient presentation financial statements and 
other tabular data, but not the notes thereto, may be in roman type at 
least as large and as legible as 8-point modern type. All such type 
shall be leaded at least 2 points.
    (2) Where a proxy statement is delivered through an electronic 
medium, issuers may satisfy legibility requirements applicable to 
printed documents, such as type size and font, by presenting all 
required information in a format readily communicated to investors.
    (e) All proxy statements shall disclose, under an appropriate 
caption, the date by which proposals of security holders intended to be 
presented at the next annual meeting must be received by the registrant 
for inclusion in the registrant's proxy statement and form of proxy 
relating to that meeting, such date to be calculated in accordance with 
the provisions of rule 14a-8(a)(3)(i). If the date of the next annual 
meeting is subsequently advanced by more than 30 calendar days or 
delayed by more than 90 calendar days from the date of the annual 
meeting to which the proxy statement relates, the registrant shall, in a 
timely manner, inform security holders of such change, and the date by 
which proposals of security holders must be received, by any means 
reasonably calculated to so inform them.

<R05>
Sec. 240.14a-6  Filing requirements.

    (a) Preliminary proxy statement. Five preliminary copies of the 
proxy statement and form of proxy shall be filed with the Commission at 
least 10 calendar days prior to the date definitive copies of such 
material are first sent or given to security holders, or such shorter 
period prior to that date as the Commission may authorize upon a showing 
of good cause thereunder. A registrant, however, shall not file with the 
Commission a preliminary proxy statement, form of proxy or other 
soliciting material to be furnished to security holders concurrently 
therewith if the solicitation relates to an annual (or special meeting 
in lieu of the annual) meeting, or for an investment company registered 
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) or a 
business development company, if the solicitation relates to any meeting 
of security holders at which the only matters to be acted upon are:
    (1) The election of directors;
    (2) The election, approval or ratification of accountant(s);
    (3) A security holder proposal included pursuant to Rule 14a-8 
(Sec. 240.14a-8 of this chapter);
    (4) The approval or ratification of a plan as defined in paragraph 
(a)(7)(ii) of Item 402 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.402(a)(7)(ii) of this 
chapter) or amendments to such a plan;

[[Page 157]]

    (5) With respect to an investment company registered under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 or a business development company, a 
proposal to continue, without change, any advisory or other contract or 
agreement that previously has been the subject of a proxy solicitation 
for which proxy material was filed with the Commission pursuant to this 
section; and/or
    (6) With respect to an open-end investment company registered under 
the Investment Company Act of 1940, a proposal to increase the number of 
shares authorized to be issued.

This exclusion from filing preliminary proxy material does not apply if 
the registrant comments upon or refers to a solicitation in opposition 
in connection with the meeting in its proxy material.

    Note 1: The filing of revised material does not recommence the ten 
day time period unless the revised material contains material revisions 
or material new proposal(s) that constitute a fundamental change in the 
proxy material.

    Note 2: The official responsible for the preparation of the proxy 
material should make every effort to verify the accuracy and 
completeness of the information required by the applicable rules. The 
preliminary material should be filed with the Commission at the earliest 
practicable date.

    Note 3: Solicitation in Opposition. For purposes of the exclusion 
from filing preliminary proxy material, a ``solicitation in opposition'' 
includes: (a) Any solicitation opposing a proposal supported by the 
registrant; and (b) any solicitation supporting a proposal that the 
registrant does not expressly support, other than a security holder 
proposal included in the registrant's proxy material pursuant to Rule 
14a-8 (Sec. 240.14a-8 of this chapter). The inclusion of a security 
holder proposal in the registrant's proxy material pursuant to Rule 14a-
8 does not constitute a ``solicitation in opposition,'' even if the 
registrant opposes the proposal and/or includes a statement in 
opposition to the proposal.

    Note 4: A registrant that is filing proxy material in preliminary 
form only because the registrant has commented on or referred to a 
solicitation in opposition should indicate that fact in a transmittal 
letter when filing the preliminary material with the Commission.

    (b) Definitive proxy statement and other soliciting materials. Eight 
definitive copies of the proxy statement, form of proxy and all other 
soliciting material, in the form in which such material is furnished to 
security holders, shall be filed with, or mailed for filing to, the 
Commission not later than the date such material is first sent or given 
to any security holders. Three copies of such material shall at the same 
time be filed with, or mailed for filing to, each national securities 
exchange upon which any class of securities of the registrant is listed 
and registered.

    Note: A registrant that is filing definitive proxy material without 
payment of a fee should state in the first paragraph of the transmittal 
letter that no fee is being paid because a fee was paid upon filing of 
preliminary proxy material.

    (c) Personal solicitation materials. If the solicitation is to be 
made in whole or in part by personal solicitation, eight copies of all 
written instructions or other material which discusses or reviews, or 
comments upon the merits of, any matter to be acted upon and which is 
furnished to the persons making the actual solicitation for their use 
directly or indirectly in connection with the solicitation shall be 
filed with, or mailed for filing to, the Commission by the person on 
whose behalf the solicitation is made not later than the date any such 
material is first sent or given to such individuals.
    (d) Release dates. All preliminary proxy statements and forms of 
proxy filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
accompanied by a statement of the date on which definitive copies 
thereof filed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section are intended to 
be released to security holders. All definitive material filed pursuant 
to paragraph (b) of this section shall be accompanied by a statement of 
the date on which copies of such material were released to security 
holders, or, if not released, the date on which copies thereof are 
intended to be released. All material filed pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section shall be accompanied by a statement of the date on which 
copies thereof were released to the individual who will make the actual 
solicitation or if not released, the date on which copies thereof are 
intended to be released.

[[Page 158]]

    (e)(1) Public availability of information. All copies of preliminary 
proxy statements and forms of proxy filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section shall be clearly marked ``Preliminary Copies,'' and shall 
be deemed immediately available for public inspection unless 
confidential treatment is obtained pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section.
    (2) Confidential treatment. If action is to be taken with respect to 
any matter specified in Item 14 of Schedule 14A (Sec. 240.14a-101), all 
copies of the preliminary proxy statement and form of proxy filed 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be for the information 
of the Commission only and shall not be deemed available for public 
inspection until filed with the Commission in definitive form, provided 
that:
    (i) The proxy statement does not relate to a matter or proposal 
subject to Sec. 240.13e-3 or a roll-up transaction as defined in Item 
901(c) of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.901(c) of this chapter); and
    (ii) The filed material is marked ``Confidential, For Use of the 
Commission Only.'' In any and all cases, such material may be disclosed 
to any department or agency of the United States Government and to the 
Congress, and the Commission may make such inquiries or investigation in 
regard to the material as may be necessary for an adequate review 
thereof by the Commission.
    (f) Communications not required to be filed. Copies of replies to 
inquiries from security holders requesting further information and 
copies of communications which do no more than request that forms of 
proxy theretofore solicited be signed and returned need not be filed 
pursuant to this section.
    (g) Solicitations subject to Sec. 240.14a-2(b)(1). (1) Any person 
who:
    (i) Engages in a solicitation pursuant to Sec. 240.14a-2(b)(1), and
    (ii) At the commencement of that solicitation owns beneficially 
securities of the class which is the subject of the solicitation with a 
market value of over $5 million,

shall furnish or mail to the Commission, not later than three days after 
the date the written solicitation is first sent or given to any security 
holder, five copies of a statement containing the information specified 
in the Notice of Exempt Solicitation (Sec. 240.14a-103) which statement 
shall attach as an exhibit all written soliciting materials. Five copies 
of an amendment to such statement shall be furnished or mailed to the 
Commission, in connection with dissemination of any additional 
communications, not later than three days after the date the additional 
material is first sent or given to any security holder. Three copies of 
the Notice of Exempt Solicitation and amendments thereto shall, at the 
same time the materials are furnished or mailed to the Commission, be 
furnished or mailed to each national securities exchange upon which any 
class of securities of the registrant is listed and registered.

    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1) of this section, no such 
submission need be made with respect to oral solicitations (other than 
with respect to scripts used in connection with such oral 
solicitations), speeches delivered in a public forum, press releases, 
published or broadcast opinions, statements, and advertisements 
appearing in a broadcast media, or a newspaper, magazine or other bona 
fide publication disseminated on a regular basis.
    (h) Revised material. Where any proxy statement, form of proxy or 
other material filed pursuant to this section is amended or revised, two 
of the copies of such amended or revised material filed pursuant to this 
section (or in the case of investment companies registered under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940, three of such copies) shall be marked to 
indicate clearly and precisely the changes effected therein. If the 
amendment or revision alters the text of the material the changes in 
such text shall be indicated by means of underscoring or in some other 
appropriate manner.
    (i) Fees. At the time of filing the proxy solicitation material, the 
persons upon whose behalf the solicitation is made, other than 
investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 
1940, shall pay to the Commission the following applicable fee:
    (1) For preliminary proxy material involving acquisitions, mergers, 
spinoffs, consolidations or proposed sales or

[[Page 159]]

other dispositions of substantially all the assets of the company, a fee 
established in accordance with Rule 0-11 (Sec. 240.0-11 of this chapter) 
shall be paid. No refund shall be given.
    (2) For all other proxy submissions and submissions made pursuant to 
Sec. 240.14a-6(g), no fee shall be required.
    (j) Merger proxies. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this

included in a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 
1933 on Form N-14, S-4 or F-4 (Sec. 239.23, Sec. 239.25 or Sec. 239.34 
of this chapter) shall be deemed filed both for the purposes of that Act 
and for the purposes of this section, but separate copies of such 
material need not be furnished pursuant to this section nor shall any 
fee be required under paragraph (i) of this section. However, any 
additional soliciting material used after the effective date of the 
registration statement on Form N-14, S-4 or F-4 shall be filed in 
accordance with this section unless separate copies of such material are 
required to be filed as an amendment of such registration statement.
    (k) Computing time periods. In computing time periods beginning with 
the filing date specified in Regulation 14A (Secs. 240.14a-1 to 240.14b-
1 of this chapter), the filing date shall be counted as the first day of 
the time period and midnight of the last day shall constitute the end of 
the specified time period.

    (l) Roll-up transactions. If a transaction is a roll-up transaction 
as defined in Item 901(c) of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.901(c)) and is 
registered (or authorized to be registered) on Form S-4 (17 CFR 229.25) 
or Form F-4 (17 CFR 229.34), the proxy statement of the sponsor or the 
general partner as defined in Item 901(d) and Item 901(a), respectively, 
of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.901) must be distributed to security 
holders no later than the lesser of 60 calendar days prior to the date 
on which the meeting of security holders is held or action is taken, or 
the maximum number of days permitted for giving notice under applicable 
state law.
    (m) Cover page. Proxy materials filed with the Commission shall 
include a cover page in the form set forth in Schedule 14A 
(Sec. 240.14a-101 of this chapter). The cover page required by this 
paragraph need not be distributed to security holders.
    (n) Solicitations subject to Sec. 240.14a-2(b)(4). Any person who:
    (1) Engages in a solicitation pursuant to Sec. 240.14a-2(b)(4); and
    (2) At the commencement of that solicitation both owns five percent 
(5%) or more of the outstanding securities of a class that is the 
subject of the proposed roll-up transaction, and engages in the business 
of buying and selling limited partnership interests in the secondary 
market, shall furnish or mail to the Commission, not later than three 
days after the date an oral or written solicitation by that person is 
first made, sent or provided to any security holder, five copies of a 
statement containing the information specified in the Notice of Exempt 
Preliminary Roll-up Communication (Sec. 240.14a-104). Five copies of any 
amendment to such statement shall be furnished or mailed to the 
Commission not later than three days after a communication containing 
revised material is first made, sent or provided to any security holder.

such holders designated by the security holder if available or 
retrievable under the registrant's or its transfer agent's security 
holder data systems; and
    (iii) The estimated cost of mailing a proxy statement, form of proxy

or payment for postage and other reasonable expenses of effecting such 
mailing. The registrant shall not be responsible for the content of the 
material; or
    (ii) Deliver the following information to the requesting security 
holder within five business days of receipt of the request: a reasonably

holder data systems; the most recent list of names, addresses and 
security positions of beneficial owners as specified in Sec. 240.14a-
13(b), in the possession, or which subsequently comes into the

shall be in the form requested by the security holder to the extent that 
such form is available to the registrant without undue burden or 
expense. The registrant shall furnish the security holder with updated 
record holder information on a daily basis or, if not available on a 
daily basis, at the shortest reasonable intervals, provided, however, 
the registrant need not provide beneficial or record holder information 
more current than the record date for the meeting or action.
    (b)(1) The requesting security holder shall have the options set 
forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and the registrant shall have 
corresponding obligations, if the registrant or general partner or 
sponsor is soliciting or intends to solicit with respect to:
    (i) A proposal that is subject to Sec. 240.13e-3;
    (ii) A roll-up transaction as defined in Item 901(c) of Regulation 
S-K (Sec. 229.901(c) of this chapter) that involves an entity with

or
    (iii) A roll-up transaction as defined in Item 901(c) of Regulation

    (B) Partnerships whose investors' securities are reported under a 
transaction reporting plan declared effective before December 17, 1993 
by the Commission under Section 11A of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78k-1).
    (2) With respect to all other requests pursuant to this section, the 
registrant

[[Page 161]]

shall have the option to either mail the security holder's material or 
furnish the security holder list as set forth in this section.
    (c) At the time of a list request, the security holder making the 
request shall:
    (1) If holding the registrant's securities through a nominee, 
provide the registrant with a statement by the nominee or other 
independent third party, or a copy of a current filing made with the 
Commission and furnished to the registrant, confirming such holder's 
beneficial ownership; and
    (2) Provide the registrant with an affidavit, declaration, 
affirmation or other similar document provided for under applicable 
state law identifying the proposal or other corporate action that will 
be the subject of the security holder's solicitation or communication 
and attesting that:
    (i) The security holder will not use the list information for any 
purpose other than to solicit security holders with respect to the same 
meeting or action by consent or authorization for which the registrant 
is soliciting or intends to solicit or to communicate with security 
holders with respect to a solicitation commenced by the registrant; and
    (ii) The security holder will not disclose such information to any 
person other than a beneficial owner for whom the request was made and 
an employee or agent to the extent necessary to effectuate the 
communication or solicitation.
    (d) The security holder shall not use the information furnished by 
the registrant pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section for any 
purpose other than to solicit security holders with respect to the same 
meeting or action by consent or authorization for which the registrant 
is soliciting or intends to solicit or to communicate with security 
holders with respect to a solicitation commenced by the registrant; or 
disclose such information to any person other than an employee, agent, 
or beneficial owner for whom a request was made to the extent necessary 
to effectuate the communication or solicitation. The security holder 
shall return the information provided pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) 
of this section and shall not retain any copies thereof or of any 
information derived from such information after the termination of the 
solicitation.
    (e) The security holder shall reimburse the reasonable expenses 
incurred by the registrant in performing the acts requested pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    Note to Sec. 240.14a-7. Reasonably prompt methods of distribution to 
security holders may be used instead of mailing. If an alternative 
distribution method is chosen, the costs of that method should be 
considered where necessary rather than the costs of mailing.

<R05>
Sec. 240.14a-8  Proposals of security holders.

    (a) If any security holder of a registrant notifies the registrant 
of his intention to present a proposal for action at a forthcoming 
meeting of the registrant's security holders, the registrant shall set 
forth the proposal in its proxy statement and identify it in its form of 
proxy and provide means by which security holders can make the 
specification required by Rule 14a-4(b) (17 CFR 240.14a-4(b)). 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the registrant shall not be required to 
include the proposal in its proxy statement or form of proxy unless the 
security holder (hereinafter, the ``proponent'') has complied with the 
requirements of this paragraph and paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section:
    (1) Eligibility. At the time he submits the proposal, the proponent 
shall be a record or beneficial owner of at least 1% or $1000 in market 
value of securities entitled to be voted on the proposal at the meeting 
and have held such securities for at least one year, and he shall 
continue to own such securities through the date on which the meeting is 
held. If the registrant requests documentary support for a proponent's 
claim that he is the beneficial owner of at least 1% or $1000 in market 
value of such voting securities of the registrant or that he has been a 
beneficial owner of the securities for one or more years, the registrant 
shall make such request within 14 calendar days after receiving the 
security holder proposal and the proponent shall furnish

[[Page 162]]

appropriate documentation within 21 calendar days after receiving the 
request. Appropriate documentation of the proponent's claim of 
beneficial ownership shall include:
    (i) A written statement by a record owner or an independent third 
party, accompanied by the proponent's written statement that the 
proponent intends to continue ownership of such securities through the 
date on which the meeting is held; or
    (ii) A copy of a Schedule 13D (Sec. 240.13d-101 of this chapter), 
Schedule 13G (Sec. 240.13d-102 of this chapter), Form 13F (Sec. 249.325 
of this chapter), Form 3 (Sec. 249.103 of this chapter) and/or Form 4 
(Sec. 249.104 of this chapter), or amendments thereto, filed with the 
Commission and furnished to the registrant by the proponent, provided 
that such filings indicate the proponent's beneficial ownership as of or 
prior to the date on which the relevant one year period commences, and 
are supported by
    (A) A copy of all subsequent amendments reporting a change in 
ownership level,
    (B) The proponent's affidavit, declaration, affirmation or other 
similar document provided for under applicable state law attesting that 
the proponent continued to be the beneficial owner of at least 1% or 
$1000 in market value of such voting securities of the registrant 
throughout the required one year period and as of the date of the 
affidavit, declaration, affirmation or other similar document provided 
for under applicable state law, and
    (C) The proponent's written statement that the proponent intends to 
continue ownership of such securities through the date on which the 
meeting is held. In the event the registrant includes the proponent's 
proposal in its proxy soliciting material for the meeting and the 
proponent fails to comply with the requirement that he continuously hold 
such securities through the meeting date, the registrant shall not be 
required to include any proposals submitted by the proponent in its 
proxy material for any meeting held in the following two calendar years.
    (2) Notice and attendance at the meeting. At the time he submits a 
proposal, a proponent shall provide the registrant in writing with his 
name, address, the number of the registrant's voting securities that he 
holds of record or beneficially, the dates upon which he acquired such 
securities, and documentary support for a claim of beneficial ownership. 
A proposal may be presented at the meeting either by the proponent or 
his representative who is qualified under state law to present the 
proposal on the proponent's behalf at the meeting. In the event that the 
proponent or his representative fails, without good cause, to present 
the proposal for action at the meeting, the registrant shall not be 
required to include any proposals submitted by the proponent in its 
proxy soliciting material for any meeting held in the following two 
calendar years.
    (3) Timeliness. The proponent shall submit his proposal sufficiently 
far in advance of the meeting so that it is received by the registrant 
within the following time periods:
    (i) Annual meetings. A proposal to be presented at an annual meeting 
shall be received at the registrant's principal executive offices not 
less than 120 calendar days in advance of the date of the registrant's 
proxy statement released to security holders in connection with the 
previous year's annual meeting of security holders except that if no 
annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual 
meeting has been changed by more than 30 calendar days from the date 
contemplated at the time of the previous year's proxy statement, a 
proposal shall be received by the registrant a reasonable time before 
the solicitation is made.
    (ii) Other meetings. A proposal to be presented at any meeting other 
than an annual meeting specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section 
shall be received a reasonable time before the solicitation is made.

    Note: In order to curtail controversy as to the date on which a 
proposal was received by the registrant, it is suggested that proponents 
submit their proposals by Certified Mail-Return Receipt Requested.

    (4) Number of proposals. The proponent may submit no more than one 
proposal and an accompanying supporting statement for inclusion in the 
registrant's proxy materials for a meeting of security holders. If the 
proponent

[[Page 163]]

submits more than one proposal, or if he fails to comply with the 500 
word limit mentioned in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, he shall be 
provided the opportunity to reduce the items submitted by him to the 
limits required by this rule, within 14 calendar days of notification of 
such limitations by the registrant.
    (b)(1) Supporting statement. The registrant, at the request of the 
proponent, shall include in its proxy statement a statement of the 
proponent in support of the proposal, which statement shall not include 
the name and address of the proponent. A proposal and its supporting 
statement in the aggregate shall not exceed 500 words. The supporting 
statement shall be furnished to the registrant at the time that the 
proposal is furnished, and the registrant shall not be responsible for 
such statement and the proposal to which it relates.
    (2) Identification of proponent. The proxy statement shall also 
include either the name and address of the proponent and the number of 
shares of the voting security held by the proponent or a statement that 
such information will be furnished by the registrant to any person, 
orally or in writing as requested, promptly upon the receipt of any oral 
or written request therefor.
    (c) The registrant may omit a proposal and any statement in support 
thereof from its proxy statement and form of proxy under any of the 
following circumstances:
    (1) If the proposal is, under the laws of the registrant's domicile, 
not a proper subject for action by security holders.

    Note: Whether a proposal is a proper subject for action by security 
holders will depend on the applicable state law. Under certain states' 
laws, a proposal that mandates certain action by the registrant's board 
of directors may not be a proper subject matter for shareholder action, 
while a proposal recommending or requesting such action of the board may 
be proper under such state laws.

    (2) If the proposal, if implemented, would require the registrant to 
violate any state law or Federal law of the United States, or any law of 
any foreign jurisdiction to which the registrant is subject, except that 
this provision shall not apply with respect to any foreign law 
compliance with which would be violative of any state law or Federal law 
of the United States.
    (3) If the proposal or the supporting statement is contrary to any 
of the Commission's proxy rules and regulations, including Rule 14a-9 
(Sec. 240.14a-9 of this chapter), which prohibits false or misleading 
statements in proxy soliciting materials;
    (4) If the proposal relates to the redress of a personal claim or 
grievance against the registrant or any other person, or if it is 
designed to result in a benefit to the proponent or to further a 
personal interest, which benefit or interest is not shared with the 
other security holders at large;
    (5) If the proposal relates to operations which account for less 
than 5 percent of the registrant's total assets at the end of its most 
recent fiscal year, and for less than 5 percent of its net earnings and 
gross sales for its most recent fiscal year, and is not otherwise 
significantly related to the registrant's business;
    (6) If the proposal deals with a matter beyond the registrant's 
power to effectuate;
    (7) If the proposal deals with a matter relating to the conduct of 
the ordinary business operations of the registrant;
    (8) If the proposal relates to an election to office;
    (9) If the proposal is counter to a proposal to be submitted by the 
registrant at the meeting;
    (10) If the proposal has been rendered moot;
    (11) If the proposal is substantially duplicative of a proposal 
previously submitted to the registrant by another proponent, which 
proposal will be included in the registrant's proxy material for the 
meeting;
    (12) If the proposal deals with substantially the same subject 
matter as a prior proposal submitted to security holders in the 
registrant's proxy statement and form of proxy relating to any annual or 
special meeting of security holders held within the preceding five 
calendar years, it may be omitted from the registrant's proxy materials 
relating to any meeting of security holders held within three calendar 
years after

[[Page 164]]

the latest such previous submission: Provided, That--
    (i) If the proposal was submitted at only one meeting during such 
preceding period, it received less than three percent of the total 
number of votes cast in regard thereto; or
    (ii) If the proposal was submitted at only two meetings during such 
preceding period, it received at the time of its second submission less 
than six percent of the total number of votes cast in regard thereto; or
    (iii) If the prior proposal was submitted at three or more meetings 
during such preceding period, it received at the time of its latest 
submission less than 10 percent of the total number of votes cast in 
regard thereto; or
    (13) If the proposal relates to specific amounts of cash or stock 
dividends.
    (d) Whenever the registrant asserts, for any reason, that a proposal 
and any statement in support thereof received from a proponent may 
properly be omitted from its proxy statement and form of proxy, it shall 
file with the Commission, not later than 80 calendar days prior to the 
date the definitive copies of the proxy statement and form of proxy are 
filed pursuant to Rule 14a-6 (Sec. 240.14a-6 of this chapter), or such 
shorter period prior to such date as the Commission or its staff may 
permit, six copies of the following items:
    (1) The proposal;
    (2) Any statement in support thereof as received from the proponent;
    (3) A statement of the reasons why the registrant deems such 
omission to be proper in the particular case; and
    (4) Where such reasons are based on matters of law, a supporting 
opinion of counsel. The registrant shall at the same time, if it has not 
already done so, notify the proponent of its intention to omit the 
proposal from its proxy statement and form of proxy and shall forward to 
him a copy of the statement of reasons why the registrant deems the 
omission of the proposal to be proper and a copy of such supporting 
opinion of counsel.
    (e) If the registrant intends to include in the proxy statement a 
statement in opposition to a proposal received from a proponent, it 
shall, not later than 30 calendar days prior to the date the definitive 
copies of the proxy statement and form of proxy are filed pursuant to 
Rule 14a-6, or, in the event that the proposal must be revised to be 
includable, not later than five calendar days after receipt by the 
registrant of the revised proposal, promptly forward to the proponent a 
copy of the statement in opposition to the proposal. In the event the 
proponent believes that the statement in opposition contains materially 
false or misleading statements within the meaning of Rule 14a-9 and the 
proponent wishes to bring this matter to the attention of the 
Commission, the proponent promptly should provide the staff with a 
letter setting forth the reasons for this view and a copy of the 
statement in opposition and at the same time promptly provide the 
registrant with a copy of his letter.

    (a) No solicitation subject to this regulation shall be made by 
means of any proxy statement, form of proxy, notice of meeting or other 
communication, written or oral, containing any statement which, at the 
time and in the light of the circumstances under which it is made, is 
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or which omits to 
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements 
therein not false or misleading or necessary to correct any statement in 
any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of a proxy 
for the same meeting or subject matter which has become false or 
misleading.
    (b) The fact that a proxy statement, form of proxy or other 
soliciting material has been filed with or examined by the Commission 
shall not be deemed a finding by the Commission that such material is 
accurate or complete or not false or misleading, or that the Commission 
has passed upon the merits of or approved any statement contained

[[Page 165]]

therein or any matter to be acted upon by security holders. No 
representation contrary to the foregoing shall be made.

particular facts and circumstances, may be misleading within the meaning 
of this section.
    (a) Predictions as to specific future market values.
    (b) Material which directly or indirectly impugns character, 
integrity or personal reputation, or directly or indirectly makes 
charges concerning improper, illegal or immoral conduct or associations, 
without factual foundation.
    (c) Failure to so identify a proxy statement, form of proxy and 
other soliciting material as to clearly distinguish it from the 
soliciting material of any other person or persons soliciting for the 
same meeting or subject matter.

Sec. 240.14a-13  Obligation of registrants in communicating with beneficial owners.

    (a) If the registrant knows that securities of any class entitled to 
vote at a meeting (or by written consents or authorizations if no 
meeting is held) with respect to which the registrant intends to solicit 
proxies, consents or authorizations are held of record by a broker, 
dealer, voting trustee, bank, association, or other entity that 
exercises fiduciary powers in nominee name or otherwise, the registrant 
shall:
    (1) By first class mail or other equally prompt means:
    (i) Inquire of each such record holder:
    (A) Whether other persons are the beneficial owners of such 
securities and if so, the number of copies of the proxy and other 
soliciting material necessary to supply such material to such beneficial 
owners;
    (B) In the case of an annual (or special meeting in lieu of the 
annual) meeting, or written consents in lieu of such meeting, at which 
directors are to be elected, the number of copies of the annual report 
to security holders necessary to supply such report to beneficial owners 
to whom such reports are to be distributed by such record holder or its 
nominee and not by the registrant;
    (C) If the record holder has an obligation under Sec. 240.14b-
1(b)(3) or Sec. 240.14b-2(b)(4)(ii) and (iii), whether an agent has been 
designated to act on its behalf in fulfilling such obligation and, if 
so, the name and address of such agent; and
    (D) Whether it holds the registrant's securities on behalf of any 
respondent bank and, if so, the name and address of each such respondent 
bank; and
    (ii) Indicate to each such record holder:
    (A) Whether the registrant, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section, intends to distribute the annual report to security holders to 
beneficial owners of its securities whose names, addresses and 
securities positions are disclosed pursuant to Sec. 240.14b-1(b)(3) or 
Sec. 240.14b-2(b)(4)(ii) and (iii);
    (B) The record date; and
    (C) At the option of the registrant, any employee benefit plan 
established by an affiliate of the registrant that holds securities of 
the registrant that the registrant elects to treat as exempt employee

    (2) Upon receipt of a record holder's or respondent bank's response 
indicating, pursuant to Sec. 240.14b-2(b)(1)(i), the names and addresses 
of its respondent banks, within one business day after the date such 
response is received, make an inquiry of and give notification to each 
such respondent bank in the same manner required by paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section; Provided, however, the inquiry required by paragraphs 
(a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall not cover beneficial owners of 
exempt employee benefit plan securities;
    (3) Make the inquiry required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section at 
least 20 business days prior to the record date of the meeting of 
security holders, or
    (i) If such inquiry is impracticable 20 business days prior to the 
record date of a special meeting, as many days before the record date of 
such meeting as is practicable or,
    (ii) If consents or authorizations are solicited, and such inquiry 
is impracticable 20 business days before the earliest date on which they 
may be used to effect corporate action, as many days before that date as 
is practicable, or
    (iii) At such later time as the rules of a national securities 
exchange on which the class of securities in question is listed may 
permit for good cause shown; Provided, however, That if a record holder 
or respondent bank has informed the registrant that a designated 
office(s) or department(s) is to receive such inquiries, the inquiry 
shall be made to such designated office(s) or department(s); and
    (4) Supply, in a timely manner, each record holder and respondent 
bank of whom the inquiries required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of

quantities, assembled in such form and at such place(s), as the record 
holder or respondent bank may reasonably request in order to send such 
material to each beneficial owner of securities who is to be furnished 
with such

[[Page 168]]

material by the record holder or respondent bank; and
    (5) Upon the request of any record holder or respondent bank that is 
supplied with proxy soliciting material and/or annual reports to 
security holders pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, pay its 
reasonable expenses for completing the mailing of such material to 
beneficial owners.

    Note 1: If the registrant's list of security holders indicates that 
some of its securities are registered in the name of a clearing agency 
registered pursuant to Section 17A of the Act (e.g., ``Cede & Co.,'' 
nominee for the Depository Trust Company), the registrant shall make 
appropriate inquiry of the clearing agency and thereafter of the 
participants in such clearing agency who may hold on behalf of a 
beneficial owner or respondent bank, and shall comply with the above 
paragraph with respect to any such participant (see Sec. 240.14a-1(i)).
    Note 2: The attention of registrants is called to the fact that each 
broker, dealer, bank, association, and other entity that exercises 
fiduciary powers has an obligation pursuant to Sec. 240.14b-1 and 
Sec. 240.14b-2 (except as provided therein with respect to exempt 
employee benefit plan securities held in nominee name) and, with respect 
to brokers and dealers, applicable self-regulatory organization 
requirements to obtain and forward, within the time periods prescribed 
therein, (a) proxies (or in lieu thereof requests for voting 
instructions) and proxy soliciting materials to beneficial owners on 
whose behalf it holds securities, and (b) annual reports to security 
holders to beneficial owners on whose behalf it holds securities, unless 
the registrant has notified the record holder or respondent bank that it 
has assumed responsibility to mail such material to beneficial owners 
whose names, addresses, and securities positions are disclosed pursuant 
to Sec. 240.14b-1(b)(3) and Sec. 240.14b-2(b)(4)(ii) and (iii).

    Note 3: The attention of registrants is called to the fact that 
registrants have an obligation, pursuant to paragraph (d) of this 
section, to cause proxies (or in lieu thereof requests for voting 
instructions), proxy soliciting material and annual reports to security 
holders to be furnished, in a timely manner, to beneficial owners of 
exempt employee benefit plan securities.

    (b) Any registrant requesting pursuant to Sec. 240.14b-1(b)(3) or 
Sec. 240.14b-2(b)(4)(ii) and (iii) a list of names, addresses and 
securities positions of beneficial owners of its securities who either 
have consented or have not objected to disclosure of such information 
shall:
    (1) By first class mail or other equally prompt means, inquire of 
each record holder and each respondent bank identified to the registrant 
pursuant to Sec. 240.14b-2(b)(4)(i) whether such record holder or 
respondent bank holds the registrant's securities on behalf of any 
respondent banks and, if so, the name and address of each such 
respondent bank;
    (2) Request such list to be compiled as of a date no earlier than 
five business days after the date the registrant's request is received 
by the record holder or respondent bank; Provided, however, That if the 
record holder or respondent bank has informed the registrant that a 
designated office(s) or department(s) is to receive such requests, the 
request shall be made to such designated office(s) or department(s);
    (3) Make such request to the following persons that hold the 
registrant's securities on behalf of beneficial owners: all brokers, 
dealers, banks, associations and other entities that exercises fiduciary 
powers; Provided however, such request shall not cover beneficial owners 
of exempt employee benefit plan securities as defined in Sec. 240.14a-
1(d)(1); and, at the option of the registrant, such request may give 
notice of any employee benefit plan established by an affiliate of the 
registrant that holds securities of the registrant that the registrant 
elects to treat as exempt employee benefit plan securities;
    (4) Use the information furnished in response to such request 
exclusively for purposes of corporate communications; and
    (5) Upon the request of any record holder or respondent bank to whom 
such request is made, pay the reasonable expenses, both direct and 
indirect, of providing beneficial owner information.

    Note: A registrant will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations 
under paragraph (b) of this section by requesting consenting and non-
objecting beneficial owner lists from a designated agent acting on 
behalf of the record holder or respondent bank and paying to that 
designated agent the reasonable expenses of providing the beneficial 
owner information.


[[Page 169]]


    (c) A registrant, at its option, may mail its annual report to 
security holders to the beneficial owners whose identifying information 
is provided by record holders and respondent banks, pursuant to 
Sec. 240.14b-1(b)(3) or Sec. 240.14b-2(b)(4)(ii) and (iii), provided 
that such registrant notifies the record holders and respondent banks, 
at the time it makes the inquiry required by paragraph (a) of this 
section, that the registrant will mail the annual report to security 
holders to the beneficial owners so identified.
    (d) If a registrant solicits proxies, consents or authorizations 
from record holders and respondent banks who hold securities on behalf 
of beneficial owners, the registrant shall cause proxies (or in lieu 
thereof requests or voting instructions), proxy soliciting material and 
annual reports to security holders to be furnished, in a timely manner, 
to beneficial owners of exempt employee benefit plan securities.

Sec. 240.14a-14  Modified or superseded documents.

    (a) Any statement contained in a document incorporated or deemed to 
be incorporated by reference shall be deemed to be modified or 
superseded, for purposes of the proxy statement, to the extent that a 
statement contained in the proxy statement or in any other subsequently 
filed document that also is or is deemed to be incorporated by reference 
modifies or replaces such statement.
    (b) The modifying or superseding statement may, but need not, state 
it has modified or superseded a prior statement or include any other 
information set forth in the document that is not so modified or 
superseded. The making of a modifying or superseding statement shall not 
be deemed an admission that the modified or superseded statement, when 
made, constituted an untrue statement of a material fact, an omission to 
state a material fact necessary to make a statement not misleading, or 
the employment of a manipulative, deceptive, or fraudulent device, 
contrivance, scheme, transaction, act, practice, course of business or 
artifice to defraud, as those terms are used in the Securities Act of 
1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``the Act''), the Public 
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Investment Company Act of 1940, 
or the rules and regulations thereunder.
    (c) Any statement so modified shall not be deemed in its unmodified 
form to constitute part of the proxy statement for purposes of the Act. 
Any statement so superseded shall not be deemed to constitute a part of 
the proxy statement for purposes of the Act.

Sec. 240.14a-15  Differential and contingent compensation in connection with roll-up transactions.

    (a) It shall be unlawful for any person to receive compensation for 
soliciting proxies, consents, or authorizations directly from security 
holders in connection with a roll-up transaction as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, if the compensation is:
    (1) Based on whether the solicited proxy, consent, or authorization 
either approves or disapproves the proposed roll-up transaction; or
    (2) Contingent on the approval, disapproval, or completion of the 
roll-up transaction.
    (b) This section is applicable to a roll-up transaction as defined 
in Item 901(c) of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.901(c) of this chapter), 
except for a transaction involving only:
    (1) Finite-life entities that are not limited partnerships;
    (2) Partnerships whose investors will receive new securities or 
securities in another entity that are not reported under a transaction 
reporting plan declared effective before December 17, 1993 by the

    Notes: A. Where any item calls for information with respect to any 
matter to be acted upon and such matter involves other matters with 
respect to which information is called for by other items of this 
schedule, the information called for by such other items also shall be 
given. For example, where a solicitation of security holders is for the 
purpose of approving the authorization of additional securities which 
are to be used to acquire another specified company, and the 
registrants' security holders will not have a separate opportunity to 
vote upon the transaction, the solicitation to authorize the securities 
is also a solicitation with respect to the acquisition. Under those 
facts, information required by Items 11, 13 and 14 shall be furnished.
    B. Where any item calls for information with respect to any matter 
to be acted upon at the meeting, such item need be answered in the 
registrant's soliciting material only with respect to proposals to be 
made by or on behalf of the registrant.
    C. Except as otherwise specifically provided, where any item calls 
for information for a specified period with regard to directors, 
executive officers, officers or other persons holding specified 
positions or relationships, the information shall be given with regard 
to any person who held any of the specified positions or relationships 
at any time during the period. Information need not be included for any 
portion of the period during which such person did not hold any such 
position or relationship, provided a statement to that effect is made.
    D. Information may be incorporated by reference only in the manner 
and to the extent specifically permitted in the items of this schedule. 
Where incorporation by reference is used, the following shall apply:
    1. Any incorporation by reference of information pursuant to the 
provisions of this schedule shall be subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 228.10(f) and Sec. 229.10(d) of this chapter restricting 
incorporation by reference of documents which incorporate by reference 
other information. A registrant incorporating any documents, or portions 
of documents, shall include a statement on the last page(s) of the proxy 
statement as to which documents, or portions of documents, are 
incorporated by reference. Information shall not be incorporated by 
reference in any case where such incorporation would render the 
statement incomplete, unclear or confusing.
    2. If a document is incorporated by reference but not delivered to 
security holders, include an undertaking to provide, without

[[Page 171]]

charge, to each person to whom a proxy statement is delivered, upon 
written or oral request of such person and by first class mail or other 
equally prompt means within one business day of receipt of such request, 
a copy of any and all of the information that has been incorporated by 
reference in the proxy statement (not including exhibits to the 
information that is incorporated by reference unless such exhibits are 
specifically incorporated by reference into the information that the 
proxy statement incorporates), and the address (including title or 
department) and telephone numbers to which such a request is to be 
directed. This includes information contained in documents filed 
subsequent to the date on which definitive copies of the proxy statement 
are sent or given to security holders, up to the date of responding to 
the request.
    3. If a document or portion of a document other than an annual 
report sent to security holders pursuant to the requirements of Rule 
14a-3 (Sec. 240.14a-3 of this chapter) with respect to the same meeting 
or solicitation of consents or authorizations as that to which the proxy 
statement relates is incorporated by reference in the manner permitted 
by Item 13(b) or 14(b) of this schedule, the proxy statement must be 
sent to security holders no later than 20 business days prior to the 
date on which the meeting of such security holders is held or, if no 
meeting is held, at least 20 business days prior to the date the votes, 
consents or authorizations may be used to effect the corporate action.
    4. Electronic filings. If any of the information required by Items 
13 or 14 of this Schedule is incorporated by reference from an annual or 
quarterly report to security holders, such report, or any portion 
thereof incorporated by reference, shall be filed in electronic format 
with the proxy statement.
    E. In Items 13 and 14 of this Schedule, the reference to ``meets the 
requirements of Form S-2'' shall refer to a registrant or to an ``other 
person'' specified in Item 14(a) of this Schedule which meets the 
requirements for use of Form S-2 (Sec. 239.12 of this chapter) and the 
reference to ``meets the requirement of Form S-3'' shall refer to a 
registrant or to an ``other person'' specified in Item 14(a) of this 
Schedule which meets the following requirements:
    (1) The registrant or other person meets the requirements of General 
Instruction I.A. of Form S-3 (Sec. 239.13 of this chapter); and
    (2) One of the following is met:

respect to the plan as proposed to be amended or modified and shall 
indicate any material differences from the existing plan.
    3. If the plan to be acted upon is set forth in a written document,

the general effect thereof upon the rights of existing security holders.
    (d) Furnish a brief statement as to arrears in dividends or as to 
defaults in principal or interest in respect to the outstanding

search card or otherwise:
    (i) The approximate number of customers of the broker or dealer who

record by the broker, dealer, or its nominee;
    (ii) The number of customers of the broker or dealer who are

department(s) is to receive such inquiries, receipt for purposes of 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall mean receipt by such designated 
office(s) or department(s).
    (2) The broker or dealer shall, upon receipt of the proxy, other 
proxy soliciting material, information statement, and/or annual reports

its customers who are beneficial owners of the registrant's securities

on its behalf in performing the obligations imposed on the broker or

Sec. 240.14c-1 thereunder. In addition, as used in this section, the 
following terms shall apply:
    (1) The term bank means a bank, association, or other entity that

to whether consent to disclosure of beneficial owner information has 
been given.

instrument creating that voting power provides that such power shall be 
exercised by different persons depending on the nature of the corporate

deemed beneficial owners; Provided, however, that only one such 
beneficial owner need be designated among the beneficial owners to 
receive proxies or requests for voting instructions, other proxy

security holders, if the person so designated assumes the obligation to 
disseminate, in a timely manner, such materials to the other beneficial 
owners.

date the designated agent receives the registrant's request. In 
complying with the registrant's request for beneficial owner information 
under paragraphs (b)(4) (ii) and (iii) of this section, a record holder 
bank or respondent bank need only supply the registrant with the names,

    (c) Exceptions to dissemination and beneficial owner information 
requirements. The bank shall be subject to the following respect to its 
dissemination and beneficial owner requirements.

securities, the bank shall not:

(b)(5) of this section data concerning such beneficial owners.
    (2) The bank need not satisfy:
    (i) Its obligations under paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of 
this section if a registrant does not provide assurance of reimbursement 
of its reasonable expenses, both direct and indirect, incurred in 
connection with performing the obligations imposed by paragraphs (b)(2), 
(b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section; or
    (ii) Its obligation under paragraph (b)(3) of this section to 
forward annual reports to consenting and non-objecting beneficial owners 
identified pursuant to paragraphs (b)(4) (ii) and (iii) of this section 
if the registrant notifies the record holder bank or respondent bank, 
pursuant to Sec. 240.14a-13(c) or Sec. 240.14c-7(c), that the registrant 
will mail the annual report to beneficial owners whose names addresses 
and securities positions are disclosed pursuant to paragraphs (b)(4) 
(ii) and (iii) of this section.
    (3) For the purposes of determining the fees which may be charged to 
registrants pursuant to Sec. 240.14a-13(b)(5), Sec. 240.14c-7(a)(5), and 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section for performing obligations under 
paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section, an amount no 
greater than that permitted to be charged by brokers or dealers for 
reimbursement of their reasonable expenses, both direct and indirect, 
incurred in connection with performing the obligations imposed by 
paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of Sec. 240.14b-1, shall be deemed to be 
reasonable.

<R05>
Sec. 240.14c-3  Annual report to be furnished security holders.

    (a) If the information statement relates to an annual (or special 
meeting in lieu of the annual) meeting, or written consent in lieu of 
such meeting, of security holders at which directors of the registrant, 
other than an investment company registered under the Investment Company

an annual report to security holders:
    (1) The annual report shall contain the information specified in 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(11) of Rule 14a-3 (Sec. 240.14a-3 of this 
chapter.)
    (2) [Reserved]

    Note to Small Business Issuers--In responding to the disclosure 
items under paragraph (b) of Rule 14a-3, (Sec. 240.14a-3 of this 
chapter) a ``small business issuer,'' defined under Rule 12b-2 of the 
Exchange Act (Sec. 240.12b-2), shall refer to the disclosure items in 
Regulation S-B (Sec. 228.10--702 of this chapter) rather than Regulation 
S-K (Sec. 229.10--702 of this chapter). If there is no comparable 
disclosure item in Regulation S-B, a small business issuer need not 
provide the information requested. A small business issuer shall provide 
the information in Item 310(a) of Regulation S-B in lieu of the 
financial information required by Rule 14a-3(b)(1) (Sec. 240.14a-
3(b)(1)). Small business issuers using the transitional small business 
issuers disclosure format in the filing of their most recent annual 
report on Form 10-KSB (Sec. 249.310b of this chapter) need not provide 
the information required by paragraph (b) of Rule 14a-3. Rather, those 
small business issuers shall provide only the financial statements 
required to be filed in their most recent Form 10-KSB. The inclusion of 
additional information, including information required of non-
transitional small business issuers, in the annual report to security 
holders will not cause the issuer to be ineligible for the transitional 
disclosure forms.

    (b) Seven copies of the report sent to security holders pursuant to 
this rule shall be mailed to the Commission, solely for its information, 
not later than the date on which such report is first sent or given to 
security holders or the date on which preliminary copies, or definitive 
copies, if preliminary filing was not required, of the information 
statement are filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 14c-5, 
whichever date is later. The report is not deemed to be ``filed'' with 
the Commission or subject to this regulation otherwise than as provided 
in this rule, or to the liabilities of section 18 of the Act, except to 
the extent that the registrant specifically requests that it be treated 
as a part of the information

[[Page 199]]

statement or incorporates it in the information statement or other filed 
report by reference.

<R05>
Sec. 240.14c-5  Filing requirements.

    (a) Preliminary information statement. Five preliminary copies of 
the information statement shall be filed with the Commission at least 10 
calendar days prior to the date definitive copies of such statement are 
first sent or given to security holders, or such shorter period prior to 
that date as the Commission may authorize upon a showing of good cause 
therefor. In computing the 10-day period, the filing date of the 
preliminary copies is to be counted as the first day and the 11th day is 
the date on which definitive copies of the information statement may be 
mailed to security holders. A registrant, however, shall not file with 
the Commission a preliminary information statement if it relates to an 
annual (or special meeting in lieu of the annual) meeting, of security 
holders at which the only matters to be acted upon are:
    (1) The election of directors;
    (2) The election, approval or ratification of accountant(s);
    (3) A security holder proposal identified in the registrant's 
information statement pursuant to Item 4 of Schedule 14C (Sec. 240.14c-
101); and/or
    (4) The approval or ratification of a plan as defined in paragraph 
(a)(7)(ii) of Item 402 of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.402(a)(7)(ii) of this 
chapter) or amendments to such a plan.

This exclusion from filing a preliminary information statement does not 
apply if the registrant comments upon or refers to a solicitation in 
opposition in connection with the meeting in its information statement.


[[Page 200]]


    Note 1: The filing of revised material does not recommence the ten 
day time period unless the revised material contains material revisions 
or material new proposal(s) that constitute a fundamental change in the 
information statement.
    Note 2: The officials responsible for the preparation of the 
information statement should make every effort to verify the accuracy 
and completeness of the information required by the applicable rules. 
The preliminary statement should be filed with the Commission at the 
earliest practicable date.
    Note 3: Solicitation in Opposition--For purposes of the exclusion 
from filing a preliminary information statement, a ``solicitation in 
opposition'' includes: (a) Any solicitation opposing a proposal 
supported by the registrant; and (b) any solicitation supporting a 
proposal that the registrant does not expressly support, other than a 
security holder proposal identified in the registrant's information 
statement pursuant to Item 4 of Schedule 14C (Sec. 240.14c-101 of this 
chapter). The identification of a security holder proposal in the 
registrant's information statement does not constitute a ``solicitation 
in opposition,'' even if the registrant opposes the proposal and/or 
includes a statement in opposition to the proposal.
    Note 4: A registrant that is filing an information statement in 
preliminary form only because the registrant has commented on or 
referred to an opposing solicitation should indicate that fact in a 
transmittal letter when filing the preliminary material with the 
Commission.

    (b) Definitive information statement. Eight definitive copies of the 
information statement, in the form in which it is furnished to security 
holders, shall be filed with, or mailed for filing to, the Commission 
not later than the date it is first sent or given to any security 
holders. Three copies thereof shall at the same time be filed with, or 
mailed for filing to, each national securities exchange upon which any 
security of the registrant is listed and registered.

    Note: A registrant that is filing a definitive information statement 
without payment of a fee should state in the first paragraph of the 
transmittal letter that no fee is being paid because a fee was paid upon 
filing of the preliminary information statement.

    (c) Release dates. All preliminary material filed pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section shall be accompanied by a statement of the 
date on which copies thereof filed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section are intended to be released to security holders. All definitive 
material filed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall be 
accompanied by a statement of the date on which copies of such material 
have been released to security holders or, if not released, the date on 
which copies thereof are intended to be released.
    (d)(1) Public availability of information. All copies of material 
filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be clearly marked 
``Preliminary Copies,'' and shall be deemed immediately available for 
public inspection unless confidential treatment is obtained pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (2) Confidential treatment. If action is to be taken with respect to 
any matter specified in Item 14 of Schedule 14A (Sec. 240.14a-101), all 
copies of the preliminary information statement filed pursuant to this 
section shall be for the information of the Commission only and shall 
not be deemed available for public inspection until definitive material 
has been filed with the Commission provided that:
    (i) The information statement does not relate to a matter or 
proposal subject to Sec. 240.13e-3 or a roll-up transaction as defined 
in Item 901(c) of Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.901(c) of this chapter); and
    (ii) The filed material is marked ``Confidential, For Use of the 
Commission Only.'' In any and all cases, such material may be disclosed 
to any department or agency of the United States Government and to the 
Congress, and the Commission may make such inquiries or investigation in 
regard to the material as may be necessary for an adequate review 
thereof by the Commission.
    (e) Revised information statements. Where any information statement 
filed pursuant to this section is amended or revised, two of the copies 
of such amended or revised material filed pursuant to this section shall 
be marked to indicate clearly and precisely the changes effected 
therein. If the amendment or revision alters the text of the material, 
the changes in such text shall be indicated by means of underscoring or 
in some other appropriate manner.
    (f) Merger material. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of 
this section, any information statement or other material included in a 
registration

[[Page 201]]

statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933 on Form N-14, S-4, or 
F-4 (Sec. 239.23, Sec. 239.25 or Sec. 239.34 of this chapter) shall be 
deemed filed both for the purposes of that Act and for the purposes of 
this section, but separate copies of such material need not be furnished 
pursuant to this section, nor shall any fee be required under paragraph 
(a) of this section. However, any additional material used after the 
effective date of the registration statement on Form N-14, S-4, or F-4 
shall be filed in accordance with this section, unless separate copies 
of such material are required to be filed as an amendment of such 
registration statement.
    (g) Fees. At the time of filing a preliminary information statement 
regarding an acquisition, merger, spinoff, consolidation or proposed 
sale or other disposition of substantially all the assets of the 
company, the registrant shall pay the Commission a fee, no part of which 
shall be refunded, established in accordance with Sec. 240.0-11.
    (h) Cover page. Each information statement filed with the Commission 
shall include a cover page in the form set forth in Schedule 14C 
(Sec. 240.14c-101). The cover page required by this paragraph need not 
be distributed to security holders.

<R05>
Sec. 240.14c-6   False or misleading statements.

    (a) No information statement shall contain any statement which, at 
the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it is made, 
is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or which omits 
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements 
therein not false or misleading or necessary to correct any statement in 
any earlier communication with respect to the same meeting or subject 
matter which has become false or misleading.
    (b) The fact that an information statement has been filed with or 
examined by the Commission shall not be deemed a finding by the 
Commission that such material is accurate or complete or not false or 
misleading, or that the Commission has passed upon the merits of or 
approved any statement contained therein or any matter to be acted upon 
by security holders. No representation contrary to the foregoing shall 
be made.

[31 FR 262, Jan. 8, 1966]


<R05>
Sec. 240.14c-7  Providing copies of material for certain beneficial owners.

    (a) If the registrant knows that securities of any class entitled to 
vote at a meeting, or by written authorizations or consents if no 
meeting is held, are held of record by a broker, dealer, voting trustee, 
or bank, association, or other entity that exercises fiduciary powers in 
nominee name or otherwise, the registrant shall:
    (1) By first class mail or other equally prompt means:
    (i) Inquire of each such record holder:
    (A) Whether other persons are the beneficial owners of such 
securities and, if so, the number of copies of the information statement 
necessary to supply such material to such beneficial owners;
    (B) In the case of an annual (or special meeting in lieu of the 
annual) meeting, or written consents in lieu of such meeting, at which 
directors are to be elected, the number of copies of the annual report 
to security holders, necessary to supply such report to such beneficial 
owners for whom proxy material has not been and is not to be made 
available and to whom such reports are to be distributed by such record 
holder or its nominee and not by the registrant;
    (C) If the record holder or respondent bank has an obligation under 
Sec. 240.14b-1(b)(3) or Sec. 240.14b-2(b)(4) (ii) and (iii), whether an 
agent has been designated to act on its behalf in fulfilling such 
obligation, and, if so, the name and address of such agent; and
    (D) Whether it holds the registrant's securities on behalf of any 
respondent bank and, if so, the name and address of each such respondent 
bank; and
    (ii) Indicate to each such record holder:
    (A) Whether the registrant pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section, intends to distribute the annual report to security holders to 
beneficial owners of its

[[Page 202]]

securities whose names, addresses and securities positions are disclosed 
pursuant to Sec. 240.14b-1(b)(3) and Sec. 240.14b-2(b)(4) (ii) and 
(iii);
    (B) The record date; and
    (C) At the option of the registrant, any employee benefit plan 
established by an affiliate of the registrant that holds securities of 
the registrant that the registrant elects to treat as exempt employee 
benefit plan securities;
    (2) Upon receipt of a record holder's or respondent bank's response 
indicating, pursuant to Sec. 240.14b-2(a)(1), the names and addresses of 
its respondent banks, within one business day after the date such 
response is received, make an inquiry of and give notification to each 
such respondent bank in the same manner required by paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section; Provided, however, the inquiry required by paragraphs 
(a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall not cover beneficial owners of 
exempt employee benefit plan securities;
    (3) Make the inquiry required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section on 
the earlier of:
    (i) At least 20 business days prior to the record date of the 
meeting of security holders or the record date of written consents in 
lieu of a meeting; or
    (ii) At least 20 business days prior to the date the information 
statement is required to be sent or given pursuant to Sec. 240.14c-2(b);

Provided, however, That, if a record holder or respondent bank has 
informed the registrant that a designated office(s) or department(s) is 
to receive such inquiries, the inquiry shall be made to such designated 
office(s) or department(s);

    (4) Supply, in a timely manner, each record holder and respondent 
bank of whom the inquiries required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of 
this section are made with copies of the information statement and/or 
the annual report to security holders, in such quantities, assembled in 
such form and at such place(s), as the record holder or respondent bank 
may reasonably request in order to send such material to each beneficial 
owner of securities who is to be furnished with such material by the 
record holder or respondent bank; and
    (5) Upon the request of any record holder or respondent bank that is 
supplied with information statements and/or annual reports to security 
holders pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, pay its reasonable 
expenses for completing the mailing of such material to beneficial 
owners.

    Note 1: If the registrant's list of security holders indicates that 
some of its securities are registered in the name of a clearing agency 
registered pursuant to section 17A of the Act (e.g., ``Cede & Co.,'' 
nominee for the Depository Trust Company), the registrant shall make 
appropriate inquiry of the clearing agency and thereafter of the 
participants in such clearing agency who may hold on behalf of a 
beneficial owner or respondent bank, and shall comply with the above 
paragraph with respect to any such participant (see Sec. 240.14c-1 (h)).

    Note 2: The requirement for sending an annual report to security 
holders of record having the same address will be satisfied by sending 
at least one report to a holder of record at that address provided that 
those holders of record to whom a report is not sent agree thereto in 
writing. This procedure is not available to registrants, however, where 
banks, associations, other entities that exercise fiduciary powers, 
brokers, dealers and other persons hold securities in nominee accounts 
or ``street names'' on behalf of beneficial owners, and such persons are 
not relieved of any obligation to obtain or send such annual report to 
the beneficial owners.

    Note 3: The attention of registrants is called to the fact that each 
broker, dealer, bank, association, and other entity that exercises 
fiduciary powers has an obligation pursuant to Sec. 240.14b-1 and 
Sec. 240.14b-2 (except as provided therein with respect to exempt 
employee benefit plan securities held in nominee name) and, with respect 
to brokers and dealers, applicable self-regulatory organization 
requirements to obtain and forward, within the time periods prescribed 
therein, (a) information statements to beneficial owners on whose behalf 
it holds securities, and (b) annual reports to security holders to 
beneficial owners on whose behalf it holds securities, unless the 
registrant has notified the record holder or respondent bank that it has 
assumed responsibility to mail such material to beneficial owners whose 
names, addresses, and securities positions are disclosed pursuant to 
Sec. 240.14b-1(b)(3) and Sec. 240.14b-2(b)(4) (ii) and (iii).

    Note 4: The attention of registrants is called to the fact that 
registrants have an obligation, pursuant to paragraph (d) of this 
section, to cause information statements and

[[Page 203]]

annual reports to security holders to be furnished, in accordance with 
Sec. 240.14c-2, to beneficial owners of exempt employee benefit plan 
securities.

    (b) Any registrant requesting pursuant to Sec. 240.14b-1(b)(3) and 
Sec. 240.14b-2(b)(4) (ii) and (iii) a list of names, addresses and 
securities positions of beneficial owners of its securities who either 
have consented or have not objected to disclosure of such information 
shall:
    (1) By first class mail or other equally prompt means, inquire of 
each record holder and each respondent bank identified to the registrant 
pursuant to Sec. 240.14b-2(e)(1) whether such record holder or 
respondent bank holds the registrant's securities on behalf of any 
respondent banks and, if so, the name and address of each such 
respondent bank;
    (2) Request such list be compiled as of a date no earlier than five 
business days after the date the registant's request is received by the 
record holder or respondent bank; Provided, however, That if the record 
holder or respondent bank has informed the registrant that a designated 
office(s) or department(s) is to receive such requests, the request 
shall be made to such designated office(s) or department(s);
    (3) Make such request to the following persons that hold the 
registrant's securities on behalf of beneficial owners: all brokers, 
dealers, banks, associations and other entities that exercise fiduciary 
powers; Provided, however, such request shall not cover beneficial 
owners of exempt employee benefit plan securities as defined in 
Sec. 240.14a-1(d)(1); and, at the option of the registrant, such request 
may give notice of any employee benefit plan established by an affiliate 
of the registrant that holds securities of the registrant that the 
registrant elects to treat as exempt employee benefit plan securities;
    (4) Use the information furnished in response to such request 
exclusively for purposes of corporate communications; and
    (5) Upon the request of any record holder or respondent bank to whom 
such request is made, pay the reasonable expenses, both direct and 
indirect, of providing beneficial owner information.

    Note: A registrant will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations 
under paragraph (b) of this section by requesting consenting and non-
objecting beneficial owner lists from a designated agent acting on 
behalf of the record holder or respondent bank and paying to that 
designated agent the reasonable expenses of providing the beneficial 
owner information.

    (c) A registrant, at its option, may send by mail or other equally 
prompt means, its annual report to security holders to the beneficial 
owners whose identifying information is provided by record holders and 
respondent banks, pursuant to Sec. 240.14b-1(b)(3) and Sec. 240.14b-
2(b)(4) (ii) and (iii), provided that such registrant notifies the 
record holders and respondent banks at the time it makes the inquiry 
required by paragraph (a) of this section that the registrant will send 
the annual report to security holders to the beneficial owners so 
identified.
    (d) If a registrant furnishes information statements to record 
holders and respondent banks who hold securities on behalf of beneficial 
owners, the registrant shall cause information statements and annual 
reports to security holders to be furnished, in accordance with 
Sec. 240.14c-2, to beneficial owners of exempt employee benefit plan 
securities.

Sec. 240.14d-1  Scope of and definitions applicable to Regulations 14D and 14E.

    (a) Scope. Regulation 14D (Secs. 240.14d-1 through 240.14d-101) 
shall apply to any tender offer which is subject to section 14(d)(1) of 
the Act, including, but not limited to, any tender offer for securities 
of a class described in that section which is made by an affiliate of 
the issuer of such class. Regulation 14E (Secs. 240.14e-1 and 240.14e-2) 
shall apply to any tender offer for securities (other than exempted

    (b) The requirements imposed by sections 14(d)(1) through 14(d)(7) 
of the Act, Regulation 14D and Schedules 14D-1 and 14D-9 thereunder, and 
Rule 14e-1 of Regulation 14E under the Act, shall be deemed satisfied 
with respect to any tender offer, including any exchange offer, for the 
securities of an issuer incorporated or organized under the laws of 
Canada or any Canadian province or territory, if such issuer is a 
foreign private issuer and is not an investment company registered or 
required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, if 
less than 40 percent of the class of securities outstanding that is the 
subject of the tender offer is held by U.S. holders, and the tender 
offer is subject to, and the bidder complies with, the laws, regulations 
and policies of Canada and/or any of its provinces or territories 
governing the conduct of the offer (unless the bidder has received an

section includes securities of the bidder to be issued pursuant to the 
offer, any registration statement and/or prospectus relating thereto 
shall be filed with the Commission along with the Schedule 14D-1F 
referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and shall be 
disseminated, together with the home jurisdiction document(s) 
accompanying such Schedule, to shareholders of the subject company 
residing in the United States in accordance with such Canadian laws, 
regulations and policies.

    Notes: 1. For purposes of any tender offer, including any exchange 
offer, otherwise eligible to proceed in accordance with Rule 14d-1(b) 
under the Act, the issuer of the subject securities will be presumed to 
be a foreign private issuer and U.S. holders will be presumed to hold 
less than 40 percent of such outstanding securities, unless (a) the 
aggregate trading volume of that class on national securities exchanges 
in the United States and on NASDAQ exceeded its aggregate trading volume 
on securities exchanges in Canada and on the Canadian Dealing Network, 
Inc. (``CDN'') over the 12 calendar month period prior to commencement 
of this offer, or if commenced in response to a prior offer, over the 12 
calendar month period prior to the commencement of the initial offer 
(based on volume figures published by such exchanges and NASDAQ and 
CDN); (b) the most recent annual report or annual information form filed 
or submitted by the issuer with securities regulators of Ontario, 
Quebec, British Columbia or Alberta (or, if the issuer of the subject 
securities is not a reporting issuer in any of such provinces, with any 
other

[[Page 206]]

Canadian securities regulator) or with the Commission indicates that 
U.S. holders hold 40 percent or more of the outstanding subject class of 
securities; or (c) the offeror has actual knowledge that the level of 
U.S. ownership equals or exceeds 40 percent of such securities.
    2. Notwithstanding the grant of an exemption from one or more of the 
applicable Canadian regulatory provisions imposing requirements that 
otherwise would be prescribed by Regulation 14D or 14E, the tender offer 
will be eligible to proceed in accordance with the requirements of this 
section if the Commission by order determines that the applicable 
Canadian regulatory provisions are adequate to protect the interest of 
investors.

Sec. 240.14d-5  Dissemination of certain tender offers by the use of stockholder lists and security position listings.

    (a) Obligations of the subject company. Upon receipt by a subject 
company at its principal executive offices of a bidder's written 
request, meeting the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section, the 
subject company shall comply with the following sub-paragraphs.
    (1) The subject company shall notify promptly transfer agents and 
any other person who will assist the subject company in complying with 
the requirements of this section of the receipt by the subject company 
of a request by a bidder pursuant to this section.
    (2) The subject company shall promptly ascertain whether the most 
recently prepared stockholder list, written or otherwise, within the 
access of the subject company was prepared as of a date earlier than ten 
business days before the date of the bidder's request and, if so, the 
subject company shall promptly prepare or cause to be prepared a 
stockholder list as of the most recent practicable date which shall not 
be more than ten business days before the date of the bidder's request.
    (3) The subject company shall make an election to comply and shall 
comply with all of the provisions of either paragraph (b) or paragraph 
(c) of this section. The subject company's election once made shall not 
be modified or revoked during the bidder's tender offer and extensions 
thereof.
    (4) No later than the second business day after the date of the 
bidder's request, the subject company shall orally notify the bidder, 
which notification shall be confirmed in writing, of the subject 
company's election made pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section. 
Such notification shall indicate (i) the approximate number of security 
holders of the class of securities being sought by the bidder and, (ii) 
if the subject company elects to comply with paragraph (b) of this 
section, appropriate information concerning the location for delivery of

offer materials computed in accordance with paragraph (g)(2) of this 
section.
    (b) Mailing of tender offer materials by the subject company. A 
subject company which elects pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section to comply with the provisions of this paragraph shall perform 
the acts prescribed by the following paragraphs.
    (1) The subject company shall promptly contact each participant

company shall use reasonable efforts to update the stockholder list and 
shall mail or cause to be mailed promptly following each update a copy 
of the bidder's tender offer materials (to the extent sufficient sets of 
such materials have been furnished by the bidder) to each person who has 
become a record holder since the later of (i) the date of preparation of 
the most recent stockholder list referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section or (ii) the last preceding update.

section to require the subject company to disseminate amendments 
disclosing material changes to the tender offer materials pursuant to 
this section, the subject company, promptly following delivery of each 
such amendment, shall mail or cause to be mailed a copy of each such 
amendment to each record holder whose name appears on the shareholder 
list described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(5) of this section and shall 
transmit or cause to be transmitted sufficient copies of such amendment 
to each participant named on security position listings who received

of this section.
    (7) The subject company shall not include any communication other 
than the bidder's tender offer materials or amendments thereto in the 
envelopes or other containers furnished by the bidder.

addresses of the record holders on the most recent stockholder list 
referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and a copy of the names 
and addresses of participants identified on the most recent security

    (2) The approximate direct cost of mailing the bidder's tender offer

the report, and postage, plus (ii) the amount of first class postage 
required to mail the bidder's tender offer materials. The approximate 
direct costs incidental to the mailing of the amendments to the bidder's 
tender offer materials shall be computed by adding (iii) the estimated 
direct costs of preparing mailing labels, of updating shareholder lists 
and of third party handling charges plus (iv) the amount of first class 
postage required to mail the bidder's amendment. Direct costs incidental 
to the mailing of the bidder's tender offer materials and amendments 
thereto when finally computed may include all reasonable charges paid by 
the subject company to third parties for supplies or services, including 
costs attendant to preparing shareholder lists, mailing labels, handling 
the bidder's materials, contacting participants named on security 
position listings and for postage, but shall exclude indirect costs, 
such as employee time which is devoted to either contesting or 
supporting the tender offer on behalf of the subject company. The final 
billing for direct costs shall be accompanied by an appropriate 
accounting in reasonable detail.
    Note to Sec. 240.14d-5. Reasonably prompt methods of distribution to 
security holders

[[Page 214]]

may be used instead of mailing. If alternative methods are chosen, the 
approximate direct costs of distribution shall be computed by adding the 
estimated direct costs of preparing the document for distribution 
through the chosen medium (including updating of shareholder lists) plus 
the estimated reasonable cost of distribution through that medium. 
Direct costs incidental to the distribution of tender offer materials 
and amendments thereto may include all reasonable charges paid by the 
subject company to third parties for supplies or services, including 
costs attendant to preparing shareholder lists, handling the bidder's 
materials, and contacting participants named on security position 
listings, but shall not include indirect costs, such as employee time 
which is devoted to either contesting or supporting the tender offer on 
behalf of the subject company.

    Notes: Attach as many copies of the second part of the cover page as 
are needed, one reporting person per page.
    Filing persons may, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication, 
answer items on the schedules (Schedule 13D, 13G or 14D-1) by 
appropriate cross references to an item or items on the cover page(s). 
This approach may be used only where the cover page item or items 
provide all the disclosure required by the schedule item. Moreover, such 
a use of a cover page item will result in the item becoming a part of 
the schedule and accordingly being considered as ``filed'' for purposes 
of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act or otherwise subject to the 
liabilities of that section of the Act.
    Reporting persons may comply with their cover page filing 
requirements by filing either completed copies of the blank forms 
available from the Commission, printed or typed facsimiles, or computer 
printed facsimiles, provided the documents filed have identical formats 
to the forms prescribed in the Commission's regulations and meet 
existing Securities Exchange Act rules as to such matters as clarity and 
size (Securities Exchange Act Rule 12b-12).

         Special Instructions for Complying With Schedule 14D-1

    Under section 14(d) and 23 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
and the rules and regulations thereunder, the Commission is authorized 
to solicit the information required to be supplied by this schedule by 
certain security holders of certain issuers.
    Disclosure of the information specified in this schedule is 
mandatory, except for Social Security or I.R.S. identification numbers, 
disclosure of which is voluntary. The information will be used for the 
primary purpose of determining and disclosing the holdings of certain 
beneficial owners of certain equity securities. This statement will be 
made a matter of public record. Therefore, any information given will be 
available for inspection by any member of the public.
    Because of the public nature of the information, the Commission can 
utilize it for a variety of purposes, including referral to other 
governmental authorities or securities self-regulatory organizations for 
investigatory purposes or in connection with litigation involving the 
Federal securities laws or other civil, criminal or regulatory statutes 
or provisions. Social Security or I.R.S. identification numbers, if 
furnished, will assist the Commission in identifying security holders 
and, therefore, in promptly processing statements of beneficial 
ownership of securities.
    Failure to disclose the information requested by this schedule, 
except for Social Security or I.R.S. identification numbers, may result 
in civil or criminal action against the persons involved for violation 
of the Federal securities laws and rules promulgated thereunder.

    Instructions. 1. Eight copies of this statement, including all 
exhibits, and two additional copies of this statement, including only 
the exhibits described in Item 11(a) of this statement, should be filed

shall be included but the text of the items is to be omitted. The

so state.
    B. Information contained in exhibits to the statement may be 
incorporated by reference in answer or partial answer to any item or 
sub-item of the statement unless it would render such answer misleading, 
incomplete, unclear or confusing. Material incorporated by reference 
shall be clearly identified in the reference by page, paragraph, caption 
or otherwise. An express statement that the specified matter is 
incorporated by reference shall be made at the particular place in the 
statement where the information is required. A copy of any information 
or a copy of the pertinent pages of a document containing such 
information which is incorporated by reference shall be submitted with 
this statement as an exhibit and shall be deemed to be filed with the

partnership; (ii) each partner who is denominated as a general partner 
or who functions as a general partner of such limited partnership; (iii) 
each member of such syndicate or group; and (iv) each person controlling

is a corporation, the information called for by the above mentioned 
items shall be given with respect to: (a) Each executive officer and 
director of such corporation; (b) each person controlling such 
corporation; and (c) each executive officer and director of any 
corporation ultimately in control of such corporation. A response to an

file a final amendment to Schedule 14D-1 [Sec. 240.14d-100] disclosing 
all material changes in the items of that Schedule and stating that the 
tender offer has terminated, the date of such termination and the 
results of such tender offer.
    E. If the bidder, before filing this statement, has filed a Schedule 
13D [Sec. 240.13d-101] with respect to the acquisition of securities of 
the same class referred to in Item 1(a) of this statement, the bidder 
shall amend such Schedule 13D [Sec. 240.13d-101] and may do so by means 
of this statement and amendments thereto, including the final amendment 
required to be filed by Instruction D: Provided, That the bidder 
indicates on the cover sheet of this statement that it is amending its 
Schedule 13D [Sec. 240.13d-101] by means of this statement.

    Item 6. Interest in securities of the subject company. (a) State the 
aggregate number and percentage of the class represented by such shares 
(which may be based on the number of shares outstanding as contained in 
the most recently available filing with the Commission by the subject 
company unless the bidder has reason to believe such information is not

is a right to acquire) by each person named in Item 2 of this schedule 
and by each associate and majority-owned subsidiary of such person 
giving the name and address of any such associate or subsidiary.
    (b) Describe any transaction in the class of securities reported on 
that was effected during the past 60 days by the persons named in

of the person covered by Item 6(b) who effected the transaction; (ii) 
the date of the transaction; (iii) the amount of securities involved; 
(iv) the price per share; and (v) where and how the transaction was

    2. If the information required by Item 6(b) of this schedule is 
available to the bidder at the time this statement is initially filed 
with the Commission pursuant to Rule 14d-3(a)(1) [Sec. 240.14d-3(a)(1)], 
such information should be included in such initial filing. However, if 
such information is not available to the bidder at the time of such 
initial filing, it shall be filed with the Commission promptly but in no 
event later than two business days after the date of such filing and, if 
material, shall be disclosed in a manner reasonably designed to inform 
security holders. The procedure specified by this instruction is 
provided for the purpose of maintaining the confidentiality of the 
tender offer in order to avoid possible misuse of inside information.
    Item 7. Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships

[[Page 224]]

transfer or the voting of any of such securities, joint ventures, loan 
or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of loans, guarantees

with whom such contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships 
have been entered into and giving the material provisions thereof. 
Include such information for any of such securities that are pledged or

another person the power to direct the voting or disposition of such 
securities, except that disclosure of standard default and similar 
provisions contained in loan agreements need not be included.
    Item 8. Persons Retained, Employed or to be Compensated. Identify 
all persons and classes of persons employed, retained or to be

make solicitations or recommendations in connection with the tender

arrangement for compensation.
    Item 9. Financial Statements of Certain Bidders. Where the bidder is 
other than a natural person and the bidder's financial conditon is 
material to a decision by a security holder of the subject company 
whether to sell, tender or hold securities being sought in the tender 
offer, furnish current, adequate financial information concerning the 
bidder; Provided, That if the bidder is controlled by another entity 
which is not a natural person and has been formed for the purpose of 
making the tender offer, furnish current, adequate financial information 
concerning such parent.
    Instructions. 1. The facts and circumstances concerning the tender 
offer, particularly the terms of the tender offer, may influence a 
determination as to whether disclosure of financial information is 
material. However, once the materiality requirement is applicable, the 
adequacy of the financial information will depend primarily on the 
nature of the bidder.
    In order to provide guidance in making this determination, the 
following types of financial information will be deemed adequate for 
purposes of this item for the type of bidder specified: (a) Financial 
statements prepared in compliance with form 10 as amended (Sec. 249.210 
of this chapter) for a domestic bidder which is otherwise eligible to 
use such form; and (b) financial statements prepared in accordance with 
Item 17 of Form 20-F [Sec. 249.200f of this chapter] for a foreign 
bidder that is otherwise eligible to use such form.
    2. If the bidder is subject to the periodic reporting requirements 
of sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Act, financial statements contained in 
any document filed with the Commission may be incorporated by reference 
in this schedule solely for the purpose of this schedule: Provided, That 
such financial statements substantially meet the requirements of this 
item; an express statement is made that such financial statements are 
incorporated by reference; the matter incorporated by reference is 
clearly identified by page, paragraph, caption or otherwise; and an 
indication is made where such information may be inspected and copies 
obtained. Financial statements which are required to be presented in 
comparative form for two or more fiscal years or periods shall not be 
incorporated by reference unless the material incorporated by reference 
includes the entire period for which the comparative data is required to 
be given.
    3. If the bidder is not subject to the periodic reporting 
requirements of the Act, the financial statements required by this item 
need not be audited if such audited financial statements are not 
available or obtainable without unreasonable cost or expense and a 
statement is made to that effect disclosing the reasons therefor.
    Item 10. Additional information. If material to a decision by a 
security holder whether to sell, tender or hold securities being sought 
in the tender offer, furnish information as to the following:
    (a) Any present or proposed material contracts, arrangements, 
understandings or relationships between the bidder or any of its 
executive officers, directors, controlling persons or subsidiaries and 
the subject company or any of its executive officers, directors, 
controlling persons or subsidiaries (other than any contract, 
arrangement or understanding required to be disclosed pursuant to Items 
3 or 7 of this schedule);
    (b) To the extent known by the bidder after reasonable 
investigation, the applicable regulatory requirements which must be 
complied with or approvals which must be obtained in connection with the 
tender offer;
    (c) The applicability of anti-trust laws;
    (d) The applicability of the margin requirements of section 7 of the 
Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder;
    (e) Any material pending legal proceedings relating to the tender 
offer including the name and location of the court or agency in which 
the proceedings are pending, the date instituted, the principal parties 
thereto and a brief summary of the proceedings; and
    Instruction. In connection with this sub-item, a copy of any 
document relating to a major development (such as pleadings, an answer, 
complaint, temporary restraining order, injunction, opinion, judgment or 
order) in a material pending legal proceeding should be promptly 
furnished to the Commission on a supplemental basis.
    (f) Such additional material information, if any, as may be 
necessary to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances 
under which they are made, not materially misleading.

[[Page 225]]

    Item 11. Material to be filed as exhibits. Furnish a copy of: (a) 
Tender offer material which is published, sent or given to security 
holders by or on behalf of the bidder in connection with the tender 
offer;
    (b) Any loan agreement referred to in Item 4 of this schedule.
    Instruction. The identity of any bank which is a party to a loan 
agreement need not be disclosed if the person filing the statement has 
requested that the identity of such bank not be made available to the 
public pursuant to Item 4 of this schedule;
    (c) Any document setting forth the terms of any contracts, 
arrangements, understandings or relationships referred to in Item 7 or 
10(a) of this schedule;
    (d) Any written opinion prepared by legal counsel at the bidder's 
request and communicated to the bidder pertaining to the tax

    (f) If any oral solicitation of security holders is to be made by or 
on behalf of the bidder, any written instruction, form or other material 
which is furnished to the persons making the actual oral solicitation 
for their use, directly or indirectly, in connection with the tender 
offer.

                          General Instructions

         I. Eligibility Requirements for Use of Schedule 14D-1F

    A. Schedule 14D-1F may be used by any person making a cash tender or 
exchange offer (the ``bidder'') for securities of any issuer 
incorporated or organized under the laws of Canada or any Canadian 
province or territory that is a foreign private issuer, where less than 
40 percent of the outstanding class of such issuer's securities that is 
the subject of the offer is held by U.S. holders. The calculation of 
U.S. holders shall be made as of the end of the subject issuer's last 
quarter or, if such quarter terminated within 60 days of the filing 
date, as of the end of such issuer's preceding quarter.

                              Instructions

    1. For purposes of this Schedule, ``foreign private issuer'' shall 
be construed in accordance with Rule 405 under the Securities Act.
    2. For purposes of this Schedule, the term ``U. S. holder'' shall 
mean any person whose address appears on the records of the issuer, any 
voting trustee, any depositary, any share transfer agent or any person 
acting in a similar capacity on behalf of the issuer as being located in 
the United States.
    3. With respect to any tender offer, including any exchange offer, 
otherwise eligible to proceed in accordance with Rule 14d-1(b) under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act''), the issuer of 
the subject securities will be presumed to be a foreign private issuer 
and U. S. holders will be presumed to hold less than 40 percent of such 
outstanding securities, unless (a) the aggregate trading volume of that 
class on national securities exchanges in the United States and on 
NASDAQ exceeded its aggregate trading volume on securities exchanges in 
Canada and on the Canadian Dealing Network, Inc. (``CDN'') over the 12 
calendar month period prior to commencement of this offer, or if 
commenced in response to a prior offer, over the 12 calendar month 
period prior to commencement of the initial offer (based on volume 
figures published by such exchanges and NASDAQ and CDN) ; (b) the most 
recent annual report or annual information form filed or submitted by 
the issuer with securities regulators of Ontario, Quebec, British 
Columbia or Alberta (or, if the issuer of the subject securities is not 
a reporting issuer in any of such provinces, with any other Canadian 
securities regulator) or with the Commission indicates that U. S. 
holders hold 40 percent or more of the subject class of securities; or 
(c) the offeror has actual knowledge that the level of U. S. ownership 
equals or exceeds 40 percent of such securities.
    4. If this Schedule is filed during the pendency of one or more 
ongoing cash tender or exchange offers for securities of the class 
subject to this offer that was commenced or was eligible to be commenced 
on Schedule 13E-4F, Schedule 14D-1F and/or Form F-8 or Form F-80, the 
date for calculation of U. S. ownership for purposes of this Schedule 
shall be the same as that date used by the initial bidder or issuer.
    5. For purposes of this Schedule, the class of subject securities 
shall not include any securities that may be converted into or are 
exchangeable for the subject securities.
    B. Any bidder using this Schedule must extend the cash tender or 
exchange offer to U. S. holders of securities of the subject company 
upon terms and conditions not less favorable than those extended to any 
other holder of such securities, and must comply with the requirements 
of any Canadian federal, provincial and/or territorial law, regulation 
or policy relating to the terms and conditions of the offer.
    C. This Schedule shall not be used if the subject company is an 
investment company registered or required to be registered under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940.
    D. This Schedule shall not be used to comply with the reporting 
requirements of section 13(d) of the Exchange Act. Persons using this 
Schedule are reminded of their obligation to file or update a Schedule 
13D where required by section 13(d)(1) of the Exchange Act and the 
Commission's rules and regulations thereunder.

                     II. Filing Instructions and Fee

    A. Five copies of this Schedule and any amendment thereto (see part 
I, item 1(b)), including all exhibits and any other paper or document 
filed as part of the Schedule, shall be filed with the Commission at its 
principal office. Each copy shall be bound, stapled or otherwise 
compiled in one or more parts, without stiff covers. The binding shall 
be made on the side or stitching margin in such manner as to leave the 
reading matter legible. Three additional copies of the Schedule and any 
amendment thereto, similarly bound, also shall be filed. No exhibits are 
required to accompany such additional copies.
    B. The original and at least one copy of this Schedule and any 
amendments thereto shall be signed manually by the persons specified 
herein. Unsigned copies shall be conformed.
    C. At the time of filing this Schedule with the Commission, the 
bidder shall pay to the Commission in accordance with Rule 0-11 of the 
Exchange Act, a fee in U. S. dollars in the amount prescribed by section 
14(g)(3) of the Exchange Act. See also Rule 0-9 under the Exchange Act.

[[Page 229]]

    (1) Where the bidder is offering securities or other non-cash 
consideration for some or all of the securities to be acquired, whether 
or not in combination with a cash payment for the same securities, the 
value of the consideration shall be based on the market value of the 
securities to be received by the bidder as established by paragraph 3 of 
this section.
    (2) If there is no market for the securities to be acquired by the 
bidder, the book value of such securities computed as of the latest 
practicable date prior to the date of filing the Schedule shall be used, 
unless the issuer of such securities is in bankruptcy or receivership or 
has an accumulated capital deficit, in which case one-third of the 
principal amount, par value or stated value of such securities shall be 
used.
    (3) When the fee is based upon the market value of the securities, 
such market value shall be calculated upon the basis of either the 
average of the high and low prices reported in the consolidated 
reporting system (for exchange traded securities and last sale reported 
for over-the-counter securities) or the average of the bid and asked 
price (for other over-the-counter securities) as of a specified date 
within five business days prior to the date of filing the Schedule.
    D. If at any time after the initial payment of the fee the aggregate 
consideration offered is increased, an additional filing fee based upon 
such increase shall be paid with the required amended filing.
    E. If any part of the document or documents to be sent to 
shareholders is in a foreign language, it shall be accompanied by a 
translation in English. If any other part of this Schedule, or any 
exhibit or other paper or document filed as part of the Schedule, is in 
a language other than English, it shall be accompanied by a substantive 
summary, version or translation in the English language.
    F. The manually signed original of the Schedule or any amendment 
thereto shall be numbered sequentially (in addition to any internal 
numbering which otherwise may be present) by handwritten, typed, printed 
or other legible form of notation from the first page of the document 
through the last page of that document and any exhibits or attachments 
thereto. Further, the total number of pages contained in a numbered 
original shall be set forth on the first page of the document.

                  III. Compliance With the Exchange Act

    A. Pursuant to Rule 14d-1(b) under the Exchange Act, the bidder 
shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of sections 14(d)(1) 
through 14(d)(7) of the Exchange Act, Regulation 14D under the Exchange 
Act and Schedule 14D-1 thereunder, and Rule 14e-1 under Regulation 14E 
of the Exchange Act, in connection with a cash tender or exchange offer 
for securities that may be made pursuant to this Schedule; provided 
that, if an exemption has been granted from requirements of Canadian 
federal, provincial, and/or territorial laws, regulations or policies, 
and the tender offer does not comply with requirements that otherwise 
would be prescribed by Regulation 14D or 14E, the bidder (absent an 
order from the Commission) shall comply with the provisions of sections 
14(d)(1) through 14(d)(7), Regulation 14D and Schedule 14D-1 thereunder, 
and Rule 14e-1 under Regulation 14E.
    B. Any cash tender or exchange offer made pursuant to this Schedule 
is not exempt from the antifraud provisions of section 10(b) of the 
Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and section 14(e) of the 
Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3 thereunder, and this Schedule shall be 
deemed ``filed'' for purposes of section 18 of the Exchange Act.
    C. The bidder's attention is directed to Regulation M (Secs. 242.100 
through 242.105 of this chapter) in the case of an exchange offer, and 
to Rule 10b-13 under the Exchange Act (Sec. 240.10b-13) for any exchange 
or cash tender offer. [See Exchange Act Release No. 29355 (June 21, 
1991) containing an exemption from Rule 10b-13.]

point modern type and at least two points leaded:
    ``This tender offer is made for the securities of a foreign issuer 
and while the offer is subject to disclosure requirements of the country 
in which the subject company is incorporated or organized, investors 
should be aware that these requirements are different from those of the 
United States. Financial statements included herein, if any, have been 
prepared in accordance with foreign generally accepted accounting 
principles and thus may not be comparable to financial statements of 
United States companies.

federal securities laws may be affected adversely by the fact that the 
subject company is located in a foreign country, and that some or all of 
its officers and directors are residents of a foreign country.
    ``Investors should be aware that the bidder or its affiliates, 
directly or indirectly, may bid for or make purchases of the issuer's 
securities subject to the offer, or of the issuer's related securities,

Canadian laws or provincial laws or regulations. ''

by applicable Canadian laws or provincial laws or regulations. ''
    Note to Item 2. If the home-jurisdiction document(s) are delivered

    For purposes of this Schedule, ``foreign private issuer'' shall be 
construed in accordance with Rule 405 under the Securities Act.
    B. Any person(s) using this Schedule must comply with the 
requirements of any Canadian federal, provincial and/or territorial law,

United States. Financial statements included herein, if any, have been 
prepared in accordance with foreign generally accepted accounting

deposited by or on behalf of security holders promptly after the

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    (1) The amount of a person's ``net long position'' in a subject 
security shall equal the excess, if any, of such person's ``long 
position'' over such person's ``short position.'' For the purposes of 
determining the net long position as of the end of the proration period 
and for tendering concurrently to two or more partial tender offers, 
securities that have been tendered in accordance with the rule and not 
withdrawn are deemed to be part of the person's long position.
    (i) Such person's long position is the amount of subject securities 
that such person:
    (A) Or his agent has title to or would have title to but for having 
lent such securities; or
    (B) Has purchased, or has entered into an unconditional contract, 
binding on both parties thereto, to purchase but has not yet received; 
or

securities or subject

on both parties thereto, to sell; or
    (B) Has borrowed; or
    (C) Has written a non-standardized call option, or granted any other 
right pursuant to which his shares may be tendered by another person; or
    (D) Is obligated to deliver upon exercise of a standardized call 
option sold on or after the date that a tender offer is first publicly 
announced or otherwise made known by the bidder to holders of the 
security to be acquired, if the exercise price of such option is lower 
than the highest tender offer price or stated amount of the 
consideration offered for the subject security. For the purpose of this 
paragraph, if one or more tender offers for the same security are 
ongoing on such date, the announcement date shall be that of the first 
announced offer.
    (2) The term equivalent security means:
    (i) Any security (including any option, warrant, or other right to 
purchase the subject security), issued by the person whose securities 
are the subject of the offer, that is immediately convertible into, or 
exchangeable or exercisable for, a subject security, or
    (ii) Any other right or option (other than a standardized call 
option) that entitles the holder thereof to acquire a subject security, 
but only if the holder thereof reasonably believes that the maker or 
writer of the right or option has title to and possession of the subject 
security and upon exercise will promptly deliver the subject security.
    (3) The term subject security means a security that is the subject 
of any tender offer or request or invitation for tenders.
    (4) For purposes of this rule, a person shall be deemed to 
``tender'' a security if he:
    (i) Delivers a subject security pursuant to an offer,
    (ii) Causes such delivery to be made,
    (iii) Guarantees delivery of a subject security pursuant to a tender 
offer,
    (iv) Causes a guarantee of such delivery to be given by another 
person, or
    (v) Uses any other method by which acceptance of a tender offer may 
be made.
    (5) The term partial tender offer means a tender offer or request or 
invitation for tenders for less than all of the outstanding securities 
subject to the offer in which tenders are accepted either by lot or on a 
pro rata basis for a specified period, or a tender offer for all of the 
outstanding shares that offers a choice of consideration in which 
tenders for different forms of consideration may be accepted either by 
lot or on a pro rata basis for a specified period.
    (6) The term standardized call option means any call option that is 
traded on an exchange, or for which quotation information is 
disseminated in an electronic interdealer quotation system of a 
registered national securities association.
    (b) It shall be unlawful for any person acting alone or in concert 
with others, directly or indirectly, to tender any subject security in a 
partial tender offer:
    (1) For his own account unless at the time of tender, and at the end 
of the proration period or period during which securities are accepted 
by lot (including any extensions thereof), he has a net long position 
equal to or greater than the amount tendered in:
    (i) The subject security and will deliver or cause to be delivered 
such security for the purpose of tender to the person making the offer 
within the period specified in the offer; or
    (ii) An equivalent security and, upon the acceptance of his tender 
will acquire the subject security by conversion, exchange, or exercise 
of such equivalent security to the extent required by the terms of the 
offer, and will deliver or cause to be delivered the subject security so 
acquired for the purpose of tender to the person making the offer within 
the period specified in the offer; or
    (2) For the account of another person unless the person making the 
tender:
    (i) Possesses the subject security or an equivalent security, or
    (ii) Has a reasonable belief that, upon information furnished by the 
person on whose behalf the tender is made, such person owns the subject 
security or an equivalent security and will promptly

[[Page 237]]

deliver the subject security or such equivalent security for the purpose 
of tender to the person making the tender.
    (c) This rule shall not prohibit any transaction or transactions 
which the Commission, upon written request or upon its own motion, 
exempts, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions.

    (a) General provisions. The term fraudulent, deceptive, or 
manipulative act or practice, as used in section 15(c) (2) of the Act, 
is hereby defined to include the direct or indirect hypothecation by a 
broker or dealer, or his arranging for or permitting, directly or 
indirectly, the continued hypothecation of any securities carried for 
the account of any customer under circumstances:
    (1) That will permit the commingling of securities carried for the 
account of any such customer with securities carried for the account of 
any other customer, without first obtaining the written consent of each 
such customer to such hypothecation;
    (2) That will permit such securities to be commingled with 
securities carried for the account of any person other than a bona fide 
customer of such broker or dealer under a lien for a loan made to such 
broker or dealer; or
    (3) That will permit securities carried for the account of customers 
to be hypothecated, or subjected to any lien or liens or claims or 
claims of the pledgee or pledgees, for a sum which exceeds the aggregate 
indebtedness of all customers in respect of securities carried for their 
accounts; except that this clause shall not be deemed to be violated by 
reason of an excess arising on any day through the reduction of the 
aggregate indebtedness of customers on such day, provided that funds or 
securities in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess are paid or 
placed in transfer to pledgees for the purpose of reducing the sum of 
the liens or claims to which securities carried for the account of 
customers are subject as promptly as practicable after such reduction 
occurs, but before the lapse of one half hour after the commencement of 
banking hours on the next banking day at the place where the largest 
principal amount of loans of such broker or dealer are payable and, in 
any event, before such broker or dealer on such day has obtained or 
increased any bank loan collateralized by securities carried for the 
account of customers.
    (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
    (1) The term customer shall not be deemed to include any general or 
special partner or any director or officer of such broker or dealer, or 
any participant, as such, in any joint, group or syndicate account with 
such broker or dealer or with any partner, officer or director thereof;
    (2) The term securities carried for the account of any customer 
shall be deemed to mean:
    (i) Securities received by or on behalf of such broker or dealer for 
the account of any customer;
    (ii) Securities sold and appropriated by such broker or dealer to a 
customer, except that if such securities were subject to a lien when 
appropriated to a customer they shall not be deemed to be ``securities 
carried for the account of any customer'' pending their release from 
such lien as promptly as practicable;
    (iii) Securities sold, but not appropriated, by such broker or 
dealer to a customer who has made any payment therefor, to the extent 
that such broker or dealer owns and has received

[[Page 250]]

delivery of securities of like kind, except that if such securities were 
subject to a lien when such payment was made they shall not be deemed to 
be ``securities carried for the account of any customer'' pending their 
release from such lien as promptly as practicable;
    (3) Aggregate indebtedness shall not be deemed to be reduced by 
reason of uncollected items. In computing aggregate indebtedness, 
related guaranteed and guarantor accounts shall be treated as a single 
account and considered on a consolidated basis, and balances in accounts 
carrying both long and short positions shall be adjusted by treating the 
market value of the securities required to cover such short positions as 
though such market value were a debit; and
    (4) In computing the sum of the liens or claims to which securities 
carried for the account of customers of a broker or dealer are subject, 
any rehypothecation of such securities by another broker or dealer who 
is subject to this section or to Sec. 240.8c-1 shall be disregarded.
    (c) Exemption for cash accounts. The provisions of paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section shall not apply to any hypothecation of securities 
carried for the account of a customer in a special cash account within 
the meaning of 12 CFR 220.4(c): Provided, That at or before the 
completion of the transaction of purchase of such securities for, or of 
sale of such securities to, such customer, written notice is given or 
sent to such customer disclosing that such securities are or may be 
hypothecated under circumstances which will permit the commingling 
thereof with securities carried for the account of other customers. The 
term the completion of the transaction shall have the meaning given to 
such term by Sec. 240.15c1-1(b).
    (d) Exemption for clearing house liens. The provisions of paragraphs 
(a)(2), (a)(3), and (f) of this section shall not apply to any lien or 
claim of the clearing corporation, or similar department or association, 
of a national securities exchange or a registered national securities 
association, for a loan made and to be repaid on the same calendar day, 
which is incidental to the clearing of transactions in securities or 
loans through such corporation, department, or association: Provided, 
however, That for the purpose of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, 
``aggregate indebtedness of all customers in respect of securities 
carried for their accounts'' shall not include indebtedness in respect 
of any securities subject to any lien or claim exempted by this 
paragraph.
    (e) Exemption for certain liens on securities of noncustomers. The 
provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall not be deemed to 
prevent such broker or dealer from permitting securities not carried for 
the account of a customer to be subjected (1) to a lien for a loan made 
against securities carried for the account of customers, or (2) to a 
lien for a loan made and to be repaid on the same calendar day. For the 
purpose of this exemption, a loan shall be deemed to be ``made against 
securities carried for the account of customers'' if only securities 
carried for the account of customers are used to obtain or to increase 
such loan or as substitutes for other securities carried for the account 
of customers.
    (f) Notice and certification requirements. No person subject to this 
section shall hypothecate any security carried for the account of a 
customer unless, at or prior to the time of each such hypothecation, he 
gives written notice to the pledgee that the security pledged is carried 
for the account of a customer and that such hypothecation does not 
contravene any provision of this section, except that in the case of an 
omnibus account the broker or dealer for whom such account is carried 
may furnish a signed statement to the person carrying such account that 
all securities carried therein by such broker or dealer will be 
securities carried for the account of his customers and that the 
hypothecation thereof by such broker or dealer will not contravene any 
provision of this section. The provisions of this paragraph shall not 
apply to any hypothecation of securities under any lien or claim of a 
pledgee securing a loan made and to be repaid on the same calendar day.
    (g) The fact that securities carried for the accounts of customers 
and securities carried for the accounts of others

[[Page 251]]

are represented by one or more certificates in the custody of a clearing 
corporation or other subsidiary organization of either a national 
securities exchange or of a registered national securities association, 
or of a custodian bank, in accordance with a system for the central 
handling of securities established by a national securities exchange or 
a registered national securities association, pursuant to which system 
the hypothecation of such securities is effected by bookkeeping entries 
without physical delivery of such securities, shall not, in and of 
itself, result in a commingling of securities prohibited by paragraph 
(a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, whenever a participating member, 
broker or dealer hypothecates securities in accordance with such system: 
Provided, however, That (1) any such custodian of any securities held by 
or for such system shall agree that it will not for any reason, 
including the assertion of any claim, right or lien of any kind, refuse 
or refrain from promptly delivering any such securities (other than 
securities then hypothecated in accordance with such system) to such 
clearing corporation or other subsidiary organization or as directed by 
it, except that nothing in such agreement shall be deemed to require the 
custodian to deliver any securities in contravention of any notice of 
levy, seizure or similar notice, or order or judgment, issued or 
directed by a governmental agency or court, or officer thereof, having 
jurisdiction over such custodian, which on its face affects such 
securities; (2) such systems shall have safeguards in the handling, 
transfer and delivery of securities and provisions for fidelity bond 
coverage of the employees and agents of the clearing corporation or 
other subsidiary organization and for periodic examinations by 
independent public accountants; and (3) the provisions of this paragraph 
(g) shall not be effective with respect to any particular system unless 
the agreement required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section and the 
safeguards and provisions required by paragraph (g)(2) of this section 
shall have been deemed adequate by the Commission for the protection of 
investors, and unless any subsequent amendments to such agreement, 
safeguards or provisions shall have been deemed adequate by the 
Commission for the protection of investors.

other remuneration received and to be received in connection with the 
entire transaction including the loan arrangment, by the broker or 
dealer, by any person controlling, controlled by, or under common 
control with the broker or dealer, and by any other person participating

purpose of purchasing or carrying the security offered or sold: 
Provided, however, That notwithstanding this paragraph, the provisions 
of paragraph (a) shall apply in full force with respect to any 
transaction involving the extension of or arrangement for credit by a 
broker or dealer (i) in a special insurance premium funding account 
within the meaning of section 4(k) of Regulation T (12 CFR 220.4(k)) or 
(ii) in compliance with the terms of Sec. 240.3a12-5 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 240.15c2-7  Identification of quotations.

    (a) It shall constitute an attempt to induce the purchase or sale of 
a security by making a ``fictitious quotation'' within the meaning of 
section 15(c)(2) of the Act, for any broker or dealer to furnish or 
submit, directly or indirectly, any quotation for a security (other than 
a municipal security) to an inter-dealer quotation system unless:
    (1) The inter-dealer-quotation-system is informed, if such is the 
case, that

[[Page 253]]

the quotation is furnished or submitted;
    (i) By a correspondent broker or dealer for the account or in behalf 
of another broker or dealer, and if so, the identity of such other 
broker or dealer; and/or
    (ii) In furtherance of one or more other arrangements (including a 
joint account, guarantee of profit, guarantee against loss, commission, 
markup, markdown, indication of interest and accommodation arrangement) 
between or among brokers or dealers, and if so, the identity of each 
broker or dealer participating in any such arrangement or arrangements: 
Provided, however, That the provisions of this subparagraph shall not 
apply if only one of the brokers or dealers participating in any such 
arrangment or arrangements furnishes or submits a quotation with respect 
to the security to an inter-dealer-quotation-system.
    (2) The inter-dealer-quotation-system to which the quotation is 
furnished or submitted makes it a general practice to disclose with each 
published quotation, by appropriate symbol or otherwise, the category or 
categories (paragraph (a)(1)(i) and/or (ii) of this section) in 
furtherance of which the quotation is submitted, and the identities of 
all other brokers and dealers referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section where such information is supplied to the inter-dealer-
quotation-system under the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section.
    (b) It shall constitute an attempt to induce the purchase or sale of 
a security by making a ``fictitious quotation,'' within the meaning of 
section 15(c)(2) of the Act, for a broker or dealer to enter into any 
correspondent or other arrangement (including a joint account, guarantee 
of profit, guarantee against loss, commission, markup, markdown, 
indication of interest and accommodation arrangement) in furtherance of 
which two or more brokers or dealers furnish or submit quotations with 
respect to a particular security unless such broker or dealer informs 
all brokers or dealers furnishing or submitting such quotations of the 
existence of such correspondent and other arrangments, and the identity 
of the parties thereto.
    (c) For purposes of this section:
    (1) The term inter-dealer-quotation-system shall mean any system of 
general circulation to brokers and dealers which regularly disseminates 
quotations of identified brokers or dealers but shall not include a 
quotation sheet prepared and distributed by a broker or dealer in the 
regular course of his business and containing only quotations of such 
broker or dealer.
    (2) The term quotation shall mean any bid or offer, or any 
indication of interest (such as OW or BW) in any bid or offer.
    (3) The term correspondent shall mean a broker or dealer who has a 
direct line of communication to another broker or dealer located in a 
different city or geographic area.

13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, unless such 
issuer has been exempted from the requirement to file reports thereunder 
pursuant to section 12(h) of the Act, such broker or dealer shall 
deliver a copy of the preliminary prospectus to any person who is 
expected to receive a confirmation of sale at least 48 hours prior to 
the sending of such confirmation.
    (c) Such broker or dealer shall take reasonable steps to furnish to 
any person who makes written request for a

prior to the effective date of the registration statement to which such 
prospectus relates, a copy of the latest preliminary prospectus on file 
with the Commission. Reasonable steps shall include receiving an 
undertaking by the managing underwriter or underwriters to send such 
copy to the address given in the requests.
    (d) Such broker or dealer shall take reasonable steps to comply 
promptly with the written request of any person for a copy of the final 
prospectus relating to such securities during the period between the 
effective date of the registration statement and the later of either the 
termination of such distribution, or the expiration of the applicable 
40- or 90-day period under section 4(3) of the Securities Act of 1933. 
Reasonable steps shall include receiving an undertaking by the managing 
underwriter or underwriters to send such copy to the address given in

available a copy of the final prospectus relating to such securities to

making of any such solicitation by such associated persons, unless a 
preliminary prospectus which is substantially the same as the final 
prospectus except for matters relating to the price of the stocks, has 
been so made available.
    (g) If the broker or dealer is a managing underwriter of such 
distribution, he shall take reasonable steps to see to it that all other 
brokers or dealers participating in such distribution are promptly 
furnished with sufficient copies, as requested by them, of each 
preliminary prospectus, each amended preliminary prospectus and the 
final prospectus to enable them to comply with paragraphs (b), (c), (d), 
and (e) of this section.
    (h) If the broker or dealer is a managing underwriter of such 
distribution, he shall take reasonable steps to see that any broker or 
dealer participating in the distribution or trading in the registered 
security is furnished reasonable quantities of the final prospectus 
relating to such securities, as requested by him, in order to enable him 
to comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of section 5(b) (1) 
and (2) of the Securities Act of 1933.
    (i) This section shall not require the furnishing of prospectuses in 
any state where such furnishing would be unlawful under the laws of such 
state: Provided, however, That this provision is not to be construed to 
relieve a broker or dealer from complying with the requirements of 
section 5(b)(1) and (2) of the Securities Act of 1933.
    (j) For purposes of this section, the term preliminary prospectus 
shall include the term prospectus subject to completion as used in 17 
CFR 230.434(a), and the term final prospectus shall include the term

Release No. 29094 (April 17, 1991), for a discussion of procedures for 
gathering and reviewing the information required by this rule and the 
requirement that a broker or dealer have a reasonable basis for 
believing that the information is accurate and obtained from reliable

publication, in any quotation medium (as defined in this section) unless 
such broker or dealer has in its records the documents and information 
required by this paragraph (for purposes of this section, ``paragraph 
(a) information''), and, based upon a review of the paragraph (a) 
information together with any other documents and information required 
by paragraph (b) of this section, has a reasonable basis under the

accurate in all material respects, and that the sources of the paragraph 
(a) information are reliable. The information required pursuant to this 
paragraph is:
    (1) A copy of the prospectus specified by section 10(a) of the 
Securities Act of 1933 for an issuer that has filed a registration 
statement under the Securities Act of 1933, other than a registration 
statement on Form F-6, which became effective less than 90 calendar days 
prior to the day on which such broker or dealer publishes or submits the 
quotation to the quotation medium, Provided That such registration 
statement has not thereafter been the subject of a stop order which is 
still in effect when the quotation is published or submitted; or
    (2) A copy of the offering circular provided for under Regulation A 
under the Securities Act of 1933 for an issuer that has filed a 
notification under Regulation A and was authorized to commence the 
offering less than 40 calendar days prior to the day on which such 
broker or dealer publishes or submits the quotation to the quotation 
medium, Provided That the offering circular provided for under 
Regulation A has not thereafter become the subject of a suspension order 
which is still in effect when the quotation is published or submitted; 
or

to section 13 or 15(d) of the Act or a copy of the annual statement 
referred to in section 12(g)(2)(G)(i) of the Act, in the case of an 
issuer required to file reports pursuant to section 13 or 15(d) of the 
Act or an issuer of a security covered by section 12(g)(2)(B) or (G) of 
the Act, together with any quarterly and current reports that have been 
filed under the provisions of the Act by the issuer after such annual 
report or annual statement; Provided, however, That until such issuer 
has filed its first annual report pursuant to section 13 or 15(d) of the 
Act or annual statement referred to in section 12(g)(2)(G)(i) of the 
Act, the broker or dealer has in its records a copy of the prospectus 
specified by section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 included in a

1933, other than a registration statement on Form F-6, that became 
effective within the prior 16 months, or a copy of any registration 
statement filed by the issuer under section 12 of the Act that became 
effective within the prior 16 months, together with any quarterly and 
current reports filed thereafter under section 13 or 15(d) of the Act; 
and Provided further, That the broker or dealer has a reasonable basis 
under the circumstances for believing that the issuer is current in 
filing annual, quarterly, and current reports filed pursuant to section 
13 or 15(d) of the Act, or, in the case of an insurance company exempted 
from section 12(g) of the Act by reason of section 12(g)(2)(G) thereof, 
the annual statement referred to in section 12(g)(2)(G)(i) of the Act; 
or
    (4) The information furnished to the Commission pursuant to 
Sec. 240.12g3-2(b) since the beginning of the issuer's last fiscal year, 
in the case of an issuer exempt from section 12(g) of the Act by reason 
of compliance with the provisions of Sec. 240.12g3-2(b), which 
information the broker or dealer shall make reasonably available upon 
request to any person expressing an interest in a proposed transaction 
in the security with such broker or dealer; or
    (5) The following information, which shall be reasonably current in 
relation to the day the quotation is submitted and which the broker or

percent of the outstanding units or shares of any equity security of the 
issuer, and, if so, the name of such person, and the basis for any 
exemption under the federal securities laws for any sales of such 
securities on behalf of such person.
If such information is made available to others upon request pursuant to 
this paragraph, such delivery, unless otherwise represented, shall not 
constitute a representation by such broker or dealer that such 
information is accurate, but shall constitute a representation by such 
broker or dealer that the information is reasonably current in relation 
to the day the quotation is submitted, that the broker or dealer has a 
reasonable basis under the circumstances for believing the information 
is accurate in all material respects, and that the information was

(a)(3) of this section is not reasonably available to the broker or 
dealer. A report or statement of an issuer described in paragraph (a)(3)

suspension order; and
    (3) A copy or a written record of any other material information 
(including adverse information) regarding the issuer which comes to the 
broker's or dealer's knowledge or possession before the publication or 
submission of the quotation.
    (c) The broker or dealer shall preserve the documents and 
information required under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for a 
period of not less than three years, the first two years in an easily 
accessible place.

this section.
    (2) For any security of an issuer included in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section,
    (i) a broker-dealer shall be in compliance with the requirement to

submission of the paragraph (a) information pursuant to Schedule H of 
the By-Laws of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; and
    (ii) a broker-dealer shall be in compliance with the requirement to 
obtain the annual, quarterly, and current reports filed by the issuer, 
if the broker-dealer has made arrangements to receive all such reports 
when filed by the issuer and it has regularly received reports from the 
issuer on a timely basis, unless the broker-dealer has a reasonable 
basis under the circumstances for believing that the issuer has failed 
to file a required report or has filed a report but has not sent it to 
the broker-dealer.
    (e) For purposes of this section:
    (1) Quotation medium shall mean any ``interdealer quotation system'' 
or any publication or electronic communications network or other device 
which is used by brokers or dealers to make known to others their 
interest in transactions in any security, including offers to buy or 
sell at a stated price or otherwise, or invitations of offers to buy or 
sell.
    (2) Interdealer quotation system shall mean any system of general

behalf of a customer (other than a person acting as or for a dealer), of 
a quotation that represents the customer's indication of interest and 
does not involve the solicitation of the customer's interest; Provided, 
however, That this paragraph (f)(2) shall not apply to a quotation 
consisting of both a bid and an offer, each of which is at a specified 
price, unless the quotation medium specifically identifies the quotation 
as representing such an unsolicited customer interest.
    (3)(i) The publication or submission, in an interdealer quotation 
system that specifically identifies as such unsolicited customer 
indications of interest of the kind described in paragraph (f)(2) of 
this section, of a quotation respecting a security which has been the 
subject of quotations (exclusive of any identified customer interests) 
in such a system on each of at least 12 days within the previous 30 
calendar days, with no more than 4 business days in succession without a 
quotation; or
    (ii) The publication or submission, in an interdealer quotation 
system that does not so identify any such unsolicited customer 
indications of interest,

bid and ask quotations in an interdealer quotation system at specified 
prices on each of at least 12 days within the previous 30 calendar days, 
with no more than 4 business days in succession without such a two-way 
quotation;

section 3(a)(38) of the Act, that has published or submitted a quotation 
respecting a security in an interdealer quotation system and such 
quotation has qualified for an exception provided in this paragraph 
(f)(3), may continue to publish or submit quotations for such security 
in the interdealer quotation system without compliance with this section 
unless and until such dealer ceases to submit or publish a quotation or 
ceases to act in the capacity of market maker respecting such security.

municipal security.

    (g) The requirement in paragraph (a)(5) of this section that the 
information with respect to the issuer be ``reasonably current'' will be 
presumed to be satisfied, unless the broker or dealer has information to 
the contrary, if:
    (1) The balance sheet is as of a date less than 16 months before the 
publication or submission of the quotation, the statements of profit and 
loss and retained earnings are for the 12 months preceding the date of

terms and conditions, as not constituting a fraudulent, manipulative or 
deceptive practice comprehended within the purpose of this section.

Underwriter'' when used in connection with an Offering) to act as an 
underwriter in a primary offering of municipal securities with an 
aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or more (an ``Offering'') 
unless the Participating Underwriter complies with the requirements of

    (b) Requirements. (1) Prior to the time the Participating 
Underwriter bids for, purchases, offers, or sells municipal securities 
in an Offering, the Participating Underwriter shall obtain and review an

delivery dates, any other

[[Page 259]]

terms or provisions required by an issuer of such securities to be 
specified in a competitive bid, ratings, other terms of the securities 
depending on such matters, and the identity of the underwriter(s).
    (2) Except in competitively bid offerings, from the time the 
Participating Underwriter has reached an understanding with an issuer of 
municipal securities that it will become a Participating Underwriter in 
an Offering until a final official statement is available, the 
Participating Underwriter shall send no later than the next business 
day, by first-class mail or other equally prompt means, to any potential 
customer, on request, a single copy of the most recent preliminary 
official statement, if any.
    (3) The Participating Underwriter shall contract with an issuer of

accounts of a broker or dealer, including securities that are collateral

that have a market value of more than 10 percent of the ``net capital'' 
of a broker or dealer before the application of paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of 
this section or Appendix A, Sec. 240.15c3-1a, there shall be an 
additional deduction from net worth and/or the Collateral Value for 
securities collateralizing a secured demand note defined in Appendix D, 
Sec. 240.15c3-1d, equal to 50 percent of the percentage deduction 
otherwise provided by this paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section or 
Appendix A, Sec. 240.15c3-1a, on that portion of the securities position 
in excess of 10 percent of the ``net capital'' of the broker or dealer 
before the application of paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section and 
Appendix A, Sec. 240.15c3-1a. In the case of securities described in 
paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(J), the additional deduction required by this 
paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(M) shall be 15 percent.
    (2) This paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(M) shall apply notwithstanding any 
long or short position exemption provided for in paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(J)

out of the first proviso to paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(J)) and the deduction 
on any such exempted position shall be 15 percent of that portion of the 
securities position in excess of 10 percent of the broker or dealer's 
net capital before the application of paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this 
section and Appendix A, Sec. 240.15c3-1a.
    (3) This paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(M) shall be applied to an issue of

have a market value in excess of $500,000 in bonds ($5,000,000 in notes) 
or 10 percent of tentative net capital, whichever is greater, and are 
held in position longer than 20 business days from the date the 
securities are received by the syndicate manager from the issuer.
    (5) Any specialist that is subject to a deduction required by this 
paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(M), respecting its specialty stock, that can 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Examining Authority for such 
broker or dealer that there is sufficient liquidity for such 
specialist's specialty stock and that such deduction need not be applied 
in the public interest for the protection of investors, may upon a 
proper showing to such Examining Authority have such undue concentration 
deduction appropriately decreased, but in no case shall the deduction 
prescribed in paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(J) of this section above be reduced. 
Each such Examining Authority shall make and preserve for a period of 
not less than 3 years a record of each application granted pursuant to 
this paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(M)(5), which shall contain a summary of the 
justification for the granting of the application.

securities exchange, and that is not a clearing member of The Options

securities, set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section or 
Appendix A to this section, except for paragraph (e) of this section 
limiting withdrawals of equity capital and Appendix D to this section 
relating to satisfactory subordination agreements. As to a specialist 
that is solely an options specialist, in paragraph (e) the term ``net 
capital'' shall be deemed to mean ``net capital before the application 
of paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section or Appendix A to this section'' 
and ``excess net capital'' shall be deemed to be the amount of net 
capital before the application of paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section 
or Appendix A to this section in excess of the amount of net capital 
required under paragraph (a) of this section. In reports filed pursuant

the proprietary or other accounts of the broker or dealer, for which 
there is no ready market, as defined in paragraph (c)(11) of this 
section, and securities, in the proprietary or other accounts of the 
broker or dealer, which cannot be publicly offered or sold because of 
statutory, regulatory or contractual arrangements or other restrictions.

                      Open Contractual Commitments

    (viii) Deducting, in the case of a broker or dealer that has open 
contractual commitments (other than those option positions subject to 
Appendix A, Sec. 240.15c3-1a), the respective deductions as specified in 
paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section or Appendix B, Sec. 240.15c3-1b, 
from the value (which shall be the market value whenever there is a 
market) of each net long and each net short position contemplated by any 
open contractual commitment in the proprietary or other accounts of the 
broker or dealer.
    (A) The deduction for contractual commitments in those securities 
that are treated in paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(J) of this section shall be 30 
percent unless the class and issue of the securities subject to the open 
contractual commitment deduction are listed for trading on a national 
securities exchange or are designated as NASDAQ National Market System 
Securities.
    (B) A broker or dealer that maintains in excess of $250,000 of net 
capital may add back to net worth up to $150,000 of any deduction 
computed under this paragraph (c)(2)(viii)(B).
    (C) The deduction with respect to any single commitment shall be 
reduced by the unrealized profit in such commitment, in an amount not 
greater than the deduction provided for by this paragraph (or increased 
by the unrealized loss), in such commitment, and in no event shall an 
unrealized profit on any closed transactions operate to increase net 
capital.
    (ix) Deducting from the contract value of each failed to deliver 
contract that is outstanding five business days or longer (21 business 
days or longer in the case of municipal securities) the percentages of 
the market value of the underlying security that would be required by 
application of the deduction required by paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this 
section. Such deduction, however, shall be increased by any excess of 
the contract price of the failed to deliver contract over the market 
value of the underlying security or reduced by any excess of the market 
value of the underlying security over the contract value of the failed 
to deliver contract, but not to exceed the amount of such deduction. The 
designated examining authority for the broker or dealer may, upon 
application of the broker or dealer, extend for a period up to 5 
business days, any period herein specified when it is satisfied that the 
extension is warranted. The designated examining authority upon 
expiration of the extension may extend for one additional period of up 
to 5 business days, any period herein specified when it is satisfied 
that the extension is warranted.

   Brokers or Dealers Carrying Accounts of Listed Options Specialists

    (x)(A) With respect to any transaction of a specialist in listed 
options, who is either not otherwise subject to the provisions of this 
section or is described in paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(N) of this section, for 
whose specialist account a broker or dealer acts as a guarantor, 
endorser, or carrying broker or dealer, such broker or dealer shall 
adjust its net worth by deducting as of noon of each business day the 
amounts computed as of the prior business day pursuant to Sec. 240.15c3-
1a. The required deductions may be reduced by any liquidating equity 
that exists in such specialist's market-maker account as of that time 
and shall be increased to the extent of any liquidating deficit in such 
account. Noon shall be determined according to the local time where the 
broker or dealer is headquartered. In no event shall excess equity in 
the specialist's market-maker account result in an increase of the net 
capital of any such guarantor, endorser, or carrying broker or dealer.
    (B) Definitions. (1) The term listed option shall mean any option 
traded on a registered national securities exchange or automated 
facility of a registered national securities association.
    (2) For purposes of this section, the equity in an individual 
specialist's market-maker account shall be computed by:
    (i) Marking all securities positions long or short in the account to 
their respective current market values;
    (ii) Adding (deducting in the case of a debit balance) the credit 
balance carried in such specialist's market-maker account; and
    (iii) Adding (deducting in the case of short positions) the market 
value of positions long in such account.
    (C) No guarantor, endorser, or carrying broker or dealer shall 
permit the sum of the deductions required pursuant to Sec. 240.15c3-1a 
in respect of all transactions in specialists' market-maker accounts 
guaranteed, endorsed, or carried by such broker or dealer to exceed 
1,000 percent of such broker's or dealer's net capital as defined in 
Sec. 240.15c3-1(c)(2) for any period exceeding three business days. If 
at any time such sum exceeds 1,000 percent of such broker's or dealer's 
net capital, then the broker or dealer shall:
    (1) Immediately transmit telegraphic or facsimile notice of such 
event to the Division of Market Regulation in the headquarters office of 
the Commission in Washington, D.C., to the district or regional office 
of the Commission for the district or region in which the broker or 
dealer maintains its principal place of business, and to its examining 
authority designated pursuant to section 17(d) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 
78q(d)) (``Designated Examining Authority''); and
    (2) Be subject to the prohibitions against withdrawal of equity 
capital set forth in Sec. 240.15c3-1(e) and to the prohibitions against 
reduction, prepayment, and repayment of subordination agreements set 
forth in paragraph (b)(11) of Sec. 240.15c3-1d, as if such broker or 
dealer's net capital were below the minimum standards specified by each 
of those paragraphs.
    (D) If at any time there is a liquidating deficit in a specialist's 
market-maker account, then the broker or dealer guaranteeing, endorsing, 
or carrying listed options transactions in such specialist's market-
maker account may not extend any further credit in that account, and 
shall take steps to liquidate promptly existing positions in the 
account. This paragraph shall not prevent the broker or dealer from, 
upon approval by the broker's or dealer's Designated Examining 
Authority, entering into hedging positions in the specialist's market-
maker account. The broker or dealer also shall transmit telegraphic or 
facsimile notice of the deficit and its amount by the close of business 
of the following business day to its Designated Examining Authority and 
the Designated Examining Authority of the specialist, if different from 
its own.
    (E) Upon written application to the Commission by the specialist and 
the broker or dealer guaranteeing, endorsing, or carrying options 
transactions in such specialist's market-maker account, the Commission 
may approve upon specified terms and conditions lesser adjustments to 
net worth than those specified in Sec. 240.15c3-1a.
    (xi) Brokers or Dealers Carrying Specialists or Market Makers 
Accounts. With

[[Page 280]]

respect to a broker or dealer who carries a market maker or specialist 
account, or with respect to any transaction in options listed on a 
registered national securities exchange for which a broker or dealer 
acts as a guarantor or endorser of options written by a specialist in a

carried or for each class or series of options guaranteed or endorsed, 
any deficiency in collateral required by paragraph (a)(6) of this 
section.
    (xii) Deduction from net worth for certain undermargined accounts. 
Deducting the amount of cash required in each customer's or non-
customer's account to meet the maintenance margin requirements of the 
Examining Authority for the broker or dealer, after application of calls 
for margin, marks to the market or other required deposits which are 
outstanding 5 business days or less.
    (xiii) Deduction from net worth for indebtedness collateralized by 
exempted securities. Deducting, at the option of the broker or dealer, 
in lieu of including such amounts in aggregate indebtedness, 4 percent 
of the amount of any indebtedness secured by exempted securities or 
municipal securities if such indebtedness would otherwise be includable 
in aggregate indebtedness.

                           Exempted Securities

    (3) The term exempted securities shall mean those securities deemed 
exempted securities by section 3(a)(12) of the Securities Exchange Act

contracts, but shall not include uncleared regular way purchases and 
sales of securities and contracts in commodities futures. A series of 
contracts of purchase or sale of the same security conditioned, if at 
all, only upon issuance may be treated as an individual commitment.

                           Adequately Secured

    (5) Indebtedness shall be deemed to be adequately secured within the 
meaning of this section when the excess of the market value of the 
collateral over the amount of the indebtedness is sufficient to make the 
loan acceptable as a fully secured loan to banks regularly making 
secured loans to brokers or dealers.

                                Customer

    (6) The term customer shall mean any person from whom, or on whose 
behalf, a broker or dealer has received, acquired or holds funds or 
securities for the account of such person, but shall not include a 
broker or dealer or a registered municipal securities dealer, or a 
general, special or limited partner or director or officer of the broker 
or dealer, or any person to the extent that such person has a claim for 
property or funds which by contract, agreement, or understanding, or by 
operation of law, is part of the capital of the broker or dealer. 
Provided, however, That the term ``customer'' shall also include a 
broker or dealer, but only insofar as such broker or dealer maintains a 
special omnibus account carried with another broker or dealer in 
compliance with 12 CFR 220.4(b) of Regulation T under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934.

                              Non-Customer

    (7) The term non-customer means a broker or dealer, registered 
municipal securities dealer, general partner, limited partner, officer,

claims of creditors of the broker or dealer.

                              Market Maker

    (8) The term market maker shall mean a dealer who, with respect to a 
particular security, (i) regularly publishes bona fide, competitive bid 
and offer quotations in a recognized interdealer quotation system; or 
(ii) furnishes bona fide competitive bid and offer quotations on 
request; and, (iii) is ready, willing and able to effect transactions in 
reasonable quantities at his quoted prices with other brokers or 
dealers.

[[Page 281]]

                      Promptly Transmit and Deliver

    (9) A broker or dealer is deemed to ``promptly transmit'' all funds 
and to ``promptly deliver'' all securities within the meaning of 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(v) of this section where such 
transmission or delivery is made no later than noon of the next business 
day after the receipt of such funds or securities; provided, however, 
that such prompt transmission or delivery shall not be required to be 
effected prior to the settlement date for such transaction.

                            Promptly Forward

    (10) A broker or dealer is deemed to ``promptly forward'' funds or 
securities within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section 
only when such forwarding occurs no later than noon of the next business 
day following receipt of such funds or securities.

                              Ready Market

    (11)(i) The term ready market shall include a recognized established 
securities market in which there exists independent bona fide offers to 
buy and sell so that a price reasonably related to the last sales price 
or current bona fide competitive bid and offer quotations can be 
determined for a particular security almost instantaneously and where 
payment will be received in settlement of a sale at such price within a 
relatively short time conforming to trade custom.
    (ii) A ready market shall also be deemed to exist where securities 
have been accepted as collateral for a loan by a bank as defined in 
section 3(a)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and where the 
broker or dealer demonstrates to its Examining Authority that such 
securities adequately secure such loans as that term is defined in 
paragraph (c)(5) of this section.

                           Examining Authority

    (12) The term Examining Authority of a broker or dealer shall mean 
for the purposes of 17 CFR 240.15c3-1 and 240.15c3-1a-d the national 
securities exchange or national securities association of which the 
broker or dealer is a member or, if the broker or dealer is a member of 
more than one such self-regulatory organization, the organization 
designated by the Commission as the Examining Authority for such broker 
or dealer, or if the broker or dealer is not a member of any such self-
regulatory organization, the Regional or District Office of the 
Commission where such broker or dealer has its principal place of 
business.

                                 Equity

    (13) [Reserved]
    (14) The term municipal securities shall mean those securities 
included within the definition of ``municipal securities'' in section 
3(a)(29) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
    (d) Debt-equity requirements. No broker or dealer shall permit the 
total of outstanding principal amounts of its satisfactory subordination 
agreements (other than such agreements which qualify under this 
paragraph (d) as equity capital) to exceed 70 percent of its debt-equity 
total, as hereinafter defined, for a period in excess of 90 days or for 
such longer period which the Commission may, upon application of the 
broker or dealer, grant in the public interest or for the protection of 
investors. In the case of a corporation, the debt-equity total shall be 
the sum of its outstanding principal amounts of satisfactory 
subordination agreements, par or stated value of capital stock, paid in 
capital in excess of par, retained earnings, unrealized profit and loss 
or other capital accounts. In the case of a partnership, the debt-equity 
total shall be the sum of its outstanding principal amounts of 
satisfactory subordination agreements, capital accounts of partners 
(exclusive of such partners' securities accounts) subject to the 
provisions of paragraph (e) of this section, and unrealized profit and 
loss. In the case of a sole proprietorship, the debt-equity total shall 
include the sum of its outstanding principal amounts of satisfactory 
subordination agreements, capital accounts of the sole proprietorship 
and unrealized profit and loss. Provided, however, That a satisfactory 
subordination agreement entered into by a partner or stockholder which 
has an initial term of at least three years and has a remaining term of 
not less than 12 months shall

[[Page 282]]

be considered equity for the purposes of this paragraph (d) if:
    (1) It does not have any of the provisions for accelerated maturity 
provided for by paragraphs (b)(9)(i), (10)(i) or (10)(ii) of Appendix 
(D) (17 CFR 240.15c3-1d) and is maintained as capital subject to the 
provisions restricting the withdrawal thereof required by paragraph (e) 
of this section or
    (2) The partnership agreement provides that capital contributed 
pursuant to a satisfactory subordination agreement as defined in 
Appendix (D) (17 CFR 240.15c3-1d) shall in all respects be partnership 
capital subject to the provisions restricting the withdrawal thereof 
required by paragraph (e) of this section.
    (e)(1) Notice provisions relating to limitations on the withdrawal 
of equity capital. No equity capital of the broker or dealer or a 
subsidiary or affiliate consolidated pursuant to appendix C (17 CFR 
240.15c3-1c) may be withdrawn by action of a stockholder or a partner or 
by redemption or repurchase of shares of stock by any of the 
consolidated entities or through the payment of dividends or any similar 
distribution, nor may any unsecured advance or loan be made to a 
stockholder, partner, sole proprietor, employee or affiliate without 
written notice given in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this 
section:
    (i) Two business days prior to any withdrawals, advances or loans if 
those withdrawals, advances or loans on a net basis exceed in the 
aggregate in any 30 calendar day period, 30 percent of the broker or 
dealer's excess net capital. A broker or dealer, in an emergency 
situation, may make withdrawals, advances or loans that on a net basis 
exceed 30 percent of the broker or dealer's excess net capital in any 30 
calendar day period without giving the advance notice required by this 
paragraph, with the prior approval of its Examining Authority. Where a 
broker or dealer makes a withdrawal with the consent of its Examining 
Authority, it shall in any event comply with paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of 
this section; or
    (ii) Two business days after any withdrawals, advances or loans if 
those withdrawals, advances or loans on a net basis exceed in the 
aggregate in any 30 calendar day period, 20 percent of the broker or 
dealer's excess net capital.
    (iii) This paragraph (e)(1) does not apply to:
    (A) Securities or commodities transactions in the ordinary course of 
business between a broker or dealer and an affiliate where the broker or 
dealer makes payment to or on behalf of such affiliate for such 
transaction and then receives payment from such affiliate for the 
securities or commodities transaction within two business days from the 
date of the transaction; or
    (B) Withdrawals, advances or loans which in the aggregate in any 
thirty calendar day period, on a net basis, equal $500,000 or less.
    (iv) Each required notice shall be effective when received by the 
Commission in Washington, DC, the regional or district office of the 
Commission for the region or district in which the broker or dealer has 
its principal place of business, the broker or dealer's Examining 
Authority and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission if such broker or 
dealer is registered with that Commission.
    (2) Limitations on Withdrawal of equity capital. No equity capital 
of the broker or dealer or a subsidiary or affiliate consolidated 
pursuant to appendix C (17 CFR 240.15c3-1c) may be withdrawn by action 
of a stockholder or a partner or by redemption or repurchase of shares 
of stock by any of the consolidated entities or through the payment of 
dividends or any similar distribution, nor may any unsecured advance or 
loan be made to a stockholder, partner, sole proprietor, employee or 
affiliate, if after giving effect thereto and to any other such 
withdrawals, advances or loans and any Payments of Payment Obligations 
(as defined in appendix D (17 CFR 240.15c3-1d)) under satisfactory 
subordination agreements which are scheduled to occur within 180 days 
following such withdrawal, advance or loan if:
    (i) The broker or dealer's net capital would be less than 120 
percent of the minimum dollar amount required by paragraph (a) of this 
section;
    (ii) The broker-dealer is registered as a futures commission 
merchant, its net capital would be less than 7 percent of

[[Page 283]]

the funds required to be segregated pursuant to the Commodity Exchange 
Act and the regulations thereunder (less the market value of commodity 
options purchased by option customers on or subject to the rules of a 
contract market, each such deduction not to exceed the amount of funds 
in the option customer's account);
    (iii) The broker-dealer's net capital would be less than 25 percent 
of deductions from net worth in computing net capital required by 
paragraphs (c)(2)(vi), (f) and appendix A, of this section, unless the 
broker or dealer has the prior approval of the Commission to make such 
withdrawal;
    (iv) The total outstanding principal amounts of satisfactory 
subordination agreements of the broker or dealer and any subsidiaries or 
affiliates consolidated pursuant to appendix C (17 CFR 240.15c3-1c) 
(other than such agreements which qualify as equity under paragraph (d) 
of this section) would exceed 70% of the debt-equity total as defined in 
paragraph (d) of this section;
    (v) The broker or dealer is subject to the aggregate indebtedness 
limitations of paragraph (a) of this section, the aggregate indebtedness 
of any of the consolidated entities exceeds 1000 percent of its net 
capital; or
    (vi) The broker or dealer is subject to the alternative net capital 
requirement of paragraph (f) of this section, its net capital would be 
less than 5 percent of aggregate debit items computed in accordance with 
17 CFR 240.15c3-3a.
    (3)(i) Temporary Restrictions on Withdrawal of Net Capital. The 
Commission may by order restrict, for a period up to twenty business 
days, any withdrawal by the broker or dealer of equity capital or 
unsecured loan or advance to a stockholder, partner, sole proprietor, 
employee or affiliate if such withdrawal, advance or loan:
    (A) When aggregated with all other withdrawals, advances or loans on 
a net basis during a 30 calendar day period exceeds 30 percent of the 
broker or dealer's excess net capital; and
    (B) The Commission, based on the facts and information available, 
concludes that the withdrawal, advance or loan may be detrimental to the 
financial integrity of the broker or dealer, or may unduly jeopardize 
the broker or dealer's ability to repay its customer claims or other 
liabilities which may cause a significant impact on the markets or 
expose the customers or creditors of the broker or dealer to loss 
without taking into account the application of the Securities Investor 
Protection Act.
    (ii) An order temporarily prohibiting the withdrawal of capital 
shall be rescinded if the Commission determines that the restriction on 
capital withdrawal should not remain in effect. The hearing will be held 
within two business days from the date of the request in writing by the 
broker or dealer.
    (4)(i) Miscellaneous provisions. Excess net capital is that amount 
in excess of the amount required under paragraph (a) of this section. 
For the purposes of paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section, a 
broker or dealer may use the amount of excess net capital and deductions 
required under paragraphs (c)(2)(vi), (f) and appendix A of this section 
reported in its most recently required filed Form X-17A-5 for the 
purposes of calculating the effect of a projected withdrawal, advance or 
loan relative to excess net capital or deductions. The broker or dealer 
must assure itself that the excess net capital or the deductions 
reported on the most recently required filed Form X-17A-5 have not 
materially changed since the time such report was filed.
    (ii) The term equity capital includes capital contributions by 
partners, par or stated value of capital stock, paid-in capital in 
excess of par, retained earnings or other capital accounts. The term 
equity capital does not include securities in the securities accounts of 
partners and balances in limited partners' capital accounts in excess of 
their stated capital contributions.
    (iii) Paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section shall not 
preclude a broker or dealer from making required tax payments or 
preclude the payment to partners of reasonable compensation, and such 
payments shall not be included in the calculation of withdrawals, 
advances, or loans for purposes of paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this 
section.

[[Page 284]]

    (iv) For the purpose of this paragraph (e) of this section, any 
transaction between a broker or dealer and a stockholder, partner, sole 
proprietor, employee or affiliate that results in a diminution of the 
broker or dealer's net capital shall be deemed to be an advance or loan 
of net capital.

    (x) Brokers or Dealers Carrying Accounts of Options Specialists. (A) 
With respect to any transaction in options listed on a registered 
national securities exchange or a facility of a registered national 
securities association for which a broker or dealer acts as a guarantor, 
endorser or carrying broker or dealer for options purchased or written 
by a specialist that is either not otherwise subject to the provisions 
of this section or is described in paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(N) of this 
section, such broker or dealer shall adjust its net worth by deducting, 
for each class of option contracts in which each such specialist is a 
market maker, an amount equal to 50 percent of the market value of each 
option contract in a long position and 75 percent of the market value of 
each contract in a short position; provided, however, that:
    (1) For the purpose of the above deductions, each option contract in 
a short position shall be deemed to have a market value of not less than 
$100.
    (2) In the case of a bona fide hedged position as defined in this 
paragraph (c)(2)(x)(C) involving a long position in a security, other 
than an option, and a short position in a call option, the deduction 
shall be 15 percent (or such other percentage required by paragraphs 
(c)(2)(vi) (A) through (K) of this section) of the market value of the 
long position reduced by any excess of the market value of the long 
position over the exercise value of the short option position. In no 
event shall such reduction operate to increase net capital.
    (3) In the case of a bona fide hedged position as defined in this 
paragraph (c)(2)(x)(C) involving a short position in a security, other 
than an option, and a long position in a call option, the deduction 
shall be the lesser of 15 percent of the market value of the short 
position or the amount by which the exercise value of the long option 
position exceeds the market value of the short position; however, if the 
exercise value of the long option position does not exceed the market 
value of the short position, no deduction shall be applied.
    (4) In the case of a bona fide hedged position as defined in this 
paragraph (c)(2)(x)(C) involving a short position in a security other 
than an option, and a short position in a put option, the deduction 
shall be 15 percent (or such other percentage required by paragraphs 
(c)(2)(vi) (A) through (K) of this section) of the market value of the 
short security position reduced by any excess of the exercise value of 
the short option position over the market value of the short security 
position. No such reduction shall operate to increase net capital.
    (5) In the case of a bona fide hedged position as defined in this 
paragraph (c)(2)(x)(C) involving a long position in a security, other 
than an option, and a long position in a put option, the deduction shall 
be the lesser of 15 percent of the market value of such long security 
position or the amount by which the market value of such long security 
position exceeds the exercise value of the long option position. If the 
market value of the long security position does not exceed the exercise 
value of the long option position, no deduction shall be applied.
    (6) In the case of a bona fide spread position as defined in this 
paragraph (c)(2)(x) in which the market value of the long position 
exceeds the market value of the short position, the deduction shall be 
50 percent of the greater of the difference between the market values of 
such long and short positions or $50 for each option contract included 
in the long position as part of such spread position; Provided, That 
such endorser, guarantor or carrying broker or dealer need not deduct 
more in respect of any such spread position in a particular underlying 
security and in respect of option contracts for the same underlying 
security which are carried in a pure short position in such specialist's 
market maker account than the greater of the deduction required by this 
paragraph (6) in respect of the spread position or the deduction 
required by paragraphs (A) and (A)(1) of this paragraph (c)(2)(x) in 
respect of the pure short position.
    (7) In the case of a bona fide spread position as defined in this 
paragraph (c)(2)(x) in which the market value of the short position

[[Page 286]]

equals or exceeds the market value of the long position, the deduction 
shall be 75 percent of the greater of the difference between the market 
values of such short and long positons or $50 for each option contract 
included in the long position as part of such spread position; provided, 
that if the option contracts in the short position expire no later than 
the option contracts in the long position, such deduction need not 
exceed the greater of 75 percent of $50 per long contract, or the amount 
by which the difference between the market values of the short and long 
positions is less than the amount by which the exercise value of the 
long position exceeds the exercise value of the short position; and 
Provided further, That such endorser, guarantor or carrying broker or 
dealer need not deduct more in respect of any such spread position in a 
particular underlying security and in respect of option contracts for 
the same underlying security which are carried in a pure long position 
in such specialist's market maker account than the greater of the 
deduction required by this paragraph (7) in respect of the spread 
position or the deduction required by paragraph (A) of this paragraph 
(c)(2)(x) in respect of the pure long position.
    (8) In the case of a bona-fide straddle position as defined in this 
paragraph (c)(2)(x), the deduction shall be the greater of the 
deductions which this paragraph (c)(2)(x) would require in respect of 
the call option position and the put option if both positions were pure 
long (or short) positions.
    (9) In the case of positions in securities which are not part of a 
bona fide hedged spread or straddle position as defined in this 
paragraph (c)(2)(x) and, in the case of options, which are not listed on 
the national securities exchange of a national securities association of 
which such specialist is a member, the deduction shall be that set forth 
in paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section, or, if such securities are 
options, the deduction shall be that set forth in Appendix A (17 CFR 
240.15c3-1a) to this section.
    (B) The deduction computed for each specialist's positions pursuant 
to paragraph (A) of this paragraph (c)(2)(x) shall be reduced by any 
liquidating equity, as defined in this paragraph (c)(2)(x), that exists 
in such specialist's market maker account with the broker or dealer, and 
shall be increased to the extent of any liquidating deficit in such 
account. Provided, that in no event shall this provision result in 
increasing the net capital of any such guarantor, endorser, or carrying 
broker or dealer.
    (1) No such guarantor, endorser or carrying broker or dealer shall 
permit the sum of (i) the deductions required by paragraph (A) of this 
paragraph (c)(2)(x) in respect of all transactions in specialists' 
market maker accounts guaranteed, endorsed or carried by such broker or 
dealer and (ii) the equity required by paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this 
section in respect of all transactions in the accounts of specialists or 
market makers in options carried by such broker or dealer pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(6) of this section to exceed 1000 percent of such broker's 
or dealer's net capital as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section 
for any period exceeding five business days; Provided, That solely for 
purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(x)(B)(1), the deductions or equity 
required in a specialist's or market maker's account in respect of 
positions in fully paid securities (other than options), which do not 
underlie options listed on the national securities exchange or facility 
of a national securities association of which such specialist or market 
maker is a member, need not be recognized; Provided further, That if at 
any time such sum exceeds 1000 percent of such broker's or dealer's net 
capital, then the broker or dealer shall immediately transmit 
telegraphic notice of such event to the principal office of the 
Commission in Washington, DC, the regional or district office of the 
Commission for the region or district in which the broker or dealer 
maintains its principal place of business, and such broker's or dealer's 
Designated Examining Authority; Provided further, That if at any time 
such sum exceeds 1000 percent of such broker's or dealer's net capital, 
then such broker or dealer shall be subject to the prohibitions against 
withdrawal of equity capital set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, 
and to the prohibitions against reduction, prepayment and repayment of 
subordination agreements set forth in paragraph (b)(11) of this 
Sec. 240.15c3-1d, as if such broker or dealer's net capital were below 
the minimum standards specified by each of the aforementioned 
paragraphs.
    (2) For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(x), equity in each such 
specialist's market marker account shall be computed by (i) marking all 
securities positions long or short in the account to their respective 
current market values, (ii) adding (deducting in the case of a debit 
balance) the credit balance carried in such specialist's market maker 
account, and (iii) adding (deducting in the case of short positions) the 
market value of positions long in such account.
    (C) For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(x), a bona fide hedged 
position shall mean either (1) a long position in a security other than 
an option (an ``underlying security''), or in a security which is 
currently exchangeable for or convertible into the underlying security 
if the conversion or exchange does not require the payment of money, 
which is offset by a short call option position or a long put option 
position for the same number of units of the same underlying security, 
or (2) a short position in an underlying security which is offset by a 
long call position or a short put position for the same number of units 
of the same underlying security.

[[Page 287]]

    (D)(1) For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(x), a bona fide spread 
position shall mean long and short positions in the same type (that is, 
put or call) of option contracts for the same number of units of the 
same underlying security.
    (2) For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(x), a bona-fide straddle 
position shall mean long put and long call (or short put and short call) 
positions for the same number of units of the same underlying security.
    (E) For purposes of applying the deductions required by paragraph 
(A) of this paragraph (c)(2)(x) in respect of positions in each such 
specialist's market maker account, long and short positions in each such 
account shall be allocated in the following sequence:
    (1) Bona fide hedged positions as defined in paragraph (C) of this 
paragraph (c)(2)(x) shall be constituted by first matching long or short 
positions in securities, other than options, against offsetting long or 
short call options positions taken in order of increasing exercise value 
and any remaining long or short positions in securities, other than 
options, against offsetting long or short put options positions taken in 
order of decreasing exercise values; provided, that in the case of long 
(or short) options of equal exercise value, the option possessing the 
greatest time to expiration shall be matched first.
    (2) Thereafter, bona fide spread positions as defined in paragraph 
(D) of this paragraph (c)(2)(x) shall be constituted by matching long 
options taken in order of increasing exercise values (decreasing 
exercise values in the case of puts) against offsetting short options 
taken in order of increasing exercise values (decreasing exercise values 
in the case of puts); provided, that in the case of long (or short) 
options of equal exercise value, the option possessing the greatest time 
to expiration shall be matched first.
    (3) Thereafter, bona-fide straddle positions as defined in paragraph 
(D) of this paragraph (c)(2)(x) shall be constituted by matching long 
(or short) call options taken in order of increasing exercise values 
against offsetting long (or short) put options taken in order of 
decreasing exercise values; provided, that in the case of long (or 
short) call (or put) options of equal exercise value, the option 
possessing the greatest time to expiration shall be matched first.
    (4) Thereafter, long or short positions not allocated pursuant to 
paragraphs (1), (2) or (3) of this section shall be treated in the 
manner prescribed by paragraphs (A), (A)(1) or (A)(9) of this paragraph 
(c)(2)(x).
    (F) If at any time the deductions required in respect of any such 
specialist's market maker account pursuant to paragraph (A) of this 
paragraph (c)(2)(x) exceed the equity in the account computed pursuant 
to paragraph (B)(2) of this paragraph (c)(2)(x), then the broker or 
dealer guaranteeing, endorsing, or carrying options transactions in such 
account:
    (1) Shall not extend further credit in the account, and
    (2) Shall issue a call for additional equity which shall be met by 
noon of the following business day, and
    (3) Shall notify by telegraph the principal office of the Commission 
in Washington, DC, the regional or district office of the Commission for 
the region or district in which the broker or dealer maintains its 
principal place of business, and the Designated Examining Authorities of 
the specialist and the broker or dealer if the specialist fails to 
deposit any required equity within the time prescribed in (2) above; 
said telegraphic notice shall be received by the Commission's 
Washington, DC office, the Commission's regional or district office, and 
the Designated Examining Authorities not later than the close of 
business on the day said call is not met.
    (G) If at any time a liquidating deficit exists in any such 
specialist's market maker account, then the broker or dealer 
guaranteeing, endorsing or carrying options transactions in such account 
shall take steps to liquidate promptly existing positions in the 
account.
    (H) Upon written application to the Commission by the specialist and 
the broker or dealer guaranteeing, endorsing, or carrying options 
transactions in such specialist's market maker account, the Commission 
may approve upon specified terms and conditions lesser adjustments to 
net worth than those specified by paragraph (A) of this paragraph 
(c)(2)(x).

<R05>
Sec. 240.15c3-1a  Options (Appendix A to 17 CFR 240.15c3-1).

    (a) Definitions. (1) The term unlisted option shall mean any option 
not included in the definition of listed option provided in paragraph 
(c)(2)(x) of Sec. 240.15c3-1.
    (2) The term option series refers to listed option contracts of the 
same type (either a call or a put) and exercise style, covering the same 
underlying security with the same exercise price, expiration date, and 
number of underlying units.
    (3) The term related instrument within an option class or product 
group refers to futures contracts and options on futures contracts 
covering the same underlying instrument. In relation to options on 
foreign currencies a related instrument within an option class also

[[Page 288]]

shall include forward contracts on the same underlying currency.
    (4) The term underlying instrument refers to long and short 
positions, as appropriate, covering the same foreign currency, the same 
security, or a security which is exchangeable for or convertible into 
the underlying security within a period of 90 days. If the exchange or 
conversion requires the payment of money or results in a loss upon 
conversion at the time when the security is deemed an underlying 
instrument for purposes of this Appendix A, the broker or dealer will 
deduct from net worth the full amount of the conversion loss. The term 
underlying instrument shall not be deemed to include securities options, 
futures contracts, options on futures contracts, qualified stock 
baskets, or unlisted instruments.
    (5) The term options class refers to all options contracts covering 
the same underlying instrument.
    (6) The term product group refers to two or more option classes, 
related instruments, underlying instruments, and qualified stock baskets 
in the same portfolio type (see paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section) 
for which it has been determined that a percentage of offsetting profits 
may be applied to losses at the same valuation point.
    (b) The deduction under this Appendix A to Sec. 240.15c3-1 shall 
equal the sum of the deductions specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(v)(C) or 
(b)(2) of this section.

                       Theoretical Pricing Charges

    (1)(i) Definitions.
    (A) The terms theoretical gains and losses shall mean the gain and 
loss in the value of individual option series, the value of underlying 
instruments, related instruments, and qualified stock baskets within 
that option's class, at 10 equidistant intervals (valuation points) 
ranging from an assumed movement (both up and down) in the current 
market value of the underlying instrument equal to the percentage 
corresponding to the deductions otherwise required under Sec. 240.15c3-1 
for the underlying instrument (See paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this 
section). Theoretical gains and losses shall be calculated using a 
theoretical options pricing model that satisfies the criteria set forth 
in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section.
    (B) The term theoretical options pricing model shall mean any 
mathematical model, other than a broker-dealer proprietary model, 
approved by a Designated Examining Authority. Such Designated Examining 
Authority shall submit the model to the Commission, together with a 
description of its methods for approving models. Any such model shall 
calculate theoretical gains and losses as described in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i)(A) of this section for all series and issues of equity, index 
and foreign currency options and related instruments, and shall be made 
available equally and on the same terms to all registered brokers or 
dealers. Its procedures shall include the arrangement of the vendor to 
supply accurate and timely data to each broker-dealer with respect to 
its services, and the fees for distribution of the services. The data 
provided to brokers or dealers shall also contain the minimum 
requirements set forth in paragraphs (b)(1)(v)(C) of this section and 
the product group offsets set forth in paragraphs (b)(1)(v)(B) of this 
section. At a minimum, the model shall consider the following factors in 
pricing the option:

(1) The current spot price of the underlying asset;
(2) The exercise price of the option;
(3) The remaining time until the option's expiration;
(4) The volatility of the underlying asset;
(5) Any cash flows associated with ownership of the underlying asset 
that can reasonably be expected to occur during the remaining life of 
the option; and
(6) The current term structure of interest rates.

    (C) The term major market foreign currency shall mean the currency 
of a sovereign nation whose short-term debt is rated in one of the two 
highest categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical 
rating organizations and for which there is a substantial inter-bank 
forward currency market. For purposes of this section, the European 
Currency Unit (ECU) shall be deemed a major market foreign currency.

[[Page 289]]

    (D) The term qualified stock basket shall mean a set or basket of 
stock positions which represents no less than 50% of the capitalization 
for a high-capitalization or non-high-capitalization diversified market 
index, or, in the case of a narrow-based index, no less than 95% of the 
capitalization for such narrow-based index.
    (ii) With respect to positions involving listed options in a single 
specialist's market-maker account, and, separately, with respect to 
positions involving listed option positions in its proprietary or other 
account, the broker or dealer shall group long and short positions into 
the following portfolio types:
    (A) Equity options on the same underlying instrument and positions 
in that underlying instrument;
    (B) Options on the same major market foreign currency, positions in 
that major market foreign currency, and related instruments within those 
options' classes;
    (C) High-capitalization diversified market index options, related 
instruments within the option's class, and qualified stock baskets in 
the same index;
    (D) Non-high-capitalization diversified index options, related 
instruments within the index option's class, and qualified stock baskets 
in the same index; and
    (E) Narrow-based index options, related instruments within the index 
option's class, and qualified stock baskets in the same index.
    (iii) Before making the computation, each broker or dealer shall 
obtain the theoretical gains and losses for each options series and for 
the related and underlying instruments within those options' class in 
each specialist's market-maker account guaranteed, endorsed, or carried 
by a broker or dealer, or in the proprietary or other accounts of that 
broker or dealer. For each option series, the theoretical options 
pricing model shall calculate theoretical prices at 10 equidistant 
valuation points within a range consisting of an increase or a decrease 
of the following percentages of the daily market price of the underlying 
instrument:

(A) +(-)15% for equity securities with a ready market, narrow-based 
indexes, and non-high-capitalization diversified indexes;
(B) +(-)6% for major market foreign currencies;
(C) +(-) 20% for all other currencies; and
(D) +(-)10% for high-capitalization diversified indexes.

    (iv)(A) As to non-clearing option specialists and market-makers, the 
percentages of the daily market price of the underlying instrument shall 
be:

(1) +(-) 4\1/2\% for major market foreign currencies; and
(2) +6(-)8% for high-capitalization diversified indexes.
(3) +(-) 10% for a non-clearing market-maker, or specialist in non-high 
capitalization diversified index product group.

    (B) The provisions of this paragraph (b)(1)(iv) shall expire two 
years from September 1, 1997, unless otherwise extended by the 
Commission.
    (v)(A) The broker or dealer shall multiply the corresponding 
theoretical gains and losses at each of the 10 equidistant valuation 
points by the number of positions held in a particular options series, 
the related instruments and qualified stock baskets within the option's 
class, and the positions in the same underlying instrument.
    (B) In determining the aggregate profit or loss for each portfolio 
type, the broker or dealer will be allowed the following offsets in the 
following order, provided, that in the case of qualified stock baskets, 
the broker or dealer may elect to net individual stocks between 
qualified stock baskets and take the appropriate deduction on the 
remaining, if any, securities:
    (1) First, a broker or dealer is allowed the following offsets 
within an option's class:
    (i) Between options on the same underlying instrument, positions 
covering the same underlying instrument, and related instruments within 
the option's class, 100% of a position's gain shall offset another 
position's loss at the same valuation point;
    (ii) Between index options, related instruments within the option's 
class, and qualified stock baskets on the same index, 95%, or such other 
amount as designated by the Commission, of

[[Page 290]]

gains shall offset losses at the same valuation point;
    (2) Second, a broker-dealer is allowed the following offsets within 
an index product group:
    (i) Among positions involving different high-capitalization 
diversified index option classes within the same product group, 90% of 
the gain in a high-capitalization diversified market index option, 
related instruments, and qualified stock baskets within that index 
option's class shall offset the loss at the same valuation point in a 
different high-capitalization diversified market index option, related 
instruments, and qualified stock baskets within that index option's 
class;
    (ii) Among positions involving different non-high-capitalization 
diversified index option classes within the same product group, 75% of 
the gain in a non-high-capitalization diversified market index option, 
related instruments, and qualified stock baskets within that index 
option's class shall offset the loss at the same valuation point in 
another non-high-capitalization diversified market index option, related 
instruments, and qualified stock baskets within that index option's 
class or product group;
    (iii) Among positions involving different narrow-based index option 
classes within the same product group, 90% of the gain in a narrow-based 
market index option, related instruments, and qualified stock baskets 
within that index option's class shall offset the loss at the same 
valuation point in another narrow-based market index option, related 
instruments, and qualified stock baskets within that index option's 
class or product group;
    (iv) No qualified stock basket should offset another qualified stock 
basket; and
    (3) Third, a broker-dealer is allowed the following offsets between 
product groups: Among positions involving different diversified index 
product groups within the same market group, 50% of the gain in a 
diversified market index option, a related instrument, or a qualified 
stock basket within that index option's product group shall offset the 
loss at the same valuation point in another product group;
    (C) For each portfolio type, the total deduction shall be the larger 
of:
    (1) The amount for any of the 10 equidistant valuation points 
representing the largest theoretical loss after applying the offsets 
provided in paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B) if this section; or
    (2) A minimum charge equal to 25% times the multiplier for each 
equity and index option contract and each related instrument within the 
option's class or product group, or $25 for each option on a major 
market foreign currency with the minimum charge for futures contracts 
and options on futures contracts adjusted for contract size 
differentials, not to exceed market value in the case of long positions 
in options and options on futures contracts; plus
    (3) In the case of portfolio types involving index options and 
related instruments offset by a qualified stock basket, there will be a 
minimum charge of 5% of the market value of the qualified stock basket 
for high-capitalization diversified and narrow-based indexes; and
    (4) In the case of portfolio types involving index options and 
related instruments offset by a qualified stock basket, there will be a 
minimum charge of 7\1/2\% of the market value of the qualified stock 
basket for non-high-capitalization diversified indexes.

                    Alternative Strategy Based Method

    (2) A broker or dealer may elect to apply the alternative strategy 
based method in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b)(2).
    (i) Definitions. (A) The term intrinsic value or in-the-money amount 
shall mean the amount by which the exercise value, in the case of a 
call, is less than the current market value of the underlying 
instrument, and, in the case of a put, is greater than the current 
market value of the underlying instrument.
    (B) The term out-of-the-money amount shall mean the amount by which 
the exercise value, in the case of a call, is greater than the current 
market value of the underlying instrument, and, in the case of a put, is 
less than the current market value of the underlying instrument.
    (C) The term time value shall mean the current market value of an 
option

[[Page 291]]

contract that is in excess of its intrinsic value.
    (ii) Every broker or dealer electing to calculate adjustments to net 
worth in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b)(2) must 
make the following adjustments to net worth:
    (A) Add the time value of a short position in a listed option; and
    (B) Deduct the time value of a long position in a listed option, 
which relates to a position in the same underlying instrument or in a 
related instrument within the option class or product group as 
recognized in the strategies enumerated in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(D) of 
this section; and
    (C) Add the net short market value or deduct the long market value 
of listed options as recognized in the strategies enumerated in 
paragraphs (b)(2)(iii)(E)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (iii) In computing net capital after the adjustments provided for in 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, every broker or dealer shall 
deduct the percentages specified in this paragraph (b)(2)(iii) for all 
listed option positions, positions covering the same underlying 
instrument and related instruments within the options' class or product 
group.

                             Uncovered Calls

    (A) Where a broker or dealer is short a call, deducting the 
percentage required by paragraphs (c)(2)(vi) (A) through (K) of 
Sec. 240.15c3-1 of the current market value of the underlying instrument 
for such option reduced by its out-of-the-money amount, to the extent 
that such reduction does not operate to increase net capital. In no 
event shall this deduction be less than the greater of $250 for each 
short call option contract for 100 shares or 50% of the aforementioned 
percentage.

                             Uncovered Puts

    (B) Where a broker or dealer is short a put, deducting the 
percentage required by paragraphs (c)(2)(vi) (A) through (K) of 
Sec. 240.15c3-1 of the current market value of the underlying instrument 
for such option reduced by its out-of-the-money amount, to the extent 
that such reduction does not operate to increase net capital. In no 
event shall the deduction provided by this paragraph be less than the 
greater of $250 for each short put option contract for 100 shares or 50% 
of the aforementioned percentage.

                             Long Positions

    (C) Where a broker or dealer is long puts or calls, deducting 50 
percent of the market value of the net long put and call positions in 
the same options series.

           Certain Security Positions With Offsetting Options

    (D)(1) Where a broker or dealer is long a put for which it has an 
offsetting long position in the same number of units of the same 
underlying instrument, deducting the percentage required by paragraphs 
(c)(2)(vi) (A) through (K) of Sec. 240.15c3-1 of the current market 
value of the underlying instrument for the long offsetting position, not 
to exceed the out-of-the-money amount of the option. In no event shall 
the deduction provided by this paragraph be less than $25 for each 
option contract for 100 shares, provided that the minimum charge need 
not exceed the intrinsic value of the option.
    (2) Where a broker or dealer is long a call for which it has an 
offsetting short position in the same number of units of the same 
underlying instrument, deducting the percentage required by paragraphs 
(c)(2)(vi) (A) through (K) of Sec. 240.15c3-1 of the current market 
value of the underlying instrument for the short offsetting position, 
not to exceed the out-of-the-money amount of the option. In no event 
shall the deduction provided by this paragraph be less than $25 for each 
option contract for 100 shares, provided that the minimum charge need 
not exceed the intrinsic value of the option.
    (3) Where a broker or dealer is short a call for which it has an 
offsetting long position in the same number of units of the same 
underlying instrument, deducting the percentage required by paragraphs 
(c)(2)(vi) (A) through (K) of Sec. 240.15c3-1 of the current market 
value of the underlying instrument for the offsetting long position 
reduced by the short call's intrinsic value. In no event shall the 
deduction provided by this paragraph be less

[[Page 292]]

than $25 for each option contract for 100 shares.

                        Certain Spread Positions

    (E)(1) Where a broker or dealer is short a listed call and is also 
long a listed call in the same class of options contracts and the long 
option expires on the same date as or subsequent to the short option, 
the deduction, after adjustments required in paragraph (b) of this 
section, shall be the amount by which the exercise value of the long 
call exceeds the exercise value of the short call. If the exercise value 
of the long call is less than or equal to the exercise value of the 
short call, no deduction is required.
    (2) Where a broker or dealer is short a listed put and is also long 
a listed put in the same class of options contracts and the long option 
expires on the same date as or subsequent to the short option, the 
deduction, after the adjustments required in paragraph (b) of this 
section, shall be the amount by which the exercise value of the short 
put exceeds the exercise value of the long put. If the exercise value of 
the long put is equal to or greater than the exercise value of the short 
put, no deduction is required.
    (c) With respect to transactions involving unlisted options, every 
broker or dealer shall determine the value of unlisted option positions 
in accordance with the provision of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of 
Sec. 240.15c3-1, and shall deduct the percentages of all securities 
positions or unlisted options in the proprietary or other accounts of 
the broker or dealer specified in this paragraph (c). However, where 
computing the deduction required for a security position as if the 
security position had no related unlisted option position and positions 
in unlisted options as if uncovered would result in a lesser deduction 
from net worth, the broker or dealer may compute such deductions 
separately.

                             Uncovered Calls

    (1) Where a broker or dealer is short a call, deducting 15 percent 
(or such other percentage required by paragraphs (c)(2)(vi) (A) through 
(K) of Sec. 240.15c3-1) of the current market value of the security 
underlying such option reduced by any excess of the exercise value of 
the call over the current market value of the underlying security. In no 
event shall the deduction provided by this paragraph be less than $250 
for each option contract for 100 shares.

                             Uncovered Puts

    (2) Where a broker or dealer is short a put, deducting 15 percent 
(or such other percentage required by paragraphs (c)(2)(vi) (A) through 
(K) of Sec. 240.15c3-1) of the current market value of the security 
underlying the option reduced by any excess of the market value of the 
underlying security over the exercise value of the put. In no event 
shall the deduction provided by this paragraph be less than $250 for 
each option contract for 100 shares.

                              Covered Calls

    (3) Where a broker or dealer is short a call and long equivalent 
units of the underlying security, deducting 15 percent (or such other 
percentage required by paragraphs (c)(2)(vi) (A) through (K) of 
Sec. 240.15c3-1) of the current market value of the underlying security 
reduced by any excess of the current market value of the underlying 
security over the exercise value of the call. No reduction under this 
paragraph shall have the effect of increasing net capital.

                              Covered Puts

    (4) Where a broker or dealer is short a put and short equivalent 
units of the underlying security, deducting 15 percent (or such other 
percentage required by paragraphs (c)(2)(vi) (A) through (K) of 
Sec. 240.15c3-1) of the current market value of the underlying security 
reduced by any excess of the exercise value of the put over the market 
value of the underlying security. No such reduction shall have the 
effect of increasing net capital.

                           Conversion Accounts

    (5) Where a broker or dealer is long equivalent units of the 
underlying security, long a put written or endorsed by a broker or

of Sec. 240.15c3-1) of the current market value of the underlying 
security.
    (6) Where a broker or dealer is short equivalent units of the 
underlying security, long a call written or endorsed by a broker or 
dealer and short a put in his proprietary or other accounts, deducting 5 
percent (or 50 percent of such other percentage required by paragraphs

[62 FR 6481, Feb. 12, 1997]

    Effective Date Note: At 62 FR 6481, Feb. 12, 1997, Sec. 240.15c3-1a 
was revised, effective Sept. 1, 1997. For the convenience of the user, 
the superseded text is set forth as follows:
Sec. 240.15c3-1a  Options (Appendix A to 17 CFR 240.15c3-1).
    (a) Certain definitions. (1) The term listed option shall mean any 
option traded on a registered national securities exchange or facility 
of a registered national securities association.
    (2) The term unlisted option shall mean any option not traded on a 
registered national securities exchange or facility of a registered 
national securities association.
    (b) Certain Adjustments to Net Worth For Listed Options Before 
Computing the Deductions Specified in (c) Below. (1) The market value of 
short positions in listed options shall be added to net worth and the 
market value of any long positions in listed options, which relate to 
long or short securities positions or short positions in listed options, 
shall be deducted from net worth, and;
    (2) The amount by which the market value of a short security 
position, which is related to a long listed call, exceeds the exercise 
value of such long call, or the amount by which the exercise value of a 
long listed put, which is related to a long security position, exceeds 
the market value of the long security, shall be added to net worth, and;
    (3) The amount by which the market value of the underlying security 
would exceed the exercise value of the short listed call, or the amount 
by which the exercise value of a short listed put exceeds the market 
value of the underlying security, shall be deducted from net worth.
    (c) Deductions From Net Worth for Uncovered Options and Securities 
Positions in Which the Broker or Dealer Has Offsetting Option Positions. 
Every broker or dealer shall in computing net capital pursuant to 17 CFR 
240.15c3-1 deduct from net worth the percentages of all securities 
positions or options in the proprietary or other accounts of the broker 
or dealer specified below. However, where computing the deduction 
required for a security position as if the security position had no 
related option position and positions in options as if uncovered would 
result in a lesser deduction from net worth, the broker or dealer may 
compute such deductions separately.

                             Uncovered Calls

    (1) Where a broker or dealer is short a call, deducting, after the 
adjustment provided for in paragraph (b) of this Appendix A, 15 percent 
(or such other percentage required by paragraphs (c)(2)(vi) (A) through 
(K) of Sec. 240.15c3-1) of the current market value of the security 
underlying such option reduced by any excess of the exercise value of 
the call over the current market value of the underlying security. In no 
event shall the deduction provided by this paragraph be less than $250 
for each option contract for 100 shares.

                             Uncovered Puts

    (2) Where a broker or dealer is short a put, deducting, after the 
adjustment provided for in paragraph (b) of this Appendix A, 15 percent 
(or such other percentage required by paragraphs (c)(2)(vi) (A) through 
(K) of Sec. 240.15c3-1) of the current market value of the security 
underlying the option reduced by any excess of the market value of the 
underlying security over the exercise value of the put. In no event 
shall the deduction provided by this paragraph be less than $250 for 
each option contract for 100 shares.

                              Covered Calls

    (3) Where a broker or dealer is short a call and long equivalent 
units of the underlying security, deducting, after the adjustments 
provided for in paragraph (b) of this Appendix A, 15 percent (or such 
other percentage required by paragraphs (c)(2)(vi) (A) through (K) of 
Sec. 240.15c3-1) of the current market value of the underlying security 
reduced by any excess of the current market value of the underlying 
security over the exercise value of the call. No reduction under this 
paragraph shall have the effect of increasing net capital.

[[Page 294]]

                              Covered Puts

    (4) Where a broker or dealer is short a put and short equivalent 
units of the underlying security, deducting, after the adjustment 
provided for in paragraph (b) of this Appendix A, 15 percent (or such 
other percentage required by paragraphs (c)(2)(vi) (A) through (K) of 
Sec. 240.15c3-1) of the current market value of the underlying security 
reduced by any excess of the exercise value of the put over the market 
value of the underlying security. No such reduction shall have the 
effect of increasing net capital.

                           Conversion Accounts

    (5) Where a broker or dealer is long equivalent units of the 
underlying security, long an unlisted put written or endorsed by a 
broker or dealer and short an unlisted call in its proprietary or other 
accounts, deducting 5 percent (or 50 percent of such other percentage 
required by paragraphs (c)(2)(vi) (A) through (K) of Sec. 240.15c3-1) of 
the current market value of the underlying security.
    (6) Where a broker or dealer is short equivalent units of the 
underlying security, long an unlisted call written or endorsed by a 
broker or dealer and short an unlisted put in his proprietary or other 
accounts, deducting 10 percent (or 50 percent of such other percentage 
required by paragraphs (A) through (K) of paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of 17 CFR 
240.15c3-1) of the market value of the underlying security.

                      Long Over-the-Counter Options

    (7) Where a broker or dealer is long an unlisted put or call 
endorsed or written by a broker or dealer, deducting 15 percent (or such 
other percentage required by paragraphs (c)(2)(vi) (A) through (K) of 
Sec. 240.15c3-1) of the market value of the underlying security, not to 
exceed any value attributed to such option in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of 
Sec. 240.15c3-1.
    (8) Listed Options. Where a broker or dealer is long listed options 
and there is no offsetting security position, deducting 50 percent of 
the market value of any net long positions in options in the same 
underlying security, with the same exercise price and the same 
expiration date. Where a broker or dealer has a net short position in an 
option in the same underlying security, with the same exercise price and 
the same expiration date and for which the broker or dealer does not 
have a related position in the underlying security or an option position 
otherwise provided for in this Appendix (A), the deduction shall be 
determined as provided in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this Appendix (A).

           Certain Security Positions with Offsetting Options

    (9) Where a broker or dealer is long a security for which it is also 
long a listed put (such broker or dealer may in addition be short a 
call), deducting, after the adjustments provided in paragraph (b) of 
this Appendix A, 15 percent of the market value of the long security 
position not to exceed the amount by which the market value of 
equivalent units of the long security position exceeds the exercise 
value of the put. If the exercise value of the put is equal to or 
exceeds the market value of equivalent units of the long security 
position, no percentage deduction shall be applied.
    (10) Where a broker or dealer is short a security for which he is 
also long a listed call (such broker or dealer may in addition be short 
a put), deducting, after the adjustments provided in paragraph (b) of 
this Appendix A, 15 percent of the market value of the short security 
position not to exceed the amount by which the exercise value of the 
long call exceeds the market value of equivalent units of the short 
security position. If the exercise value of the call is less than or 
equal to the market value of equivalent units of the short security 
position no percentage deduction shall be applied.
    (11) Certain Spread Positions. Where a broker or dealer is short a 
listed call and is also long a listed call in the same class of option 
contracts and the long option expires on the same date as or subsequent 
to the short option, the deduction, after the adjustments required in 
paragraph (b) of this Appendix (A), shall be the amount by which the 
exercise value of the long call exceeds the exercise value of the short 
call. Provided, That if the exercise value of the long call is less than 
or equal to the exercise value of the short call, no deduction is 
required.
    (12) Where a broker or dealer is short a listed put and is also long 
a listed put in the same class of option contracts and the long option 
expires on the same date as or subsequent to the short option, the 
deduction, after the adjustments required in paragraph (b) of this 
Appendix (A), shall be the amount by which the exercise value of the 
short put exceeds the exercise value of the long put. Provided, That if 
the exercise value of the long put is equal to or greater than the 
exercise value of the short put, no deduction is required.
    (13) Certain Straddle Positions. Where a broker or dealer is long a 
listed call and is also long a listed put for the same underlying 
security, the deduction shall be the greater of (i) the deduction 
resulting from application of paragraph (c)(8) of this Appendix A to the 
long call; or (ii) the deduction resulting from application of the same 
paragraph to the long put.

[[Page 295]]

    (14) Where a broker or dealer is short a listed call and is also 
short a listed put for the same underlying security, the deduction, 
after application of the adjustments required by paragraph (a) of this 
Appendix A, shall be the greater of (i) the deduction resulting from the 
application of paragraph (c)(1) of this Appendix A to the short call, or 
(ii) the deduction resulting from the application of paragraph (c)(2) of 
this Appendix A to the short put.

Sec. 240.15c3-1b  Adjustments to net worth and aggregate indebtedness for certain commodities transactions (Appendix B to 17 CFR 240.15c3-1).

    (a) Every broker or dealer in computing net capital pursuant to 17 
CFR 240.15c3-1 shall comply with the following:
    (1) Where a broker or dealer has an asset or liability which is 
treated or defined in paragraph (c) of 17 CFR 240.15c3-1, the inclusion 
or exclusion of all or part of such asset or liability for the 
computation of aggregate indebtedness and net capital shall be in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of 17 CFR 240.15c3-1, except as 
specifically provided otherwise in this Appendix B. Where a commodity 
related asset or liability is specifically treated or defined in 17 CFR 
1.17 and is not generally or specifically treated or defined in 17 CFR 
240.15c3-1 or this Appendix B, the inclusion or exclusion of all or part 
of such asset or liability for the computation of aggregate indebtedness 
and net capital shall be in accordance with 17 CFR 1.17.

                         Aggregate Indebtedness

    (2) The term aggregate indebtedness as defined in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section shall exclude with respect to commodity-related 
transactions:
    (i) Indebtedness arising in connection with an advance to a non-
proprietary account when such indebtedness is adequately collateralized 
by spot commodities eligible for delivery on a contract market and when 
such spot commodities are covered.
    (ii) Advances received by the broker or dealer against bills of 
lading issued in connection with the shipment of commodities sold by the 
broker or dealer; and
    (iii) Equity balances in the accounts of general partners.

    (3) In computing net capital as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, the net worth of a broker or dealer shall be adjusted as 
follows with respect to commodity-related transactions:
    (i) Unrealized profit or loss for certain commodities transactions. 
(A) Unrealized profits shall be added and unrealized losses shall be 
deducted in the commodities accounts of the broker or dealer, including 
unrealized profits and losses on fixed price commitments and forward 
contracts; and
    (B) The value attributed to any commodity option which is not traded 
on a contract market shall be the difference between the option's strike 
price and the market value for the physical or futures contract which is 
the subject of the option. In the case of a long call commodity option, 
if the market value for the physical or futures contract which is the 
subject of the option is less than the strike price of the option, it 
shall be given no value. In the case of a long put commodity option, if 
the market value for the physical commodity or futures contract which is 
the subject of the option is more than the striking price of the option, 
it shall be given no value.
    (ii) Deduct any unsecured commodity futures or option account 
containing a ledger balance and open trades, the combination of which 
liquidates to a deficit or containing a debit ledger balance only: 
Provided, however, Deficits or debit ledger balances in unsecured 
customers', non-customers' and proprietary accounts, which are the 
subject of calls for margin or other required deposits need not be 
deducted until the close of business on the business day following the 
date on which such deficit or debit ledger balance originated;
    (iii) Deduct all unsecured receivables, advances and loans except 
for:
    (A) Management fees receivable from commodity pools outstanding no 
longer than thirty (30) days from the date they are due;

those specifically excluded under paragraph (3)(ii) of this Appendix B. 
In the case of an introducing broker or an applicant for registration as 
an introducing broker, include 50 percent of the value of a guarantee or 
security deposit with a futures commission merchant which carries or 
intends to carry accounts for the customers of the introducing broker.
    (iv) Deduct all inventories (including work in process, finished 
goods, raw materials and inventories held for resale) except for readily 
marketable spot commodities; or spot commodities which adequately 
collateralize indebtedness under paragraph (c)(7) of 17 CFR 1.17;
    (v) Guarantee deposits with commodities clearing organizations are 
not required to be deducted from net worth;
    (vi) Stock in commodities clearing organizations to the extent of 
its margin value is not required to be deducted from net worth;
    (vii) Deduct from net worth the amount by which any advances paid by 
the broker or dealer on cash commodity contracts and used in computing 
net capital exceeds 95 percent of the market value of the commodities 
covered by such contracts.
    (viii) Do not include equity in the commodity accounts of partners 
in net worth.
    (ix) In the case of all inventory, fixed price commitments and 
forward contracts, except for inventory and forward contracts in the

sold for further delivery on or subject to the rules of a contract 
market and covered by an open futures contract for which there will be 
no charge, deduct the applicable percentage of the net position 
specified below:
    (A) Inventory which is currently registered as deliverable on a 
contract market and covered by an open futures contract or by a 
commodity option on a physical--No charge.
    (B) Inventory which is covered by an open futures contract or 
commodity option--5% of the market value.
    (C) Inventory which is not covered--20% of the market value.
    (D) Fixed price commitments (open purchases and sales) and forward 
contracts which are covered by an open futures contract or commodity 
option--10% of the market value.
    (E) Fixed price commitments (open purchases and sales) and forward 
contracts which are not covered by an open futures contract or commodity 
option--20% of the market value.
    (x) Deduct 4% of the market value of commodity options granted 
(sold) by option customers on or subject to the rules of a contract 
market.
    (xi) [Reserved]
    (xii) Deduct for undermargined customer commodity futures accounts 
the amount of funds required in each such account to meet maintenance 
margin requirements of the applicable board of trade or, if there are no 
such maintenance margin requirements, clearing organization margin 
requirements applicable to such positions, after application of calls 
for margin, or other required deposits which are outstanding three 
business days or less. If there are no such maintenance margin 
requirements or clearing organization margin requirements on such 
accounts, then deduct the amount of funds required to provide margin 
equal to the amount necessary after application of calls for margin, or 
other required deposits outstanding three days or less to restore 
original margin when the original margin has been depleted by 50 percent 
or more. Provided, To the extent a deficit is deducted from net worth in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this Appendix B, such amount 
shall not also be deducted under this paragraph (a)(3)(xii). In the 
event that an owner of a customer account has deposited an asset other 
than cash to margin, guarantee or secure his account, the value 
attributable to such asset for purposes of this paragraph shall be the 
lesser of (A) the value attributable to such asset

[[Page 297]]

pursuant to the margin rules of the applicable board of trade, or (B) 
the market value of such asset after application of the percentage 
deductions specified in paragraph (a)(3)(ix) of this Appendix B or, 
where appropriate, specified in paragraph (c)(2)(vi) or (c)(2)(vii) of 
Sec. 240.15c3-1 this chapter;
    (xiii) Deduct for undermargined non-customer and omnibus commodity 
futures accounts the amount of funds required in each such account to 
meet maintenance margin requirements of the applicable board of trade 
or, if there are no such maintenance margin requirements, clearing 
organization margin requirements applicable to such positions, after 
application of calls for margin, or other required deposits which are 
outstanding two business days or less. If there are no such maintenance 
margin requirements or clearing organization margin requirements, then 
deduct the amount of funds required to provide margin equal to the 
amount necessary after application of calls for margin, or other 
required deposits outstanding two days or less to restore original 
margin when the original margin has been depleted by 50 percent or more. 
Provided, To the extent a deficit is deducted from net worth in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this Appendix B such amount 
shall not also be deducted under this paragraph (a)(3)(xiii). In the 
event that an owner of a non-customer or omnibus account has deposited 
an asset other than cash to margin, guarantee or secure his account, the 
value attributable to such asset for purposes of this paragraph shall be 
the lesser of (A) the value attributable to such asset pursuant to the 
margin rules of the applicable board of trade, or (B) the market value 
of such asset after application of the percentage deductions specified 
in paragraph (a)(3)(ix) of this Appendix B or, where appropriate, 
specified in paragraph (c)(2)(vi) or (c)(2)(vii) of Sec. 240.15c3-1 of

    (xiv) In the case of open futures contracts and granted (sold) 
commodity options held in proprietary accounts carried by the broker or 
dealer which are not covered by a position held by the broker or dealer 
or which are not the result of a ``changer trade made in accordance with 
the rules of a contract market, deduct:
    (A) For a broker or dealer which is a clearing member of a contract 
market for the positions on such contract market cleared by such member, 
the applicable margin requirement of the applicable clearing 
organization;
    (B) For a broker or dealer which is a member of a self-regulatory 
organization 150% of the applicable maintenance margin requirement of 
the applicable board of trade or clearing organization, whichever is 
greater; or
    (C) For all other brokers or dealers, 200% of the applicable 
maintenance margin requirement of the applicable board of trade or 
clearing organization, whichever is greater; or
    (D) For open contracts or granted (sold) commodity options for which 
there are no applicable maintenance margin requirements, 200% of the 
applicable initial margin requirement;
    Provided, the equity in any such proprietary account shall reduce 
the deduction required by this paragraph (a)(3)(xiv) if such equity is 
not otherwise includable in net capital.
    (xv) In the case of a broker or dealer which is a purchaser of a 
commodity option which is traded on a contract market the deduction 
shall be the same safety factor as if the broker or dealer were the 
grantor of such option in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(xiv), but in 
no event shall the safety factor be greater than the market value 
attributed to such option.
    (xvi) In the case of a broker or dealer which is a purchaser of a 
commodity option not traded on a contract market which has value and 
such value is used to increase net capital, the deduction is ten percent 
of the market value of the physical or futures contract which is the 
subject of such option but in no event more than the value attributed to 
such option.
    (xvii) Deduction 5% of all unsecured receivables includable under 
paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(C) of this Appendix B used by the broker or dealer 
in computing ``net capital'' and which are not receivable from (A) a 
futures commission merchant registered as such with the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission,

[[Page 298]]

or (B) a broker or dealer which is registered as such with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission.
    (xviii) A loan or advance or any other form of receivable shall not 
be considered ``secured'' for the purposes of paragraph (a)(3) of this 
Appendix B unless the following conditions exist:
    (A) The receivable is secured by readily marketable collateral which 
is otherwise unencumbered and which can be readily converted into cash: 
Provided, however, That the receivable will be considered secured only 
to the extent of the market value of such collateral after application 
of the percentage deductions specified in paragraph (a)(3)(ix) of this 
Appendix B; and
    (B)(1) The readily marketable collateral is in the possession or 
control of the broker or dealer; or
    (2) The broker or dealer has a legally enforceable, written security 
agreement, signed by the debtor, and has a perfected security interest 
in the readily marketable collateral within the meaning of the laws of 
the State in which the readily marketable collateral is located.
    (xix) The term cover for purposes of this Appendix B shall mean 
cover as defined in 17 CFR 1.17(j).
    (xx) The term customer for purposes of this Appendix B shall mean

Sec. 240.15c3-1c  Consolidated Computations of Net Capital and Aggregate Indebtedness for Certain Subsidiaries and Affiliates (Appendix C to 17 CFR 240.15c3-1).

    (a) Flow Through Capital Benefits. Every broker or dealer in 
computing its net capital and aggregate indebtedness pursuant to 17 CFR 
240.15c3-1 shall, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (d) of 
this Appendix, consolidate in a single computation assets and 
liabilities of any subsidiary or affiliate for which it guarantees, 
endorses or assumes directly or indirectly the obligations or 
liabilities. The assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or affiliate 
whose liabilities and obligations have not been guaranteed, endorsed, or 
assumed directly or indirectly by the broker or dealer may also be so 
consolidated if an opinion of counsel is obtained as provided for in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Required Counsel Opinions.(1) If the consolidation, provided for 
in paragraph (a) of this section, of any such subsidiary or affiliate 
results in the increase of the broker's or dealers's net capital and/or 
the decrease of the broker's or dealer's minimum net capital requirement 
under paragraph (a) of Sec. 240.15c3-1 and an opinion of counsel 
described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section has not been obtained, 
such benefits shall not be recognized in the broker's or dealer's 
computation required by this section.
    (2) Except as provided for in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
consolidation shall be permitted with respect to any subsidiaries or 
affiliates which are majority owned and controlled by the broker or 
dealer for which the broker or dealer can demonstrate to the 
satisfaction of the Commission, through the Examining Authority, by an 
opinion of counsel that the net asset values, or the portion thereof 
related to the parent's ownership interest in the subsidiary or 
affiliate may be caused by the broker or dealer or a trustee appointed 
pursuant to the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 or otherwise, 
to be distributed to the broker or dealer within 30 calendar days. Such 
opinion shall also set forth the actions necessary to cause such a 
distribution to be made, identify the parties having the authority to 
take such actions, identify and describe the rights of other parties or 
classes of parties, including but not limited to customers, general 
creditors, subordinated lenders, minority shareholders, employees, 
litigants and governmental or regulatory authorities, who may delay or 
prevent such a distribution and such other assurances as the Commission 
or the Examining Authority by rule or interpretation may require. Such 
opinion shall be current and periodically renewed in connection with the 
broker's or dealer's annual audit pursuant to 17 CFR

[[Page 299]]

240.17a-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or upon any material 
change in circumstances.
    (c) Principles of Consolidation. In preparing a consolidated 
computation of net capital and/or aggregate indebtedness pursuant to 
this section, the following minimum and non-exclusive requirements shall 
be observed:
    (1) Consolidated net worth shall be reduced by the estimated amount 
of any tax reasonably anticipated to be incurred upon distribution of 
the assets of the subsidiary or affiliate.
    (2) Liabilities of a consolidated subsidiary or affiliate which are 
subordinated to the claims of present and future creditors pursuant to a 
satisfactory subordination agreement shall not be added to consolidated 
net worth unless such subordination extends also to the claims of 
present or future creditors of the parent broker or dealer and all 
consolidated subsidiaries.
    (3) Subordinated liabilities of a consolidated subsidiary or 
affiliate which are consolidated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section may not be prepaid, repaid or accelerated if any of the 
entities included in such consolidation would otherwise be unable to 
comply with the provisions of Appendix (D), 17 CFR 240.15c3-1d.
    (4) Each broker or dealer included within the consolidation shall at 
all times be in compliance with the net capital requirement to which it 
is subject.
    (d) Certain Precluded Acts. No broker or dealer shall guarantee, 
endorse or assume directly or indirectly any obligation or liability of 
a subsidiary or affiliate unless the obligation or liability is 
reflected in the computation of net capital and/or aggregate 
indebtedness pursuant to 17 CFR 240.15c3-1 or this Appendix (C), except 
as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

Sec. 240.15c3-1d  Satisfactory Subordination Agreements (Appendix D to 17 CFR 240.15c3-1).

    (a) Introduction. (1) This Appendix sets forth minimum and non-
exclusive requirements for satisfactory subordination agreements 
(hereinafter ``subordination agreement''). The Examining Authority may 
require or the broker or dealer may include such other provisions as 
deemed necessary or appropriate to the extent such provisions do not 
cause the subordination agreement to fail to meet the minimum 
requirements of this Appendix (D).
    (2) Certain Definitions. For purposes of 17 CFR 240.15c3-1 and this 
Appendix (D):
    (i) A subordination agreement may be either a subordinated loan 
agreement or a secured demand note agreement.
    (ii) The term subordinated loan agreement shall mean the agreement 
or agreements evidencing or governing a subordinated borrowing of cash.
    (iii) The term Collateral Value of any securities pledged to secure 
a secured demand note shall mean the market value of such securities 
after giving effect to the percentage deductions set forth in paragraph 
(c)(2)(vi) of Sec. 240.15c3-1 except for paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(J). In 
lieu of the deduction under (c)(2)(vi)(J), the broker or dealer shall 
reduce the market value of the securities pledged to secure the secured 
demand note by 30 percent.
    (iv) The term Payment Obligation shall mean the obligation of a 
broker or dealer in respect to any subordination agreement (A) to repay 
cash loaned to the broker or dealer pursuant to a subordinated loan 
agreement or (B) to return a secured demand note contributed to the 
broker or dealer or reduce the unpaid principal amount thereof and to 
return cash or securities pledged as collateral to secure the secured 
demand note and (C) ``Payment'' shall mean the performance by a broker 
or dealer of a Payment Obligation.
    (v)(A) The term secured demand note agreement shall mean an 
agreement (including the related secured demand note) evidencing or 
governing the contribution of a secured demand note to a broker or 
dealer and the pledge of securities and/or cash with the broker or 
dealer as collateral to secure payment of such secured demand note. The 
secured demand note agreement may provide that neither the lender, his 
heirs, executors, administrators or assigns shall be personally liable 
on such note and that in the event of default the

[[Page 300]]

broker or dealer shall look for payment of such note solely to the 
collateral then pledged to secure the same.
    (B) The secured demand note shall be a promissory note executed by 
the lender and shall be payable on the demand of the broker or dealer to 
which it is contributed; provided, however, that the making of such 
demand may be conditioned upon the occurrence of any of certain events 
which are acceptable to the Commission and to the Examining Authority 
for such broker or dealer.
    (C) If such note is not paid upon presentment and demand as provided 
for therein, the broker or dealer shall have the right to liquidate all 
or any part of the securities then pledged as collateral to secure 
payment of the same and to apply the net proceeds of such liquidation, 
together with any cash then included in the collateral, in payment of 
such note. Subject to the prior rights of the broker or dealer as 
pledgee, the lender, as defined herein, may retain ownership of the 
collateral and have the benefit of any increases and bear the risks of 
any decreases in the value of the collateral and may retain the right to 
vote securities contained within the collateral and any right to income 
therefrom or distributions thereon, except the broker or dealer shall 
have the right to receive and hold as pledgee all dividends payable in 
securities and all partial and complete liquidating dividends.
    (D) Subject to the prior rights of the broker or dealer as pledgee, 
the lender may have the right to direct the sale of any securities 
included in the collateral, to direct the purchases of securities with 
any cash included therein, to withdraw excess collateral or to 
substitute cash or other securities as collateral, provided that the net 
proceeds of any such sale and the cash so substituted and the securities 
so purchased or substituted are held by the broker or dealer, as 
pledgee, and are included within the collateral to secure payment of the 
secured demand note, and provided further that no such transaction shall 
be permitted if, after giving effect thereto, the sum of the amount of 
any cash, plus the Collateral Value of the securities, then pledged as 
collateral to secure the secured demand note would be less than the 
unpaid principal amount of the secured demand note.
    (E) Upon payment by the lender, as distinguished from a reduction by 
the lender which is provided for in (b)(6)(iii) or reduction by the 
broker or dealer as provided for in subparagraph (b)(7) of this Appendix 
(D), of all or any part of the unpaid principal amount of the secured 
demand note, a broker or dealer shall issue to the lender a subordinated 
loan agreement in the amount of such payment (or in the case of a broker 
or dealer that is a partnership credit a capital account of the lender) 
or issue preferred or common stock of the broker or dealer in the amount 
of such payment, or any combination of the foregoing, as provided for in 
the secured demand note agreement.
    (F) The term lender shall mean the person who lends cash to a broker 
or dealer pursuant to a subordinated loan agreement and the person who 
contributes a secured demand note to a broker or dealer pursuant to a 
secured demand note agreement.
    (b) Minimum Requirements for Subordination Agreements. (1) Subject 
to paragraph (a) of this section, a subordination agreement shall mean a 
written agreement between the broker or dealer and the lender, which (i) 
has a minimum term of one year, except for temporary subordination 
agreements provided for in paragraph (c)(5) of this Appendix (D), and 
(ii) is a valid and binding obligation enforceable in accordance with 
its terms (subject as to enforcement to applicable bankruptcy, 
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws) against 
the broker or dealer and the lender and their respective heirs, 
executors, administrators, successors and assigns.
    (2) Specific Amount. All subordination agreements shall be for a 
specific dollar amount which shall not be reduced for the duration of 
the agreement except by installments as specifically provided for 
therein and except as otherwise provided in this Appendix (D).
    (3) Effective Subordination. The subordination agreement shall 
effectively subordinate any right of the lender to receive any Payment 
with respect thereto, together with accrued interest or compensation, to 
the prior payment

[[Page 301]]

or provision for payment in full of all claims of all present and future 
creditors of the broker or dealer arising out of any matter occurring 
prior to the date on which the related Payment Obligation matures 
consistent with the provisions of 17 CFR 240.15c3-1 and 240.15c3-1d, 
except for claims which are the subject of subordination agreements 
which rank on the same priority as or junior to the claim of the lender 
under such subordination agreements.
    (4) Proceeds of Subordinated Loan Agreements. The subordinated loan 
agreement shall provide that the cash proceeds thereof shall be used and 
dealt with by the broker or dealer as part of its capital and shall be 
subject to the risks of the business.
    (5) Certain Rights of the Broker or Dealer. The subordination 
agreement shall provide that the broker or dealer shall have the right 
to:
    (i) Deposit any cash proceeds of a subordinated loan agreement and 
any cash pledged as collateral to secure a secured demand note in an 
account or accounts in its own name in any bank or trust company;
    (ii) Pledge, repledge, hypothecate and rehypothecate, any or all of 
the securities pledged as collateral to secure a secured demand note, 
without notice, separately or in common with other securities or 
property for the purpose of securing any indebtedness of the broker or 
dealer; and
    (iii) Lend to itself or others any or all of the securities and cash 
pledged as collateral to secure a secured demand note.
    (6) Collateral for Secured Demand Notes. Only cash and securities 
which are fully paid for and which may be publicly offered or sold 
without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, and the offer, 
sale and transfer of which are not otherwise restricted, may be pledged 
as collateral to secure a secured demand note. The secured demand note 
agreement shall provide that if at any time the sum of the amount of any 
cash, plus the Collateral Value of any securities, then pledged as 
collateral to secure the secured demand note is less than the unpaid 
principal amount of the secured demand note, the broker or dealer must 
immediately transmit written notice to that effect to the lender and the 
Examining Authority for such broker or dealer. The secured demand note 
agreement shall also require that following such transmittal:
    (i) The lender, prior to noon of the business day next succeeding 
the transmittal of such notice, may pledge as collateral additional cash 
or securities sufficient, after giving effect to such pledge, to bring 
the sum of the amount of any cash plus the Collateral Value of any 
securities, then pledged as collateral to secure the secured demand 
note, up to an amount not less than the unpaid principal amount of the 
secured demand note; and
    (ii) Unless additional cash or securities are pledged by the lender 
as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, the broker or dealer 
at noon on the business day next succeeding the transmittal of notice to 
the lender must commence sale, for the account of the lender, of such of 
the securities then pledged as collateral to secure the secured demand 
note and apply so much of the net proceeds thereof, together with such 
of the cash then pledged as collateral to secure the secured demand note 
as may be necessary to eliminate the unpaid principal amount of the 
secured demand note; Provided, however, That the unpaid principal amount 
of the secured demand note need not be reduced below the sum of the 
amount of any remaining cash, plus the Collateral Value of the remaining 
securities, then pledged as collateral to secure the secured demand 
note. The broker or dealer may not purchase for its own account any 
securities subject to such a sale.
    (iii) The secured demand note agreement also may provide that, in 
lieu of the procedures specified in the provisions required by paragraph 
(b)(6)(ii) of this section, the lender with the prior written consent of 
the broker or dealer and the Examining Authority for the broker or 
dealer may reduce the unpaid principal amount of the secured demand 
note. After giving effect to such reduction, the aggregate indebtedness 
of the broker or dealer may not exceed 1000 percent of its net capital 
or, in the case of a broker or dealer operating pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii) of Sec. 240.15c3-1, net capital may not be less

[[Page 302]]

than 5 percent of aggregate debit items computed in accordance with 
Sec. 240.15c3-3a, or, if registered as a futures commission merchant, 7 
percent of the funds required to be segregated pursuant to the Commodity 
Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder (less the market value of 
commodity options purchased by option customers subject to the rules of 
a contract market, each such deduction not to exceed the amount of funds 
in the option customer's account), if greater. No single secured demand 
note shall be permitted to be reduced by more than 15 percent of its 
original principal amount and after such reduction no excess collateral 
may be withdrawn. No Examining Authority shall consent to a reduction of 
the principal amount of a secured demand note if, after giving effect to 
such reduction, net capital would be less than 120 percent of the 
minimum dollar amount required by Sec. 240.15c3-1.

                         Permissive Prepayments

    (7) A broker or dealer at its option but not at the option of the 
lender may, if the subordination agreement so provides, make a Payment 
of all or any portion of the Payment Obligation thereunder prior to the 
scheduled maturity date of such Payment Obligation (hereinafter referred 
to as a ``Prepayment''), but in no event may any Prepayment be made 
before the expiration of one year from the date such subordination 
agreement became effective. This restriction shall not apply to 
temporary subordination agreements that comply with the provisions of 
paragraph (c)(5) of this Appendix D. No Prepayment shall be made, if, 
after giving effect thereto (and to all Payments of Payment Obligations 
under any other subordinated agreements then outstanding the maturity or 
accelerated maturities of which are scheduled to fall due within six 
months after the date such Prepayment is to occur pursuant to this 
provision or on or prior to the date on which the Payment Obligation in 
respect of such Prepayment is scheduled to mature disregarding this 
provision, whichever date is earlier) without reference to any projected 
profit or loss of the broker or dealer, either aggregate indebtedness of 
the broker or dealer would exceed 1000 percent of its net capital or its 
net capital would be less than 120 percent of the minimum dollar amount 
required by Sec. 240.15c3-1 or, in the case of a broker or dealer 
operating pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of Sec. 240.15c3-1, its net 
capital would be less than 5 percent of its aggregate debit items 
computed in accordance with Sec. 240.15c3-3a, or if registered as a 
futures commission merchant, 7 percent of the funds required to be 
segregated pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations 
thereunder (less the market value of commodity options purchased by 
option customers subject to the rules of a contract market, each such 
deduction not to exceed the amount of funds in the option customer's 
account), if greater, or its net capital would be less than 120 percent 
of the minimum dollar amount required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of 
Sec. 240.15c3-1. Notwithstanding the above, no Prepayment shall occur 
without the prior written approval of the Examining Authority for such 
broker or dealer.

                           Suspended Repayment

    (8)(i) The Payment Obligation of the broker or dealer in respect of 
any subordination agreement shall be suspended and shall not mature if, 
after giving effect to Payment of such Payment Obligation (and to all 
Payments of Payment Obligations of such broker or dealer under any other 
subordination agreement(s) then outstanding that are scheduled to mature 
on or before such Payment Obligation) either (A) the aggregate 
indebtedness of the broker or dealer would exceed 1200 percent of its 
net capital, or in the case of a broker or dealer operating pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of Sec. 240.15c3-1, its net capital would be less 
than 5 percent of aggregate debit items computed in accordance with 
Sec. 240.15c3-3a or, if registered as a futures commission merchant, 6 
percent of the funds required to be segregated pursuant to the Commodity 
Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder (less the market value of 
commodity options purchased by option customers on or subject to the 
rules of a contract market, each such deduction not to exceed the amount 
of

[[Page 303]]

funds in the option customer's account), if greater, or (B) its net 
capital would be less than 120 percent of the minimum dollar amount 
required by Sec. 240.15c3-1 including paragraph (a)(1)(ii), if 
applicable. The subordination agreement may provide that if the Payment 
Obligation of the broker or dealer thereunder does not mature and is 
suspended as a result of the requirement of this paragraph (b)(8) for a 
period of not less than six months, the broker or dealer shall thereupon 
commence the rapid and orderly liquidation of its business, but the 
right of the lender to receive Payment, together with accrued interest 
or compensation, shall remain subordinate as required by the provisions 
of Sec. 240.15c3-1 and Sec. 240.15c3-1d.
    (9) Accelerated Maturity-Obligation to Repay to Remain Subordinate. 
(i) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(8) of this appendix, a 
subordination agreement may provide that the lender may, upon prior 
written notice to the broker or dealer and the Examining Authority given 
not earlier than six months after the effective date of such 
subordination agreement, accelerate the date on which the Payment 
Obligation of the broker or dealer, together with accrued interest or 
compensation, is scheduled to mature to a date not earlier than six 
months after the giving of such notice, but the right of the lender to 
receive Payment, together with accrued interest or compensation, shall 
remain subordinate as required by the provisions of 17 CFR 240.15c3-1 
and 240.15c3-1d.
    (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(8) of this 
appendix, the Payment Obligation of the broker or dealer with respect to 
a subordination agreement, together with accrued interest and 
compensation, shall mature in the event of any receivership, insolvency, 
liquidation pursuant to the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 
or otherwise, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, 
reorganization whether or not pursuant to the bankruptcy laws, or any 
other marshalling of the assets and liabilities of the broker or dealer 
but the right of the lender to receive Payment, together with accrued 
interest or compensation, shall remain subordinate as required by the 
provisions of 17 CFR 240.15c3-1 and 240.15c3-1d.
    (10)(i) Accelerated Maturity of Subordination Agreements on Event of 
Default and Event of Acceleration--Obligation to Repay to Remain 
Subordinate. A subordination agreement may provide that the lender may, 
upon prior written notice to the broker or dealer and the Examining 
Authority of the broker or dealer of the occurrence of any Event of 
Acceleration (as hereinafter defined) given no sooner than six months 
after the effective date of such subordination agreement, accelerate the 
date on which the Payment Obligation of the broker or dealer, together 
with accrued interest or compensation, is scheduled to mature, to the 
last business day of a calendar month which is not less than six months 
after notice of acceleration is received by the broker or dealer and the 
Examining Authority for the broker or dealer. Any subordination 
agreement containing such Events of Acceleration may also provide, that 
if upon such accelerated maturity date the Payment Obligation of the 
broker or dealer is suspended as required by paragraph (b)(8) of this 
Appendix (D) and liquidation of the broker or dealer has not commenced 
on or prior to such accelerated maturity date, then notwithstanding 
paragraph (b)(8) of this appendix the Payment Obligation of the broker 
or dealer with respect to such subordination agreement shall mature on 
the day immediately following such accelerated maturity date and in any 
such event the Payment Obligations of the broker or dealer with respect 
to all other subordination agreements then outstanding shall also mature 
at the same time but the rights of the respective lenders to receive 
Payment, together with accrued interest or compensation, shall remain 
subordinate as required by the provisions of this Appendix (D). Events 
of Acceleration which may be included in a subordination agreement 
complying with this paragraph (b)(10) shall be limited to:
    (A) Failure to pay interest or any installment of principal on a 
subordination agreement as scheduled;
    (B) Failure to pay when due other money obligations of a specified 
material amount;

[[Page 304]]

    (C) Discovery that any material, specified representation or 
warranty of the broker or dealer which is included in the subordination 
agreement and on which the subordination agreement was based or 
continued was inaccurate in a material respect at the time made;
    (D) Any specified and clearly measurable event which is included in 
the subordination agreement and which the lender and the broker or 
dealer agree (1) is a significant indication that the financial position 
of the broker or dealer has changed materially and adversely from agreed 
upon specified norms or (2) could materially and adversely affect the 
ability of the broker or dealer to conduct its business as conducted on 
the date the subordination agreement was made; or (3) is a significant 
change in the senior management of the broker or dealer or in the 
general business conducted by the broker or dealer from that which 
obtained on the date the subordination agreement became effective;
    (E) Any continued failure to perform agreed covenants included in 
the subordination agreement relating to the conduct of the business of 
the broker or dealer or relating to the maintenance and reporting of its 
financial position; and
    (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(8) of this 
appendix, a subordination agreement may provide that, if liquidation of 
the business of the broker or dealer has not already commenced, the 
Payment Obligation of the broker or dealer shall mature, together with 
accrued interest or compensation, upon the occurrence of an Event of 
Default (as hereinafter defined). Such agreement may also provide that, 
if liquidation of the business of the broker or dealer has not already 
commenced, the rapid and orderly liquidation of the business of the 
broker or dealer shall then commence upon the happening of an Event of 
Default. Any subordination agreement which so provides for maturity of 
the Payment Obligation upon the occurrence of an Event of Default shall 
also provide that the date on which such Event of Default occurs shall, 
if liquidation of the broker or dealer has not already commenced, be the 
date on which the Payment Obligations of the broker or dealer with 
respect to all other subordination agreements then outstanding shall 
mature but the rights of the respective lenders to receive Payment, 
together with accrued interest or compensation, shall remain subordinate 
as required by the provisions of this Appendix (D). Events of Default 
which may be included in a subordination agreement shall be limited to:
    (A) The making of an application by the Securities Investor 
Protection Corporation for a decree adjudicating that customers of the 
broker or dealer are in need of protection under the Securities Investor 
Protection Act of 1970 and the failure of the broker or dealer to obtain 
the dismissal of such application within 30 days;
    (B) The aggregate indebtedness of the broker or dealer exceeding 
1500 percent of its net capital or, in the case of a broker or dealer 
that has elected to operate under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of Sec. 240.15c3-
1, its net capital computed in accordance therewith is less than 2 
percent of its aggregate debit items computed in accordance with 
Sec. 240.15c3-3a or, if registered as a futures commission merchant, 4 
percent of the funds required to be segregated pursuant to the Commodity 
Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder (less the market value of 
commodity options purchased by option customers on or subject to the 
rules of a contract market, each such deduction not to exceed the amount 
of funds in the option customer's account), if greater, throughout a 
period of 15 consecutive business days, commencing on the day the broker 
or dealer first determines and notifies the Examining Authority for the 
broker or dealer, or the Examining Authority or the Commission first 
determines and notifies the broker or dealer of such fact;
    (C) The Commission shall revoke the registration of the broker or 
dealer;
    (D) The Examining Authority shall suspend (and not reinstate within 
10 days) or revoke the broker's or dealer's status as a member thereof;
    (E) Any receivership, insolvency, liquidation pursuant to the 
Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 or otherwise, bankruptcy, 
assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization whether or not 
pursuant to bankruptcy

[[Page 305]]

laws, or any other marshalling of the assets and liabilities of the 
broker or dealer.

A subordination agreement which contains any of the provisions permitted 
by this paragraph (b)(10) shall not contain the provision otherwise 
permitted by clause (i) of paragraph (b)(9).

  Brokers and Dealers Carrying the Accounts of Specialists and Market 
                        Makers in Listed Options

    (11) A subordination agreement which becomes effective on or after 
August 1, 1977 in favor of a broker or dealer who guarantees, endorses, 
carries or clears specialist or market maker transactions in options 
listed on a national securities exchange or facility of a national 
securities association shall provide that reduction, prepayment or 
repayment of the unpaid principal amount thereof, pursuant to those 
terms of the agreement required or permitted by paragraphs (b)(6)(iii), 
(b)(7), or (b)(8)(i) of this section, shall not occur in contravention 
of paragraphs (a)(6)(v), (a)(7)(iv), or (c)(2)(x)(B)(1) of 
Sec. 240.15c3-1 insofar as they apply to such broker or dealer.
    (c) Miscellaneous Provisions--(1) Prohibited Cancellation. The 
subordination agreement shall not be subject to cancellation by either 
party; no Payment shall be made with respect thereto and the agreement 
shall not be terminated, rescinded or modified by mutual consent or 
otherwise if the effect thereof would be inconsistent with the 
requirements of 17 CFR 240.15c3-1 and 240.15c3-1d.
    (2) Every broker or dealer shall immediately notify the Examining 
Authority for such broker or dealer if, after giving effect to all 
Payments of Payment Obligations under subordination agreements then 
outstanding that are then due or mature within the following six months 
without reference to any projected profit or loss of the broker or 
dealer either the aggregate indebtedness of the broker or dealer would 
exceed 1200 percent of its net capital or its net capital would be less 
than 120 percent of the minimum dollar amount required by Sec. 240.15c3-
1, or, in the case of a broker or dealer operating pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii) of Sec. 240.15c3-1, its net capital would be less than 5 
percent of aggregate debit items computed in accordance with 
Sec. 240.15c3-3a, or, if registered as a futures commission merchant, 6 
percent of the funds required to be segregated pursuant to the Commodity 
Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder (less the market value of 
commodity options purchased by option customers on or subject to the 
rules of a contract market, each such deduction not to exceed the amount 
of funds in the option customer's account), if greater, or less than 120 
percent of the minimum dollar amount required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of 
Sec. 240.15c3-1.
    (3) Certain Legends. If all the provisions of a satisfactory 
subordination agreement do not appear in a single instrument, then the 
debenture or other evidence of indebtedness shall bear on its face an 
appropriate legend stating that it is issued subject to the provisions 
of a satisfactory subordination agreement which shall be adequately 
referred to and incorporated by reference.
    (4) Legal Title to Securities. All securities pledged as collateral 
to secure a secured demand note must be in bearer form, or registered in 
the name of the broker or dealer or the name of its nominee or 
custodian.

            Temporary and Revolving Subordination Agreements

    (5)(i) For the purpose of enabling a broker or dealer to participate 
as an underwriter of securities or other extraordinary activities in 
compliance with the net capital requirements of Sec. 240.15c3-1, a 
broker or dealer shall be permitted, on no more than three occasions in 
any 12 month period, to enter into a subordination agreement on a 
temporary basis that has a stated term of no more than 45 days from the 
date such subordination agreement became effective. This temporary 
relief shall not apply to a broker or dealer if, within the preceding 
thirty calendar days, it has given notice pursuant to Sec. 240.17a-11, 
or if immediately prior to entering into such subordination agreement, 
either:
    (A) The aggregate indebtedness of the broker or dealer exceeds 1000 
percent of its net capital or its net capital is less

[[Page 306]]

than 120 percent of the minimum dollar amount required by Sec. 240.15c3-
1, or
    (B) In the case of a broker or dealer operating pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of Sec. 240.15c3-1, its net capital is less than 5 
percent of aggregate debits computed in accordance with Sec. 240.15c3-1, 
or, if registered as a futures commission merchant, less than 7 percent 
of the funds required to be segregated pursuant to the Commodity 
Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder (less the market value of 
commodity options purchased by option customers on or subject to the 
rules of a contract market, each such deduction not to exceed the amount 
of funds in the option customer's account), if greater, or less than 120 
percent of the minimum dollar amount required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of 
this section, or
    (C) The amount of its then outstanding subordination agreements 
exceeds the limits specified in paragraph (d) of Sec. 240.15c3-1. Such 
temporary subordination agreement shall be subject to all other 
provisions of this Appendix D.
    (ii) A broker or dealer shall be permitted to enter into a revolving 
subordinated loan agreement which provides for prepayment within less 
than one year of all or any portion of the Payment Obligation thereunder 
at the option of the broker or dealer upon the prior written approval of 
the Examining Authority for the broker or dealer. The Examining 
Authority, however, shall not approve any prepayment if:
    (A) After giving effect thereto (and to all Payments of Payment 
Obligations under any other subordinated agreements then outstanding, 
the maturity or accelerated maturities of which are scheduled to fall 
due within six months after the date such prepayment is to occur 
pursuant to this provision or on or prior to the date on which the 
Payment Obligation in respect of such prepayment is scheduled to mature 
disregarding this provision, whichever date is earlier) without 
reference to any projected profit or loss of the broker or dealer, 
either aggregate indebtedness of the broker or dealer would exceed 900 
percent of its net capital or its net capital would be less than 200 
percent of the minimum dollar amount required by Sec. 240.15c3-1 or, in 
the case of a broker or dealer operating pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii) of Sec. 240.15c3-1, its net capital would be less than 6 
percent of aggregate debit items computed in accordance with 
Sec. 240.15c3-3a, or, if registered as a futures commission merchant, 10 
percent of the funds required to be segregated pursuant to the Commodity 
Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder (less the market value of 
commodity options purchased by option customers on or subject to the 
rules of a contract market, each such deduction not to exceed the amount 
of funds in the option customer's account), if greater, or its net 
capital would be less than 200 percent of the minimum dollar amount 
required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section or
    (B) Pre-tax losses during the latest three-month period equalled 
more than 15% of current excess net capital.

Any subordination agreement entered into pursuant to this paragraph 
(c)(5)(ii) shall be subject to all the other provisions of this Appendix 
D. Any such subordination agreement shall not be considered equity for 
purposes of subsection (d) of section 15c3-1, despite the length of the 
initial term of the loan.
    (6)(i) Filing. Two copies of any proposed subordination agreement 
(including nonconforming subordination agreements) shall be filed at 
least 10 days prior to the proposed execution date of the agreement with 
the Commission's Regional or District Office for the region or district 
in which the broker or dealer maintains its principal place of business 
or at such other time as the Regional or District Office for good cause 
shall accept such filing. Copies of the proposed agreement shall also be 
filed with the Examining Authority in such quantities and at such time 
as the Examining Authority may require. The broker or dealer shall also 
file with said parties a statement setting forth the name and address of 
the lender, the business relationship of the lender to the broker or 
dealer, and whether the broker or dealer carried funds or securities for 
the lender at or about the time the proposed agreement was so filed. All 
agreements shall be

[[Page 307]]

examined by the Commission's Regional or District Office or the 
Examining Authority with whom such agreement is required to be filed 
prior to their becoming effective. No proposed agreement shall be a 
satisfactory subordination agreement for the purposes of this section 
unless and until the Examining Authority has found the agreement 
acceptable and such agreement has become effective in the form found 
acceptable.
    (ii) The broker or dealer need not file with the Regional or 
District Office for the region or district in which the broker or dealer 
maintains its principal place of business (if a Regional or District 
Office is not its Examining Authority) copies of any proposed 
subordination agreement or the statement described above if the 
Examining Authority for that broker or dealer has consented to file with 
the Commission periodic reports (not less than monthly) summarizing for 
the period, on a firm-by-firm basis, the subordination agreements it has 
approved for that period. Such reports should include at the minimum, 
the amount of the loan and its duration, the name of the lender and the 
business relationship of the lender to the broker or dealer.
    (7) Subordination Agreements in Effect Prior to Adoption. Any 
subordination agreement which has been entered into prior to December 
20, 1978 and which has been deemed to be satisfactorily subordinated 
pursuant to 17 CFR 240.15c3-1 as in effect prior to December 20, 1978, 
shall continue to be deemed a satisfactory subordination agreement until 
the maturity of such agreement. Provided, That no renewal of an 
agreement which provides for automatic or optional renewal by the broker 
or dealer or lender shall be deemed to be a satisfactory subordination 
agreement unless such renewed agreement meets the requirements of this 
Appendix within 6 months from December 20, 1978. Provided, further, That 
all subordination agreements must meet the requirements of this Appendix 
within 5 years of December 20, 1978.

[29 FR 7240, June 3, 1964]


<R05>
Sec. 240.15c3-3  Customer protection--reserves and custody of securities.

    (a) Definitions. For the purpose of this section:
    (1) The term customer shall mean any person from whom or on whose 
behalf a broker or dealer has received or acquired or holds funds or 
securities for the account of that person. The term shall not include a 
broker or dealer or a registered municipal securities dealer. The term 
shall not include general partners or directors or principal officers of 
the broker or dealer or any other person to the extent that that person 
has a claim for property or funds which by contract, agreement or 
understanding, or by operation of law, is part of the capital of the 
broker or

[[Page 309]]

dealer or is subordinated to the claims of creditors of the broker or 
dealer. The term customer shall, however, include another broker or 
dealer to the extent that that broker or dealer maintains an omnibus 
account for the account of customers with the broker or dealer in 
compliance with Regulation T under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
    (2) The term securities carried for the account of a customer 
(hereinafter also ``customer securities'') shall mean:
    (i) Securities received by or on behalf of a broker or dealer for 
the account of any customer and securities carried long by a broker or 
dealer for the account of any customer; and
    (ii) Securities sold to, or bought for, a customer by a broker or 
dealer.
    (3) The term fully paid securities shall include all securities 
carried for the account of a customer in a special cash account as 
defined in Regulation T promulgated by the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System, as well as margin equity securities within the 
meaning of Regulation T which are carried for the account of a customer 
in a general account or any special account under Regulation T during 
any period when section 8 of Regulation T (12 CFR 220.8) specifies that 
margin equity securities shall have no loan value in a general account 
or special convertible debt security account, and all such margin equity 
securities in such account if they are fully paid: Provided, however, 
That the term ``fully paid securities'' shall not apply to any 
securities which are purchased in transactions for which the customer 
has not made full payment.
    (4) The term margin securities shall mean those securities carried 
for the account of a customer in a general account as defined in 
Regulation T, as well as securities carried in any special account (such 
general or special accounts hereinafter referred to as ``margin 
accounts'') other than the securities referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section.
    (5) The term excess margin securities shall mean those securities 
referred to in paragraph (a)(4) of this section carried for the account 
of a customer having a market value in excess of 140 percent of the 
total of the debit balances in the customer's account or accounts 
encompassed by paragraph (a)(4) of this section which the broker or 
dealer identifies as not constituting margin securities.
    (6) The term qualified security shall mean a security issued by the 
United States or a security in respect of which the principal and 
interest are guaranteed by the United States.
    (7) The term bank shall mean a bank as defined in section 3(a)(6) of 
the Act and shall also mean any building and loan, savings and loan or 
similar banking institution subject to supervision by a Federal banking 
authority. With respect to a broker or dealer who maintains his 
principal place of business in the Dominion of Canada, the term ``bank'' 
shall also mean a Canadian bank subject to supervision by an authority 
of the Dominion of Canada.
    (8) The term free credit balances shall mean liabilities of a broker 
or dealer to customers which are subject to immediate cash payment to 
customers on demand, whether resulting from sales of securities, 
dividends, interest, deposits or otherwise, excluding, however, funds in 
commodity accounts which are segregated in accordance with the Commodity 
Exchange Act or in a similar manner.
    (9) The term other credit balances shall mean cash liabilities of a 
broker or dealer to customers other than free credit balances and funds 
in commodities accounts segregated as aforesaid.
    (10) The term funds carried for the account of any customer 
(hereinafter also ``customer funds'') shall mean all free credit and 
other credit balances carried for the account of the customer.
    (11) The term principal officer shall mean the president, executive 
vice president, treasurer, secretary or any other person performing a 
similar function with the broker or dealer.
    (12) The term household members and other persons related to 
principals includes husbands or wives, children, sons-in-law or 
daughters-in-law and any household relative to whose support a principal 
contributes directly or indirectly. For purposes of this paragraph 
(a)(12), a principal shall be deemed to be a director, general partner, 
or principal officer of the broker or dealer.

[[Page 310]]

    (13) The term affiliated person includes any person who directly or 
indirectly controls a broker or dealer or any person who is directly or 
indirectly controlled by or under common control with the broker or 
dealer. Ownership of 10% or more of the common stock of the relevant 
entity will be deemed prima facie control of that entity for purposes of 
this paragraph.
    (b) Physical possession or control of securities. (1) A broker or 
dealer shall promptly obtain and shall thereafter maintain the physical 
possession or control of all fully-paid securities and excess margin 
securities carried by a broker or dealer for the account of customers.
    (2) A broker or dealer shall not be deemed to be in violation of the 
provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section regarding physical 
possession or control of customers' securities if, solely as the result 
of normal business operations, temporary lags occur between the time 
when a security is required to be in the possession or control of the 
broker or dealer and the time that it is placed in his physical 
possession or under his control, provided that the broker or dealer 
takes timely steps in good faith to establish prompt physical possession 
or control. The burden of proof shall be on the broker or dealer to 
establish that the failure to obtain physical possession or control of 
securities carried for the account of customers as required by paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section is merely temporary and solely the result of 
normal business operations including same day receipt and redelivery 
(turnaround), and to establish that he has taken timely steps in good 
faith to place them in his physical possession or control.
    (3) A broker or dealer shall not be deemed to be in violation of the 
provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section regarding physical 
possession or control of fully-paid or excess margin securities borrowed 
from any person, provided that the broker or dealer and the lender, at 
or before the time of the loan, enter into a written agreement that, at 
a minimum;
    (i) Sets forth in a separate schedule or schedules the basis of 
compensation for any loan and generally the rights and liabilities of 
the parties as to the borrowed securities;
    (ii) Provides that the lender will be given a schedule of the 
securities actually borrowed at the time of the borrowing of the 
securities;
    (iii) Specifies that the broker or dealer (A) must provide to the 
lender, upon the execution of the agreement or by the close of the 
business day of the loan if the loan occurs subsequent to the execution 
of the agreement, collateral, consisting exclusively of cash or United 
States Treasury bills and Treasury notes or an irrevocable letter of 
credit issued by a bank as defined in section 3(a)(6) (A) through (C) of 
the Securities Exchange Act which fully secures the loan of securities, 
and (B) must mark the loan to the market not less than daily and, in the 
event that the market value of all the outstanding securities loaned at 
the close of trading at the end of the business day exceeds 100 percent 
of the collateral then held by the lender, the borrowing broker or 
dealer must provide additional collateral of the type described in 
proviso (iii) (A) to the lender by the close of the next business day as 
necessary to equal, together with the collateral then held by the 
lender, not less than 100 percent of the market value of the securities 
loaned; and
    (iv) Contains a prominent notice that the provisions of the 
Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 may not protect the lender 
with respect to the securities loan transaction and that, therefore, the 
collateral delivered to the lender may constitute the only source of 
satisfaction of the broker's or dealer's obligation in the event the 
broker or dealer fails to return the securities.
    (4)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section, a broker 
or dealer that retains custody of securities that are the subject of a 
repurchase agreement between the broker or dealer and a counterparty 
shall:
    (A) Obtain the repurchase agreement in writing;
    (B) Confirm in writing the specific securities that are the subject 
of a repurchase transaction pursuant to such agreement at the end of the 
trading day on which the transaction is intitiated and at the end of any 
other

[[Page 311]]

day during which other securities are substituted if the substitution 
results in a change to issuer, maturity date, par amount or coupon rate 
as specified in the previous confirmation;
    (C) Advise the counterparty in the repurchase agreement that the 
Securities Investor Protection Corporation has taken the position that 
the provisions of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 do not 
protect the counterparty with respect to the repurchase agreement;
    (D) Maintain possession or control of securities that are the 
subject of the agreement.
    (ii) For purpose of this paragraph (b)(4), securities are in the 
broker's or dealer's control only if they are in the control of the 
broker or dealer within the meaning of Sec. 240.15c3-3 (c)(1), (c)(3), 
(c)(5) or (c)(6) of this title.
    (iii) A broker or dealer shall not be in violation of the 
requirement to maintain possession or control pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(4)(i)(D) during the trading day if:
    (A) In the written repurchase agreement, the counterparty grants the 
broker or dealer the right to substitute other securities for those 
subject to the agreement; and
    (B) The provision in the written repurchase agreement governing the 
right, if any, to substitute is immediately preceded by the following 
disclosure statement, which must be prominently displayed:

                           Required Disclosure

    The [seller] is not permitted to substitute other securities for 
those subject to this agreement and therefore must keep the [buyer's] 
securities segregated at all times, unless in this agreement the [buyer] 
grants the [seller] the right to substitute other securities. If the 
[buyer] grants the right to substitute, this means that the [buyer's] 
securities will likely be commingled with the [seller's] own securities 
during the trading day. The [buyer] is advised that, during any trading 
day that the [buyer's] securities are commingled with the [seller's] 
securities, they will be subject to liens granted by the [seller] to its 
clearing bank and may be used by the [seller] for deliveries on other 
securities transactions. Whenever the securities are commingled, the 
[seller's] ability to resegregate substitute securities for the [buyer] 
will be subject to the [seller's] ability to satisfy the clearing lien 
or to obtain substitute securities.
    (iv) A confirmation issued in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) 
of this section shall specify the issuer, maturity date, coupon rate, 
par amount and market value of the security and shall further identify a 
CUSIP or mortgage-backed security pool number, as appropriate, except 
that a CUSIP or a pool number is not required on the confirmation if it 
is identified in internal records of the broker or dealer that designate 
the specific security of the counterparty. For purposes of this 
paragraph (b)(4)(iv), the market value of any security that is the 
subject of the repurchase transaction shall be the most recently 
available bid price plus accrued interest, obtained by any reasonable 
and consistent methodology.
    (v) This paragraph (b)(4) shall not apply to a repurchase agreement 
between the broker or dealer and another broker or dealer (including a 
government securities broker or dealer), a registered municipal 
securities dealer, or a general partner or director or principal officer 
of the broker or dealer or any person to the extent that his claim is 
explicitly subordinated to the claims of creditors of the broker or 
dealer.
    (c) Control of securities. Securities under the control of a broker 
or dealer shall be deemed to be securities which:
    (1) Are represented by one or more certificates in the custody or 
control of a clearing corporation or other subsidiary organization of 
either national securities exchanges or of a registered national 
securities association, or of a custodian bank in accordance with a 
system for the central handling of securities complying with the 
provisions of Secs. 240.8c-1(g) and 240.15c2-1(g) the delivery of which 
certificates to the broker or dealer does not require the payment of 
money or value, and if the books or records of the broker or dealer 
identify the customers entitled to receive specified quantities or units 
of the securities so held for such customers collectively; or
    (2) Are carried for the account of any customer by a broker or 
dealer and are carried in a special omnibus account in the name of such 
broker or dealer with another broker or dealer in compliance with the 
requirements of section 4(b) of Regulation T under the Act (12 CFR 
220.4(b)), such securities being deemed

[[Page 312]]

to be under the control of such broker or dealer to the extent that he 
has instructed such carrying broker or dealer to maintain physical 
possession or control of them free of any charge, lien, or claim of any 
kind in favor of such carrying broker or dealer or any persons claiming 
through such carrying broker or dealer; or
    (3) Are the subject of bona fide items of transfer; provided that 
securities shall be deemed not to be the subject of bona fide items of 
transfer if, within 40 calendar days after they have been transmitted 
for transfer by the broker or dealer to the issuer or its transfer 
agent, new certificates conforming to the instructions of the broker or 
dealer have not been received by him, he has not received a written 
statement by the issuer or its transfer agent acknowledging the transfer 
instructions and the possession of the securities or he has not obtained 
a revalidation of a window ticket from a transfer agent with respect to 
the certificate delivered for transfer; or
    (4) Are in the custody of a foreign depository, foreign clearing 
agency or foreign custodian bank which the Commission upon application 
from a broker or dealer, a registered national securities exchange or a 
registered national securities association, or upon its own motion shall 
designate as a satisfactory control location for securities; or
    (5) Are in the custody or control of a bank as defined in section 
3(a)(6) of the Act, the delivery of which securities to the broker or 
dealer does not require the payment of money or value and the bank 
having acknowledged in writing that the securities in its custody or 
control are not subject to any right, charge, security interest, lien or 
claim of any kind in favor of a bank or any person claiming through the 
bank; or
    (6)(i) Are held in or are in transit between offices of the broker 
or dealer; or (ii) are held by a corporate subsidiary if the broker or 
dealer owns and exercises a majority of the voting rights of all of the 
voting securities of such subsidiary, assumes or guarantees all of the 
subsidiary's obligations and liabilities, operates the subsidiary as a 
branch office of the broker or dealer, and assumes full responsibility 
for compliance by the subsidiary and all of its associated persons with 
the provisions of the Federal securities laws as well as for all of the 
other acts of the subsidiary and such associated persons; or
    (7) Are held in such other locations as the Commission shall upon 
application from a broker or dealer find and designate to be adequate 
for the protection of customer securities.
    (d) Requirement to reduce securities to possession or control. Not 
later than the next business day, a broker or dealer, as of the close of 
the preceding business day, shall determine from his books or records 
the quantity of fully paid securities and excess margin securities in 
his possession or control and the quantity of fully paid securities and 
excess margin securities not in his possession or control. In making 
this daily determination inactive margin accounts (accounts having no 
activity by reason of purchase or sale of securities, receipt or 
delivery of cash or securities or similar type events) may be computed 
not less than once weekly. If such books or records indicate, as of such 
close of the business day, that such broker or dealer has not obtained 
physical possession or control of all fully paid and excess margin 
securities as required by this section and there are securities of the 
same issue and class in any of the following noncontrol locations:
    (1) Securities subject to a lien securing moneys borrowed by the 
broker or dealer or securities loaned to another broker or dealer or a 
clearing corporation, then the broker or dealer shall, not later than 
the business day following the day on which such determination is made, 
issue instructions for the release of such securities from the lien or 
return of such loaned securities and shall obtain physical possession or 
control of such securities within two business days following the date 
of issuance of the instructions in the case of securities subject to 
lien securing borrowed moneys and within five business days following 
the date of issuance of instructions in the case of securities loaned; 
or
    (2) Securities included on his books or records as failed to receive 
more than 30 calendar days, then the broker

[[Page 313]]

or dealer shall, not later than the business day following the day on 
which such determination is made, take prompt steps to obtain physical 
possession or control of securities so failed to receive through a buy-
in procedure or otherwise; or
    (3) Securities receivable by the broker or dealer as a security 
dividend receivable, stock split or similar distribution for more than 
45 calendar days, then the broker or dealer shall, not later than the 
business day following the day on which such determination is made, take 
prompt steps to obtain physical possession or control of securities so 
receivable through a buy-in procedure or otherwise.
    (4) A broker or dealer which is subject to the requirements of 
Sec. 240.15c3-3 with respect to physical possession or control of fully 
paid and excess margin securities shall prepare and maintain a current 
and detailed description of the procedures which it utilizes to comply 
with the possession or control requirements set forth in this section. 
The records required herein shall be made available upon request to the 
Commission and to the designated examining authority for such broker or 
dealer.
    (e) Special reserve bank account for the exclusive benefit of 
customers. (1) Every broker or dealer shall maintain with a bank or 
banks at all times when deposits are required or hereinafter specified a 
``Special Reserve Bank Account for the Exclusive Benefit of Customers'' 
(hereinafter referred to as the ``Reserve Bank Account''), and it shall 
be separate from any other bank account of the broker or dealer. Such 
broker or dealer shall at all times maintain in such Reserve Bank 
Account, through deposits made therein, cash and/or qualified securities 
in an amount not less than the amount computed in accordance with the 
formula set forth in Sec. 240.15c3-3a.
    (2) It shall be unlawful for any broker or dealer to accept or use 
any of the amounts under items comprising Total Credits under the 
formula referred to in paragraph (e)(1) of this section except for the 
specified purposes indicated under items comprising Total Debits under 
the formula, and, to the extent Total Credits exceed Total Debits, at 
least the net amount thereof shall be maintained in the Reserve Bank 
Account pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (3) Computations necessary to determine the amount required to be 
deposited as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be made 
weekly, as of the close of the last business day of the week, and the 
deposit so computed shall be made no later than 1 hour after the opening 
of banking business on the second following business day; provided, 
however, a broker or dealer which has aggregate indebtedness not 
exceeding 800 percent of net capital (as defined in Sec. 240.15c3-1 or 
in the capital rules of a national securities exchange of which it is a 
member and exempt from Sec. 240.15c3-1 by paragraph (b)(2) thereof) and 
which carries aggregate customer funds (as defined in paragraph (a)(10) 
of this section), as computed at the last required computation pursuant 
to this section, not exceeding $1 million, may in the alternative make 
the computation monthly, as of the close of the last business day of the 
month, and, in such event, shall deposit not less than 105 percent of 
the amount so computed no later than 1 hour after the opening of banking 
business on the second following business day. If a broker or dealer, 
computing on a monthly basis, has, at the time of any required 
computation, aggregate indebtedness in excess of 800 percent of net 
capital, such broker or dealer shall thereafter compute weekly as 
aforesaid until four successive weekly computations are made, none of 
which were made at a time when his aggregate indebtedness exceeded 800 
percent of his net capital. Computations in addition to the computations 
required in this paragraph (3), may be made as of the close of any other 
business day, and the deposits so computed shall be made no later than 1 
hour after the opening of banking business on the second following 
business day. The broker or dealer shall make and maintain a record of 
each such computation made pursuant to this paragraph (3) or otherwise 
and preserve each such record in accordance with Sec. 240.17a-4.
    (f) Notification of banks. A broker or dealer required to maintain 
the reserve

[[Page 314]]

bank account prescribed by this section or who maintains a special 
account referred to in paragraph (k) of this section shall obtain and 
preserve in accordance with Sec. 240.17a-4 written notification from 
each bank in which he has his reserve bank account or special account 
that the bank was informed that all cash and/or qualified securities 
deposited therein are being held by the bank for the exclusive benefit 
of customers of the broker or dealer in accordance with the regulations 
of the Commission, and are being kept separate from any other accounts 
maintained by the broker or dealer with the bank, and the broker or 
dealer shall have a written contract with the bank which provides that 
the cash and/or qualified securities shall at no time be used directly 
or indirectly as security for a loan to the broker or dealer by the bank 
and, shall be subject to no right, charge, security interest, lien, or 
claim of any kind in favor of the bank or any person claiming through 
the bank.
    (g) Withdrawals from the reserve bank account. A broker or dealer 
may make withdrawals from his reserve bank account if and to the extent 
that at the time of the withdrawal the amount remaining in the reserve 
bank account is not less than the amount then required by paragraph (e) 
of this section. A bank may presume that any request for withdrawal from 
a reserve bank account is in conformity and compliance with this 
paragraph (g). On any business day on which a withdrawal is made, the 
broker or dealer shall make a record of the computation on the basis of 
which he makes such withdrawal, and he shall preserve such computation 
in accordance with Sec. 240.17a-4.
    (h) Buy-in of short security differences. A broker or dealer shall 
within 45 calendar days after the date of the examination, count, 
verification and comparison of securities pursuant to Sec. 240.17a-13 or 
otherwise or to the annual report of financial condition in accordance 
with Sec. 240.17a-5, buy-in all short security differences which are not 
resolved during the 45-day period.
    (i) Notification in the event of failure to make a required deposit. 
If a broker or dealer shall fail to make in his reserve bank account or 
special account a deposit, as required by this section, the broker or 
dealer shall by telegram immediately notify the Commission and the 
regulatory authority for the broker or dealer, which examines such 
broker or dealer as to financial responsibility and shall promptly 
thereafter confirm such notification in writing.
    (j)  [Reserved]
    (k) Exemptions. (1) The provisions of this section shall not be 
applicable to a broker or dealer meeting all of the following 
conditions:
    (i) His dealer transactions (as principal for his own account) are 
limited to the purchase, sale, and redemption of redeemable securities 
of registered investment companies or of interests or participations in 
an insurance company separate account, whether or not registered as an 
investment company; except that a broker or dealer transacting business 
as a sole proprietor may also effect occasional transactions in other 
securities for his own account with or through another registered broker 
or dealer;
    (ii) His transactions as broker (agent) are limited to: (a) The sale 
and redemption of redeemable securities of registered investment 
companies or of interests or participations in an insurance company 
separate account, whether or not registered as an investment company; 
(b) the solicitation of share accounts for savings and loan associations 
insured by an instrumentality of the United States; and (c) the sale of 
securities for the account of a customer to obtain funds for immediate 
reinvestment in redeemable securities of registered investment 
companies; and
    (iii) He promptly transmits all funds and delivers all securities 
received in connection with his activities as a broker or dealer, and 
does not otherwise hold funds or securities for, or owe money or 
securities to, customers.
    (iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this section shall not apply to 
any insurance company which is a registered broker-dealer, and which 
otherwise meets all of the conditions in paragraphs (k)(1) (i), (ii), 
and (iii) of this section, solely by reason of its participation in 
transactions that are a part of the business of insurance, including the 
purchasing, selling, or holding of

[[Page 315]]

securities for or on behalf of such company's general and separate 
accounts.
    (2) The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to a 
broker or dealer:
    (i) Who carries no margin accounts, promptly transmits all customer 
funds and delivers all securities received in connection with his 
activities as a broker or dealer, does not otherwise hold funds or 
securities for, or owe money or securities to, customers and effectuates 
all financial transactions between the broker or dealer and his 
customers through one or more bank accounts, each to be designated as 
``Special Account for the Exclusive Benefit of Customers of (name of the 
broker or dealer)''; or
    (ii) Who, as an introducing broker or dealer, clears all 
transactions with and for customers on a fully disclosed basis with a 
clearing broker or dealer, and who promptly transmits all customer funds 
and securities to the clearing broker or dealer which carries all of the 
accounts of such customers and maintains and preserves such books and 
records pertaining thereto pursuant to the requirements of 
Secs. 240.17a-3 and 240.17a-4 of this chapter, as are customarily made 
and kept by a clearing broker or dealer.
    (3) Upon written application by a broker or dealer, the Commission 
may exempt such broker or dealer from the provisions of this section, 
either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, if the 
Commission finds that the broker or dealer has established safeguards 
for the protection of funds and securities of customers comparable with 
those provided for by this section and that it is not necessary in the 
public interest or for the protection of investors to subject the 
particular broker or dealer to the provisions of this section.
    (l) Delivery of securities. Nothing stated in this section shall be 
construed as affecting the absolute right of a customer of a broker or 
dealer to receive in the course of normal business operations following 
demand made on the broker or dealer, the physical delivery of 
certificates for:
    (1) Fully-paid securities to which he is entitled, and,
    (2) Margin securities upon full payment by such customer to the 
broker or dealer of his indebtedness to the broker or dealer; and, 
subject to the right of the broker or dealer under Sec. 220.7(b) of 
Regulation T [12 CFR 220.7(b)] to retain collateral for his own 
protection beyond the requirements of Regulation T, excess margin 
securities not reasonably required to collateralize such customer's 
indebtedness to the broker or dealer.
    (m) Completion of sell orders on behalf of customers. If a broker or 
dealer executes a sell order of a customer (other than an order to 
execute a sale of securities which the seller does not own) and if for 
any reason whatever the broker or dealer has not obtained possession of 
the securities from the customer within 10 business days after the 
settlement date, the broker or dealer shall immediately thereafter close 
the transaction with the customer by purchasing securities of like kind 
and quantity: Provided, however, The term customer for the purpose of 
this paragraph (m) shall not include a broker or dealer who maintains a 
special omnibus account with another broker or dealer in compliance with 
section 4(b) of Regulation T [12 CFR 220.4(b)].

    Note: See 38 FR 12103, May 9, 1973 for an order suspending 
indefinitely the operation of paragraph (m) as to sell orders for 
exempted securities (e.g., U.S. Government and municipal obligations).

    (n) Extensions of time. If a registered national securities exchange 
or a registered national securities association is satisfied that a 
broker or dealer is acting in good faith in making the application and 
that exceptional circumstances warrant such action, such exchange or 
association, on application of the broker or dealer, may extend any 
period specified in paragraphs (d) (2) and (3), (h) and (m) of this 
section, relating to the requirement that such broker or dealer take 
action within a designated period of time to buy-in a security, for one 
or more limited periods commensurate with the circumstances. Each such 
exchange or association shall make and preserve for a period of not less 
than 3 years a record of each extension granted pursuant to paragraph 
(n) of this section which

[[Page 316]]

shall contain a summary of the justification for the granting of the 
extension.

  amount by which a specific security (other than an exempted security) 
  which is collateral for margin accounts exceeds in aggregate value 15 
  percent of the aggregate value of all securities which collateralize  
  all margin accounts receivable; provided, however, the required       
  reduction shall not be in excess of the amount of the debit balance   
  required to be excluded because of this concentration rule. A         
  specified security is deemed to be collateral for a margin account

(4) Debit balances in cash and margin accounts of household members and 
  other persons related to principals of a broker or dealer and debit   
  balances in cash and margin accounts of affiliated persons of a broker
  or dealer shall be excluded from the Reserve Formula, unless the      
  broker or dealer can demonstrate that such debit balances are directly
  related to credit items in the formula.                               
(5) Debit balances in margin accounts (other than omnibus accounts)     
  shall be reduced by the amount by which any single customer's debit   
  balance exceeds 25% (to the extent such amount is greater than        
  $50,000) of the broker-dealer's tentative net capital (i.e., net      
  capital prior to securities haircuts) unless the broker or dealer can 
  demonstrate that the debit balance is directly related to credit items
  in the Reserve Formula. Related accounts (e.g., the separate accounts 
  of an individual, accounts under common control or subject to cross   
  guarantees) shall be deemed to be a single customer's accounts for    
  purposes of this provision.                                           
                                                                        
If the registered national securities exchange or the registered        
  national securities association having responsibility for examining   
  the broker or dealer (``designated examining authority'') is          
  satisfied, after taking into account the circumstances of the         
  concentrated account including the quality, diversity, and            
  marketability of the collateral securing the debit balances or margin 
  accounts subject to this provision, that the concentration of debit   
  balances is appropriate, then such designated examining authority may 
  grant a partial or plenary exception from this provision.             
                                                                        
The debit balance may be included in the reserve formula computation for
  five business days from the day the request is made.

(6) Debit balances of joint accounts, custodian accounts, participations
  in hedge funds or limited partnerships or similar type accounts or    
  arrangements of a person who would be excluded from the definition of 
  customer (``non-customer'') which persons includible in the definition
  of customer shall be included in the Reserve Formula in the following 
  manner: if the percentage ownership of the non-customer is less than 5
  percent then the entire debit balance shall be included in the        
  formula; if such percentage ownership is between 5 percent and 50     
  percent then the portion of the debit balance attributable to the non-
  customer shall be excluded from the formula unless the broker or      
  dealer can demonstrate that the debit balance is directly related to  
  credit items in the formula; if such percentage ownership is greater  
  than 50 percent, then the entire debit balance shall be excluded from 
  the formula unless the broker or dealer can demonstrate that the debit
  balance is directly related to credit items in the formula.           
Note F. Item 13 shall include the amount of margin required and on      
  deposit with Options Clearing Corporation to the extent such margin is
  represented by cash, proprietary qualified securities, and letters of 
  credit collateralized by customers' securities.

offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or sold to an 
initial purchaser by a broker-dealer participating in such offering 
provided that a broker or dealer shall not effect or enter into a

payment of funds and delivery of securities later than the fourth 
business day after the date of the contract unless otherwise expressly 
agreed to by the parties at the time of the transaction.

<R05>
Sec. 240.15d-10  Transition reports.

    (a) Every issuer that changes its fiscal closing date shall file a 
report covering the resulting transition period between the closing date 
of its most recent fiscal year and the opening date of its new fiscal 
year; Provided, however, that an issuer shall file an annual report for 
any fiscal year that ended before the date on which the issuer 
determined to change its fiscal year end. In no event shall the 
transition report cover a period of 12 or more months.
    (b) The report pursuant to this section shall be filed for the 
transition period not more than 90 days after either the close of the 
transition period or the date of the determination to change the fiscal 
closing date, whichever is later. The report shall be filed on the form 
appropriate for annual reports of the issuer, shall cover the period 
from the close of the last fiscal year end and shall indicate clearly 
the period covered. The financial statements for the transition period 
filed therewith shall be audited. Financial statements, which may be 
unaudited, shall be filed for the comparable period of the prior year, 
or a footnote, which may be unaudited, shall state for the comparable 
period of the prior year, revenues, gross profits, income taxes, income 
or loss from continuing operations before extraordinary items and 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles and net income or 
loss. The effects of any discontinued operations and/or extraordinary 
items as classified under the provisions of generally accepted 
accounting principles also shall be shown, if applicable. Per share data 
based upon such income or loss and net income or loss shall be presented 
in conformity with applicable accounting standards. Where called for by 
the time span to be covered, the comparable period financial statements 
or footnote shall be included in subsequent filings.
    (c) If the transition period covers a period of less than six 
months, in lieu of the report required by paragraph (b) of this section, 
a report may be filed for the transition period on Form 10-Q and Form 
10-QSB (Sec. 249.308a of this chapter) not more than 45 days after 
either the close of the transition period or the date of the 
determination to change the fiscal closing date, whichever is later. The 
report on Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB shall cover the period from the 
close of the last fiscal year end and shall indicate clearly the period 
covered. The financial statements filed therewith need not be audited 
but, if they are not audited, the issuer shall file with the first 
annual report for the newly adopted fiscal year separate audited 
statements of income and cash flows covering the transition period. The 
notes to financial statements for the transition period included in such 
first annual report may be integrated with the notes to financial 
statements for the full fiscal period. A separate audited balance sheet 
as of the end of the transition period shall be filed in the annual 
report only if the audited balance sheet as of the end of the fiscal 
year prior to the transition period is not filed. Schedules need not be 
filed in transition reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB.
    (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of 
this section, if the transition period covers a period of one month or 
less, the issuer need not file a separate transition report if either:
    (1) The first report required to be filed by the issuer for the 
newly adopted fiscal year after the date of the determination to change 
the fiscal year

[[Page 320]]

end is an annual report, and that report covers the transition period as 
well as the fiscal year; or
    (2)(i) The issuer files with the first annual report for the newly 
adopted fiscal year separate audited statements of income and cash flows 
covering the transition period; and
    (ii) The first report required to be filed by the issuer for the 
newly adopted fiscal year after the date of the determination to change 
the fiscal year end is a quarterly report on Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB; 
and
    (iii) Information on the transition period is included in the 
issuer's quarterly report on Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB for the first 
quarterly period (except the fourth quarter) of the newly adopted fiscal 
year that ends after the date of the determination to change the fiscal 
year. The information covering the transition period required by Part II 
and Item 2 of Part I may be combined with the information regarding the 
quarter. However, the financial statements required by Part I, which may 
be unaudited, shall be furnished separately for the transition period.
    (e) Every issuer required to file quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and 
Form 10-QSB pursuant to Sec. 240.15d-13 of this chapter that changes its 
fiscal year end shall:
    (1) File a quarterly report on Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB within the 
time period specified in General Instruction A.1. to that form for any 
quarterly period (except the fourth quarter) of the old fiscal year that 
ends before the date on which the issuer determined to change its fiscal 
year end, except that the issuer need not file such quarterly report if 
the date on which the quarterly period ends also is the date on which 
the transition period ends;
    (2) File a quarterly report on Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB within the 
time specified in General Instruction A.1. to that form for each 
quarterly period of the old fiscal year within the transition period. In 
lieu of a quarterly report for any quarter of the old fiscal year within 
the transition period, the issuer may file a quarterly report on Form 
10-Q and Form 10-QSB for any period of three months within the 
transition period that coincides with a quarter of the newly adopted 
fiscal year if the quarterly report is filed within 45 days after the 
end of such three month period, provided the issuer thereafter continues 
filing quarterly reports on the basis of the quarters of the newly 
adopted fiscal year;
    (3) Commence filing quarterly reports for the quarters of the new 
fiscal year no later than the quarterly report for the first quarter of 
the new fiscal year that ends after the date on which the issuer 
determined to change the fiscal year end; and
    (4) Unless such information is or will be included in the transition 
report, or the first annual report on Form 10-K and Form 10-KSB for the 
newly adopted fiscal year, include in the initial quarterly report on 
Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB for the newly adopted fiscal year information 
on any period beginning on the first day subsequent to the period 
covered by the issuer's final quarterly report on Form 10-Q and Form 10-
QSB or annual report on Form 10-K and Form 10-KSB for the old fiscal 
year. The information covering such period required by Part II and Item 
2 of Part I may be combined with the information regarding the quarter. 
However, the financial statements required by Part I, which may be 
unaudited, shall be furnished separately for such period.

    Note to paragraphs (c) and (e): If it is not practicable or cannot 
be cost-justified to furnish in a transition report on Form 10-Q and 
Form 10-QSB or a quarterly report for the newly adopted fiscal year 
financial statements for corresponding periods of the prior year where 
required, financial statements may be furnished for the quarters of the 
preceding fiscal year that most nearly are comparable if the issuer 
furnishes an adequate discussion of seasonal and other factors that 
could affect the comparability of information or trends reflected, an 
assessment of the comparability of the data, and a representation as to 
the reason recasting has not been undertaken.

    (f) Every successor issuer that has a different fiscal year from 
that of its predecessor(s) shall file a transition report pursuant to 
this section, containing the required information about each 
predecessor, for the transition period, if any, between the close of the 
fiscal year covered by the last annual report of each predecessor and 
the date of succession. The report shall be filed

[[Page 321]]

for the transition period on the form appropriate for annual reports of 
the issuer not more than 90 days after the date of the succession, with 
financial statements in conformity with the requirements set forth in 
paragraph (b) of this section. If the transition period covers a period 
of less than six months, in lieu of a transition report on the form 
appropriate for the issuer's annual reports, the report may be filed for 
the transition period on Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB not more than 45 days 
after the date of the succession, with financial statements in 
conformity with the requirements set forth in paragraph (c) of this 
section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the transition period covers 
a period of one month or less, the successor issuer need not file a 
separate transition report if the information is reported by the 
successor issuer in conformity with the requirements set forth in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (g)(1) Paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section shall not apply to 
foreign private issuers.
    (2) Every foreign private issuer that changes its fiscal closing 
date shall file a report covering the resulting transition period 
between the closing date of its most recent year and the opening date of 
its new fiscal year. In no event shall a transition report cover a 
period longer than 12 months.
    (3) The report for the transition period shall be filed on Form 20-F 
responding to all items to which such issuer is required to respond when 
Form 20-F is used as an annual report. Such report shall be filed within 
six months after either the close of the transition period or the date 
on which the issuer made the determination to change the fiscal closing 
date, whichever is later. The financial statements for the transition 
period filed therewith shall be audited.
    (4) If the transition period covers a period of six or fewer months, 
in lieu of the report required by paragraph (g)(3) of this section, a 
report for the transition period may be filed on Form 20-F responding to 
Items, 3, 9, 15, 16, and 17 or 18 within three months after either the 
close of the transition period or the date on which the issuer made the 
determination to change the fiscal closing date, whichever is later. The 
financial statements required by either Item 17 or Item 18 shall be 
furnished for the transition period. Such financial statements may be 
unaudited and condensed as permitted in Article 10 of Regulation S-X 
(Sec. 210.10-01 of this chapter), but if the financial statements are 
unaudited and condensed, the issuer shall file with the first annual 
report for the newly adopted fiscal year separate audited statements of 
income and cash flows covering the transition period.
    (5) Notwithstanding the foregoing in paragraphs (g)(2), (g)(3), and 
(g)(4) of this section, if the transition period covers a period of one 
month or less, a foreign private issuer need not file a separate 
transition report if the first annual report for the newly adopted 
fiscal year covers the transition period as well as the fiscal year.
    (h) The provisions of this rule shall not apply to investment 
companies required to file reports pursuant to Rule 30b1-1 
(Sec. 270.30b1-1 of this chapter) under the Investment Company Act of 
1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.).
    (i) No filing fee shall be required for a transition report filed 
pursuant to this section.

    Note: In addition to the report or reports required to be filed 
pursuant to this section, every issuer, except a foreign private issuer 
or an investment company required to file reports pursuant to Rule 30b1-
1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, that changes its fiscal 
closing date is required to file a report on Form 8-K responding to Item 
8 thereof within the period specified in General Instruction B.1. to 
that form.

registration statement included financial statements for an interim 
period subsequent to the most recent fiscal year end meeting the 
requirements of Article 10 of Regulation S-X, for the first fiscal 
quarter subsequent to the quarter reported upon in the registration 
statement. The first quarterly report of the issuer shall be filed

statement or on or before the date on which such report would have been 
required to be filed if the issuer had been required to file reports on 
Form 10-Q and Form 10-QSB as of its last fiscal quarter, whichever is 
later.

Sec. 240.15g-3  Broker or dealer disclosure of quotations and other information relating to the penny stock market.

    (a) Requirement. It shall be unlawful for a broker or dealer to 
effect a transaction in any penny stock with or for the account of a 
customer unless such broker or dealer discloses to such customer, within 
the time periods and in the manner required by paragraph (b) of this 
section, the following information:
    (1) The inside bid quotation and the inside offer quotation for the 
penny stock.
    (2) If paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply because of 
the absence of an inside bid quotation and an inside offer quotation:
    (i) With respect to a transaction effected with or for a customer on 
a principal basis (other than as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of 
this section):
    (A) The dealer shall disclose its offer price for the security:
    (1) If during the previous five days the dealer has effected no 
fewer than three bona fide sales to other dealers consistently at its 
offer price for the security current at the time of those sales, and
    (2) If the dealer reasonably believes in good faith at the time of 
the transaction with the customer that its offer price accurately 
reflects the price at which it is willing to sell one or more round lots 
to another dealer. For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this 
section, ``consistently'' shall constitute, at a minimum, seventy-five 
percent of the dealer's bona fide interdealer sales during the previous 
five-day period, and, if the dealer has effected only three bona fide 
inter-dealer sales during such period, all three of such sales.
    (B) The dealer shall disclose its bid price for the security:
    (1) If during the previous five days the dealer has effected no 
fewer than three bona fide purchases from other dealers consistently at 
its bid price for the security current at the time of those purchases, 
and
    (2) If the dealer reasonably believes in good faith at the time of 
the transaction with the customer that its bid price accurately reflects 
the price at which it is willing to buy one or more round lots from 
another dealer. For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section, 
``consistently'' shall constitute, at a minimum, seventy-five percent of 
the dealer's bona fide interdealer purchases during the previous five-
day period, and, if the dealer has effected only three bona fide inter-
dealer purchases during such period, all three of such purchases.

[[Page 325]]

    (C) If the dealer's bid or offer prices to the customer do not 
satisfy the criteria of paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(A) or (a)(2)(i)(B) of this 
section, the dealer shall disclose to the customer:
    (1) That it has not effected inter-dealer purchases or sales of the 
penny stock consistently at its bid or offer price, and
    (2) The price at which it last purchased the penny stock from, or 
sold the penny stock to, respectively, another dealer in a bona fide 
transaction.
    (ii) With respect to transactions effected by a broker or dealer 
with or for the account of the customer:
    (A) On an agency basis or
    (B) On a basis other than as a market maker in the security, where, 
after having received an order from the customer to purchase a penny 
stock, the dealer effects the purchase from another person to offset a 
contemporaneous sale of the penny stock to such customer, or, after 
having received an order from the customer to sell the penny stock, the 
dealer effects the sale to another person to offset a contemporaneous 
purchase from such customer, the broker or dealer shall disclose the 
best independent interdealer bid and offer prices for the penny stock 
that the broker or dealer obtains through reasonable diligence. A 
broker-dealer shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable diligence if 
it obtains quotations from three market makers in the security (or all 
known market makers if there are fewer than three).
    (3) With respect to bid or offer prices and transaction prices 
disclosed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the broker or

sent to the customer pursuant to 17 CFR 240.10b-10 of this chapter.
    (2) A broker or dealer, at the time of making the disclosure 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, shall make and preserve 
as part of its records, a record of such disclosure for the period 
specified in 17 CFR 240.17a-4(b).

dealer is willing to purchase one or more round lots of the penny stock, 
and shall not include indications of interest.

Sec. 240.15g-4  Disclosure of compensation to brokers or dealers.

    Preliminary Note: Brokers and dealers may wish to refer to 
Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30608 (April 20, 1992) for a 
discussion of the procedures for computing

[[Page 326]]

compensation in active and competitive markets, inactive and competitive 
markets, and dominated and controlled markets.

    (a) Disclosure requirement. It shall be unlawful for any broker or 
dealer to effect a transaction in any penny stock for or with the 
account of a customer unless such broker or dealer discloses to such 
customer, within the time periods and in the manner required by 
paragraph (b) of this section, the aggregate amount of any compensation 
received by such broker or dealer in connection with such transaction.
    (b) Timing. (1) The information described in paragraph (a) of this 
section:
    (i) Shall be provided to the customer orally or in writing prior to 
effecting any transaction with or for the customer for the purchase or 
sale of such penny stock; and
    (ii) Shall be given or sent to the customer in writing, at or prior 
to the time that any written confirmation of the transaction is given or 
sent to the customer pursuant to 17 CFR 240.10b-10.
    (2) A broker or dealer, at the time of making the disclosure 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, shall make and preserve 
as part of its records, a record of such disclosure for the period 
specified in 17 CFR 240.17a-4(b).
    (c) Definition of compensation. For purposes of this section, 
compensation means, with respect to a transaction in a penny stock:
    (1) If a broker is acting as agent for a customer, the amount of any 
remuneration received or to be received by it from such customer in 
connection with such transaction;
    (2) If, after having received a buy order from a customer, a dealer 
other than a market maker purchased the penny stock as principal from 
another person to offset a contemporaneous sale to such customer or, 
after having received a sell order from a customer, sold the penny stock 
as principal to another person to offset a contemporaneous purchase from 
such customer, the difference between the price to the customer and such 
contemporaneous purchase or sale price; or
    (3) If the dealer otherwise is acting as principal for its own 
account, the difference between the price to the customer and the 
prevailing market price.
    (d) Active and competitive market. For purposes of this section 
only, a market may be deemed to be ``active and competitive'' in 
determining the prevailing market price with respect to a transaction by 
a market maker in a penny stock if the aggregate number of transactions 
effected by such market maker in the penny stock in the five business 
days preceding such transaction is less than twenty percent of the 
aggregate number of all transactions in the penny stock reported on a 
Qualifying Electronic Quotation System (as defined in 17 CFR 240.15g-
3(c)(5)) during such five-day period. No presumption shall arise that a 
market is not ``active and competitive'' solely by reason of a market 
maker not meeting the conditions specified in this paragraph.

<R05>
Sec. 240.15g-5  Disclosure of compensation of associated persons in connection with penny stock transactions.

unless the broker or dealer discloses to such customer, within the time 
periods and in the manner required by paragraph (b) of this section, the 
aggregate amount of cash compensation that any associated person of the 
broker or dealer who is a natural person and has communicated with the 
customer concerning the transaction at or prior to receipt of the 
customer's transaction order, other than any person whose function is 
solely clerical or ministerial, has received or will receive from any 
source in connection with the transaction and that is determined at or 
prior to the time of the transaction, including separate disclosure, if 
applicable, of the source and amount of such compensation that is not

    (c) Contingent compensation arrangements. Where a portion or all of 
the cash or other compensation that the associated person may receive in 
connection with the transaction may be determined and paid following the 
transaction based on aggregate sales volume levels or other 
contingencies, the written disclosure required by paragraph (b)(1)(ii) 
of this section shall state that fact and describe the basis upon which

    (b) Exemptions. A broker or dealer shall be exempted from the 
requirement of paragraph (a) of this section under either of the 
following circumstances:
    (1) If the broker or dealer does not effect any transactions in 
penny stocks for or with the account of the customer during a period of 
six consecutive calendar months, then the broker or dealer shall not be 
required to provide monthly statements for each quarterly period that is 
immediately subsequent to such six-month period and in which the broker 
or dealer does not effect any transaction in penny stocks for or with 
the account of the customer, provided that the broker or dealer gives or 
sends to the customer written statements containing the information 
described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section on a quarterly 
basis, within ten days following the end of each such quarterly period.
    (2) If, on all but five or fewer trading days of any quarterly 
period, a security has a price of five dollars or more, the broker or 
dealer shall not be required to provide a monthly statement covering the 
security for subsequent quarterly periods, until the end of any such 
subsequent quarterly period on the last trading day of which the price 
of the security is less than five dollars.
    (c) Price determinations. For purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section, the price of a security on any trading day shall be 
determined at the close of business in accordance with the provisions of

    (1) The identity and number of shares or units of each such security 
held for the customer's account; and
    (2) The estimated market value of the security, to the extent that 
such estimated market value can be determined in accordance with the

    (i) The highest inside bid quotation for the security on the last 
trading day of the period to which the statement relates, multiplied by 
the number of shares or units of the security held for the customer's 
account; or
    (ii) If paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section is not applicable 
because of the absence of an inside bid quotation, and if the broker or 
dealer furnishing the statement has effected at least ten separate 
Qualifying Purchases in the security during the last five trading days 
of the period to which the statement relates, the weighted average price 
per share paid by the broker or dealer in

all Qualifying Purchases effected during such five-day period, 
multiplied by the number of shares or units of the security held for the 
customer's account; or
    (iii) If neither of paragraphs (d)(2)(i) nor (d)(2)(ii) of this 
section is applicable, a statement that there is ``no estimated market 
value'' with respect to the security.

of this section, the written statement required by paragraph (a) of this 
section shall include a conspicuous legend that is identified with the 
penny stocks described in the statement and that contains the following 
language:

    If this statement contains an estimated value, you should be aware 
that this value may be based on a limited number of trades or quotes. 
Therefore, you may not be able to sell these securities at a price equal 
or near to the value shown. However, the broker-dealer furnishing this 
statement may not refuse to accept your order to sell these securities. 
Also, the amount you receive from a sale generally will be reduced by 
the amount of any commissions or similar charges. If an estimated value 
is not shown for a security, a value could not be determined because of 
a lack of information.

    (f) Preservation of records. Any broker or dealer subject to this 
section shall preserve, as part of its records, copies of the written 
statements required by paragraph (a) of this section and keep such 
records for the periods specified in 17 CFR 240.17a-4(b).
    (g) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    (1) The term Quarterly period shall mean any period of three 
consecutive full calendar months.
    (2) The inside bid quotation for a security shall mean the highest 
bid quotation for the security displayed by a market maker in the 
security on a Qualifying Electronic Quotation System, at any time in 
which at least two market makers are contemporaneously displaying on 
such system bid and offer quotations for the security at specified 
prices.
    (3) The term Qualifying Electronic Quotation System shall mean an 
automated interdealer quotation system that has the characteristics set 
forth in section 17B(b)(2) of the Act, or such other automated 
interdealer quotation system designated by the Commission for purposes 
of this section.
    (4) The term Qualifying Purchases shall mean bona fide purchases by 
a broker or dealer of a penny stock for its own account, each of which 
involves at least 100 shares, but excluding any block purchase involving 
more than one percent of the outstanding shares or units of the 
security.

                  Important Information on Penny Stocks

    This statement is required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) and contains important information on penny stocks. 
Your broker-dealer is required to obtain your signature to show that you 
have received this statement before your first trade in a penny stock. 
You are urged to read this statement before signing and before making a 
purchase or sale of a penny stock.
    Penny stocks can be very risky.
    <bullet> Penny stocks are low-priced shares of small companies not 
traded on an exchange or quoted on NASDAQ. Prices often are not 
available. Investors in penny stocks often are unable to sell stock back 
to the dealer that sold them the stock. Thus, you may lose your 
investment. Be cautious of newly issued penny stock.
    <bullet> Your salesperson is not an impartial advisor but is paid to 
sell you the stock. Do not rely only on the salesperson, but seek 
outside advice before you buy any stock. If you have problems with a 
salesperson, contact the firm's compliance officer or the regulators 
listed below.
    Information you should get.
    <bullet> Before you buy penny stock, federal law requires your 
salesperson to tell you the ``offer'' and the ``bid'' on the stock, and 
the ``compensation'' the salesperson and the firm receive for the trade. 
The firm also must mail a confirmation of these prices to you after the 
trade.
    <bullet> You will need this price information to determine what 
profit, if any, you will have when you sell your stock. The offer price 
is the wholesale price at which the dealer is willing to sell stock to 
other dealers. The bid price is the wholesale price at which the dealer 
is willing to buy the stock from other dealers. In its trade with you, 
the dealer may add a retail charge to these wholesale prices as 
compensation (called a ``markup'' or ``markdown'').
    <bullet> The difference between the bid and the offer price is the 
dealer's ``spread.'' A spread that is large compared with the purchase 
price can make a resale of a stock very costly. To be profitable when 
you sell, the bid price of your stock must rise above the amount of this 
spread and the compensation charged by both your selling and purchasing 
dealers. If the dealer has no bid price, you may not be able to sell the 
stock after you buy it, and may lose your whole investment.
    Brokers' duties and customer's rights and remedies.
    <bullet> If you are a victim of fraud, you may have rights and 
remedies under state and federal law. You can get the disciplinary 
history of a salesperson or firm from the NASD at 1-800-289-9999, and 
additional information from your state securities official, at the North 
American Securities Administrators Association's central number: (202) 
737-0900. You also may contact the SEC with complaints at (202) 272-
7440.

                           Further Information

    The securities being sold to you have not been approved or 
disapproved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, the 
Securities and Exchange Commission has not passed upon the fairness or 
the merits of this transaction nor upon the accuracy or adequacy of the 
information contained in any prospectus or any other information 
provided by an issuer or a broker or dealer.
    Generally, penny stock is a security that:
    <bullet> Is priced under five dollars;

               Use Caution When Investing in Penny Stocks

    1. Do not make a hurried investment decision. High-pressure sales 
techniques can be a warning sign of fraud. The salesperson is not

[[Page 331]]

an impartial advisor, but is paid for selling stock to you. The 
salesperson also does not have to watch your investment for you. Thus, 
you should think over the offer and seek outside advice. Check to see if 
the information given by the salesperson differs from other information 
you may have. Also, it is illegal for salespersons to promise that a 
stock will increase in value or is risk-free, or to guarantee against 
loss. If you think there is a problem, ask to speak with a compliance 
official at the firm, and, if necessary, any of the regulators referred 
to in this statement.
    2. Study the company issuing the stock. Be wary of companies that 
have no operating history, few assets, or no defined business purpose. 
These may be sham or ``shell'' corporations. Read the prospectus for the 
company carefully before you invest. Some dealers fraudulently solicit 
investors' money to buy stock in sham companies, artificially inflate 
the stock prices, then cash in their profits before public investors can 
sell their stock.
    3. Understand the risky nature of these stocks. You should be aware 
that you may lose part or all of your investment. Because of large 
dealer spreads, you will not be able to sell the stock immediately back 
to the dealer at the same price it sold the stock to you. In some cases, 
the stock may fall quickly in value. New companies, whose stock is sold 
in an ``initial public offering,'' often are riskier investments. Try to 
find out if the shares the salesperson wants to sell you are part of 
such an offering. Your salesperson must give you a ``prospectus'' in an 
initial public offering, but the financial condition shown in the 
prospectus of new companies can change very quickly.
    4. Know the brokerage firm and the salespeople with whom you are 
dealing. Because of the nature of the market for penny stock, you may 
have to rely solely on the original brokerage firm that sold you the 
stock for prices and to buy the stock back from you. Ask the National 
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) or your state securities 
regulator, which is a member of the North American Securities 
Administrators Association, Inc. (NASAA), about the licensing and 
disciplinary record of the brokerage firm and the salesperson contacting 
you. The telephone numbers of the NASD and NASAA are listed on the first 
page of this document.
    5. Be cautious if your salesperson leaves the firm. If the 
salesperson who sold you the stock leaves his or her firm, the firm may 
reassign your account to a new salesperson. If you have problems, ask to 
speak to the firm's branch office manager or a compliance officer. 
Although the departing salesperson may ask you to transfer your stock to 
his or her new firm, you do not have to do so. Get information on the 
new firm. Be wary of requests to sell your securities when the 
salesperson transfers to a new firm. Also, you have the right to get 
your stock certificate from your selling firm. You do not have to leave 
the certificate with that firm or any other firm.

                               Your Rights

    Disclosures to you. Under penalty of federal law, your brokerage 
firm must tell you the following information at two different times--
before you agree to buy or sell a penny stock, and after the trade, by 
written confirmation: 
    <bullet> The bid and offer price quotes for penny stock, and the 
number of shares to which the quoted prices apply. The bid and offer 
quotes are the wholesale prices at which dealers trade among themselves. 
These prices give you an idea of the market value of the stock. The 
dealer must tell you these price quotes if they appear on an automated 
quotation system approved by the SEC. If not, the dealer must use its 
own quotes or trade prices. You should calculate the spread, the 
difference between the bid and offer quotes, to help decide if buying 
the stock is a good investment.
    A lack of quotes may mean that the market among dealers is not 
active. It thus may be difficult to resell the stock. You also should be 
aware that the actual price charged to you for the stock may differ from 
the price quoted to you for 100 shares. You should therefore determine, 
before you agree to a purchase, what the actual sales price (before the 
markup) will be for the exact number of shares you want to buy.
    <bullet> The brokerage firm's compensation for the trade. A markup 
is the amount a dealer adds to the wholesale offer price of the stock 
and a markdown is the amount it subtracts from the wholesale bid price 
of the stock as compensation. A markup/markdown usually serves the same 
role as a broker's commission on a trade. Most of the firms in the penny 
stock market will be dealers, not brokers.
    <bullet> The compensation received by the brokerage firm's 
salesperson for the trade. The brokerage firm must disclose to you, as a 
total sum, the cash compensation of your salesperson for the trade that 
is known at the time of the trade. The firm must describe in the written 
confirmation the nature of any other compensation of your salesperson 
that is unknown at the time of the trade.
    In addition to the items listed above, your brokerage firm must send 
to you:
    <bullet> Monthly account statements. In general, your brokerage firm 
must send you a monthly statement that gives an estimate of the value of 
each penny stock in your account, if there is enough information to make 
an estimate. If the firm has not bought or sold any penny stocks for 
your account for six months, it can provide these statements every three 
months.

[[Page 332]]

    A Written Statement of Your Financial Situation and Investment 
Goals. In general, unless you have had an account with your brokerage 
firm for more than one year, or you have previously bought three 
different penny stocks from that firm, your brokerage firm must send you 
a written statement for you to sign that accurately describes your 
financial situation, your investment experience, and your investment 
goals, and that contains a statement of why your firm decided that penny 
stocks are a suitable investment for you. The firm also must get your 
written consent to buy the penny stock.
    Legal remedies. If penny stocks are sold to you in violation of your 
rights listed above, or other federal or state securities laws, you may 
be able to cancel your purchase and get your money back. If the stocks 
are sold in a fraudulent manner, you may be able to sue the persons and 
firms that caused the fraud for damages. If you have signed an 
arbitration agreement, however, you may have to pursue your claim 
through arbitration. You may wish to contact an attorney. The SEC is not 
authorized to represent individuals in private litigation.
    However, to protect yourself and other investors, you should report 
any violations of your brokerage firm's duties listed above and other 
securities laws to the SEC, the NASD, or your state securities 
administrator at the telephone numbers on the first page of this 
document. These bodies have the power to stop fraudulent and abusive 
activity of salespersons and firms engaged in the securities business. 
Or you can write to the SEC at 450 Fifth St., NW., Washington, DC 20549; 
the NASD at 1735 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20006; or NASAA at 555 
New Jersey Avenue, NW., Suite 750, Washington, DC 20001. NASAA will give 
you the telephone number of your state's securities agency. If there is 
any disciplinary record of a person or a firm, the NASD, NASAA, or your 
state securities regulator will send you this information if you ask for 
it.

                           Market Information

    The market for penny stocks. Penny stocks usually are not listed on 
an exchange or quoted on the NASDAQ system. Instead, they are traded 
between dealers on the telephone in the ``over-the-counter'' market. The 
NASD's OTC Bulletin Board also will contain information on some penny 
stocks. At times, however, price information for these stocks is not 
publicly available.
    Market domination. In some cases, only one or two dealers, acting as 
``market makers,'' may be buying and selling a given stock. You should 
first ask if a firm is acting as a broker (your agent) or as a dealer. A 
dealer buys stock itself to fill your order or already owns the stock. A 
market maker is a dealer who holds itself out as ready to buy and sell 
stock on a regular basis. If the firm is a market maker, ask how many 
other market makers are dealing in the stock to see if the firm (or 
group of firms) dominates the market. When there are only one or two 
market makers, there is a risk that the dealer or group of dealers may 
control the market in that stock and set prices that are not based on 
competitive forces. In recent years, some market makers have created 
fraudulent markets in certain penny stocks, so that stock prices rose 
suddenly, but collapsed just as quickly, at a loss to investors.
    Mark-ups and mark-downs. The actual price that the customer pays 
usually includes the mark-up or mark-down. Markups and markdowns are 
direct profits for the firm and its salespeople, so you should be aware 
of such amounts to assess the overall value of the trade.
    The ``spread.'' The difference between the bid and offer price is 
the spread. Like a mark-up or mark-down, the spread is another source of 
profit for the brokerage firm and compensates the firm for the risk of 
owning the stock. A large spread can make a trade very expensive to an 
investor. For some penny stocks, the spread between the bid and offer 
may be a large part of the purchase price of the stock. Where the bid 
price is much lower than the offer price, the market value of the stock 
must rise substantially before the stock can be sold at a profit. 
Moreover, an investor may experience substantial losses if the stock 
must be sold immediately.
    Example: If the bid is $0.04 per share and the offer is $0.10 per 
share, the spread (difference) is $0.06, which appears to be a small 
amount. But you would lose $0.06 on every share that you bought for 
$0.10 if you had to sell that stock immediately to the same firm. If you 
had invested $5,000 at the $0.10 offer price, the market maker's 
repurchase price, at $0.04 bid, would be only $2,000; thus you would 
lose $3,000, or more than half of your investment, if you decided to 
sell the stock. In addition, you would have to pay compensation (a 
``mark-up,'' ``mark-down,'' or commission) to buy and sell the stock. 
\1/4\
    In addition to the amount of the spread, the price of your stock 
must rise enough to make up for the compensation that the dealer charged 
you when it first sold you the stock. Then, when you want to resell the 
stock, a dealer again will charge compensation, in the form of a 
markdown. The dealer subtracts the markdown from the price of the stock 
when it buys the stock from you. Thus, to make a profit, the bid price 
of your stock must rise above the amount of the original spread, the 
markup, and the markdown.
    Primary offerings. Most penny stocks are sold to the public on an 
ongoing basis. However, dealers sometimes sell these stocks in initial 
public offerings. You should pay special attention to stocks of 
companies that

[[Page 333]]

have never been offered to the public before, because the market for 
these stocks is untested. Because the offering is on a first-time basis, 
there is generally no market information about the stock to help 
determine its value. The federal securities laws generally require 
broker-dealers to give investors a ``prospectus,'' which contains 
information about the objectives, management, and financial condition of 
the issuer. In the absence of market information, investors should read 
the company's prospectus with special care to find out if the stocks are 
a good investment. However, the prospectus is only a description of the 
current condition of the company. The outlook of the start-up companies 
described in a prospectus often is very uncertain.

    (ii) That arises out of any activity, in any place subject to the

<R05>
Sec. 240.16a-1  Definition of Terms.

    Terms defined in this rule shall apply solely to section 16 of the 
Act and the rules thereunder. These terms shall not be limited to 
section 16(a) of the Act but also shall apply to all other subsections 
under section 16 of the Act.
    (a) The term beneficial owner shall have the following applications:
    (1) Solely for purposes of determining whether a person is a 
beneficial owner of more than ten percent of any class of equity 
securities registered pursuant to section 12 of the Act, the term 
``beneficial owner'' shall mean any person who is deemed a beneficial 
owner pursuant to section 13(d) of the Act and the rules thereunder; 
provided, however, that the following institutions or persons shall not 
be deemed the beneficial owner of securities of such class held for the 
benefit of third parties or in customer or fiduciary accounts in the 
ordinary course of business (or in the case of an employee benefit plan 
specified in paragraph (a)(1)(vi) of this section, of securities of such 
class allocated to plan participants where participants have voting 
power) as long as such shares are acquired by such institutions or 
persons without the purpose or effect of changing or influencing control 
of the issuer or engaging in any arrangement subject to Rule 13d-3(b) 
(Sec. 240.13d-3(b)):
    (i) A broker or dealer registered under Section 15 of the Act;
    (ii) A bank as defined in section 3(a)(6) of the Act;
    (iii) An insurance company as defined in section 3(a)(19) of the 
Act;

[[Page 341]]

    (iv) An investment company registered under section 8 of the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-8);
    (v) An investment adviser registered under section 203 of the 
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-3);
    (vi) An employee benefit plan or a pension fund which is subject to 
the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 
as amended, 29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq. (``Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act''), or an endowment fund;
    (vii) A parent holding company, provided the aggregate amount held 
directly by the parent, and directly and indirectly by its subsidiaries 
that are not persons specified in Sec. 240.16a-1(a)(1) (i) through (vi), 
does not exceed one percent of the securities of the subject class; and
    (viii) A group, provided that all the members are persons specified 
in Sec. 240.16a-1(a)(1) (i) through (vii).

    Note to paragraph (a). Pursuant to this section, a person deemed a 
beneficial owner of more than ten percent of any class of equity 
securities registered under section 12 of the Act would file a Form 3 
(Sec. 249.103), but the securities holdings disclosed on Form 3, and 
changes in beneficial ownership reported on subsequent Forms 4 
(Sec. 249.104) or 5 (Sec. 249.105), would be determined by the 
definition of ``beneficial owner'' in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

    (2) Other than for purposes of determining whether a person is a 
beneficial owner of more than ten percent of any class of equity 
securities registered under Section 12 of the Act, the term beneficial 
owner shall mean any person who, directly or indirectly, through any 
contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, has or 
shares a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in the equity securities, 
subject to the following:
    (i) The term pecuniary interest in any class of equity securities 
shall mean the opportunity, directly or indirectly, to profit or share 
in any profit derived from a transaction in the subject securities.
    (ii) The term indirect pecuniary interest in any class of equity 
securities shall include, but not be limited to:
    (A) Securities held by members of a person's immediate family 
sharing the same household; provided, however, that the presumption of 
such beneficial ownership may be rebutted; see also Sec. 240.16a-
1(a)(4);
    (B) A general partner's proportionate interest in the portfolio 
securities held by a general or limited partnership. The general 
partner's proportionate interest, as evidenced by the partnership 
agreement in effect at the time of the transaction and the partnership's 
most recent financial statements, shall be the greater of:
    (1) The general partner's share of the partnership's profits, 
including profits attributed to any limited partnership interests held 
by the general partner and any other interests in profits that arise 
from the purchase and sale of the partnership's portfolio securities; or
    (2) The general partner's share of the partnership capital account, 
including the share attributable to any limited partnership interest 
held by the general partner.
    (C) A performance-related fee, other than an asset-based fee, 
received by any broker, dealer, bank, insurance company, investment 
company, investment adviser, investment manager, trustee or person or 
entity performing a similar function; provided, however, that no 
pecuniary interest shall be present where:
    (1) The performance-related fee, regardless of when payable, is 
calculated based upon net capital gains and/or net capital appreciation 
generated from the portfolio or from the fiduciary's overall performance 
over a period of one year or more; and
    (2) Equity securities of the issuer do not account for more than ten 
percent of the market value of the portfolio. A right to a 
nonperformance-related fee alone shall not represent a pecuniary 
interest in the securities;
    (D) A person's right to dividends that is separated or separable 
from the underlying securities. Otherwise, a right to dividends alone 
shall not represent a pecuniary interest in the securities;
    (E) A person's interest in securities held by a trust, as specified 
in Sec. 240.16a-8(b); and
    (F) A person's right to acquire equity securities through the 
exercise or conversion of any derivative security, whether or not 
presently exercisable.

[[Page 342]]

    (iii) A shareholder shall not be deemed to have a pecuniary interest 
in the portfolio securities held by a corporation or similar entity in 
which the person owns securities if the shareholder is not a controlling 
shareholder of the entity and does not have or share investment control 
over the entity's portfolio.
    (3) Where more than one person subject to section 16 of the Act is 
deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same equity securities, all such 
persons must report as beneficial owners of the securities, either 
separately or jointly, as provided in Sec. 240.16a-3(j). In such cases, 
the amount of short-swing profit recoverable shall not be increased 
above the amount recoverable if there were only one beneficial owner.
    (4) Any person filing a statement pursuant to section 16(a) of the 
Act may state that the filing shall not be deemed an admission that such 
person is, for purposes of section 16 of the Act or otherwise, the 
beneficial owner of any equity securities covered by the statement.
    (5) The following interests are deemed not to confer beneficial 
ownership for purposes of section 16 of the Act:
    (i) Interests in portfolio securities held by any holding company 
registered under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 
U.S.C. 79a et seq.);
    (ii) Interests in portfolio securities held by any investment 
company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 
80a-1 et seq.); and
    (iii) Interests in securities comprising part of a broad-based, 
publicly traded market basket or index of stocks, approved for trading 
by the appropriate federal governmental authority.
    (b) The term call equivalent position shall mean a derivative 
security position that increases in value as the value of the underlying 
equity increases, including, but not limited to, a long convertible 
security, a long call option, and a short put option position.
    (c) The term derivative securities shall mean any option, warrant, 
convertible security, stock appreciation right, or similar right with an 
exercise or conversion privilege at a price related to an equity 
security, or similar securities with a value derived from the value of 
an equity security, but shall not include:
    (1) Rights of a pledgee of securities to sell the pledged 
securities;
    (2) Rights of all holders of a class of securities of an issuer to 
receive securities pro rata, or obligations to dispose of securities, as 
a result of a merger, exchange offer, or consolidation involving the 
issuer of the securities;
    (3) Rights or obligations to surrender a security, or have a 
security withheld, upon the receipt or exercise of a derivative security 
or the receipt or vesting of equity securities, in order to satisfy the 
exercise price or the tax withholding consequences of receipt, exercise 
or vesting;
    (4) Interests in broad-based index options, broad-based index 
futures, and broad-based publicly traded market baskets of stocks 
approved for trading by the appropriate federal governmental authority;
    (5) Interests or rights to participate in employee benefit plans of 
the issuer;
    (6) Rights with an exercise or conversion privilege at a price that 
is not fixed; or
    (7) Options granted to an underwriter in a registered public 
offering for the purpose of satisfying over-allotments in such offering.
    (d) The term equity security of such issuer shall mean any equity 
security or derivative security relating to an issuer, whether or not 
issued by that issuer.
    (e) The term immediate family shall mean any child, stepchild, 
grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-
law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or 
sister-in-law, and shall include adoptive relationships.
    (f) The term ``officer'' shall mean an issuer's president, principal 
financial officer, principal accounting officer (or, if there is no such 
accounting officer, the controller), any vice-president of the issuer in 
charge of a principal business unit, division or function (such as 
sales, administration or finance), any other officer who performs a 
policy-making function, or any other person who performs similar policy-
making functions for the issuer. Officers of the

[[Page 343]]

issuer's parent(s) or subsidiaries shall be deemed officers of the 
issuer if they perform such policy-making functions for the issuer. In 
addition, when the issuer is a limited partnership, officers or 
employees of the general partner(s) who perform policy-making functions 
for the limited partnership are deemed officers of the limited 
partnership. When the issuer is a trust, officers or employees of the 
trustee(s) who perform policy-making functions for the trust are deemed 
officers of the trust.

    Note: ``Policy-making function'' is not intended to include policy-
making functions that are not significant. If pursuant to Item 401(b) of 
Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.401(b)) the issuer identifies a person as an 
``executive officer,'' it is presumed that the Board of Directors has 
made that judgment and that the persons so identified are the officers 
for purposes of Section 16 of the Act, as are such other persons 
enumerated in this paragraph (f) but not in Item 401(b).

    (g) The term portfolio securities shall mean all securities owned by 
an entity, other than securities issued by the entity.
    (h) The term put equivalent position shall mean a derivative 
security position that increases in value as the value of the underlying 
equity decreases, including, but not limited to, a long put option and a 
short call option position.

<R05>
Sec. 240.16a-2  Persons and transactions subject to section 16.

    Any person who is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 
more than ten percent of any class of equity securities (``ten percent 
beneficial owner'') registered pursuant to section 12 of the Act, any 
director or officer of the issuer of such securities, and any person 
specified in section 17(a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 
1935 or section 30(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, including 
any person specified in Sec. 240.16a-8, shall be subject to the 
provisions of section 16 of the Act. The rules under section 16 of the 
Act apply to any class of equity securities of an issuer whether or not 
registered under section 12 of the Act. The rules under section 16 of 
the Act also apply to non-equity securities as provided by the Public 
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and the Investment Company Act of 
1940. With respect to transactions by persons subject to section 16 of 
the Act:
    (a) A transaction(s) carried out by a director or officer in the six 
months prior to the director or officer becoming subject to section 16 
of the Act shall be subject to section 16 of the Act and reported on the 
first required Form 4 only if the transaction(s) occurred within six 
months of the transaction giving rise to the Form 4 filing obligation 
and the director or officer became subject to section 16 of the Act 
solely as a result of the issuer registering a class of equity 
securities pursuant to section 12 of the Act.
    (b) A transaction(s) following the cessation of director or officer 
status shall be subject to section 16 of the Act only if:
    (1) Executed within a period of less than six months of an opposite 
transaction subject to section 16(b) of the Act that occurred while that 
person was a director or officer; and
    (2) Not otherwise exempted from section 16(b) of the Act pursuant to 
the provisions of this chapter.

    Note to Paragraph (b): For purposes of this paragraph, an 
acquisition and a disposition each shall be an opposite transaction with 
respect to the other.
    (c) The transaction that results in a person becoming a ten percent 
beneficial owner is not subject to section 16 of the Act unless the 
person otherwise is subject to section 16 of the Act. A ten percent 
beneficial owner not otherwise subject to section 16 of the Act must 
report only those transactions conducted while the beneficial owner of 
more than ten percent of a class of equity securities of the issuer 
registered pursuant to section 12 of the Act.
    (d)(1) Transactions by a person or entity shall be exempt from the 
provisions of section 16 of the Act for the 12 months following 
appointment and qualification, to the extent such person or entity is 
acting as:
    (i) Executor or administrator of the estate of a decedent;
    (ii) Guardian or member of a committee for an incompetent;

[[Page 344]]

    (iii) Receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, assignee for the benefit of 
creditors, conservator, liquidating agent, or other similar person duly 
authorized by law to administer the estate or assets of another person; 
or
    (iv) Fiduciary in a similar capacity.
    (2) Transactions by such person or entity acting in a capacity 
specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section after the period specified 
in that paragraph shall be subject to section 16 of the Act only where 
the estate, trust or other entity is a beneficial owner of more than ten 
percent of any class of equity security registered pursuant to section 
12 of the Act.

national securities exchange may designate one exchange as the only 
exchange with which reports pursuant to section 16(a) of the Act need be 
filed. Such designation shall be made in writing and shall be filed with 
the Commission and with each national securities exchange on which any 
equity security of the issuer is listed at the time of such election. 
The reporting person's obligation to file reports with each national 
securities exchange on which any equity security of the issuer is listed 
shall be satisfied by filing with the exchange so designated.
    (d) Any person required to file a statement with respect to 
securities of a single issuer under both section 16(a) of the Act and 
either section 17(a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 
or section 30(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 may file a single 
statement containing the required information, which will be deemed to 
be filed under both Acts.
    (e) Any person required to file a statement under section 16(a) of 
the Act shall, not later than the time the statement is transmitted for

of such a designation, to the issuer's corporate secretary or person 
performing equivalent functions.
    (f)(1) A Form 5 shall be filed by every person who at any time 
during the issuer's fiscal year was subject to section 16 of the Act 
with respect to such issuer, except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of 
this section. The Form shall be filed within 45 days after the issuer's 
fiscal year end, and shall disclose the following holdings and 
transactions not reported previously on Forms 3, 4 or 5:
    (i) All transactions during the most recent fiscal year that were 
exempt from section 16(b) of the Act, except:
    (A) Exercises and conversions of derivative securities exempt under 
either Sec. 240.16b-3 or Sec. 240.16b-6(b) (these are required to be 
reported on Form 4);
    (B) Transactions exempt from section 16(b) of the Act pursuant to 
Sec. 240.16b-3(c), which shall be exempt from section 16(a) of the Act; 
and
    (C) Transactions exempt from section 16(a) of the Act pursuant to 
another rule;
    (ii) Transactions that constituted small acquisitions pursuant to 
Sec. 240.16a-6(a);
    (iii) All holdings and transactions that should have been reported 
during

[[Page 345]]

the most recent fiscal year, but were not; and
    (iv) With respect to the first Form 5 requirement for a reporting 
person, all holdings and transactions that should have been reported in 
each of the issuer's last two fiscal years but were not, based on the 
reporting person's reasonable belief in good faith in the completeness 
and accuracy of the information.
    (2) Notwithstanding the above, no Form 5 shall be required where all 
transactions otherwise required to be reported on the Form 5 have been 
reported before the due date of the Form 5.

    Note: Persons no longer subject to section 16 of the Act, but who 
were subject to the Section at any time during the issuer's fiscal year, 
must file a Form 5 unless paragraph (f)(2) is satisfied. See also 
Sec. 240.16a-2(b) regarding the reporting obligations of persons ceasing 
to be officers or directors.

    (g) (1) A Form 4 shall be filed to report all transactions not 
exempt from section 16(b) of the Act and all exercises and conversions 
of derivative securities, regardless of whether exempt from section 
16(b) of the Act.
    (2) At the option of the reporting person, transactions that are 
reportable on Form 5 may be reported on Form 4, provided that the Form 4 
is filed no later than the due date of the Form 5 with respect to the 
fiscal year in which the transaction occurred.
    (h) The date of filing with the Commission shall be the date of 
receipt by the Commission; Provided, however, That a Form 3, 4, or 5 
shall be deemed to have been timely filed if the filing person 
establishes that the Form had been transmitted timely to a third party 
company or governmental entity providing delivery services in the 
ordinary course of business, which guaranteed delivery of the filing to 
the Commission no later than the required filing date.
    (i) Signatures. Where Section 16 of the Act, or the rules or forms 
thereunder, require a document filed with or furnished to the Commission 
to be signed, such document shall be manually signed, or signed using 
either typed signatures or duplicated or facsimile versions of manual 
signatures. Where typed, duplicated or facsimile signatures are used, 
each signatory to the filing shall manually sign a signature page or 
other document authenticating, acknowledging or otherwise adopting his 
or her signature that appears in the filing. Such document shall be 
executed before or at the time the filing is made and shall be retained 
by the filer for a period of five years. Upon request, the filer shall 
furnish to the Commission or its staff a copy of any or all documents 
retained pursuant to this section.
    (j) Where more than one person subject to section 16 of the Act is 
deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same equity securities, all such 
persons must report as beneficial owners of the securities, either 
separately or jointly. Where persons in a group are deemed to be 
beneficial owners of equity securities pursuant to Sec. 240.16a-1(a)(1) 
due to the aggregation of holdings, a single Form 3, 4 or 5 may be filed 
on behalf of all persons in the group. Joint and group filings must 
include all required information for each beneficial owner, and such 
filings must be signed by each beneficial owner, or on behalf of such 
owner by an authorized person.

Sec. 240.16a-8  Trusts.

    (a) Persons subject to section 16--(1) Trusts.  A trust shall be 
subject to section 16 of the Act with respect to securities of the 
issuer if the trust is a beneficial owner, pursuant to Sec. 240.16a-
1(a)(1), of more than ten percent of any class of equity securities of 
the issuer registered pursuant to section 12 of the Act (``ten percent 
beneficial owner'').

1(a)(1), of more than ten percent of any class of equity securities of 
the issuer registered pursuant to section 12 of the Act (``ten percent 
beneficial owner''); or
    (ii) The trustee otherwise is subject to section 16 of the Act and 
exercises or

[[Page 347]]

shares investment control over the issuer's securities held by the 
trust, and either the trustee or a member of the trustee's immediate 
family has a pecuniary interest in the issuer's securities held by the 
trust, except where the trustee is:
    (A) An entity or person that in the ordinary course of business acts 
as trustee, and is specified in Sec. 240.16a-1(a)(1) (i) through (viii); 
or
    (B) An officer or director of the issuer serving as trustee for the 
issuer's employee benefit plan trust.
    (2) Trustees, beneficiaries, and settlors. In determining whether a 
trustee, beneficiary, or settlor is a ten percent beneficial owner with 
respect to the issuer:
    (i) Such persons shall be deemed the beneficial owner of the 
issuer's securities held by the trust, to the extent specified by 
Sec. 240.16a-1(a)(1); and
    (ii) Settlors shall be deemed the beneficial owner of the issuer's 
securities held by the trust where they have the power to revoke the 
trust without the consent of another person.
    (b) Trust Holdings and Transactions. Holdings and transactions in 
the issuer's securities held by a trust shall be reported by the trustee 
on behalf of the trust, if the trust is subject to section 16 of the 
Act, except as provided below. Holdings and transactions in the issuer's 
securities held by a trust (whether or not subject to section 16 of the 
Act) may be reportable by other parties as follows:
    (1) Trusts.  The trust need not report holdings and transactions in 
the issuer's securities held by the trust in an employee benefit plan 
subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act over which no 
trustee exercises investment control.
    (2) Trustees. If, as provided by Sec. 240.16a-1(a)(2), a trustee 
subject to section 16 of the Act has a pecuniary interest in any holding 
or transaction in the issuer's securities held by the trust, such 
holding or transaction shall be attributed to the trustee and shall be 
reported by the trustee in the trustee's individual capacity, as well as 
on behalf of the trust. With respect to performance fees and holdings of 
the trustee's immediate family, trustees shall be deemed to have a 
pecuniary interest in the trust holdings and transactions in the 
following circumstances:
    (i) A performance fee is received that does not meet the proviso of 
Sec. 240.16a-1(a)(2)(ii)(C); or
    (ii) At least one beneficiary of the trust is a member of the 
trustee's immediate family. The pecuniary interest of the immediate 
family member(s) shall be attributed to and reported by the trustee.
    (3) Beneficiaries. A beneficiary subject to section 16 of the Act 
shall have or share reporting obligations with respect to transactions 
in the issuer's securities held by the trust, if the beneficiary is a 
beneficial owner of the securities pursuant to Sec. 240.16a-1(a)(2), as 
follows:
    (i) If a beneficiary shares investment control with the trustee with 
respect to a trust transaction, the transaction shall be attributed to 
and reported by both the beneficiary and the trust;
    (ii) If a beneficiary has investment control with respect to a trust 
transaction without consultation with the trustee, the transaction shall 
be attributed to and reported by the beneficiary only; and
    (iii) In making a determination as to whether a beneficiary is the 
beneficial owner of the securities pursuant to Sec. 240.16a-1(a)(2), 
beneficiaries shall be deemed to have a pecuniary interest in the 
issuer's securities held by the trust to the extent of their pro rata 
interest in the trust where the trustee does not exercise exclusive 
investment control.

    Note to Paragraph (b)(3): Transactions and holdings attributed to a 
trust beneficiary may be reported by the trustee on behalf of the 
beneficiary, provided that the report is signed by the beneficiary or 
other authorized person. Where the transactions and holdings are 
attributed both to the trustee and trust beneficiary, a joint report may 
be filed in accordance with Sec. 240.16a-3(j).
    (4) Settlors. If a settlor subject to section 16 of the Act reserves 
the right to revoke the trust without the consent of another person, the 
trust holdings and transactions shall be attributed to and reported by 
the settlor instead of the trust; Provided, however, That if the settlor 
does not exercise or share investment control over the issuer's 
securities held by the trust, the trust

[[Page 348]]

holdings and transactions shall be attributed to and reported by the 
trust instead of the settlor.
    (c) Remainder interests.  Remainder interests in a trust are deemed 
not to confer beneficial ownership for purposes of section 16 of the 
Act, provided that the persons with the remainder interests have no 
power, directly or indirectly, to exercise or share investment control 
over the trust.
    (d) A trust, trustee, beneficiary or settlor becoming subject to 
section 16(a) of the Act pursuant to this rule also shall be subject to 
sections 16(b) and 16(c) of the Act.

    (b) The closing of a derivative security position as a result of its

or conversion shall be exempt from the operation of section 16(b) of the 
Act, and the acquisition of underlying securities at a fixed exercise 
price due to the exercise or conversion of a call equivalent position or 
the disposition of underlying securities at a fixed exercise price due 
to the exercise of a put equivalent position shall be exempt from the 
operation of section 16(b) of the Act: Provided, however, That the 
acquisition of underlying securities from the exercise of an out-of-the-
money option, warrant, or right shall not be exempt unless the exercise 
is necessary to comport with the sequential exercise provisions of the 
Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 422A).

    Note to Paragraph (b):The exercise or conversion of a derivative 
security that does not satisfy the conditions of this section is 
eligible for exemption from section 16(b) of the Act to the extent that 
the conditions of Sec. 240.16b-3 are satisfied.

    (c) In determining the short-swing profit recoverable pursuant to 
section 16(b) of the Act from transactions involving the purchase and 
sale or sale and purchase of derivative and other securities, the 
following rules apply:
    (1) Short-swing profits in transactions involving the purchase and 
sale or sale and purchase of derivative securities that have identical 
characteristics (e.g., purchases and sales of call options of the same 
strike price and expiration date, or purchases and sales of the same 
series of convertible debentures) shall be measured by the actual prices 
paid or received in the short-swing transactions.
    (2) Short-swing profits in transactions involving the purchase and 
sale or sale and purchase of derivative securities having different 
characteristics but related to the same underlying security (e.g., the 
purchase of a call option and the sale of a convertible debenture) or 
derivative securities and underlying securities shall not exceed the 
difference in price of the underlying security on the date of purchase 
or sale and the date of sale or purchase. Such profits may be measured 
by calculating the short-swing profits that would have been realized had 
the subject transactions involved purchases and sales solely of the 
derivative security that was purchased or solely of the derivative 
security that was sold, valued as of the time of the matching purchase 
or sale, and calculated for the lesser of the number of underlying 
securities actually purchased or sold.
    (d) Upon cancellation or expiration of an option within six months 
of the writing of the option, any profit derived from writing the option 
shall be recoverable under section 16(b) of the Act. The profit shall 
not exceed the premium received for writing the option. The disposition 
or closing of a long derivative security position, as a result of 
cancellation or expiration, shall be exempt from section 16(b) of the 
Act where no value is received from the cancellation or expiration.

15 U.S.C. 78o), such person shall, for the remainder of the periods of 
time specified in this section, continue to preserve the records which 
he theretofore preserved pursuant to this section.

to the provisions of Secs. 240.17a-3 and 240.17a-4 are prepared or 
maintained by an outside service bureau, depository, bank which does not 
operate pursuant to Sec. 240.17a-3(b)(2), or other recordkeeping service

to this paragraph (a) shall be deemed to be confidential.
    (4) The provisions of paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section 
shall not apply to a member of a national securities exchange or a 
registered national securities association if said exchange or 
association maintains records containing the information required by

the applicable parts of Form X-17A-5 (Sec. 249.617 of this chapter) as 
to such member, pursuant to a plan, the procedures and provisions of 
which have been submitted to and declared effective by the Commission. 
Any such plan filed by a national securities exchange or a registered

responsibilities under the provisions of the Act, declares the plan to 
be effective. Further, the Commission, in declaring any such plan 
effective, may impose such terms and conditions relating to the

granted.
    (b) Report filed upon termination of membership interest. (1) If a 
broker or dealer holding any membership interest in a national

broker or dealer shall, within two business days after such event, file 
with the Commission Part II or Part IIA of Form X-17A-5 (Sec. 249.617 of 
this chapter) as determined by the standards set forth in paragraphs 
(a)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section as of the date of such event. The 
report shall be filed at the Commission's principal office in 
Washington, DC, and with the regional or district office of the 
Commission for the region or district in which the broker or dealer has 
its principal place of business: Provided, however, That such report 
need not be made or filed if the Commission, upon written request or 
upon its own motion, exempts such broker or dealer, either 
unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, from such 
requirement: Provided, further, That the Commission may, upon request of 
the broker or dealer, grant extensions of time for filing the report

    (2) Attached to the report required by paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section shall be an oath or affirmation that to the best knowledge and 
belief of the individual making such oath or affirmation the information 
contained in the report is true and correct. The oath or affirmation 
shall be made before a person duly authorized to administer such oath or 
affirmation. If the broker or dealer is a sole proprietorship, the oath 
or affirmation shall be made by the proprietor; if a partnership, by a 
general partner; or if a corporation by the chief executive officer, or, 
in his absence, by the person authorized to act in his place.
    (3) For the purposes of this paragraph (b) ``membership interest''

[[Page 364]]

allied membership, associated membership, floor privileges, and any 
other interest that entitles a broker or dealer to the exercise of any 
privilege on an exchange or with an association.
    (4) For the purposes of this paragraph (b), any broker or dealer 
shall be deemed to have ceased to be a member in good standing of such 
exchange or association when he has resigned, withdrawn, or been 
suspended or expelled from a membership interest in such exchange or 
association, or has directly or through any associated person sold or 
entered into an agreement for the sale of a membership interest which 
would on consummation thereof result in the termination of the broker's 
or dealer's membership interest in such exchange or association.
    (5) Whenever any national securities exchange or registered national 
securities association takes any action which causes any broker or 
dealer which is a member of such exchange or association to cease to be 
a member in good standing of such exchange or association or when such 
exchange or association learns of any action by such member of any other 
person which causes such broker or dealer to cease to be a member in 
good standing of such exchange or association, such exchange or 
associaton shall report such action promptly to the Commission, 
furnishing information as to the circumstances surrounding the event, 
and shall send a copy of such notification to the broker or dealer and 
notify such broker or dealer of its responsibilities under this 
paragraph (b).
    (6) One copy of the annual audit report shall be filed at the 
regional office of the Commission for the region in which the broker or 
dealer has its principal place of business and the principal office of 
the designated examining authority for said broker or dealer. Two copies

dealer, to obtain information relative to its financial condition.
    (4) The broker or dealer shall file with the report a supplemental 
report which shall be covered by an opinion of the independent public 
accountant on the status of the membership of the broker or dealer in 
the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (``SIPC'') if, pursuant 
to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a report of the broker or dealer is 
required to be covered by an opinion of a certified public accountant or 
a public accountant who is in fact independent. The supplemental report 
shall cover the SIPC annual general assessment reconciliation or

of the report required by paragraph (d) of this section: Provided, That 
the broker or dealer need not file the supplemental report on the SIPC 
annual general assessment reconciliation or exclusion from membership

original of which shall be submitted to the regional or district office 
of the Commission for the region or district in which the broker or 
dealer has its principal place of business, the Commission's principal 
office in Washington, the principal office of the designated examining

Membership (Form SIPC-3) was filed, and

[[Page 368]]

    (iii) An accountant's report which shall state that in the 
accountant's opinion either the assessments were determined fairly in 
accordance with applicable instructions and forms, or that a claim for 
exclusion from membership was consistent with income reported. If 
exceptions are noted, the accountant shall state any corrective action 
taken or proposed. The accountant's review on which his report is based 
shall include as a minimum the following procedures:
    (A) Comparison of listed assessment payments with respective cash 
disbursements record entries;
    (B) For all or any portion of a fiscal year ending in 1976 and each 
fiscal year thereafter, comparison of amounts reflected in the annual 
report as required by paragraph (d) of this section, with amounts

    (E) Comparison of the amount of any overpayment applied with the 
Form SIPC-7 on which it was computed; or
    (F) If exclusion from membership is claimed, the accountant shall 
review the annual report required by paragraph (d) of this section for 
all or any portion of a fiscal year ending in 1976 and each fiscal year 
thereafter to ascertain that the Certification of Exclusion from 
Membership (Form SIPC-7) was consistent with the income reported.
    (f)(1) Qualification of accountants. The Commission will not 
recognize any person as a certified public accountant who is not duly 
registered and in good standing as such under the laws of his place of 
residence or principal office. The Commission will not recognize any 
person as a public accountant who is not in good standing and entitled 
to practice as such under the laws of his place of residence or 
principal office.
    (2) Designation of accountant. (i) Every broker or dealer which is 
required by paragraph (d) of this section to file an annual report of 
financial statements section shall file no later than December 10 of 
each year a statement with the Commission's principal office in 
Washington, DC, the regional or district office of the Commission for 
the region or district in which its principal place of business is

for such broker or dealer. Such statement shall indicate the existence 
of an agreement dated no later than December first, with an independent 
public accountant covering a contractual commitment to conduct the 
broker's or dealer's annual audit during the following calendar year.
    (ii) The agreement may be of a continuing nature, providing for 
successive yearly audits, in which case no further filing is required.

chapter.
    (4) Replacement of accountant. A broker or dealer shall file a 
notice

[[Page 369]]

which must be received by the Commission's principal office in 
Washington, DC, the regional or district office of the Commission for 
the region or district in which its principal place of business is 
located, and the principal office of the designated examining authority 
for such broker or dealer, not more than 15 business days after:
    (i) The broker or dealer has notified the accountant whose opinion 
covered the most recent financial statements filed under paragraph (d) 
of this section that his services will not be utilized in future 
engagements; or
    (ii) The broker or dealer has notified an accountant who was engaged 
to give an opinion covering the financial statements to be filed under 
paragraph (d) of this section that the engagement has been terminated; 
or
    (iii) An accountant has notified the broker or dealer that he would 
not continue under an engagement to give an opinion covering the 
financial statements to be filed under paragraph (d) of this section; or
    (iv) A new accountant has been engaged to give an opinion covering 
the financial statements to be filed under paragraph (d) of this section 
without any notice of termination having been given to or by the 
previously engaged accountant.

Such notice shall state (A) the date of notification of the termination 
of the engagement or engagement of the new accountant as applicable and 
(B) the details of any problems existing during the 24 months (or the 
period of the engagement, if less) preceding such termination or new 
engagement relating to any matter of accounting principles or practices, 
financial statement disclosure, auditing scope or procedure, or 
compliance with applicable rules of the Commission, which problems, if 
not resolved to the satisfaction of the former accountant, would have 
caused him to make reference to them in connection with his report on 
the subject matter of the problems. The problems required to be reported 
in response to the preceding sentence include both those resolved to the 
former accountant's satisfaction and those not resolved to the former 
accountant's satisfaction. Problems contemplated by this section are 
those which occur at the decisionmaking level--i.e., between principal 
financial officers of the broker-dealer and personnel of the accounting 
firm responsible for rendering its report. The notice shall also state 
whether the accountant's report on the financial statements for any of 
the past two years contained an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of 
opinion or was qualified as to uncertainties, audit scope, or accounting 
principles, and describe the nature of each such adverse opinion, 
disclaimer of opinion, or qualification. The broker or dealer shall also 
request the former accountant to furnish the broker or dealer with a 
letter addressed to the Commission stating whether he agrees with the 
statements contained in the notice of the broker or dealer and, if not, 
stating the respects in which he does not agree. The broker or dealer 
shall file three copies of the notice and the accountant's letter, one 
copy of which shall be manually signed by the sole proprietor, or a 
general partner or a duly authorized corporate officer, as appropriate, 
and by the accountant, respectively.
    (g) Audit objectives. (1) The audit shall be made in accordance with 
generally accepted auditing standards and shall include a review of the 
accounting system, the internal accounting control and procedures for 
safeguarding securities including appropriate tests thereof for the 
period since the prior examination date. The audit shall include all 
procedures necessary under the circumstances to enable the independent 
public accountant to express an opinion on the statement of financial 
condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the Computation of Net 
Capital under Sec. 240.15c3-1, the Computation for Determination of 
Reserve Requirements for Brokers or Dealers under Exhibit A of 
Sec. 240.15c3-3, and Information Relating to the Possession or Control 
Requirements under Sec. 240.15c3-3. The scope of the audit and review of 
the accounting system, the internal control and procedures for 
safeguarding securities shall be sufficient to provide reasonable 
assurance that any material inadequacies existing at the date of the 
examination in.
    (i) The accounting system;
    (ii) The internal accounting controls;

[[Page 370]]

    (iii) Procedures for safeguarding securities; and
    (iv) In obtaining and maintaining physical possession or control of 
all fully paid and excess margin securities of customers as required by 
Sec. 240.15c3-3. Such review shall include a determination as to the 
adequacy of the procedures described in the records required to be 
maintained pursuant to Sec. 240.15c3-3(d)(4).
    (2) If the broker or dealer is exempt from Sec. 240.15c3-3, the 
independent public accountant shall ascertain that the conditions of the 
exemption were being complied with as of the examination date and that 
no facts came to his attention to indicate that the exemption had not 
been complied with during the period since his last examination.
    (3) A material inadequacy in the accounting system, internal 
accounting controls, procedures for safeguarding securities, and 
practices and procedures referred to in paragraph (g)(1) of this section 
which is expected to be reported under these audit objectives includes 
any condition which has contributed substantially to or, if appropriate 
corrective action is not taken, could reasonably be expected to (i) 
inhibit a broker or dealer from promptly completing securities 
transactions or promptly discharging his responsibilities to customers, 
other broker-dealers or creditors; (ii) result in material financial 
loss; (iii) result in material misstatements of the broker's or dealer's 
financial statements; or (iv) result in violations of the Commission's 
recordkeeping or financial responsibility rules to an extent that could 
reasonably be expected to result in the conditions described in 
paragraphs (g)(3) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section.
    (h) Extent and timing of audit procedures. (1) The extent and timing 
of audit procedures are matters for the independent public accountant to 
determine on the basis of his review and evaluation of existing internal 
controls and other audit procedures performed in accordance with 
generally accepted auditing standards and the audit objectives set forth 
in paragraph (g) of this section. In determining the extent of testing, 
consideration shall be given to the materiality of an area and the 
possible effect on the financial statements and schedules of a material 
misstatement in a related account. The performance of auditing 
procedures involves the proper synchronization of their application and 
thus comprehends the need to consider simultaneous performance of 
procedures in certain areas such as, for example, securities counts, 
transfer verification and customer and broker confirmation in connection 
with verification of securities positions.
    (2) If, during the course of the audit or interim work, the 
independent public accountant determines that any material inadequacies 
exist in the accounting system, internal accounting control, procedures 
for safeguarding securities, or as otherwise defined in paragraph (g)(3) 
of this section, then the independent public accountant shall call it to 
the attention of the chief financial officer of the broker or dealer, 
who shall have a responsibility to inform the Commission and the 
designated examining authority by telegraphic or facsimile notice within 
24 hours thereafter as set forth in Sec. 240.17a-11 (e) and (g). The 
broker or dealer shall also furnish the accountant with a copy of said 
notice to the Commission by telegram or facsimile within said 24 hour 
period. If the accountant fails to receive such notice from the broker 
or dealer within said 24 hour period, or if the accountant disagrees 
with the statements contained in the notice of the broker or dealer, the 
accountant shall have a responsibility to inform the Commission and the 
designated examining authority by report of material inadequacy within 
24 hours thereafter as set forth in Sec. 240.17a-11(g). Such report from 
the accountant shall, if the broker or dealer failed to file a notice, 
describe any material inadequacies found to exist. If the broker or 
dealer filed a notice, the accountant shall file a report detailing the 
aspects, if any, of the broker's or dealer's notice with which the 
accountant does not agree.
    (i) Accountant's reports, general provisions--(1) Technical 
requirements. The accountant's report shall:

and schedules covered by the report.
    (2) Representations as to the audit. The accountant's report shall:
    (i) State whether the audit was made in accordance with generally

    (ii) State whether the accountant reviewed the procedures followed 
for safeguarding securities; and
    (iii) Designate any auditing procedures deemed necessary by the 
accountant under the circumstances of the particular case which have 
been omitted, and the reason for their omission.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to imply authority for the 
omission of any procedure which independent accountants would ordinarily 
employ in the course of an audit made for the purpose of expressing the 
opinions required under this section.
    (3) Opinion to be expressed. The accountant's report shall state 
clearly the opinion of the accountant: (i) In respect of the financial 
statements and schedules covered by the report and the accounting 
principles and practices reflected therein; and (ii) as to the 
consistency of the application of the accounting principles, or as to 
any changes in such principles which have a material effect on the 
financial statements.
    (4) Exceptions. Any matters to which the accountant takes exception 
shall be clearly identified, the exception thereto specifically and 
clearly stated, and, to the extent practicable, the effect of each such 
exception on the related financial statements given.
    (5) Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the terms audit 
(or examination), accountant's report, and certified shall have the 
meanings given in Sec. 210.1-02 of this chapter.
    (j) Accountant's report on material inadequacies. The broker or 
dealer shall file concurrently with the annual audit report a 
supplemental report by the accountant describing any material 
inadequacies found to exist or found to have existed since the date of 
the previous audit. The supplemental report shall indicate any 
corrective action taken or proposed by the broker or dealer in regard 
thereto. If the audit did not disclose any material inadequacies, the 
supplemental report shall so state.
    (k) Use of certain statements filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. At the request of any broker or dealer who is (1) an 
investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, 
or (2) a sponsor or depositor of such a registered investment company 
who effects transactions in securities only with, or on behalf of, such 
registered investment company, the Commission will accept the financial 
statements filed pursuant to section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 or section 30 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder as a filing 
pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. Such a filing shall be deemed 
to satisfy the requirements of this section for any calendar year in 
which such financial statements are filed, provided that the statements 
so filed meet the requirements of the other rules under which they are 
filed with respect to time of filing and content.
    (l) Extentions and exemptions. (1) A broker's or dealer's designated 
examining authority may extend the period under paragraph (d) of this 
section for filing annual audit reports. The designated examining 
authority for the broker or dealer shall maintain, in the manner 
prescribed in Sec. 240.17a-1, a record of each extension granted.

    (m) Notification of change of fiscal year. (1) In the event any 
broker or dealer finds it necessary to change its

Washington, DC, the regional or district office of the Commission for 
the region or district in which the broker or dealer has its principal 
place of business and the principal office of the designated examining

annual report required by paragraph (a) of this section within the time 
specified without undue hardship, it may file with the Commission's 
principal office in Washington, DC, prior to the date upon which the 
report is due, an application for an extension of time to a specified

broker or dealer (other than a member) who transacts a business in 
securities through the medium of any member of a national securities 
exchange, and every broker or dealer registered pursuant to section 15 
of the Act; except that a broker or dealer meeting all of the following 
conditions shall be exempt from the provisions of this section:
    (1) His dealer transactions (as principal for his own account) are 
limited to the purchase, sale, and redemption of redeemable shares of 
registered investment companies or of interests or participations in an 
insurance company separate account, whether or not registered as an 
investment company; except that a broker or dealer transacting business 
as a sole proprietor may also effect occasional transactions in other 
securities for his own account with or through another registered 
broker-dealer;
    (2) His transactions as broker (agent) are limited to:
    (i) The sale and redemption of redeemable securities of registered 
investment companies or of interests or participations in an insurance 
company separate account, whether or not registered as an investment 
company;
    (ii) The solicitation of share accounts for savings and loan 
associations insured by an instrumentality of the United States; and
    (iii) The sale of securities for the account of a customer to obtain 
funds for immediate reinvestment in redeemable securities of registered 
investment companies; and
    (3) He promptly transmits all funds and delivers all securities 
received in connection with his activities as a broker or dealer, and 
does not otherwise hold funds or securities for, or owe money or 
securities to, customers.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this rule shall not apply to any 
insurance company which is a registered broker-dealer, and which 
otherwise meets all of the conditions in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) 
of this section, solely by reason of its participation in transactions 
that are a part of the business of insurance, including the purchasing, 
selling, or holding of securities for or on behalf of such company's 
general and separate accounts.
    (b) Any member, broker, or dealer who is subject to the provisions 
of this rule shall at least once in each calendar quarter-year:
    (1) Physically examine and count all securities held including 
securities that are the subjects of repurchase or reverse repurchase 
agreements;
    (2) Account for all securities in transfer, in transit, pledged, 
loaned, borrowed, deposited, failed to receive, failed to deliver, 
subject to repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements or otherwise 
subject to his control or direction but not in his physical possession 
by examination and comparison of the supporting detail records with the 
appropriate ledger control accounts;
    (3) Verify all securities in transfer, in transit, pledge, loaned, 
borrowed, deposited, failed to receive, failed to deliver, subject to 
repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements or otherwise subject to his 
control or direction but not in his physical possession, where such 
securities have been in said status for longer than thirty days;
    (4) Compare the results of the count and verification with his 
records; and

[[Page 377]]

    (5) Record on the books and records of the member, broker, or dealer 
all unresolved differences setting forth the security involved and date 
of comparison in a security count difference account no later than 7 
business days after the date of each required quarterly security 
examination, count, and verification in accordance with the requirements 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section. Provided, however, That no 
examination, count, verification, and comparison for the purpose of this 
section shall be within 2 months of or more than 4 months following a 
prior examination, count, verification, and comparison made hereunder.
    (c) The examination, count, verification, and comparison may be made 
either as of a date certain or on a cyclical basis covering the entire 
list of securities. In either case the recordation shall be effected 
within 7 business days subsequent to the examination, count, 
verification, and comparison of a particular security. In the event that 
an examination, count, verification, and comparison is made on a 
cyclical basis, it shall not extend over more than 1 calendar quarter-
year, and no security shall be examined, counted, verified, or compared 
for the purpose of this rule less than 2 months or more than 4 months 
after a prior examination, count, verification, and comparison.
    (d) The examination, count, verification, and comparison shall be 
made or supervised by persons whose regular duties do not require them 
to have direct responsibility for the proper care and protection of the 
securities or the making or preservation of the subject records.
    (e) The Commission may, upon written request, exempt from the 
provisions of this section, either unconditionally or on specified terms 
and conditions, any member, broker, or dealer who satisfies the 
Commission that it is not necessary in the public interest and for the 
protection of investors to subject the particular member, broker, or 
dealer to certain or all of the provisions of this section, because of 
the special nature of his business, the safeguards he has established 
for the protection of customers' funds and securities, or such other 
reason as the Commission deems appropriate.

plan for allocating among the self-regulatory organizations the 
responsibility to receive regulatory reports from persons who

compliance by such persons, with specified provisions of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the 
rules of such self-regulatory organizations, or to carry out other 
specified regulatory functions with respect to such persons.
    (b) Any plan filed hereunder may contain provisions for the 
allocation among the parties of expenses reasonably incurred by the 
self-regulatory organization having regulatory responsibilities under 
the plan.
    (c) After appropriate notice and opportunity for comment, the 
Commission may, by written notice, declare such a plan, or any part of 
the plan, effective if it finds the plan, or any part thereof, necessary 
or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of 
investors, to foster cooperation and coordination among self-regulatory 
organizations, or to remove impediments to and foster the development of 
the national market system and a national system for the clearance and 
settlement of securities transactions and in conformity with the factors 
set forth in section 17(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
    (d) Upon the effectiveness of such a plan or part thereof, any self-
regulatory organization which is a party to the plan shall be relieved 
of responsibility as to any person for whom such responsibility is 
allocated under the plan to another self-regulatory organization to the 
extent of such allocation.
    (e) Nothing herein shall preclude any self-regulatory organization 
from entering into more than one plan filed hereunder.
    (f) After the Commission has declared a plan or part thereof 
effective pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section or acted pursuant to 
paragraph (g) of this section, a self-regulatory organization relieved 
of responsibility may notify customers of, and persons doing business 
with, such member or participant of the limited nature of its 
responsibility for such member's or participant's acts, practices, and 
course of business.
    (g) In the event that plans declared effective pursuant to paragraph 
(c) of this section do not provide for all members or participants or do 
not allocate all regulatory responsibilities, the Commission may, after 
due consideration of the factors enumerated in section 17(d)(1) and 
notice and opportunity for comment, designate one or more of the self-
regulatory organizations responsible for specified regulatory 
responsibilities with respect to such members or participants.

effective, the Commission may impose any terms and conditions relating

in which the completed item was made available, the addressee and 
address to which it was made available and the number of any new 
certificate which was registered and the name in which it was 
registered. If a new certificate is dispatched or mailed to the 
presentor within five business days following receipt of an inquiry 
pertaining to that certificate, no further response to the inquiry shall 
be required pursuant to this paragraph.
    (b) When any broker-dealer requests in writing that a registered 
transfer agent acknowledge the transfer instructions and the possession 
of a security presented for transfer by such broker-dealer or revalidate 
a window ticket with respect to such security and the request identifies 
the issue, the number of shares (or principal amount of debt securities 
or number of units if relating to any other kind of security), the 
approximate date of presentment, the certificate number and the name in 
which it is registered, every registered transfer agent shall, within

number of shares (or principal amount of debt securities or number of 
units if relating to any other kind of security), the approximate date 
of presentment, the certificate number and the name in which the 
certificate was registered, every registered transfer agent shall,

the request, every registered transfer agent shall, within twenty 
business days following receipt of the request and upon assurance of

detail. A registered transfer agent shall respond, within twenty 
business days of receipt, to aged claims that contain sufficient detail. 
The response shall indicate in writing that the inquiry has been 
received, whether the claim requires further research and, if so, a 
reasonable estimate of how long that research may take. If no further 
research is required, the response shall indicate whether that claim is 
being or will be paid and, if not, the reason for not paying the claim. 
A registered transfer agent shall devote diligent attention to 
unresolved inquiries and shall resolve all inquiries as soon as 
possible.
    (2) Misdirected written inquiries concerning dividend and interest 
payments. In the event that a transfer agent is not the dividend 
disbursing or interest paying agent for an issue that is the subject of 
a claim under this section, but performed those or any transfer agent 
services for that issue within the preceding three years, the transfer 
agent shall provide in writing to the inquirer, within ten business days 
of receipt of the inquiry, the name and address of the current dividend 
disbursing or interest paying agent. If the transfer agent did not 
perform those or other transfer agent services for the issue within the 
preceding three years, the transfer agent must respond to the inquiry 
and may respond by returning the inquiry with a statement that the 
transfer agent is not the current dividend disbursing or interest paying 
agent and that it does not know the name and address of the current 
dividend disbursing or interest paying agent.
    (3) As used in this paragraph:
    (i) A current claim means a written inquiry concerning non-payment 
or incorrect payment of dividends or interest, the payment date for 
which occurred within the preceding six months.

    (f) Telephone response. (1) A transfer agent may satisfy the written 
response requirements of this section by a telephone response to the 
inquirer if:
    (i) The telephone response resolves that inquiry; and
    (ii) The inquirer does not request a written response.
    (2) When any person makes a written inquiry or request that would 
qualify under paragraph (e) of this section except that it fails to 
provide sufficient detail as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this 
section, a registered transfer agent may telephone the inquirer to 
obtain the necessary additional detail within the time periods specified 
in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. If the transfer agent does not 
receive the additional detail within ten business days, the transfer 
agent immediately shall make a written request for the additional 
information.
    (g)(1) When any person makes a written inquiry or request which 
would qualify under paragraph (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section 
except that it fails to provide all of the information specified in 
those paragraphs, or requests information which refers to a time earlier 
than the time periods specified in those paragraphs, a registered 
transfer agent shall confirm promptly receipt of the inquiry or request 
and respond to it as soon as possible.
    (2) When any person makes a written inquiry or request which would 
qualify under paragraph (e) of this section except that it fails to 
provide sufficient detail as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this 
section, a registered transfer agent must respond to the inquiry within 
the time periods specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. A 
registered transfer agent may respond to such an inquiry in accordance 
with paragraph (e)(1) of this section as though sufficient detail had 
been provided, or may return it to the inquirer, requesting the 
additional necessary details.

security transferred, purchased, redeemed or issued; Provided, however, 
That if a security transferred or redeemed contains certificate detail

    (A) Perform transfer agent functions solely for their own or their 
affiliated companies' securities issues, and
    (B) Employ batch posting systems, ten business days; and
    (iii) With respect to all other recordkeeping transfer agents, five 
business days;
    Provided, however, That all securities transferred, purchased, 
redeemed or issued prior to record date, but posted subsequent thereto, 
shall be posted as of the record date.
    (3) With respect to posting certificate detail from transfer 
journals received by the recordkeeping transfer agent from a co-transfer 
agent, the time frames set forth in paragraph (a)(2) shall commence upon 
receipt of those journals by the recordkeeping transfer agent.
    (b) Every recordkeeping transfer agent shall maintain and keep 
current an accurate master securityholder file and subsidiary files. If 
such transfer agent has any record difference, its master securityholder 
file and subsidiary files must accurately represent all relevant debits 
and credits until the record difference is resolve. The recordkeeping 
transfer agent shall exercise diligent and continuous attention to 
resolve all record differences.
    (c)(1) Every co-transfer agent shall dispatch or mail promptly to 
the recordkeeping transfer agent a record of debits and credits for 
every security transferred or issued. For the purposes of this 
paragraph, ``promptly'' means within two business days following 
transfer of each security, and, with respect to transfers occurring 
within five business days of record date, daily.
    (2) Within three business days following the end of each month, 
every co-transfer agent shall mail to the recordkeeping transfer agent 
for each issue of securities for which it acts as a co-transfer agent, a 
report setting forth:
    (i) The principal dollar amount of debt securities or the number of 
shares and related market value of equity securities comprising any buy-
in executed by the co-transfer agent during the preceding month pursuant 
to paragraph (g) of this section; and
    (ii) The reason for the buy-in.
    (d) Every co-transfer agent shall respond promptly to all inquiries 
from the recordkeeping transfer agent regarding records required to be 
dispatched or mailed by the co-transfer agent pursuant to Sec. 240.17Ad-
10(c). For the purposes of this paragraph, ``promptly'' means within 
five business days of receipt of an inquiry from a recordkeeping 
transfer agent.
    (e) Every recordkeeping transfer agent shall maintain and keep 
current an accurate control book for each issue of securities. A change 
in the control book shall not be made except upon written authorization 
from a duly authorized agent of the issuer.
    (f) Every recordkeeping transfer agent shall retain a record of all 
certificate detail deleted from the master securityholder file for a 
period of six years from the date of deletion. In lieu of maintaining a 
hard copy, a recordkeeping transfer agent may comply with this paragraph 
by complying with Sec. 240.17Ad-7(f) or Sec. 240.17Ad-7(g).
    (g)(1) A registered transfer agent, in the event of any actual 
physical overissuance that such transfer agent caused and of which it 
has knowledge, shall, within 60 days of the discovery of such 
overissuance, buy in securities equal to the number of shares in the

[[Page 407]]

case of equity securities or the principal dollar amount in the case of 
debt securities. During the sixty-day period, the registered transfer 
agent shall devote diligent attention to resolving the overissuance and 
recovering the certificates. This paragraph requires a buy-in only by 
the transfer agent that erroneously issued the certificate(s) giving 
rise to the physical overissuance, and applies only to those physical 
overissuances created by transfers or issuances subsequent to September 
30, 1983.
    (2) If a transfer agent obtains a letter from the party holding the 
overissued certificates that confirms that the overissued certificate(s) 
will be returned to the transfer agent not later than thirty days after 
the expiration of the sixty-day period, the transfer agent need not buy 
in securities by the sixtieth day. If, however, the certificate(s) are 
not returned to the transfer agent within the additional thirty-day 
period, the transfer agent immediately must execute the buy-in in 
accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
    (3) If the certificates involved are covered by a surety bond 
indemnifying the transfer agent for all expenses incurred as a result of 
actual overissuance, the transfer agent need not buy in the securities. 
The transfer agent, however, shall devote diligent attention to 
resolving the overissuance and recovering the certificates.
    (4) For purposes of this paragraph, discovery of the overissuance 
occurs when the transfer agent identifies the erroneously issued 
certificate(s) and the registered securityholder(s).
    (h) Subsequent to the effective date of this section, registered 
transfer agents that:
    (1) Assume the maintenance and updating of master securityholder 
files from predecessor transfer agents,
    (2) Establish a new master securityholder file for a particular 
issue, or
    (3) Convert from manual to automated systems,

must carry over any existing certificate detail required by this section 
on the master securityholder file.
A recordkeeping transfer agent shall not be required to add certificate 
detail to the master securityholder file respecting certificates issued 
prior to the effective date of this section.

Sec. 240.17Ad-13  Annual study and evaluation of internal accounting control.

    (a) Accountant's report. Every registered transfer agent, except as 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section, shall file annually with the 
Commission and the transfer agent's appropriate regulatory agency in 
accordance with Sec. 240.17Ad-2(h), a report specified in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section prepared by an independent accountant concerning 
the transfer agent's system of internal accounting control and related 
procedures for the transfer of record ownership and the safeguarding of 
related securities and funds. That report shall be filed within 90 
calendar days of the date of the study and evaluation set forth in 
paragraph (a)(1).
    (1) The accountant's report shall:
    (i) State whether the study and evaluation was made in accordance 
with generally accepted auditing standards using the criteria set forth 
in paragraph (a)(3) of this section;
    (ii) Describe any material inadequacies found to exist as of the 
date of the study and evaluation and any corrective action taken, or if 
no material inadequacy existed, the report shall so state;
    (iii) Comment on the current status of any material inadequacy 
described in the immediately preceding report; and
    (iv) Indicate the date of the study and evaluation.
    (2) The study and evaluation of the transfer agent's system of 
internal accounting control for the transfer of record ownership and the 
safeguarding of related securities and funds shall cover the following:
    (i) Transferring securities related to changes of ownership (i.e., 
cancellation of certificates or other instruments evidencing prior 
ownership and issuance of certificates or instruments evidencing current 
ownership);
    (ii) Registering changes of ownership on the books and records of 
the issuer;
    (iii) Transferring record ownership as a result of corporate actions 
(e.g., issuance, retirement, redemption, liquidation, conversion, 
exchange, tender offer or other types of reorganization);
    (iv) Dividend disbursement or interest paying-agent activities;
    (v) Administering dividend reinvestment programs; and
    (vi) Distributing statements respecting initial offerings of 
securities.
    (3) For purposes of this report, the objectives of a transfer 
agent's system of internal accounting control for the transfer of record 
ownership and the safeguarding of related securities and funds should be 
to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that securities and 
funds are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or

[[Page 410]]

disposition and that transfer agent activities are performed promptly 
and accurately. For purposes of this report, a material inadequacy is a 
condition for which the independent accountant believes that the 
prescribed procedures or the degree of compliance with them do not 
reduce to a relatively low level the risk that errors or irregularities, 
in amounts that would have a significant adverse effect on the transfer 
agent's ability promptly and accurately to transfer record ownership and 
safeguard related securities and funds, would occur or not be detected 
within a timely period by employees in the normal coruse of performing 
their assigned functions. Occurrence of errors or irregularities more 
frequently than in isolated instances may be evidence that the system 
has a material inadequacy. A significant adverse effect on a transfer 
agent's ability promptly and accurately to transfer record ownership and 
safeguard related securities and funds could result from any condition 
or conditions that individually, or taken as a whole, would reasonably 
be expected to:
    (i) Inhibit the transfer agent from promptly and accurately 
discharging its responsibilities under its contractual agreement with 
the issuer;
    (ii) Result in material financial loss to the transfer agent; or
    (iii) Result in a violation of Sec. 240.17Ad-2, 17Ad-10 or 17Ad-
12(a).
    (b) Notice of corrective action. If the accountant's report 
describes any material inadequacy, the transfer agent shall, within 
sixty calendar days after receipt of the report, notify the Commission 
and its appropriate regulatory agency in writing regarding the 
corrective action taken or proposed to be taken.
    (c) Record retention. The accountant's report and any documents 
required by paragraph (b) of this section shall be maintained by the 
transfer agent for at least three years, the first year in an easily 
accessible place.
    (d) Exemptions. The requirements of Sec. 240.17Ad-13 shall not apply 
to registered transfer agents that qualify for exemptions pursuant to 
this paragraph, 17Ad-13(d).
    (1) A registered transfer agent shall be exempt if it performs 
transfer agent functions solely for:
    (i) Its own securities;
    (ii) Securities issued by a subsidiary in which it owns 51% or more 
of the subsidiary's capital stock; and
    (iii) Securities issued by another corporation that owns 51% or more 
of the capital stock of the registered transfer agent.
    (2) A registered transfer agent shall be exempt if it:
    (i) Is an exempt transfer agent pursuant to Sec. 240.17AD-4(b); and
    (ii) In the case of a transfer agent that performs transfer agent 
functions for redeemable securities issued by companies registered under 
section 8 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, maintains master 
securityholder files consisting of fewer than 1000 shareholder accounts, 
in the aggregate, for each of such issues for which it performs transfer 
agent functions.
    (3) A registered transfer agent shall be exempt if it is a bank or 
financial institution subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, provided that it 
is not notified to the contrary by its appropriate regulatory agency and 
provided that a report similar in scope to the requirements of 
Sec. 240.17Ad-13(a) is prepared for either the bank's board of directors 
or an audit committee of the board of directors.

depositary, in the case of a tender offer, or an exchange agent, in the 
case of an exchange offer, in connection with a tender or exchange 
offer, unless that transfer agent has established, within

[[Page 411]]

two business days after commencement of the offer, specially designated 
accounts. These accounts shall be maintained throughout the duration of 
the offer, including protection periods, with all qualified registered 
securities depositories holding the subject company's securities, for 
purposes of receiving from depository participants securities being 
tendered to the bidder by book-entry delivery pursuant to transmittal 
letters and other documentation and for purposes of allowing tender 
agents to return to depository participants by book-entry movement 
securities withdrawn from the offer.
    (b) Exclusions. The rule shall not apply to tender or exchange 
offers (1) that are made for a class of securities of a subject company 
that has fewer than (i) 500 security holders of record for that class, 
or (ii) 500,000 shares of that class outstanding; or (2) that are made 
exclusively to security holders of fewer than 100 shares of a class of

company, business day, security holders, and transmittal letter shall be 
given the meanings provided in Sec. 240.14d-1(b); (2) unless the context 
otherwise requires, a tender or exchange offer shall be deemed to have 
commenced as specified in Sec. 240.14d-2; (3) the term bidder shall mean 
any person who makes a tender or exchange offer or on whose behalf a 
tender or exchange offer is made; (4) a qualified registered securities 
depository shall mean a registered clearing agency having rules and 
procedures approved by the Commission pursuant to section 19 of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to enable book-entry delivery of the

from, the transfer agent through the facilities of that securities 
depository; and (5) the term depositary refers to that agent of the 
bidder receiving securities from tendering depository participants and 
paying those participants for shares tendered. The term exchange agent 
refers to the agent performing like functions in connection with an 
exchange offer.
    (d) Exemptions. The Commission may exempt from the provisions of 
this rule, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, 
any registered transfer agent, tender or exchange offer, or class of 
tender or exchange offers, if the Commission determines that an 
exemption is consistent with the public interest, the protection of 
investors, the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of 
securities transactions, the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, or 
the removal of impediments to a national clearance and settlement 
system.

transfer agent shall establish:

the transfer agent's written standards or procedures.
    (2) A registered transfer agent shall notify the guarantor and the 
presentor of the rejection and the reasons for the rejection within two

in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section is neither a member of a 
clearing corporation nor maintains net capital of at least $100,000.
    (g) Signature guarantee program. (1) A registered transfer agent 
shall be deemed to comply with paragraph (c) of this section if its 
standards and procedures include:
    (i) Rejecting a request for transfer because the guarantor is 
neither a member of nor a participant in a signature guarantee program; 
or
    (ii) Accepting a guarantee from an eligible guarantor institution 
who, at the time of issuing the guarantee, is a member of or participant 
in a signature guarantee program.
    (2) Within the first six months after revising its standards and 
procedures to include a signature guarantee program, the transfer agent

a member of nor

participant in a signature guarantee program, unless the transfer agent 
has given that guarantor ninety days written notice of the transfer 
agent's intent to reject transfers with guarantees from non-
participating or non-member guarantors.

standardized options overlying exchange-listed stocks that were listed

Commission is the appropriate regulatory agency takes any action 
described in this rule to which the person affected thereby has 
consented and such action:
    (1) Conditions or limits membership or participation in, association 
with a member of, or access to services offered by, such organization or 
a member thereof and
    (2) Is based upon a statutory disqualification defined in section 
3(a)(39) of the Act, notice thereof shall be filed under Rule 19h-1 and 
not under this rule.
    (b) The notice requirement of section 19(d)(1) of the Act, 
concerning an action subject to such section taken by a self-regulatory 
organization for which the Commission is the appropriate regulatory 
agency, shall be satisfied by any notice with respect to such action 
(including a notice filed pursuant to

[[Page 419]]

this rule) which contains the information required in the statement 
supporting the organization's determination required by section 6(d) (1) 
or (2), section 15A(h) (1) or (2), or section 17A(b)(5) (A) or (B) of 
the Act, as appropriate.
    (c)(1) Any self-regulatory organization for which the Commission is 
the appropriate regulatory agency that takes any final disciplinary 
action with respect to any person shall promptly file a notice thereof 
with the Commission in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. 
For the purposes of this rule, a ``final disciplinary action'' shall 
mean the imposition of any final disciplinary sanction pursuant to 
section 6(b)(6), 15A(b)(7), or 17A(b)(3)(G) of the Act or other action 
of a self-regulatory organization which, after notice and opportunity 
for hearing, results in any final disposition of charges of:
    (i) One or more violations of--
    (A) The rules of such organization;

national securities exchange imposes a fine not exceeding $1000 or 
suspends floor privileges of a clerical employee for not more than five 
days for violation of any of its regulations concerning personal decorum 
on a trading floor, the disposition shall not be considered ``final'' 
for purposes of this paragraph if the sanctioned person has not sought 
an adjudication, including a hearing, or otherwise exhausted his 
administrative remedies at the exchange with respect to the matter. 
Provided further, That this exemption from the notice requirement of 
this paragraph shall not be available where a decorum sanction is 
imposed at, or results from, a hearing on the matter.
    (2) Any disciplinary action, other than a decorum sanction not 
deemed ``final'' under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, taken by a 
seld-regulatory organization for which the Commission is the appropriate 
regulatory agency against any person for violation of a rule of the 
self-regulatory organization which has been designated as a minor rule 
violation pursuant to a plan or any amendment thereto filed with and 
declared effective by the Commission under this paragraph, shall not be 
considered ``final'' for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section if 
the sanction imposed consists of a fine not exceeding $2500 and the 
sanctioned person has not sought an adjudication, including a hearing,

regulatory organization with resepect to the matter. After appropriate 
notice of the terms of substance of the filing or a description of the 
subjects and issues involved and opportunity for interested persons to 
submit written comment, the Commission may, by order, declare such plan 
or amendment effective if it finds that such plan or amendment is 
consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, or 
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Commission in 
its order may restrict the categories of violations to be designated as 
minor rule violations and may impose any other terms or conditions to 
the plan (including abbreviated reporting of selected minor rule 
violations) and to the period of its effectiveness which it deems 
necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of 
investors or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

<R05>

Sec. 240.19h-1  Notice by a self-regulatory organization of proposed admission to or continuance in membership or participation or association with a member of 
          any person subject to a statutory disqualification, and 
          applications to the Commission for relief therefrom.

    (a) Notice of admission or continuance notwithstanding a statutory 
disqualification. (1) Any self-regulatory organization proposing, 
conditionally or unconditionally, to admit to, or continue any person 
in, membership or participation or (in the case of a national securities 
exchange or registered securities association) association with a 
member, notwithstanding a statutory disqualification, as defined in 
section 3(a)(39) of the Act, with respect to such person, shall file a 
notice with the Commission of such proposed admission or continuance. If 
such disqualified person has not consented to the terms of such 
proposal, notice of the organization's action shall be filed pursuant to 
rule 19d-1 under the Act and not this rule.
    (2) With respect to a person associated with a member of a national 
securities exchange or registered securities association, notices need 
be filed with the Commission pursuant to this rule only if such person:
    (i) Controls such member, is a general partner or officer (or person 
occupying a similar status or performing similar functions) of such 
member, is an employee who, on behalf of such member, is engaged in 
securities advertising, public relations, research, sales, trading, or 
training or supervision of other employees who engage or propose to 
engage in such activities, except clerical and ministerial persons 
engaged in such activities, or is an employee with access to funds, 
securities or books and records, or
    (ii) Is a broker or dealer not registered with the Commission, or 
controls such (unregistered) broker or dealer or is a general partner or 
officer (or person occupying a similar status or performing similar 
functions) of such broker or dealer.
    (3) A notice need not be filed with the Commission pursuant to this 
rule if:
    (i) The person subject to the statutory disqualification is already 
a participant in, a member of, or a person associated with a member of, 
a self-regulatory organization, and the terms and conditions of the 
proposed admission by another self-regulatory organization are the same 
in all material respects as those imposed or not disapproved in 
connection with such person's prior admission or continuance pursuant to 
an order of the Commission under paragraph (d) of this section or other 
substantially equivalent written communication.
    (ii) The self-regulatory organization finds, after reasonable 
inquiry, that except for the identity of the employer concerned, the 
terms and conditions of the proposed admission or continuance are the 
same in all material respects as those imposed or not disapproved in 
connection with a prior admission or continuance of the person subject 
to the statutory disqualification pursuant to an order of the Commission 
under paragraph (d) of this section or other substantially equivalent 
written communication and that there is no intervening conduct or other 
circumstance that would cause the employment to be inconsistent with the 
public interest or the protection of investors;
    (iii) The disqualification consists of (A) an injunction from 
engaging in any action, conduct, or practice specified in

[[Page 424]]

section 15(b)(4)(C) of the Act, which injunction was entered 10 or more 
years prior to the proposed admission or continuance--Provided, however, 
That in the case of a final or permanent injunction which was preceded 
by a preliminary injunction against the same person in the same court 
proceeding, such ten-year period shall begin to run from the date of 
such preliminary injunction--and/or (B) a finding by the Commission or a 
self-regulatory organization of a willful violation of the Act, the 
Securities Act of 1933, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the 
Investment Company Act of 1940, or a rule or regulation under one or 
more of such Acts and the sanction for such violation is no longer in 
effect;
    (iv) The disqualification previously (A) was a basis for the 
institution of an administrative proceeding pursuant to a provision of 
the federal securities laws, and (B) was considered by the Commission in 
determining a sanction against such person in the proceeding; and the 
Commission concluded in such proceeding that it would not restrict or 
limit the future securities activities of such person in the capacity 
now proposed or, if it imposed any such restrictions or limitations for 
a specified time period, such time period has elapsed;
    (v) The disqualification consists of a court order or judgment of 
injunction or conviction, and such order or judgment (A) expressly 
includes a provision that, on the basis of such order or judgment, the 
Commission will not institute a proceeding against such person pursuant 
to section 15(b) or 15B of the Act or that the future securities 
activities of such persons in the capacity now proposed will not be 
restricted or limited or (B) includes such restrictions or limitations 
for a specified time period and such time period has elapsed; or
    (vi) In the case of a person seeking to become associated with a 
broker or dealer or municipal securities dealer, the Commission has 
previously consented to such proposed association pursuant to section 
15(b)(6) or 15B(c)(4) of the Act.

In the case of an admission to membership, participation, or 
association, if an exception provided for in this paragraph (a)(3) is 
applicable, the self-regulatory organization shall, pursuant to its 
rules, determine when the admission to membership, participation, or 
association shall become effective.
    (4) If a self-regulatory organization determines to admit to, or 
continue any person in, membership, participation, or association with a 
member pursuant to an exception from the notice requirements provided in 
paragraph (a)(3)(ii), (iv) or (v) of this section, such organization 
shall, within 14 calendar days of its making of such determination, 
furnish to the Commission, by letter, a notification setting forth, as 
appropriate:
    (i) The name of the person subject to the statutory 
disqualification;
    (ii) The name of the person's prospective and immediately preceding 
employers who are (were) brokers or dealers or municipal securities 
dealers;
    (iii) The name of the person's prospective supervisor(s);
    (iv) The respective places of such employments as reflected on the 
records of the self-regulatory organization;
    (v) If applicable, the findings of the self-regulatory organization 
referred to in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section and the nature 
(including relevant dates) of the previous Commission or court 
determination referred to in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) or (v) of this 
section; and
    (vi) An identification of any other self-regulatory organization 
which has indicated its agreement with the terms and conditions of the 
proposed admission or continuance;
    (5) If a notice or notification has been previously filed or 
furnished pursuant to this rule by a self-regulatory organization, any 
other such organization need not file or furnish a separate notice or 
notification pursuant to this rule with respect to the same matter if 
such other organization agrees with the terms and conditions of the 
membership, participation or association reflected in the notice or 
notification so filed or furnished, and such agreement is set forth in 
the notice or notification.
    (6) The notice requirements of sections 6(c)(2), 15A(g)(2), and 
17A(b)(4)(A) of the Act concerning an action of a self-regulatory 
organization subject to one (or more) of such sections and this

[[Page 425]]

paragraph (a) shall be satisfied by a notice with respect to such action 
filed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (7) The Commission, by written notice to a self-regulatory 
organization on or before the thirtieth day after receipt of a notice 
under this Rule, may direct that such organization not admit to 
membership, participation, or association with a member any person who 
is subject to a statutory disqualification for a period not to exceed an 
additional 60 days beyond the initial 30 day notice period in order that 
the Commission may extend its consideration of the proposal; Provided, 
however, That during such extended period of consideration, the 
Commission will not direct the self-regulatory organization to bar the 
proposed admission to membership, participation or association with a 
member pursuant to section 6(c)(2), 15A(g)(2), or 17A(b)(4)(A) of the 
Act, and the Commission will not institute proceedings pursuant to 
section 15(b) or 15B of the Act on the basis of such disqualification if 
the self-regulatory organization has permitted the admission to 
membership, participation or association with a member, on a temporary 
basis, pending a final Commission determination.
    (b) Preliminary notifications. Promptly after receiving an 
application for admission to, or continuance in, participation or 
membership in, or association with a member of, a self-regulatory 
organization which would be required to file with the Commission a 
notice thereof pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section if such 
admission or continuance is ultimately proposed by such organization, 
the organization shall file with the Commission a notification of such 
receipt. Such notification shall include, as appropriate:
    (1) The date of such receipt;
    (2) The names of the person subject to the statutory 
disqualification and the prospective employer concerned together with 
their respective last known places of residence or business as reflected

    (3) The basis for any such disqualification including (if based on a 
prior adjudication) a copy of the order or decision of the court, the 
Commission, or the self-regulatory organization which adjudicated the 
matter giving rise to the disqualification; and
    (4) The capacity in which the person concerned is proposed to be 
employed.
    (c) Contents of notice of admission or continuance. A notice filed 
with the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall 
contain the following, as appropriate:
    (1) The name of the person concerned together with his last known 
place of residence or business as reflected on the records of the self-
regulatory organization;
    (2) The basis for any such disqualification from membership, 
participation or association including (if based on a prior 
adjudication) a copy of the order or decision of the court, the 
Commission or the self-regulatory organization which adjudicated the 
matter giving rise to such disqualification;
    (3) In the case of an admission, the date upon which it is proposed 
by the organization that such membership, participation or association 
shall become effective, which shall be not less than 30 days from the 
date upon which the Commission receives the notice;
    (4) A description by or on behalf of the person concerned of the 
activities engaged in by the person since the disqualification arose, 
the prospective business or employment in which the person plans to 
engage and the manner and extent of supervision to be exercised over and 
by such person. This description shall be accompanied by a written 
statement submitted to the self-regulatory organization by the proposed 
employer setting forth the terms and conditions of such employment and 
supervision. The description also shall include (i) the qualifications, 
experience and disciplinary records of the proposed supervisors of the 
person and their family relationship (if any) to that person; (ii) the 
findings and results of all examinations conducted, during the two years 
preceding the filing of the notice, by self-regulatory organizations of 
the main office of the proposed employer and of the branch office(s) in 
which the employment will occur or be subject to supervisory controls; 
(iii) a copy of a completed Form

[[Page 426]]

certification by the self-regulatory organization that such person is 
fully qualified under all applicable requirements to engage in the 
proposed activities; and (iv) the name and place of employment of any 
other associated person of the proposed employer who is subject to a 
statutory disqualification (other than a disqualification specified in 
paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section);
    (5) If a hearing on the matter has been held by the organization, a 
certified record of the hearing together with copies of any exhibits 
introduced therein;
    (6) All written submissions not included in a certified oral hearing 
record which were considered by the organization in its disposition of 
the matter;
    (7) An identification of any other self-regulatory organization 
which has indicated its agreement with the terms and conditions of the 
proposed admission or continuance;
    (8) All information furnished in writing to the self-regulatory 
organization by the staff of the Commission for consideration by the 
organization in its disposition of the matter or the incorporation by 
reference of such information, and a statement of the organization's 
views thereon; and
    (9) Such other matters as the organization or person deems relevant.

If the notice contains assertions of material facts not a matter of 
record before the self-regulatory organization, such facts shall be 
sworn to by affidavit of the person or organization offering such facts 
for Commission consideration. The notice may be accompanied by a brief.
    (d) Application to the Commission for relief from certain statutory 
disqualifications. The filing of a notice pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section shall neither affect nor foreclose any action which the 
Commission may take with respect to such person pursuant to the 
provisions of section 15(b), 15B or 19(h) of the Act or any rule 
thereunder. Accordingly, a notice filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section with respect to the membership, participation, or 
association of any person subject to an ``applicable disqualification,'' 
as defined in paragraph (f) of this section, may be accompanied by an 
application by or on behalf of the person concerned to the Commission 
for an order declaring, as applicable, that notwithstanding such 
disqualification, the Commission:
    (1) Will not institute proceedings pursuant to section 15(b)(1)(B), 
15(b)(4), 15(b)(6), 15B(a)(2), 15B(c)(2), 19(h)(2) or 19(h)(3) of the 
Act if such person seeks to obtain or continue registration as a broker 
or dealer or municipal securities dealer or association with a broker or 
dealer or municipal securities dealer so registered, or membership or 
participation in a self-regulatory organization;
    (2) Will not direct otherwise, as provided in section 6(c)(2), 
15A(g)(2) or 17A(b)(4)(A) of the Act; and
    (3) Will deem such person qualified pursuant to Rule G-4 of the 
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board under the Act.

If a Commission consent is required in order to render a proposed 
association lawful under section 15(b)(6) or 15B(c)(4) of the Act, an 
application by or on behalf of the person seeking such consent shall 
accompany the notice of the proposed association filed pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section. The Commission may, in its discretion and 
subject to such terms and conditions as it deems necessary, issue such 
an order and consent should the Commission determine not to object to 
the position of the self-regulatory organization set forth in the notice 
or application; Provided, however, That nothing herein shall foreclose 
the right of any person, at his election, to apply directly to the 
Commission for such consent, if he makes such application pursuant to 
the terms of an existing order of the Commission under section 15(b)(6) 
or 15B(c)(4) of the Act limiting his association with a broker or dealer 
or municipal securities dealer but explicitly granting him such a right 
to apply for entry or reentry at a later time.
    (e) Contents of application to the Commission. An application to the 
Commission pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section shall consist of

last known place of residence or business as reflected on the records of 
the self-regulatory organization;

the self-regulatory organization which adjudicated the matter giving 
rise to such ``applicable disqualification'';
    (3) The nature of the relief sought and the reasons therefor;
    (4) A description of the activities engaged in by the person since 
the disqualification arose;
    (5) A description of the prospective business or employment in which 
the person plans to engage and the manner and extent of supervision to 
be exercised over and by such person. This description shall be 
accompanied by a written statement submitted to the self-regulatory 
organization by the proposed employer setting forth the terms and 
conditions of such employment and supervision. The description also 
shall include (i) the qualifications, experience, and disciplinary 
records of the proposed supervisors of the person and their family 
relationship (if any) to that person; (ii) the findings and results of 
all examinations conducted, during the two years preceding the filing of 
the application, by self-regulatory organizations of the main office of 
the proposed employer and of the branch office(s) in which the 
employment will occur or be subject to supervisory controls; (iii) a 
copy of a completed Form U-4 with respect to the proposed association of 
such person and a certification by the self-regulatory organization that 
such person is fully qualified under all applicable requirements to 
engage in the proposed activities; and (iv) the name and place of 
employment of any other associated person of the proposed employer who 
is subject to a statutory disqualification (other than a 
disqualification specified in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section);
    (6) If a hearing on the matter has been held by the organization, a 
certified copy of the hearing record, together with copies of any 
exhibits introduced therein;
    (7) All written submissions not included in a certified oral hearing 
record which were considered by the organization in its disposition of 
the matter;

views thereon; and
    (9) Such other matters as the organization or person deems relevant.

If the application contains assertions of material facts not a matter of 
record before the organization, such facts shall be sworn to by 
affidavit of the person or organization offering such facts for 
Commission consideration.
    (f) Definitions. For purposes of this rule:
    (1) The term applicable disqualification shall mean:
    (i) Any effective order of the Commission pursuant to section 15(b) 
(4) or (6), 15B(c) (2) or (4) or 19(h) (2) or (3) of the Act--
    (A) Revoking, suspending or placing limitations on the registration, 
activities, functions, or operations of a broker or dealer;
    (B) Suspending, barring, or placing limitations on the association, 
activities, or functions of an associated person of a broker or dealer;

organization, the person subject to the disqualification, or other 
applicant (such as the proposed employer) on behalf of such person,

amendments thereto) except those portions thereof to the disclosure of 
which the exchange shall have filed objection pursuant to Sec. 240.24b-2

Sec. 240.24b-2  Nondisclosure of information filed with the Commission and with any exchange.

                            Preliminary Note

    Confidential treatment requests shall be submitted in paper format 
only, whether or not the filer is required to submit a filing in 
electronic format.
    (a) Any person filing any registration statement, report, 
application, statement, correspondence, notice or other document (herein 
referred to as the material filed) pursuant to the Act may make written 
objection to the public disclosure of any information contained therein 
in accordance with the procedure set forth below. The procedure provided 
in this rule shall be the exclusive means of requesting confidential 
treatment of information required to be filed under the Act.
    (b) The person shall omit from material filed the portion thereof 
which it desires to keep undisclosed (hereinafter called the 
confidential portion). In lieu thereof, it shall indicate at the 
appropriate place in the material filed that the confidential portion 
has been so omitted and filed separately with the Commission. The person 
shall file with the copies of the material filed with the Commission:
    (1) One copy of the confidential portion, marked ``Confidential 
Treatment,'' of the material filed with the Commission. The copy shall 
contain an appropriate identification of the item or other requirement 
involved and, notwithstanding that the confidential portion does not 
constitute the whole of the answer, the entire answer thereto; except 
that in the case where the confidential portion is part of a financial 
statement or schedule, only the particular financial statement or 
schedule need be included. The copy of the confidential portion shall be 
in the

[[Page 429]]

same form as the remainder of the material filed;
    (2) An application making objection to the disclosure of the 
confidential portion. Such application shall be on a sheet or sheets 
separate from the confidential portion, and shall contain (i) an 
identification of the portion; (ii) a statement of the grounds of 
objection referring to, and containing an analysis of, the applicable 
exemption(s) from disclosure under the Commission's rules and 
regulations adopted under the Freedom of Information Act (17 CFR 
200.80), and a justification of the period of time for which 
confidential treatment is sought; (iii) a written consent to the 
furnishing of the confidential portion to other government agencies, 
offices or bodies and to the Congress; and (iv) the name of each 
exchange, if any, with which the material is filed.
    (3) The copy of the confidential portion and the application filed 
in accordance with this paragraph (b) shall be enclosed in a separate 
envelope marked ``Confidential Treatment'' and addressed to The 
Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, DC 20549.
    (c) Pending a determination as to the objection filed the material 
for which confidential treatment has been applied will not be made 
available to the public.
    (d)(1) If it is determined that the objection should be sustained, a 
notation to that effect will be made at the appropriate place in the 
material filed. Such a determination will not preclude reconsideration 
whenever appropriate, such as upon receipt of any subsequent request 
under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and, if appropriate, 
revocation of the confidential status of all or a portion of the 
information in question. Where an initial determination has been made 
under this rule to sustain objections to disclosure, the Commission will 
attempt to give the person requesting confidential treatment advance 
notice, wherever possible, if confidential treatment is revoked.
    (2) In any case where an objection to disclosure has been disallowed 
or where a prior grant of confidential treatment has been revoked, the 
person who requested such treatment will be so informed by registered or 
certified mail to the person or his agent for service. Pursuant to 
Sec. 201.431 of this chapter, persons making objections to disclosure 
may petition the Commission for review of a determination by the 
Division disallowing objections or revoking confidential treatment.
    (e) The confidential portion shall be made available to the public 
at the time and according to the conditions specified in paragraphs (d) 
(1) and (2) of this section:
    (1) Upon the lapse of five days after the dispatch of notice by 
registered or certified mail of a determination disallowing an 
objection, if prior to the lapse of such five days the person shall not 
have communicated to the Secretary of the Commission his intention to 
seek review by the Commission under Sec. 201.431 of this chapter of the 
determination made by the Division; or
    (2) If such a petition for review shall have been filed under 
Sec. 201.431 of this chapter, upon final disposition thereof adverse to 
the petitioner.
    (f) If the confidential portion is made available to the public, one 
copy thereof shall be attached to each copy of the material filed with 
the Commission and with each exchange.

reasonable regulations as to the manner of inspection, during reasonable 
office hours, all information regarding a security registered on such

representation by any exchange as to the accuracy, completeness, or 
genuineness thereof.
    (b) In the case of an application for registration of a security 
pursuant to section 12 an exchange may delay making available the 
information contained therein until it has certified to the Commission 
its approval of such security for listing and registration.

Sec. 240.31-1  Securities transactions exempt from transaction fees.

                            Preliminary Notes

    If a sale of a security for which a fee is paid under section 31 of 
the Act is effected on a national securities exchange, the transaction 
fee must be paid by that exchange. With regard to sales of securities 
for which a fee is paid under section 31, effected otherwise than on a 
national securities exchange (except those securities for which a fee is 
paid under section 31(d)), the fee is to be paid by the registered 
broker or dealer on the sale side of the transaction. When there is no 
registered broker or dealer on the sale side

[[Page 431]]

of the transaction (as, for example, where a third market dealer 
purchases securities for its own account from a public customer), the 
fee is to be paid by the registered broker or dealer on the purchase 
side of the transaction. Where no registered broker or dealer is 
involved in the transaction, no fee arises.
    The fee for options transactions occurring on a national securities 
exchange is to be paid by the exchange itself, or by the Options 
Clearing Corporation on behalf of the exchange, and such fee is to be 
computed on the basis of the option premium (market price) for the sale 
of the option, and the exercise price of the option in the event of its 
exercise. In addition, any sale of securities for which a fee is paid 
under section 31 (except those securities for which a fee is paid under 
section 31(d)), occurring otherwise than on a national securities 
exchange, to or by a person exercising an option contract, shall require 
payment of a section 31 fee, in an amount determined on the basis of the 
exercise price, by the registered broker or dealer selling the 
securities. If there is no registered broker or dealer on the sale side 
of such transaction, then the fee is to be paid by the registered broker 
or dealer on the purchase side of the transaction. If no registered 
broker or dealer is involved in the transaction, no fee arises. Finally, 
any sale of securities for which a fee is paid under section 31(d), to 
or by a person exercising an option contract, shall require payment of a 
section 31 fee, in an amount determined on the basis of the exercise 
price, by the appropriate national securities association or by the 
Options Clearing Corporation on behalf of the association.
    (a) The following shall be exempt from section 31 of the Act:
    (1) Transactions in securities offered pursuant to an effective 
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 (except 
transactions in put or call options issued by the Options Clearing 
Corporation) or offered in accordance with an exemption from 
registration afforded by section 3(a) or 3(b) thereof (15 U.S.C. 77c(a) 
or 77c(b)), or a rule thereunder.
    (2) Transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering 
within the meaning of section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 
U.S.C. 77d(2));
    (3) The purchase or sale of securities pursuant to and in 
consummation of a tender or exchange offer;
    (4) The purchase or sale of securities upon the exercise of a 
warrant or right (except a put or call), or upon the conversion of a 
convertible security; and
    (5) Transactions which are executed outside the United States and 
are not reported, or required to be reported, to a transaction reporting 
association as defined in Sec. 240.11Aa3-1 (Rule 11Aa3-1 under the Act) 
and any approved plan filed thereunder;
    (b) Over-the-counter (``OTC'') transactions in OTC securities which 
are subject to unlisted trading privileges on a national securities 
exchange shall be exempt only from section 31(c) of the Act.

[61 FR 68594, Dec. 30, 1996]

    Effective Date Note: At 61 FR 68594, Dec. 30, 1996, Sec. 240.31-1 
was revised, effective Sept. 1, 1997. For the convenience of the user, 
the superseded text appears as follows:
Sec. 240.31-1  Securities transactions exempt from transaction fees.

                            Preliminary Notes

    If a sale of a security for which a fee is paid under section 31 of 
the Act is effected on a national securities exchange, the transaction 
fee must be paid by that exchange. With regard to sales of securities 
for which a fee is paid under section 31, effected otherwise than on a 
national securities exchange, the fee is to be paid by the registered 
broker or dealer on the sale side of the transaction. When there is no 
registered broker or dealer on the sale side of the transaction (as, for 
example, where a third market dealer purchases securities for its own 
account from a public customer), the fee is to be paid by the registered 
broker or dealer on the purchase side of the transaction. Where no 
registered broker or dealer is involved in the transaction, no fee 
arises.
    The fee for options transactions occurring on a national securities 
exchange is to be paid by the exchange itself, or by the Options 
Clearing Corporation on behalf of the exchange, and such fee is to be 
computed on the basis of the option premium (market price) for the sale 
of the option, and the exercise price of the option in the event of its 
exercise. In addition, any sale of securities for which a fee is paid 
under section 31, occurring otherwise than on a national securities 
exchange, to or by a person exercising an option contract shall require 
payment of

[[Page 432]]

a section 31 fee, in an amount determined on the basis of the exercise 
price, by the registered broker or dealer selling the securities. If 
there is no registered broker or dealer on the sale side of such 
transaction, then the fee is to be paid by the registered broker or 
dealer on the purchase side of the transaction. If no registered broker 
or dealer is involved in the transaction, no fee arises.
    The following shall be exempt from section 31 of the Act: (a) 
Transactions in securities offered pursuant to an effective registration 
statement under the Securities Act of 1933 (except transactions in put 
or call options issued by the Options Clearing Corporation) or offered 
in accordance with an exemption from registration afforded by section 
3(a) or (b) thereof, or a rule thereunder;
    (b) Transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering 
within the meaning of section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933;
    (c) The purchase or sale of securities pursuant to and in 
consummation of a tender or exchange offer;
    (d) The purchase or sale of securities upon the exercise of a 
warrant or right (except a put or call), or upon the conversion of a 
convertible security;
    (e) Transactions which are executed outside the United States and 
are not reported, or required to be reported, to a transaction reporting 
association as defined in Sec. 240.11Aa3-1 (Rule 11Aa3-1 under the Act) 
and any approved plan filed thereunder.
    (f) Transactions in Nasdaq securities as defined in Sec. 240.11Aa3-1 
(Rule 11Aa3-1 under the Act) except for:
    (1) Transactions in those Nasdaq securities for which transaction 
reports are collected, processed, and made available pursuant to the 
plan originally submitted to the Commission pursuant to Sec. 240.17a-15 
(subsequently amended and redesignated as Rule 11Aa3-1) under the Act, 
which plan was declared effective as of May 17, 1974; and
    (2) Transactions in those Nasdaq securities occurring on a national 
securities exchange pursuant to unlisted trading privileges.

Sec. 240.31-1  Securities transactions exempt from transaction fees.

                            Preliminary Note

    The section 31 fee for options transactions occurring on a national 
securities exchange, or transactions in options subject to prompt last 
sale reporting occurring otherwise than on an exchange, is to be paid by 
the exchange or the national securities association itself, 
respectively, or the Options Clearing Corporation on behalf of the 
exchange or association, and such fee is to be computed on the basis of 
the option premium (market price) for the sale of the option. In the 
event of the exercise of an option, whether such option is traded on an 
exchange or otherwise, a section 31 fee is to be paid by the exchange or 
the national securities association itself, or the Options Clearing 
Corporation on behalf of the exchange or association, and such fee is to 
be computed on the basis of the exercise price of the option.

<R05>
Sec. 242.103  Nasdaq passive market making.

    (a) Scope of Section. This section permits broker-dealers to engage 
in market making transactions in covered securities that are Nasdaq 
securities without violating the provisions of Sec. 242.101; Except That 
this section shall not apply to any security for which a stabilizing bid 
subject to Sec. 242.104 is in effect, or during any at-the-market 
offering or best efforts offering.
    (b) Conditions to be Met.
    (1) General limitations. A passive market maker must effect all 
transactions in the capacity of a registered market maker on Nasdaq. A 
passive market maker shall not bid for or purchase a covered security at 
a price that exceeds the highest independent bid for the covered 
security at the time of the transaction, except as permitted by 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section or required by a rule promulgated by 
the Commission or the NASD governing the handling of customer orders.
    (2) Purchase limitation. On each day of the restricted period, a 
passive market maker's net purchases shall not exceed the greater of its 
30% ADTV limitation or 200 shares (together, ``purchase limitation''); 
Provided, however, That a passive market maker may purchase all of the 
securities that are part of a single order that, when executed, results 
in its purchase limitation being equalled or exceeded. If a passive 
market maker's net purchases equal or exceed its purchase limitation, it 
shall withdraw promptly its quotations from Nasdaq. If a passive market 
maker withdraws its quotations pursuant to this paragraph, it may not 
effect any bid or purchase in the covered security for the remainder of 
that day, irrespective of any later sales during that day, unless 
otherwise permitted by Sec. 242.101.
    (3) Requirement to lower the bid. If all independent bids for a 
covered security are reduced to a price below the passive market maker's 
bid, the passive market maker must lower its bid promptly to a level not 
higher than the then highest independent bid; Provided, however, That a 
passive market maker may continue to bid and effect purchases at its bid 
at a price exceeding the then highest independent bid until the passive 
market maker purchases an aggregate amount of the covered security that 
equals or, through the purchase of all securities that are part of a 
single order, exceeds the lesser of two times

[[Page 445]]

the minimum quotation size for the security, as determined by NASD 
rules, or the passive market maker's remaining purchasing capacity under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (4) Limitation on displayed size. At all times, the passive market 
maker's displayed bid size may not exceed the lesser of the minimum 
quotation size for the covered security, or the passive market maker's 
remaining purchasing capacity under paragraph (b)(2) of this section; 
Provided, however, That a passive market maker whose purchasing capacity 
at any time is between one and 99 shares may display a bid size of 100 
shares.
    (5) Identification of a passive market making bid. The bid displayed 
by a passive market maker shall be designated as such.
    (6) Notification and reporting to the NASD. A passive market maker 
shall notify the NASD in advance of its intention to engage in passive 
market making, and shall submit to the NASD information regarding 
passive market making purchases, in such form as the NASD shall 
prescribe.
    (7) Prospectus disclosure. The prospectus for any registered 
offering in which any passive market maker intends to effect 
transactions in any covered security shall contain the information 
required in Secs. 228.502, 228.508, 229.502, and 229.508 of this 
chapter.
    (c) Transactions at Prices Resulting from Unlawful Activity. No 
transaction shall be made at a price that the passive market maker knows 
or has reason to know is the result of activity that is fraudulent, 
manipulative, or deceptive under the securities laws, or any rule or 
regulation thereunder.


<R05>
Sec. 242.104  Stabilizing and other activities in connection with an offering.

    (a) Unlawful Activity. It shall be unlawful for any person, directly 
or indirectly, to stabilize, to effect any syndicate covering 
transaction, or to impose a penalty bid, in connection with an offering 
of any security, in contravention of the provisions of this section. No 
stabilizing shall be effected at a price that the person stabilizing 
knows or has reason to know is in contravention of this section, or is 
the result of activity that is fraudulent, manipulative, or deceptive 
under the securities laws, or any rule or regulation thereunder.
    (b) Purpose. Stabilizing is prohibited except for the purpose of 
preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of a security.
    (c) Priority. To the extent permitted or required by the market 
where stabilizing occurs, any person stabilizing shall grant priority to 
any independent bid at the same price irrespective of the size of such 
independent bid at the time that it is entered.
    (d) Control of Stabilizing. No sole distributor or syndicate or 
group stabilizing the price of a security or any member or members of 
such syndicate or group shall maintain more than one stabilizing bid in 
any one market at the same price at the same time.
    (e) At-the-Market Offerings. Stabilizing is prohibited in an at-the-
market offering.
    (f) Stabilizing Levels.--(1) Maximum stabilizing bid. 
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this paragraph (f), no 
stabilizing shall be made at a price higher than the lower of the 
offering price or the stabilizing bid for the security in the principal 
market (or, if the principal market is closed, the stabilizing bid in 
the principal market at its previous close).
    (2) Initiating stabilizing.--
    (i) Initiating stabilizing when the principal market is open. After 
the opening of quotations for the security in the principal market, 
stabilizing may be initiated in any market at a price no higher than the 
last independent transaction price for the security in the principal 
market if the security has traded in the principal market on the day 
stabilizing is initiated or on the most recent prior day of trading in 
the principal market and the current asked price in the principal market 
is equal to or greater than the last independent transaction price. If 
both conditions of the preceding sentence are not satisfied, stabilizing 
may be initiated in any market after the opening of quotations in the 
principal market at a price no higher than the highest current 
independent bid for the security in the principal market.
    (ii) Initiating stabilizing when the principal market is closed.

[[Page 446]]

    (A) When the principal market for the security is closed, but 
immediately before the opening of quotations for the security in the 
market where stabilizing will be initiated, stabilizing may be initiated 
at a price no higher than the lower of:
    (1) The price at which stabilizing could have been initiated in the 
principal market for the security at its previous close; or
    (2) The most recent price at which an independent transaction in the 
security has been effected in any market since the close of the 
principal market, if the person stabilizing knows or has reason to know 
of such transaction.
    (B) When the principal market for the security is closed, but after 
the opening of quotations in the market where stabilizing will be 
initiated, stabilizing may be initiated at a price no higher than the 
lower of:
    (1) The price at which stabilization could have been initiated in 
the principal market for the security at its previous close; or
    (2) The last independent transaction price for the security in that 
market if the security has traded in that market on the day stabilizing 
is initiated or on the last preceding business day and the current asked 
price in that market is equal to or greater than the last independent 
transaction price. If both conditions of the preceding sentence are not 
satisfied, under this paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B)(2), stabilizing may be 
initiated at a price no higher than the highest current independent bid 
for the security in that market.
    (iii) Initiating stabilizing when there is no market for the 
security or before the offering price is determined. If no bona fide 
market for the security being distributed exists at the time stabilizing 
is initiated, no stabilizing shall be initiated at a price in excess of 
the offering price. If stabilizing is initiated before the offering 
price is determined, then stabilizing may be continued after 
determination of the offering price at the price at which stabilizing 
then could be initiated.
    (3) Maintaining or carrying over a stabilizing bid. A stabilizing 
bid initiated pursuant to paragraph (f)(2) of this section, which has 
not been discontinued, may be maintained, or carried over into another 
market, irrespective of changes in the independent bids or transaction 
prices for the security.
    (4) Increasing or reducing a stabilizing bid. A stabilizing bid may 
be increased to a price no higher than the highest current independent 
bid for the security in the principal market if the principal market is 
open, or, if the principal market is closed, to a price no higher than 
the highest independent bid in the principal market at the previous 
close thereof. A stabilizing bid may be reduced, or carried over into 
another market at a reduced price, irrespective of changes in the 
independent bids or transaction prices for the security. If stabilizing 
is discontinued, it shall not be resumed at a price higher than the 
price at which stabilizing then could be initiated.
    (5) Initiating, maintaining, or adjusting a stabilizing bid to 
reflect the current exchange rate. If a stabilizing bid is expressed in 
a currency other than the currency of the principal market for the 
security, such bid may be initiated, maintained, or adjusted to reflect 
the current exchange rate, consistent with the provisions of this 
section. If, in initiating, maintaining, or adjusting a stabilizing bid 
pursuant to this paragraph (f)(5), the bid would be at or below the 
midpoint between two trading differentials, such stabilizing bid shall 
be adjusted downward to the lower differential.
    (6) Adjustments to stabilizing bid. If a security goes ex-dividend, 
ex-rights, or ex-distribution, the stabilizing bid shall be reduced by 
an amount equal to the value of the dividend, right, or distribution. 
If, in reducing a stabilizing bid pursuant to this paragraph (f)(6), the 
bid would be at or below the midpoint between two trading differentials, 
such stabilizing bid shall be adjusted downward to the lower 
differential.
    (7) Stabilizing of components. When two or more securities are being 
offered as a unit, the component securities shall not be stabilized at 
prices the sum of which exceeds the then permissible stabilizing price 
for the unit.

[[Page 447]]

    (8) Special prices. Any stabilizing price that otherwise meets the 
requirements of this section need not be adjusted to reflect special 
prices available to any group or class of persons (including employees 
or holders of warrants or rights).
    (g) Offerings with no U.S. Stabilizing Activities--
    (1) Stabilizing to facilitate an offering of a security in the 
United States shall not be deemed to be in violation of this section if 
all of the following conditions are satisfied:
    (i) No stabilizing is made in the United States;
    (ii) Stabilizing outside the United States is made in a jurisdiction 
with statutory or regulatory provisions governing stabilizing that are 
comparable to the provisions of this section; and
    (iii) No stabilizing is made at a price above the offering price in 
the United States, except as permitted by paragraph (f)(5) of this 
section.
    (2) For purposes of this paragraph (g), the Commission by rule, 
regulation, or order may determine whether a foreign statute or 
regulation is comparable to this section considering, among other 
things, whether such foreign statute or regulation: specifies 
appropriate purposes for which stabilizing is permitted; provides for 
disclosure and control of stabilizing activities; places limitations on 
stabilizing levels; requires appropriate recordkeeping; provides other 
protections comparable to the provisions of this section; and whether 
procedures exist to enable the Commission to obtain information 
concerning any foreign stabilizing transactions.
    (h) Disclosure and Notification--(1) Any person displaying or 
transmitting a bid that such person knows is for the purpose of 
stabilizing shall provide prior notice to the market on which such 
stabilizing will be effected, and shall disclose its purpose to the 
person with whom the bid is entered.
    (2) Any person effecting a syndicate covering transaction or 
imposing a penalty bid shall provide prior notice to the self-regulatory 
organization with direct authority over the principal market in the 
United States for the security for which the syndicate covering 
transaction is effected or the penalty bid is imposed.
    (3) Any person subject to this section who sells to, or purchases 
for the account of, any person any security where the price of such 
security may be or has been stabilized, shall send to the purchaser at 
or before the completion of the transaction, a prospectus, offering 
circular, confirmation, or other document containing a statement similar 
to that comprising the statement provided for in Item 502(d) of 
Regulation S-B (Sec. 228.502(d) of this chapter) or Item 502(d) of 
Regulation S-K (Sec. 229.502(d) of this chapter).
    (i) Recordkeeping Requirements. A person subject to this section 
shall keep the information and make the notification required by 
Sec. 240.17a-2 of this chapter.
    (j) Excepted Securities. The provisions of this section shall not 
apply to:
    (1) Exempted Securities. ``Exempted securities,'' as defined in 
section 3(a)(12) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(12)); or
    (2) Transactions of Rule 144A securities. Transactions in securities 
eligible for resale under Sec. 230.144A(d)(3) of this chapter, if such 
securities are offered or sold in the United States solely to:
    (i) Qualified institutional buyers, as defined in 
Sec. 230.144A(a)(1) of this chapter, or to offerees or purchasers that 
the seller and any person acting on behalf of the seller reasonably 
believes are qualified institutional buyers, in a transaction exempt 
from registration under section 4(2) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 
77d(2)) or Secs. 230.144A or 230.501 through 230.508 of this chapter; or
    (ii) Persons not deemed to be ``U.S. persons'' for purposes of 
Secs. 230.902(o)(2) or 230.902(o)(7) of this chapter, during a 
distribution qualifying under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section.
    (k) Exemptive Authority. Upon written application or upon its own 
motion, the Commission may grant an exemption from the provisions of 
this section, either unconditionally or on specified terms and 
conditions, to any transaction or class of transactions, or to any 
security or class of securities.

Sec. 242.105  Short selling in connection with a public offering.

    (a) Unlawful Activity. In connection with an offering of securities 
for cash pursuant to a registration statement or a notification on Form 
1-A (Sec. 239.90 of this chapter) filed under the Securities Act, it 
shall be unlawful for any person to cover a short sale with offered 
securities purchased from an underwriter or broker or dealer 
participating in the offering, if such short sale occurred during the 
shorter of:
    (1) The period beginning five business days before the pricing of 
the offered securities and ending with such pricing; or
    (2) The period beginning with the initial filing of such 
registration statement or notification on Form 1-A and ending with the 
pricing.

conducted on a firm commitment basis.

motion, the Commission may grant an exemption from the provisions of

    (3) The registrant has been subject to the periodic reporting

immediately preceding the filing of this Form and is currently in 
compliance with such obligations; and
    (4) The aggregate market value of the public float of the

(Sec. 239.39 of this chapter).

                              Instructions

    1. For purposes of this Form, ``foreign private issuer'' shall be 
construed in accordance with Rule 405 under the Securities Act.
    2. For purposes of this Form, the term ``crown corporation'' shall 
mean a corporation all of whose common shares or comparable equity is 
owned directly or indirectly by the Government of Canada or a Province 
or Territory of Canada.
    3. For purposes of this Form, the ``public float'' of specified 
securities shall mean only such securities held by persons other than 
affiliates of the issuer.
    4. For the purposes of this Form, an ``affiliate'' of a person is 
anyone who beneficially owns directly or indirectly, or exercises 
control or direction over, more than 10 percent of the outstanding 
equity shares of such person. The determination of a person's affiliates 
shall be made as of the end of such person's most recently completed 
fiscal year.
    5. For purposes of this Form, ``equity shares'' shall mean common 
shares, non-voting equity shares and subordinate or restricted voting 
equity shares, but shall not include preferred shares.
    6. For purposes of this Form, the market value of outstanding equity 
shares (whether or not held by affiliates) shall be computed by use of 
the price at which the shares were last sold, or the average of the bid 
and asked prices of such shares, in the principal market for such shares 
as of a date within 60 days prior to the date of filing. If there is no 
market for any of such securities, the book value of such securities 
computed as of the latest

[[Page 455]]

practicable date prior to the filing of this Form shall be used for 
purposes of calculating the market value, unless the issuer of such 
securities is in bankruptcy or receivership or has an accumulated 
capital deficit, in which case one-third of the principal amount, par 
value or stated value of such securities shall be used.

    (c) If the registrant is a successor registrant subsisting after a 
business combination, it shall be deemed to meet the 12-month reporting 
requirement of paragraph (b)(3) of this section if:
    (1) The time the successor registrant has been subject to the 
continuous disclosure requirements of any securities commission or 
equivalent regulatory authority in Canada, when added separately to the 
time each predecessor had been subject to such requirements at the time 
of the business combination, in each case equals at least 12 calendar 
months, provided, however, that any predecessor need not be considered 
for purposes of the reporting history calculation if the reporting 
histories of predecessors whose assets and gross revenues, respectively, 
would contribute at least 80 percent of the total assets and gross 
revenues from continuing operations of the successor registrant, as 
measured based on pro forma combination of such participating companies' 
most recently completed fiscal years immediately prior to the business 
combination, when combined with the reporting history of the successor 
registrant in each case satisfy such 12-month reporting requirement; and
    (2) The successor registrant has been subject to such continuous 
disclosure requirements since the business combination, and is currently 
in compliance with its obligations thereunder.
    (d) This Form shall not be used if the registrant is an investment 
company registered or required to be registered under the Investment 
Company Act of 1940.
    (e) Registrants registering securities on this Form, and registrants 
filing annual reports on this Form who have not previously filed a Form 
F-X (Sec. 249.250 of this chapter) in connection with the class of 
securities in relation to which the obligation to file this report 
arises, shall file a Form F-X with the Commission together with this 
Form.

broker-dealer. Disclosure of the information specified in this form is 
mandatory prior to processing of applications for withdrawal, except for 
social security account numbers, disclosure of which is voluntary. The 
information will be used for the primary purpose of determining whether 
it is in the public interest to permit a broker-dealer to withdraw his 
registration. This notice will be made a matter of public record. 
Therefore, any information, given will be available for inspection by 
any member of the public. Because of the public nature of the

including referral to other governmental authorities or securities self-
regulatory organizations for investigatory purposes or in connection 
with litigation involving the Federal securities laws and other civil, 
criminal or regulatory statutes or provisions. Social security account 
numbers, if furnished, will assist the Commission in identifying 
registrants and, therefore, in promptly processing applications for 
withdrawal. Failure to disclose the information requested by Form BDW, 
except for social security account numbers, may result in the registrant 
not being permitted to withdraw his registration.

other section now or hereafter in force pursuant to section 3(a) of the 
Act exempting any class of holding companies from the registration 
requirements of the act, is within the exemption afforded by any such 
section, or if it appears that any question exists as to whether the 
exemption of any such company may be detrimental to the public interest 
or the interest of investors or consumers, the Commission may notify 
such holding company to that effect by registered mail. Thirty days 
after such notification, such exemption shall terminate, without 
prejudice to the right of such holding company to file an application 
for an order granting such an exemption pursuant to any applicable 
section of the act, and without prejudice to any temporary exemption 
provided for by the act if such application is filed in good faith.

within the meaning of section 2(a)(3) of the Act, if such company is

Commission a statement that such company falls within the provisions of 
that subparagraph, including as exhibits (i) copies of its charter, by-
laws and any licenses issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to 
such company; (ii) a list of its members or stockholders indicating 
their respective percentages of voting power; and (iii) if such company 
was in existence at the end of the preceding calendar year, a balance 
sheet as at the end of the preceding calendar year and an income and 
surplus statement for such year or a statement of receipts and 
expenditures for such year and of financial status at its end.
    (3) As a prerequisite to retaining the status afforded by paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, any such company shall annually on or before May 
file a statement with this Commission that such company continues to 
fall within the provisions of that subparagraph, including as exhibits 
(i) any changes or additions to its charter or by-laws or list of

    (4) If it appears to the Commission (on the basis of the aforesaid 
statements or otherwise) that a substantial question of law or fact 
exists as to whether any company is entitled to the status afforded by 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Commission may notify such company 
to that effect by registered mail. Thirty days after such notification 
the status afforded by paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall no longer 
be available to such company, without prejudice to the right of such 
company to file an application for an order granting an exemption from 
the application of section 2(a)(3) of the Act, and without prejudice to

State of the United States, (2) has no subsidiary company owning any 
such assets so located, and (3) is engaged solely in business outside 
the United States, shall not be deemed to be an electric or gas utility 
company within the meaning of section 2(a)(3) or (a)(4) of the Act, if 
its gross sales of electric energy or of natural or manufactured gas 
distributed at retail, by means of facilities owned or operated by such 
company, did not exceed 1 percent of its gross revenues during the 
previous calendar year.
    (d) A company shall not be deemed to be an electric utility company 
or a gas utility company which owns any of the facilities specified in 
sections 2(a)(3) and (4) [of the Act] Provided, That:
    (1) Such company owns the facility as a company, as a trustee, or as 
holder of a beneficial interest under a trust, or as a purchaser or 
assignee of any of the foregoing; and
    (i) Such facility is leased under a net lease directly to a public 
utility company either as a sole lessee or joint lessee with one or more 
other public utility companies, and such facility is or is to be 
employed by the lessee in its operations as a public utility company; 
and
    (ii) Such company is otherwise primarily engaged in one or more 
businesses other than the business of a public utility company, or is a 
company all of whose equity interest is owned by one or more companies 
so engaged, either directly or through subsidiary companies; and

[[Page 469]]

    (iii) The terms of the lease have been expressly authorized or 
approved by a regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the rates 
and service of the public utility company which leases such facility; 
and
    (iv) The lease of the facility extends for an initial term of not 
less than 15 years, except for termination of the lease upon events 
therein set forth, unless the owner shall state in the initial 
certificate filed pursuant to paragraph (d)(5) of this section that a 
shorter term specified in the lease is not less than two-thirds of the 
expected useful life of the facility; and
    (v) The rent reserved under the lease shall not include any amount 
based, directly or indirectly, on revenues or income of the public 
utility company, or any part thereof.

Paragraphs (d)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this section shall not apply to a 
lease executed before, or within 30 days after, the effective date of 
this section, if the certificate required by paragraph (d)(5) of this 
section is filed within 60 days after such effective date.
    (2) Paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall cease to be applicable in 
the event of termination of the lessee's right to possession or use of 
the facility during its term, unless within 90 days of the date of 
termination, and subject to such prior or subsequent regulatory and 
other approvals as by law may be required, such company, as defined in 
this section, negotiates a new lease or an operating agreement at a 
fixed rental.
    (3) A public utility company shall not cease to be such by reason of 
a lease, directly or indirectly, of part or all of its facilities to any 
associate company or to any entity, whether or not a company, as defined 
in section 2(a)(2) of the Act.
    (4) Except to the extent provided in paragraphs (d)(1) and (6) of

    (5) Any company specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall 
file, or join in the filing of, a certificate on a form prescribed by 
the Commission, as to each lease within 30 days of its execution. Upon 
any transfer of legal or beneficial ownership, such new owner shall file 
an appropriate amendment within 30 days of such transfer. If the lease 
is amended in a manner which would alter any item of the certificate, or 
if the facility ceases, for any reasons, to be subject to the lease, the 
holder of legal title to the facility shall file an appropriate 
amendment within 30 days of the event.
    (6) A company shall not be deemed to be an electric utility company 
by reason of ownership of any interest in nuclear fuel and facilities 
incident to its use, if the operation and use thereof is vested by lease 
or contract in one or more public utility companies, unless the 
consideration paid by a public utility company for the use of such fuel 
and facilities, or of the heat or energy produced thereby, includes an 
amount based, directly or indirectly, on the revenue or income of the 
public utility company or any part thereof. Any such company shall file, 
or join in the filing of, the certificates specified in paragraph (d)(5) 
of this section. A certificate with respect to a lease or contract 
executed prior to, or within 30 days after, the effective date of this 
section shall be filed within 60 days after such effective date.
    (7) The provisions of paragraphs (d)(1) and (5) of this section, and 
the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(6) of this section shall not 
apply if the facilities therein specified are in possession of and 
operated by one or more governmental bodies or instrumentalities thereof 
specified in section 2(c) of the Act.

filed under section 2(a)(8) (49 Stat. 804; 15 U.S.C. 79b), whether filed 
before or after the adoption of this section, shall, unless otherwise 
expressly stated therein, be deemed to be filed on behalf of such 
applicant and of all subsidiary companies of such applicant, and shall

subsidiary company filing such application: Provided, however, That the 
Commission may in any case direct the filing of separate applications by 
any such companies or may order separate hearings or enter separate or 
different orders with respect to any such companies so deemed to be 
included pursuant to this section.

    (a) An electric utility company which is not an ``affiliate'' of any 
other company under clause (B) of section 2(a)(11) shall be exempt from 
section 9(a)(2) of the Act with respect to the acquisition of any 
security of a power supply company, either directly or through a wholly-
owned company organized solely for that purpose, provided that:
    (1) The acquisition of any securities of the power supply company, 
including its voting securities, and any obligation by such electric 
utility company to provide funds to the power supply company pursuant to 
a capital funds agreement or guarantee of its debts, is authorized by a 
regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the rates and services of 
such electric utility company;
    (2) All of the voting securities of the power supply company are 
owned by one or more electric utility companies to which the power 
supply company sells all of its electric energy, or as a transmission 
company provides all its transmission services to them or their 
customers (exclusive of any electric energy or transmission services 
which it sells to or provides to any person described in section 2(c) of 
the Act or to any rural electric cooperative association); and
    (3) The issue of securities by the power supply company (other than 
any security maturing not more than one year after the date of issue) is 
subject to express authorization by a regulatory authority having 
jurisdiction over their issuance.
    (b) If the voting securities of the power supply company are 
acquired by more than one electric utility company, the requirements of 
this rule shall apply independently to each (except that paragraph 
(a)(1) shall not apply to any person referred to in section 2(c) of the

    (a) When an electric utility company becomes a holding company with 
respect to one or more power supply companies in a transaction or 
tranactions exempted under Sec. 250.14, the electric utility company, as 
such holding company, shall be exempt pursuant to section 3(a)(2) of the 
Act. If an electric utility company otherwise qualifies for an exemption 
pursuant to section 3(a)(2) of the Act, either by order or pursuant to 
Sec. 250.2(a)(2) of these rules, that exemption shall not be affected by 
an acquisition exempt under Sec. 250.14.
    (b) The exemption under paragraph (a) of this section shall apply to 
an electric utility company whose acquisition, though not subject to 
section 9(a)(2) of the Act, satisfies all the requirements provided by

subsidiary company or as an affiliate of a registered holding company or 
of a subsidiary company thereof, as such terms are respectively defined 
in sections 2(a)(8)(A) and 2(a)(11) of the Act, if--
    (1) Such company is not a public utility company as defined in

thereof of its interest in such company has been approved by the 
Commission pursuant to sections 9(a)(1) and 10 of the Act and applicable 
rules thereunder upon a timely application to the Commission.
    (b) The exemption provided by this rule shall continue in effect 
during the pendency of such application. If an acquisition is made 
subject to Commission approval, the exemption provided by this rule is 
not terminated if the Commission does not grant its approval. In that 
event any such acquisition shall be disposed of in accordance with the 
order of the Commission.
    (c) If a registered holding company directly or indirectly acquires 
any voting securities of such company, or any other voting interest, 
pursuant to this rule, the holding company shall include as an exhibit 
to its annual report on Form U5S a copy of the annual report of such 
company. It may incorporate by reference the annual report such company 
is required to file pursuant to other statutes administered by the

jurisdiction over rates with respect to a company exempt under this 
rule, including authority over affiliate transactions by or with such 
company pursuant to the laws administered by that agency.

previously or concurrently filed with the Commission pursuant to any Act 
administered by it, the application or declaration may, subject to the 
limitations of Sec. 228.10(f) and Sec. 229.10(d) of this chapter, 
incorporate such information by exact and specific reference to the 
filing in which it was physically filed. The Commission may refuse to 
permit incorporation by reference in any instance where, in its opinion, 
such incorporation is confusing, misleading or inadequate.
    (2) Electronic filings. Any application or declaration filed in 
electronic format may incorporate by reference any information contained 
in any document previously or concurrently filed with the Commission 
under any Act administered by it, provided that, if amended, the 
document or amendment has been filed in accordance with the requirements

thereof shall be on good quality, unglazed, white paper, no larger than 
8\1/2\ x 11 inches in size. To the extent that the reduction of larger 
documents would render them illegible, such documents may be filed on 
paper larger than 8\1/2\ x 11 inches in size. All documents filed shall 
be bound on the left side in such manner as to leave the reading matter 
legible, and shall be printed, lithographed, mimeographed, typewritten, 
or prepared by any process which, in the opinion of the Commission, 
produces copies suitable for permanent records and microfilming. 
Irrespective of the process used, all copies of such material shall be 
clear, easily readable and suitable for repeated photocopying. Debits 
and credits in financial statements shall be clearly distinguishable as 
such on photocopies.

originals, one duplicate original) of all registrations, applications,

    In any proceeding instituted by the Commission, the Commission may 
direct that any party respondent shall file an answer to the allegations 
contained in the order of the Commission initiating such proceeding, or 
in any statement of facts filed in such proceeding. Unless otherwise 
directed by the Commission, such answer shall conform to the

    (1) Shall conform to the requirements of Regulation S-X as to form 
and content of financial statements; and
    (2) Shall make and keep current accounts, books and other records of 
all of its transactions in sufficient detail to permit examination, 
audit and verification of the financial statements, schedules and 
reports it is required to file with the Commission or which it issues to 
stockholders. Such accounts, books and other records shall be maintained 
in appropriate form and in sufficient detail to provide all of the 
information with respect to the business of the company specified by 
such Commission filing requirements as are in effect when the 
transactions recorded occur.
    (b) Every registered holding company shall identify in its Form U5S 
the chart of accounts used by it and by each subsidiary company.
    (1) The initial identification shall be made in the Form U5S, or a 
supplement thereto, filed in the year in which the use of such accounts 
is to begin, or in the year 1975 for charts of accounts already in use 
or proposed to be used in that year. Subsequent Forms U5S need merely 
state that no change in the accounts used has occurred, if that is the 
fact.

[[Page 477]]

    (2) A copy of each chart of accounts shall be annexed as an exhibit 
to the filing in which it is identified, except that it is unnecessary 
to file a copy of an official chart of accounts which any company 
subject to this rule is required to use by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, a state commission or by Sec. 250.27 or Sec. 250.93 under 
the Act. A company electing to use a chart of accounts promulgated by 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also need not file a copy 
thereof.
    (3) An amendment to Form U5S shall be filed as to any modification 
of such chart of accounts, except a modification made to an official 
chart of accounts by the commission which promulgated it. The amendment 
shall describe the nature, purpose and effect of the proposed 
modification and the date it is to be placed in effect. It shall be 
filed at least 30 days prior to its effective date. Unless the 
Commission directs otherwise, the chart of accounts, as so modified, 
shall be used thereafter.
    (c) Every registered holding company and every subsidiary company 
thereof shall hereafter follow the equity method of accounting for 
investments in any subsidiary company.
    (1) Each investment shall be recorded at its carrying value 
heretofore established and the actual cost of investments hereafter 
made. Each investment shall be periodically adjusted for the 
proportionate share of earnings or losses or capital changes of the 
subsidiary company since its acquisition, crediting any dividends 
received from such subsidiary company.
    (2) Every company subject to this rule shall maintain a subaccount 
to its retained earnings account which shall be periodically debited or 
credited with its proportionate share of undistributed retained earnings 
of subsidiary companies.
    (3) No company subject to this rule shall declare or pay any 
dividends or reacquire any of its own securities from or on the basis of 
any balances recorded in the subaccount referred to in paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section, except pursuant to a declaration under section 12(c) of 
the Act.
    (d) No registered holding company which is not a public utility 
company shall dispose, without authorization from the Commission, of any 
accounts, books, or other records, except pursuant to 17 CFR part 257.
    (e) This rule shall not modify or revoke any order of the Commission 
heretofore entered as to the accounting by any company subject to this 
rule including any continuing provision as to amortization or other 
disposition of any item governed thereby.
    (f) Nothing in this rule shall relieve any company subject thereto 
from compliance with the requirements as to recordkeeping and retention 
that may be prescribed by any other regulatory agency.
    (g) Any references in other rules, forms or releases under the Act 
to the uniform system of accounts shall be hereafter deemed to refer to 
this rule.

Sec. 250.27   Classification of accounts prescribed for utility companies not already subject thereto.

    (a) Every registered holding company and subsidiary thereof, which 
is a public utility company and which is not required by either the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or a State commission to conform to 
a classification of accounts, shall keep its accounts, insofar as it is 
an electric utility company, in the manner currently prescribed for 
similar companies by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or, and 
insofar as it is a gas utility company, in the manner currently 
recommended by the National Association of Railroad and Utilities 
Commissioners, except any company whose public utility activities are so 
limited that the application to it of such system of accounts is clearly 
inappropriate. A company claiming that its activities are thus limited, 
shall apply to the Commission for written instructions to that effect.
    (b) All references, in the systems of accounts made applicable by 
paragraph (a) of this section, to the authority prescribing the same and 
to orders and instructions by, and reports to, said authority, shall be 
deemed to refer to the Securities and Exchange Commission

otherwise, no registered holding company or subsidiary company thereof 
shall distribute to its security holders, or publish, financial 
statements which are inconsistent with the book accounts of such company 
or financial statements filed with this Commission by, or on behalf of, 
such company. This section shall not be deemed to prevent the 
distribution or publication of reasonable condensations or of unaudited 
financial statements or of financial statements (on a cash or other 
basis) pursuant to the requirements of an indenture or mortgage given to 
secure bonds or similar instruments, or of appropriate financial 
statements of a receiver or trustee appointed by a court of the United 
States.

company or any subsidiary thereof to a State Commission covering 
operations not reported to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
shall be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission no later than 
ten days after such submission.

indebtedness, or pursuant to the exercise of preemptive right or 
conversion privilege, or as a result of any reclassification, general 
exchange offer or reorganization: Provided, That no exemption shall be 
available under this paragraph as to the acquisition of any voting 
securities or securities convertible into voting securities if after

or indirectly, own, control, or hold 5 percent or more of the particular 
class of such securities.

transactions. In the

[[Page 479]]

ordinary course of the acquiring company's business (other than the

    (5) Securities of local enterprises. Any security issued by an 
industrial or other nonutility enterprise located in the service 
territory of the acquiring public-utility company or, if the acquiring 
company is not a public-utility company, in the service territory of the 
registered holding-company system: Provided,
    (i) The total cost of acquisitions by the acquiring company of 
securities of industrial development companies organized for the purpose 
of, and in accordance with a State law that specifically relates to, 
promoting the development of business and industry in such state does 
not exceed an annual aggregate amount of $5 million, and
    (ii) The total cost of acquisitions of securities of other local 
industrial or nonutility enterprises does not exceed an annual aggregate 
amount of $1 million. In no event, however, will the above exemption 
apply where, by reason of such acquisition, the acquiring company would 
become an affiliate of the issuer.
    (6) Small minority interests. Any security of any subsidiary 
company, if prior to such acquisition the acquiring company owns 95 
percent or more of the outstanding securities of the class acquired.
    (b) Section 9(a) (49 Stat. 817; 15 U.S.C. 79i) shall not apply to

    (c) Section 9(a)(1) shall not apply to the acquisition of securities

distribution and/or sale of material and services related wholly to such 
names and marks.
    (d) Section 9(a)(2) shall not apply to the acquisition by a person 
who is neither a registered holding company, nor a subsidiary company

section 11(b), where such securities constitute all the vendor's 
interest in a company which does not operate any utility assets and 
which is a public-utility company only by reason of the ownership of a 
reversionary interest in utility assets: Provided, That such utility 
assets are operated under lease by a company which is not an affiliate 
of either the vendor or of the vendee, and the Commission finds that by 
reason of the duration of the lease, the ownership by the lessee of 
securities of the lessor and similar matters, there is no substantial 
probability of the lessor resuming operation of said utility assets. 
Such finding of the Commission may be made in connection with an 
application by the vendor company with respect to such sale.

exceed in any calendar year the lesser of $5 million or five percent of

operations as a public-utility company during the preceding calendar 
year.

limitation in Sec. 250.58(a)(1).
    (5) Failure to demand or enforce payment with respect to all or part 
of any obligation which is by its terms payable on demand, or of any 
security which has matured, if no new agreement is entered into with 
respect to the terms or conditions of the unpaid balance thereof.
    (6) An agreement by a registered holding company or subsidiary 
company of a registered holding company to guarantee, to assume joint 
liability, or to act as a surety or as an indemnitor with respect to 
contingent liabilities or other obligations of a subsidiary of such 
company, incurred in the ordinary course of such subsidiary's business, 
if said agreement is in the form of:
    (i) A direct guarantee, assumption of liability, surety or 
indemnification of the subsidiary company's obligations which is 
required to meet the requirements of federal, state or local law; or
    (ii) An indirect guarantee of a subsidiary through a surety or 
indemnification of one or more surety companies or agencies, which have 
agreed to provide bonds of the following kinds required by subsidiary 
companies in the holding-company system:

[[Page 482]]

    (A) Court and fiduciary bonds such as appeal bonds, supersedeas 
bonds, condemnation bonds, or bonds required to free property from 
attachment or to lift an injuction;
    (B) License and permit bonds such as blasting and oversize load 
permit bonds;
    (C) United States, state and local government bonds such as customs 
bonds, workers' compensation self-insurance bonds, bonds required by the 
Internal Revenue Services, mineral right-of-way or drilling lease bonds 
and notary public bonds;
    (D) Lost instrument bonds or other bonds which may be necessary or

    (E) Admiralty bonds;
    (F) Bonds required for engineering or construction purposes such as 
bid, performance or payment bonds;
    (G) Any other bonds of a similar nature required for routine 
operational purposes;

Provided, however, That: (1) No payment, compensation or other 
consideration shall be paid or accrue to the parent company in 
consideration for such guarantee, assumption of liability, surety or 
indemnification; (2) this rule shall not be construed to apply to a 
direct or indirect guarantee, assumption of liability, surety or 
indemnification of a subsidiary company's indebtedness for borrowed 
money; and (3) the aggregate of all such direct and indirect guarantees, 
assumptions of liability, sureties or indemnifications by the parent 
company, shall not exceed the greater of $50,000,000, or 5 percent of 
the aggregate amount of the other securities of the company then 
outstanding, such securities to be valued at (i) original principal 
amount, if there is such a principal amount, and (ii) fair market value 
as of the date of issuance, if there is no such principal amount. Par 
value stock shall be treated in the same manner as no par value stock, 
i.e., as stock issued without any principal amount.
    (c) A declaration under paragraph (a) of this section shall not be 
required for the filing of a consolidated tax return by the eligible 
associate companies in a registered holding company system, or the 
execution or performance of the agreement referred to herein, if such 
consolidated tax return is filed pursuant to a tax agreement, in 
writing, relating to either federal or state taxes, for a term of one or 
more tax years among the associate companies included in the 
consolidated return, and the agreement provides for allocation among 
such associate companies of the liabilities and benefits arising from 
such consolidated tax return for each tax year in a manner not 
inconsistent with the following conditions:
    (1) Definitions:
    Consolidated tax is the aggregate tax liability for a tax year, 
being the tax shown on the consolidated return and any adjustments 
thereto thereafter determined. The consolidated tax will be the refund 
if the consolidated return shows a negative tax.
    Corporate tax credit is a negative separate return tax of an 
associate company for a tax year, equal to the amount by which the 
consolidated tax is reduced by including a net corporate taxable loss or 
other net tax benefit of such associate company in the consolidated tax 
return.
    Corporate taxable income is the income or loss of an associate 
company for a tax year, computed as though such company had filed a 
separate return on the same basis as used in the consolidated return, 
except that dividend income from associate companies shall be 
disregarded, and other intercompany transactions eliminated in the 
consolidated return shall be given appropriate effect. It shall be 
further adjusted to allow for applicable rights accrued to the associate 
company under paragraphs (c) (4) and (5) of this section or under prior 
rules or orders, on the basis of other tax years, but carryovers or 
carrybacks shall not be taken into account if the associate company has 
been paid a corporate tax credit therefor. If an associate company is a 
member of the registered system's consolidated tax group for only part 
of a tax year, that period will be deemed to be its tax year for all 
purposes under paragraph (c) of this section.
    Separate return tax is the tax on the corporate taxable income of an 
associate company computed as though such

[[Page 483]]

company were not a member of a consolidated group.
    (2) The consolidated tax shall be apportioned among the several 
members of the group in proportion to (i) the corporate taxable income 
of each such member, or (ii) the separate return tax of each such 
member, but the tax apportioned to any subsidiary shall not exceed the 
separate return tax of such subsidiary.
    (3) The tax agreement shall provide for appropriate and equitable 
adjustment of the allocation specified under paragraph (c) (2)(i) or 
(2)(ii) of this section if the sum of the corporate taxable incomes or 
separate return taxes of all members of the group in any taxable year 
differs from the consolidated taxable income or tax because of 
intercompany transactions excluded from the consolidated return. It 
shall provide for appropriate and equitable adjustment of the allocation 
specified under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) to the extent that the consolidated 
tax and separate return tax for any year include material items taxed at 
different rates or involving other special benefits or limitations. Such 
adjustments will be directed to allocating to the individual members of 
the group the material effects of any particular features of the tax law 
applicable to them.
    (4) The tax agreement may exclude from the allocation under 
paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section associate companies not having a 
positive corporate taxable income for the year being allocated, or under 
paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section associate companies not having a 
positive separate return tax for the year being allocated. An agreement 
under this paragraph shall make appropriate and equitable provision for 
preserving to each subsidiary company so excluded the equivalent of any 
rights which such company would have had, under the applicable tax law, 
had it filed a separate return, to use in other years any loss or credit 
availed of by the group through the consolidated return. With respect to 
carryover rights, such provisions will normally consist of recognition 
of the carryover in future allocations by reducing the consolidated tax 
allocation in the subsequent year of the subsidiary company entitled to 
the benefit, and by charging the excess to the companies which had 
benefited by the prior deduction or credit. In the case of a carryback, 
the excluded subsidiary company should normally be paid the amount of 
refund to which it would have been entitled had it filed a separate 
return.
    (5) The agreement may, instead of excluding members as provided in 
paragraph (c)(4), include all members of the group in the tax 
allocation, recognizing negative corporate taxable income or a negative 
corporate tax, according to the allocation method chosen. An agreement 
under this paragraph shall provide that those associate companies with a 
positive allocation will pay the amount allocated and those subsidiary 
companies with a negative allocation will receive current payment of 
their corporate tax credits. The agreement shall provide a method for 
apportioning such payments, and for carrying over uncompensated 
benefits, if the consolidated loss is too large to be used in full. Such 
method may assign priorities to specified kinds of benefits.
    (6) The tax agreement for each taxable year shall be filed as an 
exhibit to the system's annual report on Form U5S (Sec. 259.5s of this 
chapter) for the previous taxable year. The initial filing after the 
effective date of this amendment shall be made as an amendment to the 
last Form U5S filed. If an existing tax agreement is merely renewed or 
amended, prior filings may be incorporated by reference. Amendments to a 
tax agreement shall be filed as an amendment to the Form U5S. Any 
amendment which would alter the allocation to any associate company for 
any period preceding its adoption shall be conditioned on approval by 
the Commission if the Commission directs, within 60 days after its 
filing, that it be deemed to be a declaration under Rule 45(a).

Sec. 250.46   Dividend declarations and payments on certain indebtedness.

    (a) Dividends. No registered holding company or subsidiary thereof 
shall declare or pay any dividend on any security of such company out of 
capital or unearned surplus, except pursuant to a declaration notifying 
the Commission of the proposed transaction, which has become effective 
in accordance with the procedure specified in Sec. 250.23, and pursuant 
to the order of the Commission with respect to such declaration under 
the applicable provisions of the act.
    (b) Payments on certain indebtedness. No registered holding company 
or subsidiary company thereof shall, directly or indirectly, make any 
payment of principal or interest on any note, bond, book account or any 
indebtedness however evidenced which is or was issued as, or based upon 
a dividend or dividends created or issued or declared from, or charged 
against, capital or unearned surplus, or in renewal of, or in exchange 
for any such obligation, whether such dividend was declared before or 
after the act took effect, except pursuant to a declaration notifying 
the Commission of the proposed transaction, which has become effective 
in accordance with the procedure specified in Sec. 250.23, and pursuant 
to the order of the Commission with respect to such declaration under 
the applicable provisions of the Act. In determining whether proposed 
payments on any such indebtedness issued or declared as a dividend in 
part out of earned surplus and in part out of capital or unearned 
surplus, or issued in renewal of, or in exchange for, such indebtedness, 
fall within this paragraph, past payments on account of such 
indebtedness or any predecessor indebtedness shall be deemed to have 
been first applied in reduction of the portion of such indebtedness 
issued or declared as a dividend out of earned surplus.

Sec. 250.47   Exemption of public utility subsidiaries as to certain securities issued to the Rural Electrification Administration.

security of which it is the issuer in an amount not exceeding in any one 
calendar year 2 percent of the aggregate of the outstanding funded

with respect to the pledge of any security or other property as 
collateral for any security so issued or sold, and with respect to the 
redemption or retirement, in whole or in part, of any such security.
    (b) Certificate of notification. Within 10 days after the issue or 
sale of any security exempt under this section, the issuer shall file 
with the Commission a certificate of notification on Form U-6B-2 
containing the information prescribed by that form.

U.S.C. 79i) with respect to the acquisition, in the ordinary course of 
business, of any evidence of indebtedness executed by customers of such 
public utility company as consideration for the purchase (whether from 
such public utility company, from an associate company thereof, or from 
dealers) of standard electric or gas appliances, or reacquisition of any 
such security guaranteed by such company.
    (2) Guarantee. Any public utility company, or subsidiary thereof, or

activities. See Sec. 250.22(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Issuance of note. Any public utility company, or subsidiary 
thereof, or associated service company thereof, shall be exempt from the 
provisions of section 6(a) of the Act with respect to the issue or sale 
of any note or draft which is, and at all times will be, secured by a 
pledge of such customers' evidence of indebtedness having a principal 
amount still unpaid at least equal to the unpaid principal amount of 
such note or draft. This paragraph shall be inapplicable to any company 
which is a registered holding company.<SUP>4
    </SUP>(4) Acquisition of guaranteed paper or retirement of notes. 
Any public utility company, or subsidiary thereof, or associate service 
company thereof, shall be exempt from section 9(a) of the Act and

any note or draft or customers' evidence of indebtedness issued or 
guaranteed by such company under the circumstances described in 
paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
    (b) Exemption in connection with loans to employees. Each registered 
holding company and any subsidiary company thereof is exempted from

the acquisition of any evidence of indebtedness from its employee in 
consideration of a loan made to such employee and each subsidiary of a 
registered holding company is exempted from section 6(a) of the Act (49 
Stat. 814; 15 U.S.C. 79f) with respect to the guarantee of indebtedness 
of it employee:
    (1) If such transaction is made pursuant to a personnel policy of 
general application adopted in writing by the board of directors of such 
company, or by a committee or executive officer authorized by the board 
of directors so to act and communicated to the class of employees to 
which it applies; and does not cause the total amount of guarantees and 
loans of all companies in the holding-company system to or for the 
account of such employee, outstanding at the time of the transaction, to 
exceed the limits specified in the applicable personnel policy.
    (2) The exemption also extends to securities or guarantees incident 
to bona fide advances to the employee for travel or other reimbursable 
expenses and current indebtedness of the employee for goods or services 
sold by the system companies in the ordinary course of business.
    (3) Each company intending to avail itself of this exemption 
subsequent to the effective date of this rule shall file, as an exhibit 
or as an amendment to the system's annual report on Form U5S, a copy of 
such personnel policy.

As used in this rule, the term ``employee'' includes an officer and does 
not include a director who is not an officer or employee; and the term 
``guarantee'' includes the assumption of an indebtedness or of an 
obligation to purchase such indebtedness or otherwise to provide a means 
of payment if the primary obligor fails to pay.

Sec. 250.51   Acquisitions pursuant to preliminary agreements and invitation for tenders.

    For the purpose of section 9(a) of the Act, the term ``acquire'' is 
defined to include the making of a contract or agreement (herein called 
Preliminary Agreement) pursuant to which a person subject to section 
9(a) (of the Act) (herein called the Proposed Acquirer) contingently or 
otherwise acquires any right or becomes subject to any obligation to 
acquire directly or indirectly any securities or utility assets or any 
other interest in any business, or to direct any other person to make 
any sale or acquisition of any securities or utility assets or any other 
interest in any business. Except where an exemption from section 9(a) 
(of the Act) may be applicable, the making of such Preliminary Agreement 
or the taking of any action in connection therewith, without prior 
approval of the Commission, by any person so subject to section 9(a) (of 
the Act) shall be deemed unlawful, unless all of the following 
conditions are satisfied:
    (a) The transaction contemplated by the Preliminary Agreement is 
expressly conditioned on Commission approval and the application for 
such approval is filed with the Commission as soon as practicable.
    (b) No standby, option, or similar fee is paid or payable by or on 
behalf of the

[[Page 487]]

Proposed Acquirer as consideration for the Preliminary Agreement.
    (c) The Proposed Acquirer does not indemnify or agree to indemnify 
any person against any market or investment risk in connection with such 
person's acquisition, retention or disposition of the subject matter of 
the proposed acquisition.
    (d) The Proposed Acquirer does not transfer to any person (other 
than a subsidiary or successor in interest by merger or consolidation), 
by way of assignment or otherwise, any of its rights or interests in 
respect of the subject matter of the proposed acquisition unless such 
transfer is conditioned upon consummation of the Preliminary Agreement 
following its approval by the Commission.
    (e) In case a proposed transaction includes an acquisition of 
securities pursuant to an invitation for tenders to be made prior to the 
approval of such acquisition, provision shall be made that any person 
tendering such securities (the Tenderer) may demand in writing the 
return of any deposited securities at any time after 60 days from the 
initial mailing or publication of the invitation for tenders unless 
prior to the receipt of such demand either (1) the proposed acquisition 
has been approved by the Commission and the Proposed Acquirer is 
obligated to consummate the transaction or (2) the Tenderer has been 
issued a transferable certificate of deposit which meets the conditions 
specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (f) A transferable certificate of deposit for purposes of paragraph 
(e) of this section may be issued in exchange for tendered securities 
subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The terms of the certificate of deposit as proposed to be issued 
are specified in the invitations for tenders, including equitable 
provisions for return of the tendered securities in the event the 
proposed transaction is not approved by the Commission or otherwise 
fails of consummation, for exercise of voting rights and for receipt of 
dividends or interest by the Tenderer during the deposit period.
    (2) The Proposed Acquirer files with the Commission an application-
declaration proposing the issuance of such certificates of deposit in 
exchange for tendered securities.
    (3) Upon notice and after a hearing which shall be limited to the 
fairness of the terms and conditions of such issuance and exchange and 
to compliance with the conditions of this Rule, the Commission in its 
descretion may by order permit such issuance and exchange on such terms 
and conditions as it shall approve. Any person to whom it is proposed to 
issue a certificate of deposit shall be entitled to appear at such 
hearing.
    (4) If the terms and conditions specified in the certificates of 
deposit to be issued pursuant to order of the Commission differ from 
those specified in the invitation for tenders previously published by 
the Proposed Acquirer, the Commission may in such order require the 
Proposed Acquirer to give notice thereof by mail (and publication if 
deemed appropriate) to all persons who have tendered their securities 
and to provide up to 20 days after mailing of such notice for any such 
person to elect, in a manner prescribed by the Commission, either to 
continue to or revoke his tender. The terms and conditions specified in 
the certificates of deposit may be modified only pursuant to order of 
the Commission.

    (1) The issue and sale of such security are solely for the purpose 
of financing the business of such public utility subsidiary company;
    (2) The issue and sale of such security have been expressly 
authorized by the state commission of the state in which such subsidiary 
company is organized and doing business; and
    (3) The interest rates and maturity dates of any debt security 
issued to an

[[Page 488]]

associate company are designed to parallel the effective cost of capital 
of that associate company.
    (b) Any subsidiary of a registered holding company which is not a 
holding company, a public-utility company, an investment company, or a 
fiscal or financing agency of a holding company, a public-utility 
company or an investment company shall be exempt from section 6(a) of 
the Act (15 U.S.C. 79f(a)) and rules thereunder with respect to the

    (1) The issue and sale of such security are solely for the purpose 
of financing the existing business of such subsidiary company; and
    (2) The interest rates and maturity dates of any debt security 
issued to an associate company are designed to parallel the effective 
cost of capital of that associate company; Provided, That any security 
issued to an associate company by any energy-related company subsidiary, 
as defined in Sec. 250.58, shall not be exempt hereunder unless, after 
giving effect thereto, the aggregate investment by a registered holding 
company or any subsidiary thereof in such subsidiary and all other such 
energy-related company subsidiaries does not exceed the limitation in

under this section, the issuer or seller shall file with the Commission 
a Certificate of Notification on Form U-6B-2 (17 CFR 259.206) containing 
the information prescribed by that form. However, with respect to exempt 
financing transactions between associate companies which involve the 
repetitive issue or sale of securities or are part of an intrasystem 
financing program involving the issuance and sale of securities not 
exempted by this section, the filing of information on Form U-6B-2 may 
be done on a calendar quarterly basis.
    (d) The acquisition by a company in a registered holding company 
system of any security issued and sold by any associate company, 
pursuant to this section, is exempt from the requirements of section 
9(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 79i(a)); provided that the exemption granted 
by this paragraph (d) shall not apply to any transaction involving the 
issue and sale of securities to form a new subsidiary company of a 
registered holding company.

Sec. 250.53  Certain registered holding company financings in connection with the acquisition of one or more exempt wholesale generators.

    (a) In determining whether to approve the issue or sale of a 
security by a registered holding company for purposes of financing the 
acquisition of an exempt wholesale generator, or the guarantee of a 
security of an exempt wholesale generator by a registered holding 
company, the Commission shall not make a finding that such security is 
not reasonably adapted to the earning power of such company or to the 
security structure of such company or companies in the same holding 
company system, or that the circumstances are such as to constitute the 
making of such guarantee an improper risk for such company, if the 
following conditions are met:
    (1) Aggregate investment does not exceed 50% of the system's 
consolidated retained earnings.
    (i) Aggregate investment means all amounts invested, or committed to 
be invested, in exempt wholesale generators and foreign utility 
companies, for which there is recourse, directly or indirectly, to the 
registered holding company. Among other things, the term includes, but 
is not limited to, preliminary development expenses that culminate in 
the acquisition of an exempt wholesale generator or a foreign utility 
company; and the fair market value of assets acquired by an exempt 
wholesale generator or a foreign utility company from a system company 
(other than an exempt wholesale generator or a foreign utility company).
    (ii) Consolidated retained earnings means the average of the 
consolidated retained earnings of the registered holding company system 
as reported for the four most recent quarterly periods on the holding 
company's Form 10-K or 10-Q (Sec. 249.308a or Sec. 249.310 of this 
chapter, respectively) filed under the

[[Page 489]]

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
    (2) The registered holding company maintains books and records to 
identify investments in and earnings from any exempt wholesale generator 
or foreign utility company in which it directly or indirectly holds an

    (4) A person's gross revenues from its own commercial and investment 
banking activities and from its ratable share of the commercial banking

incidentally to such a sale; and such transactions shall be exempt from

and the rules and regulations thereunder: Provided, That, where any such

<R05>
Sec. 250.82   Temporary exemption from section 13.

    (a) Every registered holding company shall be exempt from the 
provisions of section 13 (49 Stat. 825; 15 U.S.C. 79m) and the rules and 
regulations adopted thereunder for a period of 30 days after the date 
when such company shall first become a registered holding company, and 
every subsidiary of such a registered holding company and every company 
principally engaged in performing services or construction for, or 
making sales to, associates of such registered holding company shall

such month all accounts and records of such company with respect to such 
matters shall be maintained in accordance with the provisions of

and of the rules and regulations thereunder that would have been 
applicable to it if the Commission had previously taken favorable action 
on such application or declaration.

Sec. 250.83   Exemption in the case of transactions with foreign associates.

    (a) Any subsidiary company of a registered holding company, which 
subsidiary is or is about to become engaged in the performance of any 
service, sales, or construction contract for any associate company which 
does not derive, directly or indirectly, any material part of its income 
from sources within the United States and which is not a public utility 
company operating within the United States, may make application to the 
Commission for exemption, in whole or in part, from the standards 
established by section 13(b) of the Act (49 Stat. 825; 15 U.S.C. 79m), 
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, relating to the 
performance of any service, sales, or construction contract for such 
associate companies.
    (b) No form is prescribed therefor, but every such application shall 
comply with the provisions of Sec. 250.20. Every such application shall 
fully set forth information regarding ownership of security issues, 
servicing activities of the applicant, and such other data as may be 
necessary to enable the Commission to determine if, by reason of the 
lack of any major interest of holders of securities offered in the 
United States in servicing arrangements affecting such serviced 
subsidiaries, or for any other reason, such an application for exemption 
should be granted as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or 
for the protection of investors.
    (c) Upon filing such an application in good faith, the applicant 
shall be entitled to a temporary exemption from all provisions of 
section 13(b) of the Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated 
thereunder, as to which an exemption is sought, pending action by the 
Commission upon the application.
    (d) Any subsidiary company of a registered holding company 
(including a mutual service company) may perform service, sales, or 
construction contracts for any associate company which does not derive, 
directly or indirectly, any material part of its income from sources 
within the United States and which is not a public utility company 
operating within the United States without complying with the standards 
established by section 13(b) of the Act, and the rules and regulations 
thereunder, and without the necessity of filing an application for or 
securing an order of exemption from those standards, so long as the 
aggregate cost to all such associate companies for services, sales, or 
construction performed by virtue of the exemption granted by this 
paragraph (whether performed by one or more subsidiary companies or 
mutual service companies in the same holding company system) does not 
exceed $10,000 within any one calendar year.

such associate to meet a break-down or other emergency, and the parties

    (a) Application for approval of a company as a mutual service 
company shall be filed by the company, or the persons proposing to 
organize it, with the Commission on Form U-13-1, as specified in the 
instructions for that form. The Commission will not approve any company 
as a mutual service company unless it finds that the company is so 
organized as to capitalization, ownership by, and representation of, 
member companies, costs, revenues, and the sharing thereof, and other 
matters as reasonably to insure the efficient and economical performance 
of services or construction or sale of goods by the company for or to

and at a reasonable saving over the cost of comparable services or 
construction performed or goods sold by independent persons.

registered holding company (other than a mutual service company) is so 
organized and conducted or to be conducted, as to meet the requirements

filed with the Commission on Form U-13-1, as specified in the 
instructions for that form, by such company or the persons proposing to 
organize it.
    (c) Within a reasonable time after the filing of an application for 
approval of a mutual service company, the Commission shall, after notice 
and opportunity for hearing, enter an order granting or refusing 
approval or otherwise disposing of the application.
    (d) Within a reasonable time after the filing of a declaration with 
respect to the organization and conduct of business of a subsidiary

approval of a mutual service company, or the finding that a subsidiary 
service company's organization and conduct of business are sufficient to 
meet the requirements

Commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, shall find that

<R05>
Sec. 250.89   Termination of contracts.

    Every service, sales, or construction contract made after April 1, 
1936, between a registered holding company and an associate company 
thereof which is a public utility company, a mutual service company, or 
a company engaged in the business of performing services or construction 
for, or selling goods to, associate public utility companies, or between 
a subsidiary company of a registered holding company (including a mutual 
service company) and any associate company thereof, shall contain 
provision for its termination to the extent that performance may 
conflict with any rule, regulation or order of the Commission adopted 
before or after the making of such contract.


<R05>
Sec. 250.90   Transactions limited to cost.

    (a) Except as permitted by this section, or any other appliable 
rule, regulation, or order of the Commission:
    (1) No registered holding company shall perform any service or 
construction for, or sell any goods to, any associate company thereof 
which is a public utility company, a mutual service company, or a 
company engaged in the business of performing service or construction 
for, or selling goods to, associate public utility companies, or enter 
into any contract to do so, and
    (2) No subsidiary company of a registered holding company (including 
a mutual service company) shall perform any service or construction for, 
or sell any goods to, any associate company thereof, or enter into any 
contract to do so, at more than cost as determined pursuant to 
Sec. 250.91 or any other applicable rule, regulation, or order of the 
Commission, or in the absence thereof, in accordance with sound methods 
of determining cost. In the case of a sale of used goods the price shall 
be not more than cost less depreciation. Any charges on a basis of 
estimated cost shall be readjusted to actual cost at least annually, if 
for services or goods, and upon completion of individual projects, in 
case of construction.
    (b) In the case of construction for an associate company of a 
specific proj- ect, building, or unit on which substantial expenses were 
incurred before August 26, 1935, pursuant to a contract made before that 
date, the holding company or subsidiary performing the construction 
shall be entitled to the proportion of its profit or fee earned prior to 
April 1, 1936.
    (c) If a sale of goods is merely incidental to a sale of an entire 
business or a substantial portion thereof, or to a sale of assets other 
than goods, a lump sum price for the entire transaction may include such 
goods without the assignment of a specific portion of the price to the 
cost of such goods.
    (d) The price of services, construction, or goods need not be 
limited to cost although the transaction comes within the terms of 
paragraph (a) of this section if:
    (1) Neither the company performing the services or construction, or 
selling the goods, nor the associate company receiving such services or 
construction, or buying such goods, is (i) a public utility or holding 
company, (ii) an investment company or investment trust, including any 
company or trust which is a medium of investment in securities for the 
benefit of a registered holding company or its employees or officers, or 
(iii) a company engaged in the business of selling goods to associate 
companies or performing services or construction, or (iv) a company 
controlling, directly or indirectly, any company specified in paragraph 
(d)(1) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section; or
    (2) Such transaction consists of a sale of goods produced by the 
seller.


<R05>
Sec. 250.91   Determination of cost.

    (a) Subject to the provisions of this section and of any other 
applicable rule, regulation, or order of the Commission, a transaction 
shall be deemed to be performed at not more than cost if the price 
(taking into account all

[[Page 503]]

charges) does not exceed a fair and equitable allocation of expenses 
(including the price paid for goods) plus reasonable compensation for 
necessary capital procured through the issuance of capital stock (or 
similar securities of an unincorporated company).
    (b) Direct charges shall be made so far as costs can be identified 
and related to the particular tranactions involved without excessive 
effort or expense. Other elements of cost, including taxes, interest, 
other overhead, and compensation for the use of capital procured by the 
issuance of capital stock (or similar securities of an unincorporated 
company) shall be fairly and equitably allocated. Interest on borrowed 
capital and compensation for the use of capital shall represent a 
reasonable return on only the amount of capital reasonably necessary for 
the performance of services or construction for, or the selling of goods 
to, customers for whom transactions are required by the rules of the 
Commission to be performed at cost. Such amount shall not include the 
cost of assignment of, or any capitalization of, any service, sales, or 
construction contract.
    (c) Any expense (including the price paid for goods) incurred in a 
transaction with an associate company of the performing or selling 
company (directly or through one or more other associate companies 
thereof), to the extent that it exceeds the cost of such transaction to 
such associate company, shall not be included in determining cost to 
such performing or selling company.
    (d) Any expense (including the price paid for goods) incurred in a 
transaction with a person other than an associate company but not at 
arm's-length, to the extent that it exceeds the expense at which the 
performing or selling company might reasonably be expected to obtain 
elsewhere, or to furnish itself, comparable performance, goods, capital, 
or other items of expense involved (giving due regard to quality, 
quantity, regularity of supply, and other factors entering into the 
calculation of a fair price), shall not be included in determining cost 
to such performing or selling company.


<R05>
Sec. 250.92   Sales of goods produced by seller.

    (a) No registered holding company shall sell any goods produced by 
it to any associate company thereof which is a public utility company, a 
mutual service company, or a company engaged in the business of 
performing services or construction for, or selling goods to, associate 
public utility companies, or enter into any contract to do so, and,
    (b) No subsidiary company of a registered holding company (including 
a mutual service company) shall sell any goods produced by it to any 
associate company thereof, or enter into any contract to do so,

at a price which exceeds the price at which the purchaser might 
reasonably be expected to obtain comparable goods elsewhere, or to 
furnish them itself, giving due regard to quality, quantity, regularity 
of supply, and other factors entering into the calculation of a fair 
price.


<R05>
Sec. 250.93  Accounts and records of mutual and subsidiary service companies.

    \6\See Sec. 250.20(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) Orders granting exemption from rules. Any transaction subject to 
the requirements of any rule promulgated under the act may be exempted 
therefrom by the Commission upon application, or upon its own motion 
provided an application for approval of such transaction or a 
declaration with respect thereto is pending, if it appears to the 
Commission that such requirements as applied to such transaction are not 
necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of 
investors or consumers.
    (b) Orders withdrawing exemption. Any unexecuted transaction which 
is within the exemption provided in any rule from the requirements of 
any provision of the act or of the rules, may nevertheless be subjected 
thereto by order, after notice and opportunity for hearing, if it 
appears to the Commission that the withdrawal of such exemption as 
applied to such transaction would be appropriate in the public interest 
or the interest of investors or consumers. The Commission may by such 
notice suspend the applicability of any such exemption to any 
transaction pending final determination.

    Preliminary Note: If any person wishes to object to the public 
disclosure of any information contained in a filing with the Commission 
under any provision of the Act then that portion thereof which contains 
such information shall be submitted in paper format only, whether or not 
the filer is an electronic filer.
    (a) General provision. Unless otherwise directed by the Commission, 
all information contained in any notification, statement, application, 
declaration, report, or other document filed with the Commission shall

statement, application, declaration, report, or other document with the 
Commission under any provision of the act, or of any rules or order of 
the Commission thereunder, wishes to object to the public disclosure of 
any information contained therein, he shall file that portion thereof 
which contains such information separately from the remainder and shall 
plainly mark it ``Confidential Treatment''. There shall also be filed 
with such information written objection to its public disclosure which 
(1) shall identify that portion of the notification, statement, 
application, declaration, report or other document to the public 
disclosure of which objection is made, (2) shall state the reasons why 
public disclosure thereof is not necessary or appropriate in the public 
interest or for the protection of investors or consumers, and (3) may

    (c) Information obtained in the course of examinations, studies, and

information relating to the subject matter of such document is 
nevertheless included in material filed with the Commission pursuant to 
a determination of an appropriate department or agency of the United 
States that disclosure of such information would not be contrary to the 
interests of national defense or foreign policy, a statement from such

Sec. 256.00-1  Preface.

    (a) The accompanying Uniform System of Accounts for Mutual Service

[[Page 511]]

and Subsidiary Service Companies represents a modernization of the 
accounting system for such companies to provide a detailed system of 
accounts which is tailored to present and expanded services, including 
data processing, modeling, rate analysis, system analysis, budgeting and 
other support services such as fuel management and analysis, being 
rendered by such companies. This Uniform System of Accounts is not 
applicable to gas or electric utility companies, or companies primarily 
engaged (1) in production of goods, including exploration and 
development of fuel resources, (2) in the provision of water, telephone, 
or similar services, the sale of which is normally subject to public 
rate regulation, (3) in provision of transportation, whether or not so 
regulated, or (4) in the ownership of property, including leased 
property and fuel reserves, for the use of associate companies.
    (b) It has been the Commission's task to provide a system 
comprehensive enough to cover the traditional services and the present 
services being performed by such companies, yet elastic enough to permit 
adaptation to varying requirements; a system which, faithfully applied, 
will provide information essential in the administration of section 13 
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, will be workable and 
reasonably simple from an operating viewpoint, and free from unnecessary 
complexities or burdensome requirements which might render it 
incompatible with the interests of investors or consumers.
    (c) This Uniform System of Accounts requires the service company to 
(1) design subaccounts and keep memorandum and time records to 
facilitate the preparation of reports and statements required by 
regulatory commissions and the conduct of audit and account inspection 
programs, (2) establish a work order system to accumulate reimbursable 
costs and charges to customers, and (3) account for compensation for use 
of capital, if paid.
    (d) Credits to the accounts or memorandum records may be made upon 
the basis of estimated costs to associate companies which shall conform 
as nearly as may be practicable to actual costs: Provided, That at 
stated intervals adjustments of the estimated costs to actual costs 
shall be made. Invoices to associate companies shall clearly indicate 
any adjustments to estimated cost previously billed. Such adjustments 
may be made at intervals during the fiscal year, but final adjustments 
shall be made at the end of such year. Overbillings or underbillings 
arising from these adjustments shall be cleared through the appropriate 
account and offset by adjustments to other accounts involved.
    (e) The ``expense'' accounts provided have been designed to show the 
cost of each general class of service furnished by the service company 
and with a view toward securing an equitable allocation thereof to the 
associate companies served.
    (f) Consideration was given in the preparation of this system to the 
necessity of providing for a more detailed classification of service 
costs in order to permit these costs to be identified with the 
functional processes of the associate companies served. In this 
connection, each service company shall maintain a work order system for 
accumulating reimbursable costs and charges to customers and maintain 
time records for all service company employees in order to support the 
accounting allocation of all expenses assignable to the types of 
services performed and chargeable to the companies served.
    (g) It is believed that the results to be obtained from the system 
now prescribed, together with the more detailed information to be called 
for in the annual reports, will provide a better basis for identifying 
cost than is presently available.


<R05>
Sec. 256.01-1  Companies for which this system of accounts is prescribed.

    (a) This Uniform System of Accounts is designed for use by: (1) Any 
company operating, or organized to operate, as a mutual service company

conduct of business the Commission has found to meet the requirements of 
section 13(b) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, with 
respect to the performance of

[[Page 512]]

services or construction work for, or the sale of goods to, associate 
companies.
    (b) This Uniform System of Accounts is not applicable to gas or 
electric utility companies; or companies primarily engaged (1) in 
production of goods, including exploration and development of fuel 
resources, (2) in the provision of water, telephone, or similar 
services, the sale of which is normally subject to public rate 
regulation, (3) in provision of transportation, whether or not so 
regulated, or (4) in the ownership of property, including leased 
property and fuel reserves, for the use of associate companies.


<R05>
Sec. 256.01-2  Application to service companies doing business with nonassociate companies.

    While this Uniform System of Accounts is designed for companies 
whose principal business is the performance of services or construction 
for associate companies at cost, it contemplates situations in which the 
service company may perform service or construction for nonassociate 
companies in transactions in which charges are not limited to cost. In 
recognition of such charges account 458-4 is included in the ``Income'' 
group for ``Excess or deficiency on servicing nonassociate companies.'' 
A deficiency incurred in a project deemed beneficial to the associate 
companies may be charged to associate companies subject to disallowance 
by a State or Federal Commission having jurisdiction over the rates or 
services of such associates. To the extent not so chargeable, or if 
disallowed, such a deficiency will be charged to account 458-4. In 
computing charges to associate companies for any fiscal year, any net 
credit in this account must be deducted from amounts reimbursable by 
associate companies as compensation for use of capital invested in the 
service company.


<R05>
Sec. 256.01-3  General structure of accounting system.

    (a) The accounts provided herein are in two general categories: 
Balance sheet accounts and income and expense accounts. Subsidiary 
accounts are provided for the details of account 101, Service company 
property.
    (b) The income and expense accounts include, under separate 
divisions, accounts for recording the revenue or income earned or 
received and also appropriate accounts for all expenses of operation, 
maintenance, taxes, interest, all elements of cost allocable to the 
service performed, and compensation for the use of capital. Appropriate 
subdivisions or subaccounts should be provided for each service company 
department or division.
    (c) All disbursements and expenses of the service company for 
service performed for associate companies are recoverable from such 
companies. In the interest of minimizing questions as to the propriety 
of charges for reimbursement, each service company shall maintain a work 
order system for accumulating all costs. To the maximum extent possible, 
such costs shall be accumulated by direct charges. All employees, 
including officers, of the service company shall keep, within reasonable 
cost benefit standards, time records which permit ready identification 
of the hours worked, account numbers charged, department work order 
number and other code designations that facilitate proper 
classification.
    (d) The numbers to the right of the decimal point in most cases 
correspond with the respective account numbers in the Uniform System of 
Accounts for Public Utilities and Licensees (18 CFR Part 101) of the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and shall be considered as parts of 
the account titles. Each service company, however, may adopt for its own 
purposes a different system of account numbers provided that the account 
numbers herein prescribed shall appear in the descriptive headings of 
the ledger accounts and, if practicable, on original source documents. 
Service companies adopting a different system of account numbers for 
their own purposes shall keep readily available a list which indicates 
its account numbers and the corresponding account numbers provided 
herein. Records of service companies shall be maintained in a manner 
permitting ready analysis by prescribed accounts (with direct reference 
to the source of each item in the books of original entry) and 
permitting preparation of financial operating statements directly

[[Page 513]]

from such records at the end of each accounting period.


<R05>
Sec. 256.01-4  Construction or service contracts, and centralized procurement accounting.

    (a) Specific accounts have not been provided in which to classify 
expenditures made in the performance of construction or service 
contracts, under which the service company undertakes projects to 
construct physical property for associate or nonassociate companies. The 
difference in the nature of undertakings which will be embraced in such 
contracts renders impracticable an attempt to prescribe the accounts 
applicable in all cases. The service company shall keep records pursuant 
to its work order system indicating the cost of each contract or 
project, the amount of service costs allocated thereto, and such 
additional classification of expenditures relating to projects as will 
meet the accounting requirements of the company for which the work is 
performed.
    (b) Service costs allocated to construction shall include the proper 
proportion of salaries, expense of officers and employees, pay of 
employees on the service company's regular staff specifically assigned 
to construction work, and other expenses of maintaining the service 
company's organization and equipment. Cost of materials, construction 
payrolls, outside services, and other expenses directly attributable to 
construction work shall be excluded from the accounting system of the 
service company and charged directly by the vendor or supplier to the 
construction project.
    (c) Service costs allocated to centralized procurement activities 
shall include only the cost of the support services performed by the 
service company in connection with the procurement of goods for 
associate companies. Cost of goods procured shall be excluded from the 
accounting system of the service company and charged directly by the 
vendor or supplier to the associate company concerned. The service 
company shall keep records indicating the cost of goods, if any, which 
it procures for each associate company and the amount of service costs 
allocated thereto. These records should be maintained to meet the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's accounting requirements for 
electric and gas companies.


<R05>
Sec. 256.01-5  Determination of service cost accounting.

    Service at cost and fair allocation of costs require, first of all, 
an accurate accounting for the elements which make up the aggregate 
expense of conducting the business of the service company. In the 
accounts herein prescribed, the total amounts included in the expense 
accounts during any period plus such amount as appropriately may be 
added as compensation for the use of capital, if paid, constitute cost 
during such period.


<R05>
Sec. 256.01-6  Departmental classification required.

    The importance of ``salaries and wages'' as an element of cost 
requires analysis of this item of expense by departmental or other 
functional category in accordance with the departmental organization of 
the service company. To the extent practicable, such departmental 
organization should be established along lines which will provide a 
readily available basis for analysis.


<R05>
Sec. 256.01-7   Records.

    (a) The books of account and other records of the service company 
shall be so kept as to show fully the facts pertaining to all entries in 
these accounts. All such entries shall be supported by detailed 
information sufficient to permit ready identification and audit.
    (b) The books and records referred to herein shall include not only 
accounting records in a limited technical sense but all other records 
such as minute books, stock books, reports, working papers, memoranda, 
etc., which may be useful in developing the history of or facts 
regarding any transactions of the service company.
    (c) No company shall destroy any records except as authorized by the 
provisions of part 257 of this chapter.
    (d) The accounts may be further subdivided: Provided, Such 
subdivisions do not impair the integrity of the prescribed accounts. The 
titles of all subdivisions or subaccounts shall refer by

[[Page 514]]

number to the accounts of which they are subdivisions.
    (e) Clearing-accounts shall be kept when necessary or useful in 
making the proper distribution of items to the appropriate accounts 
prescribed herein or in accumulating general overhead cost such as rent, 
utility, employee benefits, and other general and support services that 
are to be allocated to work orders.
    (f) On or before the effective date of this Uniform System of 
Accounts, the several accounts prescribed herein shall be opened by 
transferring thereto the balances carried in the accounts previously 
maintained by the service company. The service company is authorized to 
make such subdivisions, reclassification, or consolidations of such 
balances as are necessary to meet the requirements of this Uniform 
System of Accounts.
    (g) Except where this Uniform System of Accounts accords specific 
treatment for specified accounts, all accounts and financial statements 
shall be maintained in accordance with Regulation S-X and Accounting 
Series Releases of this Commission. The Uniform System of Accounts 
promulgated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, as amended from 
time to time, and the interpretations thereof adopted from time to time 
by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and accounting regulations 
and orders of any other Federal or State Commission having jurisdiction 
over associate companies shall be complied with unless expressly 
inconsistent with the requirements of this system.

Sec. 256.01-9  Unbilled items.

    When the amount of any known item affecting these accounts cannot be 
accurately determined in time for inclusion in the accounts of the 
fiscal year in which the transaction occurs, the amount of the item 
shall be estimated and included in the proper accounts. When the amount

<R05>
Sec. 256.01-10  Billing procedures.

    All invoices for services rendered to associate companies shall be 
submitted monthly with sufficient information and in sufficient detail 
to permit the associate company to identify and classify the charge in 
terms of the system of accounts prescribed by the regulatory authorities

through the issuance of capital stock. Interest on borrowed capital and 
compensation for the use of capital shall only represent a reasonable 
return on the amount of capital reasonably necessary for the performance 
of services or construction work for, or the sale of goods to, associate 
companies. Such compensation may be estimated and shall be computed 
monthly in the manner prescribed by the Commission. The amount of

registered as a holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company 
Act of 1935, and to companies found by the Commission, pursuant to 
Sec. 250.88 to meet the requirements of section 13 of the Act as mutual 
or subsidiary service companies.
    (1) Company means a service company subject to Sec. 250.93, or a 
holding company subject to Sec. 250.26, which is not an electric utility 
company or a gas utility company, and any predecessor or inactive or 
dissolved associate company, the records of which are in the possession 
or control of such company.
    (2) Records include any records prepared, maintained or held by any 
agent or employee of a company, including any such records of a stock 
transfer agent, registrar, paying agent, indenture trustee or other 
person employed by a company to perform services with respect to the 
securities of the company, insofar as such person is accountable to the 
company or to its security holders for such records. The specification 
in the schedule of a record related to a type of transaction includes 
all documents and correspondence, not redundant or duplicative of other 
records retained, needed to explain or verify such transaction. 
Supporting documents such as checks or vouchers, which are separately 
scheduled may, nevertheless, be destroyed in accordance with the 
schedule for their respective class, when the company determines that 
the lapse of time has

[[Page 528]]

made it unlikely that it will need to prove the details evidenced 
thereby.
    (3) Any company subject to this regulation, which, as agent, 
operator, lessor or otherwise, maintains or has possession of any 
records relating to the operation, property or obligations of an 
electric or gas utility company or natural gas company or a nuclear 
licensee, as defined in the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act, the 
Atomic Energy Act or the laws of any state within which such utility 
company operates, shall comply with the laws or regulations as to record 
retention and destruction which would apply to such records if they were 
records of such utility company or licensee.
    (4) Except for the certifications, indices and cross references 
specified herein, the regulation shall not be construed as requiring the 
preparation or maintenance of records not required to be prepared or 
maintained by other rules or regulations of the Commission.
    (5) The regulation shall not excuse compliance with any other lawful 
requirement for the preservation of records for periods longer than 
those prescribed in the regulation.
    (6) Duplicate copies of records which contain no significant 
information not shown on the copy preserved may be destroyed at any 
time. If the same document would be required under more than one 
scheduled item, such as an indenture also included as an exhibit in a 
filing required to be retained, only one copy need be preserved if cross 
references are substituted for the additional copies.
    (7) Notwithstanding the provisions of the regulation, the Commission 
may, upon the request of any company, authorize the destruction of any 
specified records of such company and the Commission, on its own motion 
or on the motion of any regulatory agency, may direct that records which 
would be useful in developing facts relevant to any transaction recorded 
by the company be preserved for such period as the Commission may 
specify.
    (b) Designation of supervisory official. Each company subject to the 
regulation shall designate one or more officials to supervise the 
preservation or authorized destruction of its records. Insofar as its 
records include those in the possession of a transfer agent, indenture 
trustee or other independent custodian, the terms of the agreement with 
the custodian may include provisions, not inconsistent with this 
regulation, for the preservation and destruction of such records by the 
custodian and the responsibility of the company's designated official 
shall be to make reasonable inquiry as to the due performance of the 
custodian's obligation.
    (c) Protection and storage of records. The company shall provide 
reasonable protection from damage by fire, flood, and other hazards for 
records required by the regulation to be preserved and, in the selection 
of storage space, safeguard such records from unnecessary exposure to 
deterioration from excessive humidity, dryness, or lack of proper 
ventilation.
    (d) Index of records. At each office of the company where records 
are kept or stored, such records as are required by the regulation to be 
preserved shall be so arranged, filed, and currently indexed that such 
records shall be readily available for inspection by authorized 
representatives of regulatory agencies concerned.
    (e) Definition of record media. (1) The data constituting the 
records listed in the schedules may be retained in any of th media forms 
in Figure 1 of this section, if the media selected has a standard life 
expectancy equal to or in excess of the specified retention period. In 
cases where media regeneration to achieve full length of period 
retention becomes necessary, the company shall take such action as 
prudence calls for and notify the Commission immediately thereafter. The 
specifications in Figure 1 are generic. At the request of a company, the 
Commission may authorize alternative media reasonably equivalent to 
those specified.
    (2) If the media form of the record retained is other than a 
readable paper copy, then reader and/or printer equipment and related 
printout programs, if required, shall be provided by the company for 
data reference.
    (3) The media form initially selected for the record becomes the 
``original'' for that particular record. If subsequent conditions (e.g., 
improved media

[[Page 529]]

life expectancy, increased company resources, increased securities 
sales) require and the remaining retention period permits a change in 
the media forms, the company may convert to another media and dispose of 
its old equipment, provided the certification processes described in 
paragraph (f) of this section are observed and data referencing 
capability is maintained.

                                         11.5).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (f) Microform, tape and computer output certification--(1) As the 
initial recording media--
    (i) Each microform record series shall contain, at the beginning, a 
microform introduction stating the title of the record series, the date 
prepared, the name of the official responsible for validating or 
confirming the data contained therein. Each microform record series 
shall be closed with a clear and standard microform notation indicating 
the completion of the series and the date. If the microform record 
series is a product of Computer Output Microfilm (``COM''), the 
certification required of this section is not required if the series is 
prepared in accordance with written standard procedures developed by the 
company that ensure the integrity of record series which are the product 
of COM. Such procedures must include the name of the official 
responsible for validating or confirming the data contained in the 
record series and confirming that a particular COM record was produced 
in accordance with the standard procedures.
    (ii) If a record series is a computer output product (i.e., output 
paper or microfiche, or aperture cards), any certification that may 
otherwise be required under paragraph (f)(l)(i) of this section is not 
required if:
    (A) The series is prepared in accordance with written standard 
procedures developed, or accepted general business practices followed, 
by the company that ensure the integrity of record series that are the 
product of computer output; and
    (B) Such procedures include the name or title of the official 
responsible for validating or confirming the data contained in the 
record series and confirming that a particular computer output record 
series was produced in accordance with the standard procedures or 
practices.
    (iii) Each tape record series shall be externally labeled and there 
shall be prepared for that series an introduction stating the record 
series title, date prepared, the name of the official responsible for 
validating or confirming the data contained therein and an index where 
appropriate. Each record series shall be closed with a clear and 
standard notation indicating the completion of that series and the date.
    (2) Conversion from other media--(i) Each microform record series 
shall include, as an integral part, a certificate(s) stating that the 
microforms are direct and facsimile reproductions of the original 
records and that they have been made in accordance with prescribed 
instructions. Such certificate(s) shall be executed by a person(s) 
having personal knowledge of the facts covered thereby.
    (ii) Each microform record series shall commence and end with a 
statement as to the nature and arrangement of the records reproduced, 
and the date. Rolls of film shall not be cut except to produce jacketed 
microfiche. Supplemental or retaken film, whether of misplaced of 
omitted documents or of

[[Page 530]]

portions of microform found to be defective, shall be attached to the 
beginning of the microform record series. If supplemental or retaken 
film of misplaced or omitted documents, or of portions of microfilm 
found to be defective, are attached to the microfilm record series, the 
certificate described in paragraph (f)(l)(i) shall cover the 
supplemental or retaken film and shall state the reasons for the 
attachment.

When a retrieval system (e.g., image count indexing (``blipping'')) is 
used, the supplemental or retaken film may be attached at the end of the 
series, if the provisions at the beginning of the series advise the 
viewer of the location of the problem frames and the supplemental or 
retaken images.

    (iii) If, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (g) of this 
section, the company elects to convert records to the tape media, the 
same certification provisions specified in paragraph (f)(l)(iii) of this 
section must be provided in the conversion program.
    (g) Change of media for existing records. Those records prepared and 
maintained under previous regulations in a paper media and whose 
remaining retention period falls within the life expectancy range of any 
of the media detailed in Figure 1, may be converted to that media at the 
company's option, provided the applicable certification processes 
described in paragraph (f) of this section are observed and an audit 
referencing capability maintained.
    (h) Media. (1) All records created or maintained in a media shall--
    (i) Be prepared, arranged, classified, identified, and indexed as to 
permit the subsequent location, examination, and reproduction of the 
record to a readable media;
    (ii) Be stored in such a manner as to provide reasonable protection 
from hazards such as fire, flood, theft, etc., and be maintained in a 
controlled environment; and
    (iii) Be regenerated, including proper certification, when damaged.
    (2) The company shall be prepared to furnish, at its own expense, 
standard facilities for reading media and shall additionally provide, if 
the Commission so directs, copies of records in a readable form.
    (3) All film stock shall be of approved operationally-permanent-
record microcopying type, which meets the current specifications of the 
American National Standards Institute.
    (4) Punched cards, tape or similar media used as intermediate 
records or steps in data processing for assembling data to be posted to 
the records of the company or used in a report or study can be destroyed 
at the option of the company.
    (i) Destruction of records. The destruction of the records permitted 
to be destroyed under the provisions of the regulations in this part may 
be performed in any manner elected by the company. Precautions should be 
taken, however, to macerate or otherwise destroy the legibility of 
records, the content of which is forbidden by law to be divulged to 
unauthorized persons.
    (j) Premature destruction or loss of records. When records are 
destroyed or lost before the expiration of the prescribed period of 
retention, a statement listing, as far as may be determined, the records 
destroyed and describing the circumstances of accidental or other 
premature destruction or loss shall be filed with the Commission within 
ninety (90) days from the date of discovery of such destruction or loss.
    (k) Schedule of records and periods of retention. The schedules of 
records retention periods constitute a part of this regulation. The 
schedules prescribe the periods of time that designated records shall be 
preserved.
    (l) Retention periods designated ``Destroy at Option.'' Use of the 
retention period, ``Destroy at option,'' in the regulation constitutes 
authorization for such destruction under the conditions specified for 
the particular types of records only if such optional destruction is 
based on a reasonable judgment that the records are unlikely to be 
needed and if such optional destruction is not in conflict with other 
legal retention requirements. Optional destruction of records relevant 
to pending or expected regulatory or legal actions is not authorized. 
``Destroy at option after audit'' requires retention until the company 
has received an opinion of its independent accountants

[[Page 531]]

with respect to the financial statements including the transactions to 
which such records relate.
    (m) Use of technical accounting terms. For purposes of the 
schedules, traditional accounting terms such as ledgers, journals, 
registers and vouchers refer to the function rather than the form of the 
record. All refer to quasi-permanent records, designed to collect, 
classify and in some aspects summarize, various types of the company's 
transactions. They are interrelated and, in another traditional term, 
are the principal constituents of the books of account, including 
subsidiary ledgers and registers. The retention periods apply to records 
serving this function, regardless of form. A multiple purpose record, 
such as a service company stock stub which also serves as the 
shareholder's ledger, or a voucher file which also serves as the 
journal, referred to more than once in the schedule, is governed by the 
longest retention period applying to any of its functions. For brevity, 
the term ``note'' is used in the schedule to refer to an evidence of 
debt maturing within one year of its creation, which was not the subject 
of an offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The term 
``debenture'' refers to a document evidencing any other unsecured debt. 
The term ``mortgage'' refers to any form of secured obligation, ``bond'' 
refers to a document evidencing a secured debt in whole or part, and 
``mortgagee'' refers to the holder of a mortgage or bond and includes 
any person, such as an indenture trustee, authorized to act for a 
mortgagee.

of the aggregate votes which the holders of all the outstanding voting 
securities of such person are entitled to cast in the direction or 
management of the affairs of such person.
    (b) A specified percentage of a class of securities of a person 
means such percentage of the aggregate amount of securities of the class 
outstanding.
    (c) The term amount, when used in regard to securities, means the 
principal amount if relating to evidences of indebtedness, the number of 
shares if relating to capital shares, and the number of units if 
relating to any other kind of security.
    (d) The term outstanding means issued and not held by or for the 
account of the issuer. The following securities shall not be deemed 
outstanding within the meaning of this definition:
    (1) Securities of an issuer held in a sinking fund relating to 
securities of the issuer of the same class;
    (2) Securities of an issuer held in a sinking fund relating to 
another class of securities of the issuer, if the obligation evidenced 
by such other class of securities is not in default as to principal or

substantially the same rights and privileges: Provided, however, That, 
in the case of secured evidences of indebtedness, all of which are 
issued under a single indenture, differences in the interest rates or 
maturity dates of various series thereof shall not be deemed sufficient 
to constitute such series different classes: And, provided further, 
That, in the case of unsecured evidences of indebtedness, differences in 
the interest rates or maturity dates thereof shall not be deemed 
sufficient to constitute them securities of different classes, whether 
or not they are issued under a single indenture.

Sec. 269.2   Form T-2, for statement of eligibility and qualification for individual trustees.

    This form shall be filed pursuant to Rule 5a-1(b) (Sec. 260.5a-1(b) 
of this chapter) for statements of eligibility and qualification of 
individuals designated to act as trustees under trust indentures to be 
qualified pursuant to section 305 or 307 of the Trust Indenture Act of 
1939. Under sections 307, 308, 309, 310 and 319 of the Trust Indenture 
Act of 1939 (17 CFR part 260), the Commission is authorized to solicit 
the information required to be supplied by this form for statements of 
eligibility and qualification of individuals designated to act as 
trustees. Disclosure of the information specified in this form is 
mandatory prior to processing statements of eligibility and 
qualification, except for social security account numbers, disclosure of 
which is voluntary. The information will be used for the primary purpose 
of determining relationships of trustees and whether there are any 
conflicting interests. This statement will be made a matter of public 
record. Therefore, any information given will be available for 
inspection by any member of the public. Because of the public nature of 
the information, the Commission can utilize it for a variety of 
purposes, including referral to other governmental authorities or 
securities self-regulatory organizations for investigatory purposes or 
in connection with litigation involving the Federal securities laws or 
other civil, criminal or regulatory statutes or provisions. Social 
security account numbers, if furnished, will assist the Commission in 
identifying persons desiring to qualify as trustees and, therefore, in 
promptly processing filings. Failure to disclose the information 
requested by this form, except for social security account numbers, may 
result in enforcement action by the Commission to compel compliance with 
the Federal securities laws.

Sec. 270.0-4   Incorporation by reference.

    (a) A registered investment company may, subject to the limitations 
of Sec. 228.10(f) and Sec. 229.10(d) of this chapter, incorporate by 
reference as an exhibit, in any registration statement, application or 
report filed with the Commission, any document or part thereof 
previously or concurrently filed with the Commission pursuant to any act 
administered by the Commission. The incorporation may be made whether 
the matter incorporated was filed by such registered company or any 
other person. If any modification has occurred in the text of any such 
document since the filing thereof, the company shall file with the 
reference a statement containing the text of any such modification and 
the date thereof. If the number of copies of any document previously or 
concurrently filed with the Commission is less than the number required 
to be filed with the registration statement, application or report which 
incorporates such document, the company shall file therewith as many 
additional copies of the document as may be necessary to meet the 
requirements of the registration statement, application or report.
    (b) A registered investment company may, subject to the limitations 
of Sec. 201.24 of this chapter, incorporate by reference, in any 
registration statement, application or report filed with the Commission 
any financial statement or part thereof previously or concurrently filed 
with the Commission

[[Page 567]]

pursuant to any act administered by the Commission, if it substantially 
conforms to the requirements of the form on which such registration 
statement, application or report is filed. The incorporation may be made 
whether the matter incorporated was filed by such registered company or 
any other person. If a certificate of an independent public accountant 
or accountants is required to accompany a financial statement in any 
registration statement, application or report, the incorporation by 
reference of a certificate previously or concurrently filed will not be 
deemed a compliance with such requirements unless the written consent of 
the accountant or accountants to such incorporation is filed with the 
registration statement, application or report.
    (c) In each case of incorporation by reference, the matter 
incorporated shall be clearly identified in the reference. An express 
statement shall be made to the effect that the specified matter is 
incorporated in the registration statement, application or report at the 
particular place where the information is required.
    (d) Notwithstanding any particular provision permitting 
incorporation by reference, no registration statement, application or 
report shall incorporate by reference any exhibit or financial statement 
which:
    (1) Has been withdrawn, or
    (2) Was filed in connection with a registration statement under the 
Act, or a registration on a national securities exchange, which has 
ceased to be effective, or
    (3) Is contained in a registration statement or report subject, at 
the time of the incorporation by reference, to pending proceedings under 
section 8(b) or 8(d) of the Securities Act of 1933, section 8(e) of the 
Act, or to an order entered under any of those Sections, or
    (4) If it is a document that has been filed in paper with respect to 
an electronic filer under a temporary hardship exemption (Sec. 232.201 
of this chapter) and an electronic format copy has not been submitted.
    (e) Notwithstanding any particular provision permitting 
incorporation by reference, the Commission may refuse to permit such 
incorporation in any case in which in its judgment such incorporation 
would render the registration statement application, or report 
incomplete, unclear, or confusing.

Sec. 270.2a-1   Valuation of portfolio securities in special cases.

    (a) Any investment company whose securities are qualified for sale, 
or for whose securities application for such qualification has been 
made, in any State in which the securities owned by such company are 
required by applicable State law or regulations to be valued at cost or 
on some other basis different from that prescribed by clause (A) of 
section 2(a)(41) of the Act for the purpose of determining the 
percentage of its assets invested in any particular type or 
classification of securities or in the securities of any one issuer, 
may, in valuing its securities for the purposes of sections 5 and 12 of 
the Act, use the same basis of valuation as that used in complying with 
such State law or regulations in lieu of the method of valuation 
prescribed by clause (A) of section 2(a)(41) of the Act.
    (b) Any open-end company which has heretofore valued its securities 
at cost for the purpose of qualifying as a ``mutual investment company'' 
under the Internal Revenue Code, prior to its amendment by the Revenue 
Act of 1942, shall henceforth, for the purposes of sections 5 and 12 of 
the Act, value its securities in accordance with the method prescribed 
in clause (A) of section 2(a)(41) of the Act unless such company is 
permitted under paragraph (a) of this section to use a different method 
of valuation.
    (c) A registered investment company which has adopted for the 
purposes of sections 5 and 12 of the Act a method of valuation permitted 
by paragraph (a) of this section, shall state in its registration 
statement filed pursuant to section 8 (54 Stat. 803; 15 U.S.C. 80a-8) of 
the Act, or in a report filed pursuant to section 30 (54 Stat. 836; 15 
U.S.C. 80a-30) of the Act, the method of valuation adopted and the facts 
which justify the adoption of such method. A registered investment 
company which has adopted for the purposes of sections 5 and 12 of the 
Act a method of valuation permitted by paragraph (a) of this section, 
unless it shall have adopted such method for the purpose or partly for 
the purpose of qualifying as a ``mutual investment company'' under the 
Internal Revenue Code, shall continue to use that method until it has 
notified the Commission of its desire to use a different method, and has 
received from the Commission permission for such change. Such permission 
may be made effective on a fixed date or within such reasonable time 
thereafter as may be deemed advisable under the circumstances.
    (d) If at any time it appears that the method of valuation adopted 
by any company pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is no longer 
justified by the facts, the Commission may require a change in the 
method of valuation within a reasonable period of time either to the 
method prescribed in clause (A) of section 2(a)(41) of the Act or to 
some other method permitted by paragraph (a) of this section which is 
justified by the existing facts.

    During any fiscal quarter in which elimination of securities from

sections 5 and 12 of the Act (54 Stat. 800, 808; 15 U.S.C. 80a-5, 80a-

    (a) Specific certificate,
    (b) First in--first out,
    (c) Last in--first out, or
    (d) Average value.

For these purposes, a single method of elimination shall be used

                   Preliminary Note to Sec. 270.2a3-1

    This Sec. 270.2a3-1 excepts from the definition of affiliated person 
in section 2(a)(3)) (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(3)) those limited partners of 
investment companies organized in limited partnership form that are 
affiliated persons solely because they are partners under section 
2(a)(3)(D) (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(3)(D)). Reliance on this Sec. 270.2a3-1 
does not except a limited partner that is an affiliated person by virtue 
of any other provision.
    No limited partner of a registered management company or a business 
development company, organized as a limited partnership and relying on 
Sec. 270.2a19-2, shall be deemed to be an affiliated person of such 
company, or any other partner of such company, solely by reason of being 
a limited partner of such company.

Sec. 270.2a-4  Definition of ``current net asset value'' for use in computing periodically the current price of redeemable security.

    (a) The current net asset value of any redeemable security issued by 
a registered investment company used in computing periodically the 
current price for the purpose of distribution, redemption, and 
repurchase means an amount which reflects calculations, whether or not 
recorded in the books of account, made substantially in accordance with 
the following, with estimates used where necessary or appropriate.
    (1) Portfolio securities with respect to which market quotations are 
readily available shall be valued at current market value, and other 
securities and assets shall be valued at fair value as determined in 
good faith by the board of directors of the registered company.
    (2) Changes in holdings of portfolio securities shall be reflected 
no later than in the first calculation on the first business day 
following the trade date.
    (3) Changes in the number of outstanding shares of the registered 
company resulting from distributions, redemptions, and repurchases shall 
be reflected no later than in the first calculation on the first 
business day following such change.
    (4) Expenses, including any investment advisory fees, shall be 
included to date of calculation. Appropriate provision shall be made for 
Federal income taxes if required. Investment companies which retain 
realized capital gains designated as a distribution to shareholders 
shall comply with paragraph (h) of Sec. 210.6-03 of Regulation S-X.
    (5) Dividends receivable shall be included to date of calculation 
either at ex-dividend dates or record dates, as appropriate.
    (6) Interest income and other income shall be included to date of 
calculation.
    (b) The items which would otherwise be required to be reflected by 
paragraphs (a) (4) and (6) of this section need not be so reflected if 
cumulatively, when netted, they do not amount to as much as one cent per 
outstanding share.
    (c) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
section, any interim determination of current net asset value between 
calculations made as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the 
preceding business day and the current business day may be estimated so 
as to reflect any change in current net asset value since

[[Page 570]]

the closing calculation on the preceding business day.

hereinafter defined), substantially all of the assets of which consist 
of Qualifying Assets (as hereinafter defined). Special Purpose Entity

agreement remains, at least equal to the Resale Price (as defined 
hereinafter) provided in the agreement; and

and sell the collateral in the event of a default by the seller; and
    (iv) The collateral consists entirely of securities that are direct 
obligations of, or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and 
interest by, the United States or any agency thereof, and/or 
certificates of deposit, bankers' acceptances which are eligible for 
acceptance by a Federal Reserve Bank, and, if the seller is a depositary 
institution as defined in 12 U.S.C. 1813(c), mortgage related securities 
(as such term is defined in section 3(a)(41) of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(41)]) that, at the time the repurchase 
agreement is entered into, are rated in the highest rating category by

of more than 397 calendar days but that has a remaining maturity of 397 
or less and that is an Unrated Security is not an Eligible Security if

security and an escrow agent that is not an affiliated person, as 
defined in section 2(a)(3)(C) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(3)(C)], of 
the issuer of the debt security, and, in accordance with such escrow 
agreement, are pledged only to the payment of the debt security and, to 
the extent that excess proceeds are available after all payments of 
principal, interest, and applicable premiums on the Refunded Securities, 
the expenses of the escrow agent and, thereafter, to the issuer or 
another party; provided that:
    (i) The deposited securities shall not be redeemable prior to their 
final maturity;
    (ii) At the time the deposited securities are placed in the escrow 
account, an independent certified public accountant shall have certified 
to the escrow agent that the deposited securities will satisfy all 
scheduled payments of principal, interest and applicable premiums on the 
Refunded Securities; and
    (iii) The escrow agreement shall prohibit the substitution of the 
deposited securities unless the substituted securities are Government 
Securities and, at the time of such substitution, the escrow agent shall 
have received a certification from an independent certified public 
accountant substantially the same as that required by paragraph 
(a)(18)(ii) of this section which certification shall give effect to the 
substitution.
    (19) Requisite NRSROs shall mean:
    (i) Any two NRSROs that have issued a rating with respect to a 
security or class of debt obligations of an issuer; or
    (ii) If only one NRSRO has issued a rating with respect to such 
security or class of debt obligations of an issuer at the time the fund 
purchases or rolls over the security, that NRSRO.
    (20) Second Tier Security shall mean any Eligible Security that is 
not a First Tier Security. Second Tier Conduit Security shall mean any 
Conduit Security that is an Eligible Security that is not a First Tier 
Security.

itself out as primarily distributing income exempt from the income taxes 
of a specified state or locality.
    (22) Standby Commitment shall mean a Put that entitles the holder to 
achieve same day settlement.
    (23) Tax Exempt Fund shall mean any money market fund that holds 
itself out as distributing income exempt from regular federal income

    (24) Total Assets shall mean, with respect to a money market fund 
using the Amortized Cost Method, the total amortized cost of its assets 
and, with respect to any other money market fund, the total market-based 
value of its assets.
    (25) Unconditional Demand Feature shall mean an Unconditional Put 
that is also a Demand Feature.
    (26) Unconditional Demand Feature Issued By A Non-Controlled Person 
shall mean an Unconditional Put that is also a Demand Feature Issued By 
A Non-Controlled Person.
    (27) Unconditional Put shall mean a Put (including any guarantee, 
financial guarantee (bond) insurance, letter of credit or similar 
unconditional credit enhancement) that by its terms would be readily 
exercisable in the event of a default in payment of principal or 
interest on the underlying security or securities.
    (28) United States Dollar-Denominated shall mean, with reference to 
a security, that all principal and interest payments on such security 
are payable to security holders in United States dollars under all 
circumstances and that the interest rate of, the principal amount to be 
repaid, and the timing of payments related to such security do not vary 
or float with the value of a foreign currency, the rate of interest 
payable on foreign currency borrowings, or with any other interest rate 
or index expressed in a currency other than United States dollars.

[[Page 574]]

    (29) Unrated Security shall mean:
    (i) A security with a remaining maturity of 397 calendar days or 
less issued by an issuer that did not, at the time the security was 
acquired or rolled over by the fund, have a current short-term rating 
assigned by any NRSRO:
    (A) To the security; or
    (B) To the issuer of the security with respect to a class of debt 
obligations

(or any debt obligation within that class) that is comparable in 
priority and security with the security, or a Demand Feature with 
respect to the security; and
    (ii) A security:
    (A) That at the time of issuance had a remaining maturity of more 
than 397 calendar days but that has a remaining maturity of 397 calendar 
days or less; and
    (B) Whose issuer had not at the time it was acquired or rolled over 
by the fund received from any NRSRO a short-term rating with respect to 
a class of debt obligations (or any debt obligation within that class) 
that now is comparable in priority and security with the security; and
    (iii) A security that is a rated security and is the subject of an 
external credit support agreement (including an arrangement by which the 
security has become a Refunded Security) that was not in effect when the 
security (or the issuer) was assigned its rating unless the security has 
a rating from an NRSRO reflecting the existence of the credit support 
agreement.
    (iv) A security is not an Unrated Security if any debt obligation 
(reference security) that is issued by the same issuer and is comparable 
in priority and security with that security has a short-term rating by 
an NRSRO. The status of such security as an Eligible Security or First 
Tier Security shall be the same as that of the reference security.
    (30) Variable Rate Security shall mean a security the terms of which 
provide for the adjustment of its interest rate on set dates (such as 
the last day of a month or calendar quarter) and which, upon each 
adjustment until the final maturity of the instrument or the period 
remaining until the principal amount can be recovered through demand, 
can reasonably be expected to have a market value that approximates its 
amortized cost.
    (b) Holding Out. It shall be an untrue statement of material fact 
within the meaning of section 34(b) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-33(b)] for 
a registered investment company, in any registration statement, 
application, report, account, record, or other document filed or 
transmitted pursuant to the Act, including any advertisement, pamphlet, 
circular, form letter, or other sales literature addressed to or 
intended for distribution to prospective investors that is required to 
be filed with the Commission by section 24(b) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-
24(b)] to:
    (1) Adopt the term ``money market'' as part of its name or title or 
the name or title of any redeemable securities of which it is the 
issuer; or
    (2) Hold itself out to investors as, or adopt a name which suggests 
that it is, a money market fund or the equivalent of a money market 
fund, unless such registered investment company meets the conditions of 
paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section. For purposes of 
this paragraph, a name which suggests that a registered investment 
company is a money market fund or the equivalent thereof shall include 
one which uses such terms as ``cash,'' ``liquid,'' ``money,'' ``ready 
assets'' or similar terms.
    (c) Share Price Calculations. The current price per share, for 
purposes of distribution, redemption and repurchase, of any redeemable 
security issued by any registered investment company (``money market 
fund''), notwithstanding the requirements of section 2(a)(41) of the Act 
[15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(41)] and of Secs. 270.2a-4 and 270.22c-1 thereunder, 
may be computed by use of the Amortized Cost Method or the Penny-
Rounding Method; Provided, however, That:
    (1) Board Findings. The board of directors of the money market fund 
shall determine, in good faith, that it is in the best interests of the 
fund and its shareholders to maintain a stable net asset value per share 
or stable price per share, by virtue of either the Amortized Cost Method 
or the Penny-Rounding Method, and that the money market fund will 
continue to use such

[[Page 575]]

method only so long as the board of directors believes that it fairly 
reflects the market-based net asset value per share.
    (2) Portfolio Maturity. The money market fund shall maintain a 
dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity appropriate to its objective 
of maintaining a stable net asset value per share or price per share; 
Provided, however, That the money market fund will not:
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, 
purchase any instrument with a remaining maturity of greater than 397 
calendar days; or
    (ii) In the case of a money market fund not using the Amortized Cost 
Method, purchase a Government Security with a remaining maturity of 
greater than 762 calendar days; or
    (iii) Maintain a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity that 
exceeds ninety days.
    (3) Portfolio Quality--(i) General. The money market fund shall 
limit its portfolio investments, including Puts and repurchase 
agreements, to those United States Dollar-Denominated securities that 
the fund's board of directors determines present minimal credit risks 
(which determination must be based on factors pertaining to credit 
quality in addition to any rating assigned to such securities by an 
NRSRO) and which are at the time of acquisition Eligible Securities.
    (ii) Securities Subject to Unconditional Demand Features. A security 
that is subject to an Unconditional Demand Feature may be determined to 
be an Eligible Security or a First Tier Security based solely on whether 
the Unconditional Demand Feature is an Eligible Security or First Tier 
Security, as the case may be.
    (iii) Securities Subject to Conditional Demand Features. A security 
that is subject to a Conditional Demand Feature (``Underlying 
Security'') may be determined to be an Eligible Security or a First Tier 
Security only if:
    (A) The Conditional Demand Feature is an Eligible Security or First 
Tier Security, as the case may be; and
    (B) At the time of the purchase of the Underlying Security, the 
money market fund's board of directors has determined that there is 
minimal risk that the circumstances that would result in the Conditional 
Demand Feature not being exercisable will occur; and
    (1) The conditions limiting exercise either can be monitored readily 
by the fund, or relate to the taxability, under federal, state or local 
law, of the interest payments on the security; or
    (2) The terms of the Conditional Demand Feature require that the 
fund will receive notice of the occurrence of the condition and the 
opportunity to exercise the Demand Feature in accordance with its terms; 
and
    (C)(1) If the Underlying Security has a remaining maturity of 397 
days or less, the Underlying Security (or the debt securities of issuer 
of the Underlying Security) has received a short-term rating by the 
Requisite NRSROs within the NRSROs' two highest short-term ratings 
categories (within which there may be sub-categories or gradations 
indicating relative standing) or, if unrated, is determined to be of 
comparable quality by the money market fund's board of directors; or
    (2) If the Underlying Security has a remaining maturity of more than 
397 calendar days, the Underlying Security (or the debt securities of 
the issuer of the Underlying Security) has received a long-term rating 
by the Requisite NRSROs within the NRSROs' two highest long-term rating 
categories (within which there may be sub-categories or gradations 
indicating relative standing) or, if unrated, is determined to be of 
comparable quality by the money market fund's board of directors.
    (4) Portfolio Diversification--(i) Taxable and National Funds. 
Immediately after the acquisition of any security (other than a 
Government Security or a security subject to an Unconditional Demand 
Feature Issued By a Non-Controlled Person), a money market fund other 
than a Single State Fund shall not have invested more than five percent 
of its Total Assets in securities issued by the issuer of the security.
    (ii) Single State Funds. With respect to 75 percent of its Total 
Assets, immediately after the acquisition of any security (other than a 
Government Security or a security subject to an Unconditional Demand 
Feature Issued By a Non-Controlled Person), a Single State Fund shall 
not have invested more

[[Page 576]]

than five percent of its Total Assets in securities issued by the issuer 
of the security; Provided, however, That a Single State Fund shall not 
invest more than five percent of its Total Assets in securities issued 
by the issuer of the security unless the securities are First Tier 
Securities.
    (iii) Safe Harbor. Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this 
section, a money market fund other than a Single State Fund may invest 
up to twenty-five percent of its Total Assets in the First Tier 
Securities of a single issuer for a period of up to three Business days 
after the purchase thereof.
    (iv) Second Tier Securities--(A) Taxable Funds. Immediately after 
the acquisition of any Second Tier Security, a money market fund that is 
not a Tax Exempt Fund shall not have invested more than:
    (1) The greater of one percent of its Total Assets or one million 
dollars in securities issued by that issuer which, when acquired by the 
money market fund (either initially or upon any subsequent roll over) 
were Second Tier Securities; and
    (2) Five percent of its Total Assets in securities which, when 
acquired by the money market fund (either initially or upon any 
subsequent roll over) were Second Tier Securities.
    (B) Tax Exempt Funds. Immediately after the acquisition of any 
Second Tier Conduit Security that is not subject to an Unconditional 
Demand Feature Issued By a Non-Controlled Person, a money market fund 
that is a Tax Exempt Fund shall not have invested more than:
    (1) The greater of one percent of its Total Assets or one million 
dollars in securities issued by that issuer which, when acquired by the 
money market fund (either initially or upon any subsequent roll over) 
were Second Tier Conduit Securities not subject to an Unconditional 
Demand Feature Issued By a Non-Controlled Person; and
    (2) Five percent of its Total Assets in Conduit Securities which, 
when acquired by the money market fund (either initially or upon any 
subsequent roll over) were Second Tier Conduit Securities not subject to 
an Unconditional Demand Feature Issued By a Non-Controlled Person.
    (v) Puts--(A) General. Immediately after the acquisition of any Put 
or security subject to a Put, with respect to seventy-five percent of 
the assets of a money market fund, no more than ten percent of the 
fund's Total Assets may be invested in securities issued by or subject 
to Puts from the institution that issued the Put, subject to sections 
(c)(4)(v)(B) and (C) of this section.
    (B) Second Tier Puts. Immediately after the acquisition of any Put 
(or a security after giving effect to the Put) that is a Second Tier 
Security, a money market fund shall not have invested more than five 
percent of its Total Assets in securities issued by or subject to Puts 
from the institution that issued the Put.
    (C) Puts Issued by Non-Controlled Persons. Immediately after the 
acquisition of any security subject to a Put, a money market fund shall 
not have invested more than ten percent of its Total Assets in 
securities issued by, or subject to Puts from the institution that 
issued the Put, unless, with respect to any security subject to Puts 
from that institution, the Put is a Put Issued By a Non-Controlled 
Person.
    (vi) Diversification Calculations--(A) General. For purposes of 
making calculations under paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (iv) of this 
section:
    (1) Repurchase Agreements. The acquisition of a repurchase agreement 
may be deemed to be an acquisition of the underlying securities, 
provided that the obligation of the seller to repurchase the securities 
from the money market fund is Collateralized Fully.
    (2) Refunded Securities. The acquisition of a Refunded Security 
shall be deemed to be an acquisition of a Government Security.
    (3) Conduit Securities. A Conduit Security shall be deemed to be 
issued by the issuer (other than the Municipal Issuer) ultimately 
responsible for payments of interest and principal on the security.
    (4) Asset Backed Securities. An Asset Backed Security shall be 
deemed to be issued by the Special Purpose Entity that issued the Asset 
Backed Security, Provided, however, any person whose obligations 
constitute ten percent or more of the principal amount of the Qualifying 
Assets shall be deemed to be

[[Page 577]]

an issuer of the portion of the Asset Backed Security such obligations 
represent. For purposes of the foregoing, if the Qualifying Assets held 
by the Special Purpose Entity are themselves Asset Backed Securities 
(``Secondary Asset Backed Securities''), then the Special Purpose Entity 
shall be treated as holding directly the Secondary Asset Backed 
Securities.
    (5) Shares in Master Funds. A money market fund substantially all of 
the assets of which consist of shares of another money market fund 
acquired in reliance on section 12(d)(1)(E) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-
12(d)(1)(E)] shall be deemed to be in compliance with this section if 
the board of directors reasonably believes that the money market fund in 
which it has invested is in compliance with this section.
    (B) Put Diversification Calculations. In making calculations under 
the Put diversification requirements of paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this 
section, the following rules apply:
    (1) Issuer-Provided Puts. In the case of a security subject to a Put 
from the same institution that issued the underlying security, the value 
of the securities subject to the Put may be excluded from the Put 
diversification requirements of paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section.
    (2) Fractional Puts. In the case of a security subject to a Put from 
an institution by which the institution guarantees a specified portion 
of the value of the security, the institution shall be deemed to 
guarantee the specified portion thereof, Provided, however, if the 
security is an Asset Backed Security and the Put is a guarantee of all 
or a portion of the first losses with respect to the security, the 
institution providing the Put shall be deemed to have guaranteed the 
entire principal amount of the security.
    (3) Layered Puts. In the case of a security subject to Puts from 
multiple institutions that have not limited the extent of their 
obligations as described in paragraph (c)(4)(vi)(B)(2) of this section, 
each institution shall be deemed to have guaranteed the entire principal 
amount of the security, Provided, however, in the case of a security 
subject to an Unconditional Demand Feature and a Put (or Puts) that is 
not a Demand Feature, the Put diversification requirements of paragraph 
(c)(4)(v) of this section need only be satisfied as to the institution 
issuing the Unconditional Demand Feature.
    (4) Puts Not Relied Upon. If the fund's board of directors 
determines that the fund is not relying on a Put to determine the 
quality (pursuant to paragraphs (c)(3)(ii) or (c)(3)(iii) of this 
section), or maturity (pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section), or 
liquidity of the portfolio security and maintains a record of this 
determination (pursuant to paragraphs (c)(8)(ii) and (c)(9)(vi) of this 
section), the Put diversification requirements of paragraph (c)(4)(v) of 
this section need not be satisfied as with respect to such put.
    (vii) Diversification Safe Harbor. A money market fund that 
satisfies the applicable diversification requirements of paragraph 
(c)(4) of this section shall be deemed to have satisfied the 
diversification requirements of section 5(b)(1) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 
80a-5(b)(1)] and the rules adopted thereunder.
    (5) Downgrades, Defaults and Other Events--(i) Downgrades--(A) 
General. Upon the occurrence of either of the events specified in 
paragraphs (c)(5)(i)(A)(1) and (2) of this section with respect to a 
portfolio security, the board of directors of the money market fund 
shall reassess promptly whether such security continues to present 
minimal credit risks and shall cause the fund to take such action as the 
board of directors determines is in the best interests of the money 
market fund and its shareholders:
    (1) A portfolio security of a money market fund ceases to be a First 
Tier Security (either because it no longer has the highest rating from 
the Requisite NRSROs or, in the case of an Unrated Security, the board 
of directors of the money market fund determines that it is no longer of 
comparable quality to a First Tier Security); and
    (2) The money market fund's investment adviser (or any person to 
whom the fund's board of directors has delegated portfolio management 
responsibilities) becomes aware that any Unrated Security or Second Tier 
Security held by the money market fund has, since the security was 
acquired by

[[Page 578]]

the fund, been given a rating by any NRSRO below the NRSRO's second 
highest rating category.
    (B) Securities To Be Disposed Of. The reassessments required by 
paragraph (c)(5)(i)(A) of this section shall not be required if, in 
accordance with the procedures adopted by the board of directors, the 
security is disposed of (or matures) within five Business days of the 
specified event and, in the case of events specified in paragraph 
(c)(5)(i)(A)(2) of this section, the board is subsequently notified of 
the adviser's actions.
    (C) Special Rule for Certain Securities Subject to Demand Features. 
In the event that after giving effect to a rating downgrade, more than 
five percent of the fund's Total Assets are invested in securities 
issued by or subject to Demand Features from a single institution that 
are Second Tier Securities, the board of directors (or its delegate) 
shall cause the fund to reduce its investment in securities issued by or 
subject to Demand Features from that institution to no more than five 
percent of its Total Assets by exercising the Demand Features at the 
next succeeding exercise date(s), absent a finding by the board of 
directors that disposal of the portfolio security would not be in the 
best interests of the money market fund.
    (ii) Defaults and Other Events. Upon the occurrence of any of the 
events specified in paragraphs (c)(5)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section 
with respect to a portfolio security, the money market fund shall 
dispose of such security as soon as practicable consistent with 
achieving an orderly disposition of the security, by sale, exercise of 
any Demand Feature or otherwise, absent a finding by the board of 
directors that disposal of the portfolio security would not be in the 
best interests of the money market fund (which determination may take 
into account, among other factors, market conditions that could affect 
the orderly disposition of the portfolio security):
    (A) The default with respect to a portfolio security (other than an 
immaterial default unrelated to the financial condition of the issuer);
    (B) A portfolio security ceases to be an Eligible Security;
    (C) A portfolio security has been determined to no longer present 
minimal credit risks; or
    (D) An Event of Insolvency occurs with respect to the issuer of or 
the provider of any Put with respect to a portfolio security other than 
a Put with respect to which a non-reliance determination has been made 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(vi)(B)(4) of this section.
    (iii) Notice to the Commission. In the event of a default with 
respect to one or more portfolio securities (other than an immaterial 
default unrelated to the financial condition of the issuer) or an Event 
of Insolvency with respect to the issuer of the security or any Put to 
which it is subject, where immediately before default the securities (or 
the securities subject to the Put) accounted for \1/2\ of 1 percent or 
more of a money market fund's Total Assets, the money market fund shall 
promptly notify the Commission of such fact and the actions the money 
market fund intends to take in response to such situation. Notification 
under this paragraph shall be made telephonically or by means of a 
facsimile transmission, followed by letter sent by first class mail, 
directed to the attention of the Director of the Division of Investment 
Management.
    (iv) Defaults for Purposes of Paragraphs (c)(5)(ii) and (iii). For 
purposes of paragraphs (c)(5)(ii) and (iii) of this section, an 
instrument subject to a Demand Feature or unconditional credit 
enhancement shall not be deemed to be in default (and an Event of 
Insolvency with respect to the security shall not be deemed to have 
occurred) if:
    (A) In the case of an instrument subject to a Demand Feature, the 
Demand Feature has been exercised and the fund has recovered either the 
principal amount or the amortized cost of the instrument, plus accrued 
interest; or
    (B) The provider of the credit enhancement is continuing, without 
protest, to make payments as due on the instrument.
    (6) Required Procedures: Amortized Cost Method. In the case of a 
money market fund using the Amortized Cost Method:
    (i) General. In supervising the money market fund's operations and 
delegating special responsibilities involving portfolio management to 
the money

[[Page 579]]

market fund's investment adviser, the money market fund's board of 
directors, as a particular responsibility within the overall duty of 
care owed to its shareholders, shall establish written procedures 
reasonably designed, taking into account current market conditions and 
the money market fund's investment objectives, to stabilize the money 
market fund's net asset value per share, as computed for the purpose of 
distribution, redemption and repurchase, at a single value.
    (ii) Specific Procedures. Included within the procedures adopted by 
the board of directors shall be the following:
    (A) Shadow Pricing. Written procedures shall provide:
    (1) That the extent of deviation, if any, of the current net asset 
value per share calculated using available market quotations (or an 
appropriate substitute which reflects current market conditions) from 
the money market fund's amortized cost price per share, shall be 
calculated at such intervals as the board of directors determines 
appropriate and reasonable in light of current market conditions;
    (2) For the periodic review by the board of directors of the amount 
of the deviation as well as the methods used to calculate the deviation; 
and
    (3) For the maintenance of records of the determination of deviation 
and the board's review thereof.
    (B) Prompt Consideration of Deviation. In the event such deviation 
from the money market fund's amortized cost price per share exceeds \1/
2\ of 1 percent, the board of directors shall promptly consider what 
action, if any, should be initiated by the board of directors.
    (C) Material Dilution or Unfair Results. Where the board of 
directors believes the extent of any deviation from the money market 
fund's amortized cost price per share may result in material dilution or 
other unfair results to investors or existing shareholders, it shall 
cause the fund to take such action as it deems appropriate to eliminate 
or reduce to the extent reasonably practicable such dilution or unfair 
results.
    (7) Required Procedures: Penny-Rounding Method. In the case of a 
money market fund using the Penny-Rounding Method, in supervising the 
money market fund's operations and delegating special responsibilities 
involving portfolio management to the money market fund's investment 
adviser, the money market fund's board of directors undertakes, as a 
particular responsibility within the overall duty of care owed to its 
shareholders, to assure to the extent reasonably practicable, taking 
into account current market conditions affecting the money market fund's 
investment objectives, that the money market fund's price per share as 
computed for the purpose of distribution, redemption and repurchase, 
rounded to the nearest one percent, will not deviate from the single 
price established by the board of directors.
    (8) Specific Procedures: Amortized Cost and Penny-Rounding Methods. 
Included within the procedures adopted by the board of directors for 
money market funds using either the amortized cost or penny-rounding 
methods shall be the following:
    (i) Securities for Which Maturity is Determined by Reference to 
Demand Features. In the case of a security for which maturity is 
determined by reference to a Demand Feature, written procedures shall 
require ongoing review of the security's continued minimal credit risks, 
which review must be based on, among other things, financial data for 
the most recent fiscal year of the issuer of the Demand Feature and, in 
the case of a security subject to a Conditional Demand Feature, the 
issuer of the security, whether such data is publicly available or 
provided under the terms of the security's governing documentation.
    (ii) Securities Subject to Puts. In the case of a security subject 
to one or more Puts, written procedures shall require periodic 
evaluation of the determination described in paragraph 
(c)(4)(vi)(B)(4)(puts not relied upon) of this section.
    (iii) Adjustable Rate Securities Without Demand Features. In the 
case of a Variable Rate or Floating Rate Security that does not have a 
Demand Feature and for which maturity is determined pursuant to 
paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2) or (d)(4) of this section, written procedures 
shall require periodic review of

[[Page 580]]

whether the security, upon readjustment of its interest rate, can 
reasonably be expected to have a market value that approximates its 
amortized cost.
    (iv) Asset Backed Securities. In the case of an Asset Backed 
Security, written procedures shall require the fund to periodically 
determine whether a person other than the Special Purpose Entity is the 
issuer of all or a portion of the Asset Backed Security for purposes of 
paragraph (c)(4)(vi)(A)(4) of this section.
    (9) Record Keeping and Reporting--(i) Written Procedures. For a 
period of not less than six years following the replacement of such 
procedures with new procedures (the first two years in an easily 
accessible place), a written copy of the procedures (and any 
modifications thereto) described in paragraphs (c)(5) through (c)(8) and 
(e) of this section shall be maintained and preserved.
    (ii) Board Considerations and Actions. For a period of not less than 
six years (the first two years in an easily accessible place) a written 
record shall be maintained and preserved of the board of directors' 
considerations and actions taken in connection with the discharge of its 
responsibilities, as set forth in this section, to be included in the 
minutes of the board of directors' meetings.
    (iii) Credit Risk Analysis. For a period of not less than three 
years from the date that the credit risks of a portfolio security were 
most recently reviewed in accordance with paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this 
section, a written record of the determination that a portfolio security 
presents minimal credit risks and the NRSRO ratings (if any) used to 
determine the status of the security as an Eligible Security, First Tier 
Security or Second Tier Security shall be maintained and preserved in an

remaining until the next readjustment of the interest rate or the period 
remaining until the principal amount can be recovered through demand.
    (3) Long-Term Variable Rate Securities. A Variable Rate Security, 
the principal amount of which is scheduled to be paid in more than 397

readjustment of the interest rate or the period remaining until the 
principal amount can be recovered through demand.
    (4) Short-Term Floating Rate Securities. A Floating Rate Security, 
the principal amount of which, in accordance with the terms of the

recovered through demand.

to a demand for the repurchase of the securities.
    (7) Portfolio Lending Agreements. A portfolio lending agreement 
shall be treated as having a maturity equal to the period remaining 
until the date on which the loaned securities are scheduled to be 
returned, or where the agreement is subject to demand, the notice period 
applicable to a demand for the return of the loaned securities.
    (8) Money Market Fund Securities. An investment in a money market 
fund shall be treated as having a maturity equal to the period of time 
within which the acquired money market fund is required to make payment 
upon redemption, unless the acquired money market fund has agreed in 
writing to provide redemption proceeds to the investing money market 
fund within a shorter time period, in which case the maturity of such 
investment shall be deemed to be the shorter period.
    (e) Delegation. The money market fund's board of directors may 
delegate to the fund's investment adviser or officers the responsibility 
to make any determination required to be made by the board of directors 
under this section (other than the determinations required by paragraphs

periodic reviews of fund investments and the delegate's procedures in 
connection with investment decisions and prompt review of the adviser's 
actions in the event of the default of a security or Event of Insolvency 
with respect to the issuer of the security or any Put to which it is

Sec. 270.3a-4  Status of investment advisory programs.

    Note: This section is a nonexclusive safe harbor from the definition 
of investment company for programs that provide discretionary investment 
advisory services to clients. There is no registration requirement under 
section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77e] with respect to 
programs that are organized and operated in the manner described in 
Sec. 270.3a-4. The section is not intended, however, to create any 
presumption about a program that is not organized and operated in the 
manner contemplated by the section.

    (a) Any program under which discretionary investment advisory 
services are provided to clients that has the following characteristics 
will not be deemed to be an investment company within the meaning of the

the

[[Page 585]]

client's financial situation and investment objectives and in accordance 
with any reasonable restrictions imposed by the client on the management 
of the account.
    (2)(i) At the opening of the account, the sponsor or another person 
designated by the sponsor obtains information from the client regarding 
the client's financial situation and investment objectives, and gives 
the client the opportunity to impose reasonable restrictions on the 
management of the account;
    (ii) At least annually, the sponsor or another person designated by 
the sponsor contacts the client to determine whether there have been any 
changes in the client's financial situation or investment objectives, 
and whether the client wishes to impose any reasonable restrictions on 
the management of the account or reasonably modify existing 
restrictions;
    (iii) At least quarterly, the sponsor or another person designated 
by the sponsor notifies the client in writing to contact the sponsor or 
such other person if there have been any changes in the client's 
financial situation or investment objectives, or if the client wishes to 
impose any reasonable restrictions on the management of the client's 
account or reasonably modify existing restrictions, and provides the 
client with a means through which such contact may be made; and
    (iv) The sponsor and personnel of the manager of the client's 
account who are knowledgeable about the account and its management are 
reasonably available to the client for consultation.
    (3) Each client has the ability to impose reasonable restrictions on 
the management of the client's account, including the designation of 
particular securities or types of securities that should not be 
purchased for the account, or that should be sold if held in the 
account; Provided, however, that nothing in this section requires that a 
client have the ability to require that particular securities or types 
of securities be purchased for the account.
    (4) The sponsor or person designated by the sponsor provides each 
client with a statement, at least quarterly, containing a description of 
all activity in the client's account during the preceding period, 
including all transactions made on behalf of the account, all 
contributions and withdrawals made by the client, all fees and expenses 
charged to the account, and the value of the account at the beginning 
and end of the period.
    (5) Each client retains, with respect to all securities and funds in 
the account, to the same extent as if the client held the securities and 
funds outside the program, the right to:
    (i) Withdraw securities or cash;
    (ii) Vote securities, or delegate the authority to vote securities 
to another person;
    (iii) Be provided in a timely manner with a written confirmation or 
other notification of each securities transaction, and all other 
documents required by law to be provided to security holders; and
    (iv) Proceed directly as a security holder against the issuer of any 
security in the client's account and not be obligated to join any person 
involved in the operation of the program, or any other client of the 
program, as a condition precedent to initiating such proceeding.
    (b) As used in this section, the term sponsor refers to any person 
who receives compensation for sponsoring, organizing or administering 
the program, or for selecting, or providing advice to clients regarding 
the selection of, persons responsible for managing the client's account 
in the program. If a program has more than one sponsor, one person shall 
be designated the principal sponsor, and such person shall be considered 
the sponsor of the program under this section.

partnership or joint venture, against the partners or participants in 
the joint venture) to enforce the guarantee without first proceeding 
against the finance subsidiary;
    (4) Any securities issued by the finance subsidiary which are 
convertible or exchangeable are convertible or exchangeable only for

of the Securities Act of 1933 by section 3(a)(3) of that Act; and
    (7) Where the parent company is a foreign bank as the term is used 
in rule 3a-6 (17 CFR 270.3a-6 of this chapter), the parent company may,

section, issue, in favor of the holders of the finance subsidiary's debt 
securities or non-voting preferred stock, as the case may be, an 
irrevocable letter of credit in an amount sufficient to fund all of the 
amounts required to be guaranteed by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of 
this section, provided, that:
    (i) payment on such letter of credit shall be conditional only upon

    (a) Notwithstanding section 3(a) of the Act, any issuer who is 
engaged in the business of purchasing, or otherwise acquiring, and 
holding eligible assets (and in activities related or incidental 
thereto), and who does not issue redeemable securities will not be 
deemed to be an investment company; Provided That:
    (1) The issuer issues fixed-income securities or other securities 
which entitle their holders to receive payments that depend primarily on 
the cash flow from eligible assets;
    (2) Securities sold by the issuer or any underwriter thereof are 
fixed-income securities rated, at the time of initial sale, in one of 
the four highest categories assigned long-term debt or in an equivalent 
short-term category (within either of which there may be sub-categories 
or gradations indicating relative standing) by at least one nationally

person of the issuer or of any person involved in the organization or 
operation of the issuer, except that:
    (i) Any fixed-income securities may be sold to accredited investors

securities) involved in the organization or operation of the issuer or 
an affiliate, as defined in rule 405 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 
230.405), of such a person;

Provided, That the issuer or any underwriter thereof effecting such sale 
exercises reasonable care to ensure that such securities are sold and 
will be resold to persons specified in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of 
this section;
    (3) The issuer acquires additional eligible assets, or disposes of 
eligible assets, only if:
    (i) The assets are acquired or disposed of in accordance with the 
terms and conditions set forth in the agreements, indentures, or other 
instruments pursuant to which the issuer's securities are issued;
    (ii) The acquisition or disposition of the assets does not result in 
a downgrading in the rating of the issuer's outstanding fixed-income 
securities; and
    (iii) The assets are not acquired or disposed of for the primary 
purpose of recognizing gains or decreasing losses resulting from market 
value changes; and
    (4) If the issuer issues any securities other than securities 
exempted from the Securities Act by section 3(a)(3) thereof (15 U.S.C. 
77c(a)(3)), the issuer:

does not offer or provide credit or credit enhancement to the issuer, 
and that executes an agreement or instrument concerning the issuer's 
securities containing provisions to the effect set forth in section 
26(a)(3) of the Act;
    (ii) Takes reasonable steps to cause the trustee to have a perfected 
security interest or ownership interest valid against third parties in 
those eligible assets that principally generate the cash flow needed to 
pay the fixed-income security holders, provided that such assets 
otherwise required to be held by the trustee may be released to the 
extent needed at the time for the operation of the issuer; and
    (iii) Takes actions necessary for the cash flows derived from 
eligible assets for the benefit of the holders of fixed-income 
securities to be deposited periodically in a segregated account that is 
maintained or controlled by the trustee consistent with the rating of 
the outstanding fixed-income securities.
    (b) For purposes of this section:
    (1) Eligible assets means financial assets, either fixed or 
revolving, that by their terms convert into cash within a finite time 
period plus any rights or other assets designed to assure the servicing 
or timely distribution of proceeds to security holders.

holder to receive:
    (i) A stated principal amount; or
    (ii) Interest on a principal amount (which may be a notional

standard or formula which does not reference any change in the market 
value or fair value of eligible assets; or

principal amount) calculated by reference to auctions among holders and 
prospective holders, or through remarketing of the security; or

    (ii) Changes in the investment policy of the separate account 
initiated by contractholders or the board of directors of the separate

during which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading, not less 
frequently than once daily as of the time of the close of trading on

annually, then the amount payable on death need be determined only when 
such net premium is transferred;

any prior payment during the contract period except that such amount may 
exceed the amount deducted from a prior payment if the increase is 
caused by the grading of cash values into reserves or reductions in the 
annual cost of insurance;

    (B) Is examined from time to time by the insurance regulatory 
authority of such state, territory or District of Columbia as to its 
financial condition and other affairs and is subject to supervision and 
inspection with respect to its separate account operations; and
    (C) Limits the fees for administrative services to amounts that are 
reasonable in relation to services rendered and expenses incurred. The 
Commission shall retain jurisdiction regarding the determination of such 
fees;
    (iv) Sections 27(c)(1) and 27(d), to the extent that such sections 
require that the variable life insurance contract be redeemable or 
provide for a refund in cash: Provided, That such contract provides for 
election by the contractholder of a cash surrender value or certain non-
forfeiture and settlement options which are required or permitted by the 
insurance law or regulation of the jurisdiction in which the contract is 
offered: And further provided, That unless required by the insurance law 
or regulation of the jurisdiction in which the

[[Page 602]]

contract is offered or unless elected by the contractholder, such 
contract shall not provide for the automatic imposition of any option, 
including, but not limited to, an automatic premium loan, which would 
involve the accrual or payment of an interest or similar charge;
    (v) Section 27(d): Provided, That the variable life insurance 
contract gives the holder thereof the right to:
    (A) Surrender the contract at any time during the first 24 months 
after issuance and receive in cash an amount not less than the sum of 
the present value of his contract which is the cash surrender value next 
computed after receipt by the life insurer of the request for surrender 
in proper form, plus, depending upon the period over which such contract 
has been retained by the contractholder, an amount which is a refund of 
any excess paid for sales loading prior to surrender: Provided, however, 
That if payments for the contract have not been duly paid on the date 
the request for surrender is received by the life insurer, and if the 
sum of the cash surrender value and the amount of any excess sales 
loading which would otherwise be refundable in cash were applied to 
provide (without sales loading) a nonforfeiture benefit in accordance 
with the contract, then the contractholder shall be entitled to receive 
in cash the present value, next computed after receipt by the life 
insurer of the request for surrender in proper form, of any non-
forfeiture benefit then in force. The amount of sales loading to be 
refunded shall be equal to that part of the excess paid for sales 
loading which is over the sum of 30 per centum of payments made for the 
first contract year plus 10 per centum of the payments made for the 
second contract year; and
    (B) Convert the contract at any time during the first 24 months 
after issuance so long as payments are duly made to a life insurance 
policy on the life of the insured which provides for fixed death 
benefits and cash surrender values pursuant to a plan of insurance 
specified in the contract issued by the life insurer, or by a life 
insurance company affiliated with such insurer, which provides for the 
same initial amount of insurance as the variable life insurance contract 
and premiums which are based on the same issue age and risk 
classification of the insured as the variable life insurance contract, 
which conversion shall be subject to an equitable adjustment in payments 
and cash values to reflect variances, if any, in the payments and cash 
values under the original contract and the new policy: Provided, That 
the method of computing such adjustment shall be filed with the 
Commission as an exhibit to the form required pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii) of this Rule;
    (vi) A depositor or principal underwriter for a variable life 
insurance contract sold subject to section 27(d) or section 27(f) of the 
Act, or both, shall be exempt from the requirements of Rule 27d-1 if an 
insurance company undertakes in writing to guarantee the performance of 
all obligations of such depositor or principal underwriter under 
sections 27(d) and 27(f) of the Act to refund charges and such insurance 
company, depositor and principal underwriter comply with all provisions 
of Rule 27d-2;
    (vii) Section 27(e) and Rule 27e-1 thereunder to the extent that the 
separate account and the depositor and principal underwriter therefor, 
when such persons are subject to paragraph (b)(13)(v) of this Rule, are 
required to provide a notice of right of withdrawal and refund to 
holders of variable life insurance contracts, if the life insurer or a 
duly authorized agent provides a notice of withdrawal and refund rights 
on Form N-27I-1, to the holder of any variable life insurance contract 
under which a refund may be available, provided that such notice shall 
be sent by first class mail to the contractholder:
    (A) At issuance of the variable life insurance contract, which 
notice may be sent together with the issued variable life insurance 
contract and an illustration, in a form appropriate for inclusion in the 
prospectus for the variable life insurance contract, of gross annual 
payments, death benefits and cash surrender values applicable to the 
age, sex and underwriting classification of the insured; and
    (B) If the contractholder has failed to make a payment prior to the 
expiration of the refund right provided by paragraph (b)(13)(v) of this 
Rule and

[[Page 603]]

the contract has not been reinstated within 30 days following the 
expiration of the grace period provided in the variable life insurance 
contract for making of any payment due: Provided, however, In any event, 
if a payment is not made when due such notice shall be sent not less 
than 15 days prior to the expiration of the refund right, which notice 
may be sent together with a notification that the payment is overdue or 
an offer to reinstate the contract;
    (viii) Section 27(f) and Rule 27f-1: Provided, That:
    (A) The contractholder may elect to return the contract within 45 
days of the date of the execution of the application for insurance or 
within 10 days after receipt of the issued contract by the 
contractholder, or within 10 days after mailing of the notice of the 
right of withdrawal, whichever is later, and receive a refund of all 
payments made for such contract;
    (B) A refund of all payments to redeeming contractholders will not 
in any way affect the interests in the separate account or the benefits 
of other variable life insurance contractholders;
    (C) Notice of such withdrawal right and a statement of charges on 
Form N-27I-2 is sent by first class mail to the contractholder, which 
notice and statement may be accompanied by the variable life insurance 
contract and an illustration, in a form appropriate for inclusion in the 
prospectus for the variable life insurance contract, of payments, death 
benefits and cash surrender values applicable to the age, sex and 
underwriting classification of the insured;
    (D) The contractholder, in conjunction with the notice of withdrawal 
right referred to in paragraph (b)(13)(viii)(C) of this rule, is 
provided with a form of request for refund of payments made, which form 
shall set forth;
    (1) Instructions as to the manner in which a refund may be obtained 
including the address to which the request form should be mailed; and
    (2) Spaces necessary to indicate the date of such request, the 
contract number and the signature of the contractholder; and
    (E) Within 7 days from the receipt of such duly executed timely 
request for refund, the life insurer will refund in cash to the 
contractholder the entire amount of payments made on the contract;
    (ix) Solely for purposes of paragraphs (b)(13)(v) and (viii) of this 
Rule, the postmark date on the envelope containing the variable life 
insurance contract shall determine whether such contract has been 
submitted for surrender or conversion within the designated period.
    (14) Section 32(a)(2): Provided, That:
    (i) The independent public accountant is selected before the 
effective date of the registration statement under the Securities Act of 
1933, as amended, for variable life insurance contracts which are funded 
by the separate account, and the identity of such accountant is 
disclosed in such registration statement, and
    (ii) The selection of such accountant is submitted for ratification 
or rejection to variable life insurance contractholders at their first 
meeting after the effective date of the registration statement under the 
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on condition that such meeting shall 
take place within one year after such effective date, unless the time 
for the holding of such meeting shall be extended by the Commission upon 
written request for good cause shown.
    (15) If the separate account is organized as a unit investment 
trust, all the assets of which consist of the shares of one or more 
registered management investment companies which offer their shares 
exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of the life 
insurer or of any affiliated life insurance company:
    (i) The eligibility restrictions of section 9(a) of the Act shall

management investment company described above;
    (ii) The life insurer shall be ineligible pursuant to paragraph (3) 
of section 9(a) of the Act to serve as investment adviser of or

(b)(15) only if an affiliated person of such life insurer, ineligible by 
reason of paragraph (1) or (2) of section 9(a), participates in the 
management or administration of such company;
    (iii) The life insurer may vote shares of the registered management 
investment companies held by the separate account without regard to 
instructions from contractholders of the separate account if such 
instructions would require such shares to be voted:
    (A) To cause such companies to make (or refrain from making) certain 
investments which would result in changes in the sub-classification or 
investment objectives of such companies or to approve or disapprove any 
contract between such companies and an investment adviser when required 
to do so by an insurance regulatory authority subject to the provisions 
of paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and (7)(ii)(A) of this section; or
    (B) In favor of changes in investment objectives, investment adviser 
of or principal underwriter for such companies subject to the provisions 
of paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) and (7)(ii) (B) and (C) of this section;
    (iv) Any action taken in accordance with paragraph (b)(15)(iii) (A) 
or (B) of this section and the reasons therefor shall be disclosed in 
the next report to contractholders made pursuant to section 30(d) and 
Rule 30d-2 thereunder.
    (v) Any registered management investment company established by the 
insurer and described in this paragraph (b)(15) shall be exempt from 
section 14(a) provided that until such company has total assets of at 
least $100,000 the life insurer shall have at least the minimum net 
worth prescribed in paragraph (b)(6) of this section; and
    (vi) Any registered management investment company established by the

by paragraphs (b)(7)(i), (b)(8)(i), and (b)(14), provided that such 
company complies with the conditions set forth in those paragraphs as if 
it were a separate account.
    (c) When used in this rule:
    (1) Variable life insurance contract means a contract of life 
insurance, subject to regulation under the insurance laws or code of 
every jurisdiction in which it is offered, funded by a separate account 
of a life insurer, which contract, so long as payments are duly paid in 
accordance with its terms, provides for:
    (i) A death benefit and cash surrender value which vary to reflect 
the investment experience of the separate account;
    (ii) An initial stated dollar amount of death benefit, and payment 
of a death benefit guaranteed by the life insurer to be at least equal 
to such stated amount; and
    (iii) Assumption of the mortality and expense risks thereunder by 
the life insurer for which a charge against the assets of the separate 
account may be assessed. Such charge shall be disclosed in the 
prospectus and shall not be less than fifty per centum of the maximum 
charge for risk assumption as disclosed in the prospectus and as 
provided for in the contract.
    (2) Incidental insurance benefits means insurance benefits provided 
pursuant to the variable life insurance contract, other than the minimum 
and variable death benefit, which do not vary in amount or duration in 
accordance with the investment performance of the separate account, and 
include, but are not limited to, accidental death and dismemberment 
benefits, disability income benefits, guaranteed insurability options, 
and family income or fixed benefit term riders.
    (3) Minimum death benefit is the amount guaranteed by the life 
insurer to be paid pursuant to a variable life insurance contract in the 
event of the death of the insured without regard to the investment 
performance of the separate account funding the variable life insurance 
contract, if payments are duly made and if there are no outstanding 
loans, partial withdrawals or partial surrenders, but does not include 
any incidental insurance benefits.
    (4) Sales load charged on any payment is the excess of the payment 
over the sum of the following:
    (i) The amount of the cash value for the first contract year, if 
any, and the amount of the increase in the cash

[[Page 605]]

value for each subsequent contract year, that is attributable to 
payments made and not attributable to investment earnings;
    (ii) The cost of insurance for the period for which the payment is 
made based on the 1958 Commissioners Standard Ordinary Mortality Table 
and the assumed investment rate specified in the contract;
    (iii) A reasonable charge necessary to cover the risk assumed by the 
life insurer that the variable death benefit will be less than the 
guaranteed minimum death benefit;
    (iv) Any administrative expenses or fees which are reasonable and in 
amounts not exceeding anticipated administrative expenses and fees not 
properly chargeable to sales or promotional activities;
    (v) A deduction approximately equal to state premium taxes;
    (vi) Any additional charge assessed if the insured does not meet 
standard underwriting requirements;
    (vii) Any additional charge assessed specifically for any incidental 
insurance benefits which do not vary in relation to the performance of 
the separate account;
    (viii) Any additional charge, in the nature of an interest or 
service charge or administrative fee, assessed when payments are made 
more frequently than annually;
    (ix) For a participating variable life insurance contract, a 
deduction for dividends to be paid or credited in accordance with the 
dividend scale in effect on the issue date of the contract assuming a 
gross annual investment return for the separate account which funds such 
contract of 4 percent after deduction for any Federal income taxes, 
which deduction may be determined pursuant to either of the following 
methods, provided that the same method must be applied with respect to 
each payment under the contract:
    (A) The actuarial level annual equivalent of dividends to be paid or 
credited over the period described in paragraph (b)(13)(i) of this 
section, based upon the mortality, interest and lapse assumptions used 
in computing the dividend scale for such contract multiplied by the 
fraction of the contract year for which the payment is made; or
    (B) That portion of the dividend to be paid for the contract year 
which does not depend on the making of additional payments.
    (5) Assumed investment rate is the rate of investment return 
specified in the contract which would be required to be credited to a 
variable life insurance contract, after deduction of charges for Federal 
income taxes, investment management fees, portfolio transaction expenses 
and mortality and expense guarantees, to maintain the variable death 
benefit equal at all times to the amount of death benefit, other than 
incidental insurance benefits, which would be payable pursuant to the 
variable life insurance contract if the death benefit did not vary 
according to the investment experience of the separate account.
    (6) Variable death benefit is the amount of death benefit, other 
than incidental insurance benefits, payable under a variable life 
insurance contract which varies to reflect the investment performance of 
the separate account, and which would be payable in the absence of the 
minimum death benefit.
    (7) Payment, as used in paragraphs (b)(13)(i), (b)(13)(ii) and 
(b)(13)(v)(A) of this section and in sections 27(a)(2) and 27(h)(2) 
solely with respect to variable life insurance contracts, means the 
gross premium payment made less any portion of such gross premium 
charged for or attributable to the items specified in paragraphs 
(c)(4)(vi), (vii) and (viii) of this section. ``Payment,'' as used in 
any other section of the Rule, means the gross premiums paid or payable 
for the variable life insurance contract.

value, or to securities hypothecated, pledged, or placed in escrow for 
the account of such separate account in connection with a loan or other 
transaction authorized by specific resolution of the board of directors

of the accountant stating that he has made an examination of such 
securities and investments and describing the nature and extent of the 
examination shall be sent to the Commission by the accountant promptly 
after each examination;
    (vii) Securities and similar investments of a separate account 
maintained with a bank or other company whose functions and physical 
facilities are supervised by federal or state authorities under any 
arrangement whereby the directors, officers, employees or agents of the 
separate account or the life insurer are authorized or permitted to 
withdraw such investments upon their mere receipt are deemed to be in 
the custody of the life insurer and shall be exempt from the 
requirements of section 17(f) so long as the arrangement complies with 
all provisions of this paragraph (b)(9), except that such securities 
will be maintained in the vault of a bank or other company rather than 
the vault of an insurance company.
    (10) Section 18(i) (15 U.S.C. 80a-18(i)), to the extent that:
    (i) For the purposes of any section of the Act which provides for 
the vote of securityholders on matters relating to the investment 
company:
    (A) Flexible contractholders shall have one vote for each $100 of 
cash value funded by the separate account, with fractional votes 
allocated for amounts less than $100;
    (B) The life insurer shall have one vote for each $100 of assets of

    (C) The number of votes to be allocated shall be determined as of a 
record date not more than 90 days before any meeting at which such vote 
is held, Provided, That if a quorum is not present at the meeting, the 
meeting may be adjourned for up to 60 days without fixing a new record

    (i) The cash value of each flexible contract shall be computed in 
accordance with Rule 22c-1(b) under the Act; Provided, however, That 
where actual computation is not necessary for the operation of a 
particular contract, then the cash value of that contract must only be 
capable of computation; And provided further, That to the extent the 
calculation of the cash value reflects deductions for the cost of 
insurance and other insurance benefits or administrative expenses and 
fees or sales loads, such deductions need only be made at such times as 
specified in the contract or as necessary for compliance with insurance 
laws and regulations; and
    (ii) The death benefit, unless required by insurance laws and 
regulations, shall be computed on any day that the investment experience 
of the separate account would affect the death benefit under the terms 
of the contract provided that such terms are reasonable, fair, and 
nondiscriminatory;
    (iii) Necessary to comply with this Rule or with insurance laws and 
regulations and established administrative procedures of the life 
insurer for issuance, increases in or additions of insurance benefits,

limited to, premium rate structure and premium processing, insurance 
underwriting standards, and the particular benefit afforded by the 
contract, Provided, however, That any procedure or action shall be 
reasonable, fair and not discriminatory to the interests of the affected

80a-27(h)(1)), and 27(h)(4) (15 U.S.C. 80a-27(h)(4)), to the extent that 
sales load, as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this Rule, deducted does 
not exceed that permitted by either paragraph (b)(13)(i)((A) or 
(b)(13)(i)(B) of this section:
    (A) 9 per centum of the sum of the guideline annual premiums that 
would be paid during the period equal to the lesser of 20 years or the 
anticipated life expectancy of the insured named in the contract based 
on the 1980 Commissioners Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, Provided, 
That this paragraph (b)(13)(i)(A) shall not prohibit deduction of sales 
load, in any manner permitted by this Rule, from payments made in excess

governed (with respect to each class of flexible contract offered) by 
either paragraph (b)(13)(i)(A) or (B); Provided, however, That for each 
class of flexible contract that requires more than four guideline annual 
premiums within the first two contract periods following issuance of the 
contract or of an increase in or addition of insurance benefits (within 
the meaning of paragraph (d)(2) of this section), the separate account 
must elect to be governed by paragraph (b)(13)(i)(B) of this section.
    (ii) Sections 27(a)(3) (15 U.S.C. 80a-27(a)(3)) and 27(h)(3) (15 
U.S.C. 80a-27(h)(3)), Provided, That the proportionate amount of sales 
load deducted from any payment shall not exceed the proportionate amount 
deducted from any prior payment unless an increase is caused by 
reductions in the annual

[[Page 611]]

cost of insurance, or a reduction in the sales load deducted from 
amounts transferred to a flexible contract from another plan of 
insurance;
    (iii) Sections 27(c)(2), 26(a)(1) (15 U.S.C. 80a-26(a)(1)), and 
26(a)(2) (15 U.S.C. 80a-26(a)(2)), to the extent necessary to permit the 
actions described in paragraphs (A) through (F) of this section, 
Provided, That the life insurer complies with all other applicable 
provisions of section 26 as if it were a trustee, depositor or custodian 
for the separate account; files with the insurance regulatory authority 
of a state or territory of the United States or of the District of 
Columbia an annual statement of its financial condition in the form 
prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which 
most recent statement indicates that it has a combined capital and 
surplus, if a stock company, or an unassigned surplus, if a mutual 
company, of not less than $1,000,000; and is examined from time to time 
by the insurance regulatory authority of such state, territory or 
District of Columbia as to its financial condition and other affairs and 
is subject to supervision and inspection with respect to its separate 
account operations.
    (A) Payment of a fee to the life insurer, or to any affiliated 
person or agent of the insurer, for bookkeeping or other administrative 
services provided to the separate account, or for administrative 
services or expenses incurred in underwriting, issuing, and maintaining 
flexible contracts, Provided, That the fee is not greater than the 
expenses, without profit:
    (1) Actually paid by the life insurer for the services provided; and
    (2) Increased by the value of any services provided directly by the 
life insurer, as determined in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles consistently applied.
The standard set forth in this paragraph shall be applied as follows: if 
the separate account reserves the right to increase the fee, the fee 
shall not exceed the cost of the services to be provided for one year; 
or if the fee is guaranteed not to increase for a specified period of 
time, the fee shall not exceed the average expected cost of the services 
to be provided during the period of the guarantee;
    (B) The holding of the assets of the separate account by the life 
insurer without a trust indenture or other such instrument;
    (C) When the separate account is organized as a unit investment

a management investment company, an investment advisory fee;
    (F) The deduction of a charge for mortality, expense, and any 
guaranteed death benefit risks assumed by the life insurer under the 
flexible contracts (collectively, a ``risk charge''), Provided, That the 
registration statement under the 1933 Act for flexible contracts 
includes:
    (1) A representation that this paragraph is being relied upon;
    (2) A representation that the level of the risk charge either is:
    (i) Within the range of industry practice for comparable flexible or 
scheduled contracts, or
    (ii) Reasonable in relation to the risks assumed by the life insurer 
under the contracts;
    (3) A brief description of the methodology used to support the 
representation made in response to paragraph (b)(13)(iii)(F)(2) of this 
Rule and an undertaking to keep and make available to the Commission 
upon request the documents used to support that representation;
    (4) A representation that either:
    (i) The proceeds from explicit sales loads will be sufficient to 
cover the expected costs of distributing the flexible contracts; or

[[Page 612]]

    (ii)(A) The life insurer has concluded that there is a reasonable 
likelihood that the distribution financing arrangement of the separate 
account will benefit the separate account and contractholders and will 
keep and make available to the Commission on request a memorandum 
setting forth the basis for this representation; and
    (B) If the separate account is organized as a management investment 
company, a representation that the account will have a board of 
directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the separate 
account, formulate and approve any plan under Rule 12b-1 to finance 
distribution expenses. If the separate account is organized as a unit 
investment trust, a representation that the account will invest only in 
management investment companies which have undertaken to have a board of 
directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company, 
formulate and approve any plan under Rule 12b-1 to finance distribution 
expenses.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (b)(13)(iii)(F), no 
risk charge may be deducted in reliance thereupon if the registration 
statement or amendment thereto which initially sets forth the deduction 
of such charge or its increase becomes effective by lapse of time 
pursuant to section 8(a) of the 1933 Act or Rule 485 (17 CFR 230.485) 
thereunder. Such charge shall be disclosed in the prospectus and shall 
not be less than fifty per centum of the maximum charge for risk 
assumption as disclosed in the prospectus and as provided for in the 
contract. Any separate account organized under the Act as a management 
investment company and deducting a risk charge pursuant to this section 
shall be exempt from section 12(b) and Rule 12b-1 thereunder to the 
extent that monies derived from the risk charge may be used to finance 
distribution of the flexible contracts;
    (iv) Sections 27(c)(1) and 27(d), and sections 2(a)(32) and 22(c) 
and Rule 22c-1 thereunder, to the extent that:
    (A) Such sections require that the flexible contract be redeemable 
or provide for a refund in cash, Provided,  That the contract provides 
for election by the contractholder of a cash surrender value or certain 
non-forfeiture and settlement options which are required or permitted by 
the insurance law or regulation of the jurisdiction in which the 
contract is offered, And provided further, That unless required by the 
insurance law or regulation of the jurisdiction in which the contract is 
offered or unless elected by the contractholder, the contract shall not 
provide for the automatic imposition of any option, including, but not 
limited to, an automatic premium loan, which would involve the accrual 
or payment of an interest or similar charge.
    (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(13)(iv)(A) of 
this Rule, if the amounts available under the contract to pay the 
charges due under the contract on any contract processing day are less 
than such charges due, the contract may provide that the cash surrender 
value (and any excess paid for sales loading not used to keep the 
contract in force pursuant to paragraph (b)(13)(iv)(B)(2) of this Rule) 
shall be applied to purchase a non-forfeiture option specified by the 
life insurer in such contract, Provided, That the contract also provides 
that:
    (1) Contract processing days occur not less frequently than monthly, 
and
    (2) the amount of any excess paid for sales loading (as provided in 
paragraph (b)(13)(v)(A) of this Rule) shall first be applied to keep the 
contract in force, Provided, however, That if the contractholder 
subsequently makes a payment, the life insurer may recover such excess 
loading;
    (C) Subject to other provisions of this Rule, sales loads and 
administrative expenses or fees may be deducted upon redemption.
    (v) Section 27(d), Provided, That the flexible contract gives the 
holder thereof the right to:
    (A) Surrender the contract at any time during the first 24 months 
after issuance and receive in cash an amount not less than the sum of 
the present value of his contract which is the cash surrender value next 
computed after receipt by the life insurer of the request for surrender 
in proper form, plus, an amount which is a refund of any excess paid for 
sales loading prior to or in connection with the surrender. The amount 
of sales loading to be refunded shall be equal to that part of

[[Page 613]]

the sales loading in excess of (1) the sum of 30 per centum of payments 
in aggregate amount less than or equal to one guideline annual premium, 
plus 10 per centum of payments in aggregate amount greater than one 
guideline annual premium but not more than two guideline annual 
premiums, and (2) 9 per centum of each payment made in excess of two 
guideline annual premiums;
    (B) Convert the contract at any time during the first 24 months 
after issuance, so long as the contract is in force, to a life insurance 
policy on the life of the insured under a plan of insurance (other than 
a plan involving a flexible contract as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this Rule or a scheduled contract as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 
6e-2) specified in the contract, issued by the life insurer or by an 
affiliated life insurance company, which provides for (1) at the 
election of the contractholder, either the same death benefit or the 
same net amount at risk as the flexible contract at the time of 
conversion and (2) premiums (or cost of insurance or other charges, 
(``charges'') if such plan of insurance provides for flexible premiums) 
which are based on the same issue age and risk classification of the 
insured as the flexible contract. The conversion shall be subject to an 
equitable adjustment in payments and cash values to reflect variances, 
if any, in the payments (or charges), dividends, and cash values under 
the flexible contract and the new policy. The method of computing such 
adjustment shall be filed with the Commission as an exhibit to the form 
required under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this Rule;
    (vi) A depositor or principal underwriter for a flexible contract 
sold subject to section 27(d) or section 27(f), or both, shall be exempt 
from the requirements of Rule 27d-1 (17 CFR 270.27d-1) if an insurance 
company undertakes in writing to guarantee the performance of all 
obligations of such depositor or principal underwriter under sections 
27(d) and 27(f) to refund charges, and such insurance company, depositor 
and principal underwriter comply with all provisions of Rule 27d-2 (17 
CFR 270.27d-2);
    (vii) Section 27(e) [15 U.S.C. 80a-27(e)] and Rule 27e-1 (17 CFR 
270.27e-1) thereunder, to the extent that the separate account and the 
depositor and principal underwriter therefor, when such persons are 
subject to paragraph (b)(13)(v)(A) of this Rule, are required to provide 
a notice of right of surrender and refund to holders of flexible 
contracts, if the life insurer or a duly authorized agent provides a 
notice of surrender and refund rights on a written document containing 
information comparable to that required by Form N-27I-1 (17 CFR 274.301) 
to the holder of any flexible contract under which a refund may be 
available, Provided, That such notice shall be sent by first class mail 
or personal delivery to the contractholder:
    (A) Upon issuance of the flexible contract, which notice may be sent 
together with the issued contract and an illustration, in a form 
appropriate for inclusion in the prospectus for the flexible contract, 
of guideline annual premiums, death benefits and cash surrender values 
applicable to the age, sex and underwriting classification of the 
insured; and
    (B) On any contract processing day, prior to the expiration of the 
surrender and refund right provided in paragraph (b)(13)(v)(A) of this 
Rule, on which the amounts available under the contract on such day to 
pay the charges authorized by the contract are less than the amount 
necessary to keep the contract in force until the next following 
contract processing day. This notice may be sent together with any 
notice required by applicable state authority to be sent in these 
circumstances; Provided, however, That the right of surrender and refund 
provided by paragraph (b)(13)(v)(A) of this Rule shall not expire until 
not less than 15 days after the mailing or receipt, if personally 
delivered, of the last notice referred to in this paragraph 
(b)(13)(vii)(B) of this section;
    (viii) Section 27(f) and Rule 27f-1 thereunder (17 CFR 270.27f-1), 
Provided, That:
    (A) The contractholder may elect to return the contract within 45 
days of the date of the execution of the application for insurance, or 
within 10 days after receipt of the issued contract by

[[Page 614]]

the contractholder, or within 10 days after mailing or personal delivery 
of the notice of the right of withdrawal referred to in paragraph 
(b)(13)(viii)(C) of this Rule, whichever is later, and receive a refund 
equal to the sum of (1) the difference between the payments made, 
including any contract fees or other charges, and the amounts allocated 
to the separate account under the contract, (2) the value of the amounts 
allocated to the separate account under the contract on the date the 
returned contract is received by the insurer or its agent, and (3) any 
contract fees and other changes imposed on the amounts allocated to such 
separate account, Provided, however, That if state law or the contract 
so require, the redeeming contractholder shall receive a refund of all 
payments made for such contract;
    (B) A refund in accordance with paragraph (b)(13)(viii)(A) of this 
Rule to redeeming contractholders will not in any way affect the 
interests in the separate account or the benefits of other flexible or 
scheduled contractholders;
    (C) Notice of such withdrawal right and a statement of contract fees 
and other charges on a written document containing information 
comparable to that required by Form N-27I-2 (17 CFR 274.303) is sent by 
first class mail or personal delivery to the contractholder, which 
notice and statement may be accompanied by the flexible contract, and an 
illustration, in a form appropriate for inclusion in the prospectus for 
the flexible contract, of guideline annual premiums (or, if the contract 
is subject to paragraph (b)(13)(i)(B), payments), death benefits and 
cash surrender values applicable to the age, sex and underwriting 
classification of the insured;
    (D) The contractholder, in conjunction with the notice of withdrawal 
right referred to in paragraph (b)(13)(viii)(C) of this section, is 
provided with a form of request for refund of the amount computed in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(13)(viii)(A), which form shall set forth:
    (1) Instructions as to the manner in which a refund may be obtained, 
including the address to which the request form should be mailed; and
    (2) Spaces necessary to indicate the date of such request, the 
contract number and the signature of the contractholder; and
    (E) Within 7 days from the receipt of such duly executed timely 
request for refund, the life insurer will refund in cash to the 
contractholder the amount computed in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(13)(viii)(A) of this Rule; and
    (ix) Solely for purposes of paragraphs (b)(13)(v) and (b)(13)(viii) 
of this Rule, the postmark date on the envelope containing the flexible 
contract shall determine whether such contract has been submitted for 
surrender, conversion, or withdrawal within the designated period.
    (14) Section 32(a)(2) (15 U.S.C. 80a-31(a)(2)), Provided, That:
    (i) The independent public accountant is selected before the 
effective date of the 1933 Act registration statement for flexible 
contracts, and the identity of the accountant is disclosed in the 
registration statement, and
    (ii) The selection of the accountant is submitted for ratification 
or rejection to flexible contractholders at their first meeting and 
within one year after the effective date of the 1933 Act registration 
statement for flexible contracts, unless the time for holding the 
meeting is extended by order of the Commission.
    (15) If the separate account is organized as a unit investment 
trust, all the assets of which consist of the shares of one or more 
registered management investment companies which offer their shares 
exclusively to separate accounts of the life insurer, or of any 
affiliated life insurance company, offering either scheduled contracts 
or flexible contracts, or both; or which also offer their shares to 
variable annuity separate accounts of the life insurer or of an 
affiliated life insurance company, or which offer their shares to any 
such life insurance company in consideration solely for advances made by 
the life insurer in connection with the operation of the separate 
account; Provided, That: the board of directors of each investment 
company, constituted with a majority of disinterested directors, will 
monitor such company for the existence of any material irreconcilable 
conflict between the interests

[[Page 615]]

of variable annuity contractholders and scheduled or flexible 
contractholders investing in such company; the life insurer agrees that 
it will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts 
to the directors; and if a conflict arises, the life insurer will, at 
its own cost, remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a 
new registered management investment company and segregating the assets 
underlying the variable annuity contracts and the scheduled or flexible 
contracts; Then:
    (i) The eligibility restrictions of section 9(a) shall not apply to 
those persons who are officers, directors or employees of the life 
insurer or its affiliates who do not participate directly in the 
management or administration of any registered management investment 
company described in this paragraph (b)(15);
    (ii) The life insurer shall be ineligible under paragraph (3) of

ineligible by reason of paragraphs (1) or (2) of section 9(a), 
participates in the management or administration of such company;
    (iii) For purposes of any section of the Act which provides for the 
vote of securityholders on matters relating to the separate account or 
the underlying registered investment company, the voting provisions of 
paragraph (b)(10)(i) and (ii) of this Rule apply, Provided, That:
    (A) The life insurer may vote shares of the registered management 
investment companies held by the separate account without regard to 
instructions from contractholders of the separate account if such 
instructions would require such shares to be voted:
    (1) To cause such companies to make (or refrain from making) certain 
investments which would result in changes in the sub-classification or 
investment objectives of such companies or to approve or disapprove any 
contract between such companies and an investment adviser when required 
to do so by an insurance regulatory authority subject to the provisions 
of paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and (b)(7)(ii)(A) of this Rule; or
    (2) In favor of changes in investment objectives, investment adviser 
of or principal underwriter for such companies subject to the provisions

29(d)) and Rule 30d-2 (17 CFR 270.30d-2);
    (iv) Any registered management investment company established by the 
life insurer and described in this paragraph (b)(15) shall be exempt

at least $100,000, the life insurer shall have at least the minimum net 
worth prescribed in paragraph (b)(6) of this Rule; and
    (v) Any registered management investment company established by the 
life insurer and described in this paragraph (b)(15) shall be exempt 
from sections 15(a), 16(a), and 32(a)(2), to the extent prescribed by 
paragraphs (b)(7)(i), (b)(8)(i), and (b)(14) of this Rule, Provided, 
That the company complies with the conditions set forth in those 
paragraphs as if it were a separate account.
    (c) When used in this Rule:
    (1) Flexible premium variable life insurance contract means a 
contract of life insurance, subject to regulation under the insurance 
laws or code of every jurisdiction in which it is offered, funded by a 
separate account of a life insurer, which contract provides for:
    (i) Payments which are not fixed by the life insurer as to both 
timing and amount: Provided, however, That the life insurer may fix the 
timing and minimum amount of payments for the first two contract periods 
following issuance of the contract or of an increase in or addition of 
insurance benefits (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section), and may prescribe a reasonable minimum amount for any 
additional payment;
    (ii) A death benefit the amount or duration of which may vary to 
reflect the investment experience of the separate account;

[[Page 616]]

    (iii) A cash value which varies to reflect the investment experience 
of the separate account; and
    (iv) There is a reasonable expectation that subsequent payments will 
be made.
    (2) Incidental insurance benefits means insurance benefits provided 
pursuant to the flexible contract, other than any guaranteed and 
variable death benefit, which do not have discrete cash values that may 
vary in amount in accordance with the investment experience of the 
separate account, and include, but are not limited to, accidental death 
and dismemberment benefits, disability income benefits, guaranteed 
insurability options, and family income or fixed benefit term riders.
    (3) Guaranteed death benefit is any amount guaranteed by the life 
insurer to be paid pursuant to a flexible contract in the event of the 
death of the insured without regard to the investment experience of the 
separate account, if there are no outstanding loans or partial 
surrenders, but does not include any incidental insurance benefits.
    (4) Sales load charged during a contract period is the excess of any 
payments made during the period over the sum of the following:
    (i) The amount of the change (whether it is an increase or decrease) 
in the cash value for the period that is not attributable to net 
investment earnings or to dividends for a participating flexible 
contract for the period;
    (ii) The cost of insurance for the period based on:
    (A) For a flexible contract subject to paragraph (b)(13)(i)(A) of 
this section, the 1980 Commissioners Standard Ordinary Mortality Table 
and net interest at the annual effective rate specified for purposes of 
paragraph (c)(8)(i)(B) of this Rule; or
    (B) For a flexible contract subject to paragraph (b)(13)(i)(B) of 
this section, either the 1980 Commissioners Standard Ordinary Mortality 
Table or the 1958 Commissioners Ordinary Mortality Table (whichever 
relates to rates guaranteed by the contract) and the assumed investment 
rate specified in the contract, Provided, however, That the 1958 
Commissioners Ordinary Mortality Table may only be used for those 
contracts issued before 1990, or such earlier mandatory date for 
implementation of the 1980 Commissioners Standard Ordinary Mortality 
Table under the applicable Standard Nonforfeiture Law for life 
insurance;
    (iii) A reasonable charge necessary to cover the risk assumed by the 
life insurer that the variable death benefit will be less than any 
guaranteed death benefit;
    (iv) Any administrative expenses or fees which are deducted pursuant 
to paragraph (b)(13)(iii)(A) of this Rule;
    (v) A deduction for and approximately equal to state premium taxes;
    (vi) Any additional charge assessed if the insured does not meet 
standard underwriting requirements, including, but not limited to, any 
additional cost of insurance charge for a contract purchased on a 
simplified underwriting or guaranteed issue basis;
    (vii) Any additional charge assessed specifically for any incidental 
insurance benefits;
    (viii) Any additional charge, the nature of an interest charge, 
assessed when payments are made more frequently than annually, but only 
to the extent that such payments are made to fulfill a minimum payment 
requirement imposed pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this Rule;
    (ix) Any amounts redeemed by the contractholder or paid out to the 
beneficiary upon the death of the insured which are not attributable to 
net investment earnings for the period; and
    (x) For a participating flexible contract, a deduction for dividends 
to be paid or credited in accordance with the dividend scale in effect 
on the issue date of the contract assuming a net annual investment 
return for the separate account which funds the contract of 5 per 
centum. The deduction may be determined by either of the following 
methods, but the same method must be used for each contract period:
    (A) The actuarial level annual equivalent of dividends to be paid or 
credited over the contract periods described in paragraph (b)(13)(i) of 
this Rule, based upon the mortality, interest and lapse assumptions used 
in computing the dividend scale for the contract (and, if the contract 
is subject to paragraph (b)(13)(i)(A) of this section, the

[[Page 617]]

assumption that the guideline annual premium will be paid in each 
contract period) multiplied by the fraction of the contract year 
represented by the contract period; or
    (B) That portion of the dividend to be paid for the contract year 
which does not depend on the making of payments in addition to those 
made during the period.
    (5) Contract period means the period from a contract issue or 
anniversary date to the earlier of the next following anniversary date 
(or, if later, the last day of any grace period commencing before such 
next following anniversary date) or the termination date of the 
contract.
    (6) Variable death benefit is the amount of death benefit, other 
than incidental insurance benefits, payable under a flexible contract 
which varies to reflect the investment experience of the separate 
account and which would be payable in the absence of any guaranteed 
death benefit.
    (7) Payment, as used in paragraphs (b)(13)(i), (b)(13)(ii), and 
(b)(13)(v)(A) of this Rule and in sections 27(a)(2) and 27(h)(2) solely 
with respect to flexible contracts, means for a contract period the 
gross permiums paid less any portion of such gross premiums charged for 
the items specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(vi), (c)(4)(vii), and 
(c)(4)(viii) of this Rule. ``Payment,'' as used in any other section of 
this Rule, means the gross premiums paid or payable for the flexible 
contract, Except, That ``Payment'' shall not include any amount deducted 
by the life insurer to recover excess sales loading previously applied 
to keep the contract in force pursuant to paragraph (b)(13)(iv)(B)(2) of 
this Rule.
    (8)(i) Guideline annual premium means the level annual amount that 
would be payable through the maturity date specified in paragraph 
(c)(8)(ii)(B) of this Rule for the future benefits under the contract 
if, subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(8)(ii) of this Rule:
    (A) The payments were fixed by the life insurer as to both timing 
and amount, and
    (B) The payments were based on the 1980 Commissioners Standard 
Ordinary Mortality Table, net investment earnings at the greater of an 
annual effective rate of 5 per centum or rate or rates guaranteed at 
issuance of the flexible contract, the sales load under the contract, 
and the fees and charges associated with the contract specified in 
parapraphs (c)(4)(iii), (c)(4)(iv), (c)(4)(v), (c)(4)(vi), (c)(4)(vii), 
(c)(4)(viii) (for the first two contract periods as permitted by 
paragraphs (c)(1)(i)), and (c)(4)(x) of this Rule.
    (ii) In computing the future benefits under the flexible contract 
for determining the guideline annual premium:
    (A) The excess of the amount payable by reason of the death of the 
insured (determined without regard to any incidental insurance benefits) 
over the cash value of the contract shall be deemed to be not greater 
than such excess at the time the contract was issued,
    (B) The maturity date shall be the latest maturity date permitted 
under the contract but not less than 20 years after the date of issue or 
(if earlier) age 95, and
    (C) The amount of any endowment benefit (or sum of endowment 
benefits) shall be deemed not to exceed the least amount payable by 
reason of the death of the insured (determined without regard to any 
incidental insurance benefits) at any time under the contract.
    (9) Cash value means the amount that would be available in cash upon 
voluntary termination of a contract by its owner before it becomes 
payable by death or maturity, without regard to any charges that may be 
assessed upon such termination and before deduction of any outstanding 
contract loan.
    (10) Cash surrender value means the amount available in cash upon 
voluntary termination of a contract by its owner before it becomes 
payable by death or maturity, after any charges assessed in connection 
with the termination have been deducted and before deduction of any 
outstanding contract loan.
    (11) Net investment earnings means investment earnings in the 
separate account after deduction of any asset charges, including but not 
limited to, such charges for income tax; brokerage and other investment 
expenses; mortality, expense, and guaranteed death benefit risks; and an 
investment advisory

[[Page 618]]

fee, but not including deductions for sales load. However, ``net 
investment earnings'' as used in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this Rule shall 
not include any amount deducted pursuant to paragraphs (ii) through 
(viii) of paragraph (c)(4).
    (12) Contract processing day means any day on which charges under 
the contract are deducted from the separate account.
    (d) The following computational rules shall be used in applying this 
Rule:
    (1) Paragraphs (b)(13)(i) and (b)(13)(ii) of this Rule shall be 
deemed to be satisfied with respect to any flexible contract under which 
sales load is deducted other than from payments prior to the allocation 
of net payments to the separate account if:
    (i) from issuance of the contract through each contract period, the 
aggregate amount of sales load deducted is not more than the aggregate 
amount of sales load that could be deducted under an otherwise identical 
flexible contract that deducted sales load only from payments prior to 
their allocation to the separate account; and
    (ii)(A) the amount of sales load deducted pursuant to any method 
permitted under this paragraph (other than asset-based sales loads) does 
not exceed the proportionate amount of sales load deducted prior thereto 
pursuant to the same method, unless an increase in such proportionate 
amount is caused by reductions in the annual cost of insurance, or a 
reduction in the sales load deducted from amounts transferred to a 
flexible contract from another plan of insurance; or
    (B) for asset-based sales load structures, the percentage of assets 
taken as sales load does not exceed any of the percentages previously 
taken pursuant to the same method, unless an increase in such percentage 
is caused by a reduction in the percentage taken on amounts transferred 
to a flexible contract from another plan of insurance.
    (2)(i) Solely with respect to increases in or additions of insurance 
benefits requested by a contractholder after issuance of a flexible 
contract, the contract shall be deemed to satisfy paragraphs 
(b)(13)(i)(A), (b)(13)(ii), (b)(13)(v), (b)(13)(viii), and (d)(1)(ii) of 
this Rule, Provided, That from issuance of the contract through each 
contract period the aggregate amount of sales load imposed is not more 
than the aggregate amount of sales load that would be permissible under 
the base test contract, as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this 
Rule, and the incremental test contract, as defined in paragraph 
(d)(2)(iii)(C) of this Rule.
    (ii) The following procedures shall be used in applying paragraph 
(d)(2)(i) of this section:
    (A) Payments for the actual contract, as defined in paragraph 
(d)(2)(iii)(A) of this Rule, and the base and incremental test contracts 
shall, for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the sales load 
provisions of this Rule, be deemed paid in the following proportionate 
amounts: level annual payments for the base test contract equal to the 
guideline annual premium for the contract, commencing upon issuance; 
level annual payments for the incremental test contract equal to the 
difference between the guideline annual premium for the actual contract 
after the increase in or addition of insurance benefits and before such 
increase or addition, commencing upon such increase or addition; and 
level annual payments for the actual contract equal to the guideline 
annual premium for such contract, commencing upon issuance and adjusted 
for such increase or addition as of the date of such increase or 
addition, Provided that the guideline annual premium used is that 
defined in paragraph (c)(8) of this section;
    (B) To the extent that the increases in, or additions of, insurance 
benefits are funded out of cash value, such cash value shall be 
proportionately allocated between the base test contract and incremental 
test contract according to the ratio of their respective guideline 
annual payments, as described in (d)(2)(ii)(A); and
    (C) It is assumed that no redemptions are made under the actual and 
test contracts.
    (D) An incremental test contract may deduct, in any manner permitted 
by this Rule, not more than 50 per centum of the sales load which would 
otherwise be permitted under the base test

[[Page 619]]

contract, and not be subject to the surrender, conversion, and 
withdrawal provisions set forth in paragraphs (b)(13)(v) (A) and (B) and 
(b)(13)(viii) of this Rule, Provided, however, That the increased or 
added benefit will be subject to the surrender, conversion, and 
withdrawal provisions referenced above if more than such 50 per centum 
of sales load is assessed.
    (iii) For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2):
    (A) Actual contract shall mean the flexible contract issued to the 
contractholder, and adjusted for the increase in or addition of 
insurance benefits, as of the date of the increase or addition;
    (B) Base test contract shall mean the actual contract had the 
increase or addition not occurred;
    (C) Incremental test contract shall mean a flexible contract that, 
(1) is issued on the date of the increase or addition, and (2) provides 
insurance benefits identical to the incremental change in insurance 
benefits under the actual contract upon such increase or addition; and
    (D) Any change in insurance benefits which would occur automatically 
under a contract, with or without the opportunity for contractholder 
disapproval, or any change in death benefit operation shall not be 
considered an ``increase in or addition of insurance benefits requested 
by a contractholder'' for purposes of imposing additional sales load.

    (a) A management investment company organized under the laws of 
Canada or any province thereof may obtain an order pursuant to section 
7(d) permitting its registration under the act and the public offering 
of its securities, if otherwise appropriate, upon the filing of an 
application complying with paragraph (b) of this section. All such 
applications will be considered by the Commission pursuant to the 
procedure set forth in Sec. 270.0-5 and other applicable rules. 
Conditions and arrangements proposed by investment companies organized 
under the laws of other countries will be considered by the Commission 
in the light of the special circumstances and local laws involved in 
each case.
    (b) An application filed pursuant to this section shall contain, 
inter alia, the following undertakings and agreements of the applicant:
    (1) Applicant will cause each present and future officer, director, 
investment adviser, principal underwriter and custodian of the applicant 
to enter into an agreement, to be filed by applicant with the Commission 
upon the filing of its registration statement or upon the assumption of 
such office by such person which will provide, among other things, that 
each such person agrees (i) to comply with the applicant's Letters 
Patent (Charter) and By Laws, the act and the rules thereunder, and the 
undertakings and agreements contained in said application insofar as 
applicable to such person; (ii) to do nothing inconsistent with the 
applicant's undertakings and agreements required by this section; (iii) 
that the undertakings enumerated as paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of 
this section constitute representations and inducements to the 
Commission to issue its order in the premises and continue the same in 
effect, as the case may be; (iv) that each such agreement constitutes a 
contract between such person and the applicant and its shareholders with 
the intent that applicant's shareholders shall be beneficiaries of and 
shall have the status of parties to such agreement so as to enable them 
to maintain actions at law or in equity within the United States and 
Canada for any violation thereof. In addition the agreement of each 
officer and director will contain provisions similar to those contained 
in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
    (2) That every agreement and undertaking of the applicant, its 
officers, directors, investment adviser, principal underwriter and 
custodian required by this section (i) constitute inducements to the 
Commission for the issuance and continuance in effect of, and conditions 
to, the Commission's order to be entered under this section; (ii)

[[Page 620]]

a contract among applicant and applicant's shareholders with the same 
intent as set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section; and (iii) 
failure by the applicant or any of the above enumerated persons to 
comply with any such agreement and undertaking, unless permitted by the 
Commission, shall constitute a violation of the order entered under this 
section.
    (3) That the Commission, in its discretion, may revoke its order 
permitting registration of the applicant and the public offering of its 
securities if it shall find after notice and opportunity for hearing 
that there shall have been a violation of such order or the act and may 
determine whether distribution of applicant's assets is necessary or 
appropriate in the interests of investors and may so direct.
    (4) That applicant will perform every action and thing necessary to 
cause and assist the custodian of its assets to distribute the same, or 
the proceeds thereof, if the Commission or a court of competent 
jurisdiction, shall have so directed by a final order.
    (5) That any shareholder of the applicant or the Commission on its 
own motion or on request of shareholders shall have the right to 
initiate a proceeding (i) before the Commission for the revocation of 
the order permitting registration of the applicant or (ii) before a 
court of competent jurisdiction for the liquidation of applicant and a 
distribution of its assets to its shareholders and creditors. Such court 
may enter such order in the event that it shall find, after notice and 
opportunity for hearing that applicant, its officers, directors, 
investment adviser, principal underwriter or custodian shall have 
violated any provision of the act or the Commission's order of 
registration of the applicant.

A court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of paragraphs (b)(4) 
and (5) of this paragraph means the District Court of the United States 
of the district in which the assets of the applicant are maintained.
    (6) That any shareholder of the applicant shall have the right to 
bring suit at law or in equity, in any court of the United States or 
Canada having jurisdiction over applicant, its assets or any of its 
officers or directors to enforce compliance by applicant, its officers 
and directors with any provision of applicant's Charter or By Laws, the 
act and the rules thereunder, or undertakings and agreements required by 
this section, insofar as applicable to such persons. That such court may 
appoint a trustee or receiver of the applicant with all powers necessary 
to implement the purposes of such suit, including the administration of 
the estate, the collection of corporate property including choses-in-
action, and distribution of applicant's assets to its creditors and 
shareholders. That applicant and its officers and directors waive any 
objection they may be entitled to raise and any right they may have to 
object to the power and right of any shareholder of the applicant to 
bring such suit, reserving, however, their right to maintain that they 
have complied with the aforesaid provisions, undertakings and 
agreements, and otherwise to dispute such suit on its merits. Applicant, 
its officers and directors also agree that any final judgment or decree 
of any United States court as aforesaid, may be granted full faith and 
credit by a court of competent jurisdiction of Canada and consent that 
such Canadian court may enter judgment or decree thereon at the instance 
of any shareholder, receiver or trustee of the applicant.
    (7) Applicant will file, and will cause each of its present or 
future directors, officers, or investment advisers who is not a resident 
of the United States to file with the Commission irrevocable designation 
of the applicant's custodian as an agent in the United States to accept 
service of process in any suit, action or proceeding before the 
Commission or any appropriate court to enforce the provisions of the 
acts administered by the Commission, or to enforce any right or 
liability based upon applicant's Charter, By Laws, contracts, or the 
respective undertakings and agreements of any such person required by 
this section, or which alleges a liability on the part of any such 
persons arising out of their service, acts of transactions relating to 
the applicant.

each document is uniform.
    (c) The registration statement or report and, insofar as practicable 
all papers and documents filed as a part thereof, shall be printed, 
lithographed, mimeographed or typewritten. However, the registration

registration statement or report is in a foreign language, it shall be 
accompanied by a translation into the English language.
    (f) Where a registration statement or report is distributed through 
an electronic medium, issuers may satisfy legibility requirements 
applicable to printed documents, such as paper size, type size and font, 
bold-face type, italics and red ink, by presenting all required

    (b) Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to a registered 
closed-end management investment company whose registration statement 
was filed on Form N-2; provided that the following information is 
transmitted to shareholders in its annual report to shareholders:
    (1) If the company offers a dividend reinvestment plan to 
shareholders, information about the plan required to be disclosed in the 
company's prospectus by Item 10.1.e of Form N-2 (17 CFR 274.11a-1);
    (2) Any material changes in the company's investment objectives or

with investment in the company (described in Item 8.3 of Form N-2); and

dividend reinvestment plan by delivering to each shareholder annually a 
separate document containing the information about the plan required to 
be disclosed in the company's prospectus by Item 10.1.e of Form N-2. Any 
such document shall be deemed to be a record or document subject to the 
record-keeping requirements of section 31 (15 U.S.C. 80a-30) and the 
rules adopted thereunder (17 CFR 270.31a-1 et seq.).
    (d) The changes required to be disclosed by paragraphs (b)(2)

    (3) Sale of the security was restricted to a specified, limited 
group of persons and, in accordance with the terms of the security or 
the instruments pursuant to which the security was issued, upon its 
being transferred by the holder to a person not a member of the group 
eligible to purchase the security, the issuer required the surrender of 
the security and paid the redemption price thereof.
    (c) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply

    (1) Deferred sales load shall mean any sales load, including a 
contingent deferred sales load, that is deducted upon redemption or 
annuitization of amounts representing all or a portion of a 
securityholder's interest in a separate account;
    (2) Exchanged security shall include not only the security or 
securities (or portion[s] thereof) of a securityholder actually 
exchanged pursuant to an exchange offer but also any security or 
securities (or portion[s] thereof) of the securityholder previously 
exchanged for the exchanged security or its predecessors;
    (3) Front-end sales load shall mean any sales load that is deducted 
from one or more purchase payments made by a securityholder before they 
are invested in a separate account; and
    (4) Purchase payments made for the acquired security, as used in 
paragraphs (c)(2) and (d)(2) of this section, shall not include any 
purchase payments made for the exchanged security or any appreciation 
attributable to those purchase payments that are transferred to the 
offering account in connection with an exchange.
    (b) Notwithstanding section 11 of the Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-11], any 
registered separate account or any principal underwriter for such an 
account (collectively, the ``offering account'') may make or cause to be 
made an offer to the holder of a security of the offering account, or of 
any other registered separate account having the same insurance company 
depositor or sponsor as the offering account or having an insurance 
company depositor or sponsor that is an affiliate of the offering 
account's depositor or sponsor, to exchange his security (or portion 
thereof) (the ``exchanged security'') for a security (or portion 
thereof) of the offering account (the ``acquired security'') without the 
terms of such exchange offer first having been submitted to and approved 
by the Commission, as provided below:
    (1) If the securities (or portions thereof) involved are variable 
annuity contracts, then
    (i) The exchange must be made on the basis of the relative net asset 
values of the securities to be exchanged, except that the offering 
account may deduct at the time of the exchange
    (A) An administrative fee which is disclosed in the part of the 
offering account's registration statement under

[[Page 633]]

the Securities Act of 1933 relating to the prospectus, and
    (B) Any front-end sales load permitted by paragraph (c) of this 
section, and
    (ii) Any deferred sales load imposed on the acquired security by the 
offering account shall be calculated in the manner prescribed by 
paragraph (d) or (e) of this section; or
    (2) If the securities (or portions thereof) involved are variable 
life insurance contracts offered by a separate account registered under 
the Act as a unit investment trust, then the exchange must be made on 
the basis of the relative net asset values of the securities to be 
exchanged, except that the offering account may deduct at the time of 
the exchange an administrative fee which is disclosed in the part of the 
offering account's registration statement under the Securities Act of 
1933 relating to the prospectus.
    (c) If the offering account imposes a front-end sales load on the 
acquired security, then such sales load
    (1) Shall be a percentage that is no greater than the excess of the 
rate of the front-end sales load otherwise applicable to that security 
over the rate of any front-end sales load previously paid on the 
exchanged security, and
    (2) Shall not exceed 9 percent of the sum of the purchase payments 
made for the acquired security and the exchanged security.
    (d) If the offering account imposes a deferred sales load on the 
acquired security and the exchanged security was also subject to a 
deferred sales load, then any deferred sales load imposed on the 
acquired security:
    (1) Shall be calulated as if
    (i) The holder of the acquired security had been the holder of that 
security from the date on which he became the holder of the exchanged 
security and
    (ii) Purchase payments made for the exchanged security had been made 
for the acquired security on the date on which they were made for the 
exchanged security; and
    (2) Shall not exceed 9 percent of the sum of the purchase payments 
made for the acquired security and the exchanged security.
    (e) If the offering account imposes a deferred sales load on the 
acquired security and a front-end sales load was paid on the exchanged 
security, then any deferred sales load imposed on the acquired security 
may not be imposed on purchase payments made for the exchanged security 
or any appreciation attributable to purchase payments made for the 
exchanged security that are transferred in connection with the exchange.
    (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no offer of exchange shall be 
made in reliance on this section if both a front-end sales load and a 
deferred sales load are to be imposed on the acquired security or if 
both such sales loads are imposed on the exchanged security.

of the costs incurred in connection with exchanges for a period of not

The records preserved under this provision shall be subject to 
inspection by the Commission in accordance with section 31(b) of the Act 
(15 U.S.C. 80a-30(b)) as if such records were records required to be

to exchange that security for a security of the offering company;
    (7) Redemption fee means any fee (other than a sales load, deferred

    (b) Nothwithstanding section 11(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-11(a)),

uniformly to all securityholders of the class specified;
    (2) Any redemption fee charged with respect to the exchanged

the fee is charged;
    (3) No deferred sales load is imposed on the exchanged security at 
the time of an exchange;
    (4) Any sales load charged with respect to the acquired security is 
a percentage that is no greater than the excess, if any, of the rate of 
the sales load applicable to that security in the absence of an exchange 
over the sum of the rates of all sales loads previously paid on the 
exchanged security, Provided that:
    (i) The percentage rate of any sales load charged when the acquired 
security is redeemed, that is solely the result of a deferred sales load 
imposed on the exchanged security, may be no greater than the excess, if 
any, of the applicable rate of such sales load, calculated in accordance 
with paragraph (b)(5) of this section, over the sum of the rates of all 
sales loads previously paid on the acquired security, and
    (ii) In no event may the sum of the rates of all sales loads imposed 
prior to and at the time the acquired security is redeemed, including 
any sales load paid or to be paid with respect to the exchanged

absence of an exchange to the security (exchanged or acquired) with the 
highest such rate;
    (5) Any deferred sales load charged at the time the acquired 
security is redeemed is calculated as if the holder of the acquired 
security had held that security from the date on which he became the 
holder of the exchanged security, Provided that:
    (i) The time period during which the acquired security is held need 
not be included when the amount of the deferred sales load is 
calculated, if the deferred sales load is

[[Page 635]]

    (A) reduced by the amount of any fees collected on the acquired 
security under the terms of any plan of distribution adopted in 
accordance with rule 12b-1 under the Act (17 CFR 270.12b-1) (a ``12b-1 
plan''), and
    (B) Solely the result of a sales load imposed on the exchanged 
security, and no other sales loads, including deferred sales loads, are 
imposed with respect to the acquired security,
    (ii) The time period during which the exchanged security is held 
need not be included when the amount of the deferred sales load on the 
acquired security is calculated, if
    (A) The deferred sales load is reduced by the amount of any fees 
previously collected on the exchanged security under the terms of any 
12b-1 plan, and
    (B) The exchanged security was not subject to any sales load, and
    (iii) The holding periods in this subsection may be computed as of 
the end of the calendar month in which a security was purchased or 
redeemed;
    (6) The prospectus of the offering company discloses
    (i) The amount of any administrative or redemption fee imposed on an 
exchange transaction for its securities, as well as the amount of any 
administrative or redemption fee imposed on its securityholders to 
acquire the securities of other investment companies in an exchange 
transaction, and
    (ii) If the offering company reserves the right to change the terms 
of or terminate an exchange offer, that the exchange offer is subject to 
termination and its terms are subject to change;
    (7) Any sales literature or advertising that mentions the existence 
of the exchange offer also discloses
    (i) The existence of any administrative fee or redemption fee that 
would be imposed at the time of an exchange; and
    (ii) If the offering company reserves the right to change the terms 
of or terminate the exchange offer, that the exchange offer is subject 
to termination and its terms are subject to change;
    (8) Whenever an exchange offer is to be terminated or its terms are 
to be amended materially, any holder of a security subject to that offer 
shall be given prominent notice of the impending termination or 
amendment at least 60 days prior to the date of termination or the 
effective date of the amendment, Provided that:
    (i) No such notice need be given if the only material effect of an 
amendment is to reduce or eliminate an administrative fee, sales load or 
redemption fee payable at the time of an exchange, and
    (ii) No notice need be given if, under extraordinary circumstances, 
either
    (A) There is a suspension of the redemption of the exchanged 
security under section 22(e) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-22(e)] and the 
rules and regulations thereunder, or
    (B) The offering company temporarily delays or ceases the sale of 
the acquired security because it is unable to invest amounts effectively 
in accordance with applicable investment objectives, policies and 
restrictions; and
    (9) In calculating any sales load charged with respect to the 
acquired security:
    (i) If a securityholder exchanges less than all of his securities, 
the security upon which the highest sales load rate was previously paid 
is deemed exchanged first; and
    (ii) If the exchanged security was acquired through reinvestment of 
dividends or capital gains distributions, that security is deemed to 
have been sold with a sales load rate equal to the sales load rate 
previously paid on the security on which the dividend was paid or 
distribution made.
    (c) If either no sales load is imposed on the acquired security or 
the sales load imposed is less than the maximum allowed by paragraph 
(b)(4) of this section, the offering company may require the exchanging 
securityholder to have held the exchanged security for a minimum period 
of time previously established by the offering company and applied 
uniformly to all securityholders of the class specified.
    (d) Any offering company that has previously made an offer of 
exchange may continue to impose fees or sales loads permitted by an 
order under section 11(a) of the Act upon shares purchased before the 
earlier of (1) One year after the effective date of this section, or (2) 
When the offer has been brought into compliance with the terms of this

[[Page 636]]

section, and upon shares acquired through reinvestment of dividends or 
capital gains distributions based on such shares, until such shares are 
redeemed.
    (e) Any offering company that has previously made an offer of 
exchange cannot rely on this section to amend such prior offer unless
    (1) The offering company's prospectus disclosed, during at least the 
two year period prior to the amendment of the offer (or, if the fund is 
less than two years old, at all times the offer has been outstanding) 
that the terms of the offer were subject to change, or
    (2) The only effect of such change is to reduce or eliminate an 
administrative fee, sales load or redemption fee payable at the time of 
an exchange.

furnish, such information as may reasonably be necessary to an informed 
determination of whether such plan should be implemented or continued; 
in fulfilling their duties under this paragraph the directors should 
consider and give appropriate weight to all pertinent factors, and

provides for any action to be taken with respect to a plan, that action 
must be taken separately for each class, provided, however, that under 
Sec. 270.18f-3(e)(2), any shareholder vote on a plan of a target class 
must also require a vote of any purchase class.

company, or any company or companies controlled by such registered 
investment company (``acquiring company'') may acquire any security

percent or less of its gross revenues from securities related activities 
unless the acquiring company would control such person after the 
acquisition.
    (b) Notwithstanding section 12(d)(3) of the Act, an acquiring 
company may acquire any security issued by a person that, in its most 
recent fiscal year, derived more than 15 percent of its gross revenues 
from securities related activities, provided that:
    (1) Immediately after the acquisition of any equity security, the 
acquiring company owns not more than five percent of the outstanding

    (2) An issuer's gross revenues from its own securities related 
activities and from its ratable share of the securities related 
activities of enterprises of which it owns 20 percent or more of the 
voting or equity interest should be considered in determining the degree 
to which an issuer is engaged in securities related activities. Such 
information may be obtained from the issuer's annual report to 
shareholders, the issuer's annual reports or registration statement 
filed with the Commission, or the issuer's chief financial officer.
    (3) Equity security is as defined in Sec. 240.3a-11 of this chapter.
    (4) Debt security includes all securities other than equity

    (6) Where an acquiring company is considering acquiring or has 
acquired options, warrants, rights, or convertible securities of a 
securities related business, the determination required by paragraph (b)

acquisition of securities of a securities related business:
    (i) Receipt of stock dividends on securities acquired in compliance 
with this section;

with this section; and
    (v) Acquisition of Puts, as defined in Sec. 270.2a-7(a)(16), 
provided that, immediately after the acquisition of any Put, the company 
will not, with respect to 75 percent of the total value of its assets, 
have invested more than ten percent of the total value of its assets in 
securities underlying Puts from the same institution. For the purposes 
of this section, a Put will be considered to be from the party to whom 
the company will look for payment of the exercise price.
    (8) Any class or series of an investment company that issues two or 
more classes or series of preferred or special stock, each of which is 
preferred over

[[Page 639]]

all other classes or series with respect to assets specifically 
allocated to that class or series, shall be treated as if it is a 
registered investment company.

requirements prescribed in Investment Company Act Release No. 13005 
(Feb. 2, 1983) with respect to repurchase agreements with brokers or

date of its execution shall be deemed to have been specifically approved 
at least annually by the board of directors or by a vote of a majority

if such approval occurs:
    (1) With respect to the first continuance of a contract, during the

(ii) the second anniversary of the date upon which such contract was 
executed; or
    (2) With respect to any subsequent continuance of a contract, during 
the 90 days prior to and including the first anniversary of the date 
upon which the most recent previous annual continuance of such contract 
became effective.
    (b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply 
to any continuance of a contract which shall have been approved not 
later than 90 days after the date of adoption of this section, provided 
that such contract shall expire, by its terms, not later than 17 months 
from the date of adoption of this section.

    Note: This section does not establish the exclusive method of 
complying with the Act. It provides one procedure by which a registered 
investment company may comply with the applicable provisions of sections 
15(a) and 15(b) of the Act; it does not preclude any other appropriate 
procedure. Any annual continuance of a contract approved in accordance 
with the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of Sec. 270.15a-2 will 
constitute a renewal of such contract for the purposes of section 15(c) 
of the Act, and therefore such renewal must be approved by the

    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, all such 
securities and similar investments shall be deposited in the safekeeping 
of, or in a vault or other depository maintained by, a bank or other 
company whose functions and physical facilities are supervised by 
Federal or State authority. Investments so deposited shall be physically 
segregated at all times from those of any other person and shall be 
withdrawn only in connection with transactions of the character 
described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) The first sentence of paragraph (b) of this section shall not 
apply to securities on loan which are collateralized to the extent of 
their full market value, or to securities hypothecated, pledged, or 
placed in escrow for the account of such investment company in 
connection with a loan or other transaction authorized by specific 
resolution of its board of directors, or to securities in transit in 
connection with the sale, exchange, redemption, maturity or conversion, 
the exercise of warrants or rights, assents to changes in terms of the

    (d) Except as otherwise provided by law, no person shall be 
authorized or permitted to have access to the securities and similar 
investments deposited in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section 
except pursuant to a resolution of the board of directors of such 
investment company. Each such resolution shall designate not more than 
five persons who shall be either officers or responsible employees of 
such company and shall provide that access to such investments shall be 
had only by two or more such persons jointly, at least one of whom shall 
be an officer; except that access to such investments shall be permitted 
(1) to properly authorized officers and employees of the bank or other 
company in whose safekeeping the investments are placed and (2) for the 
purpose of paragraph (f) of this section to the independent public 
accountant jointly with any two persons so designated or with such 
officer or employee of such bank or such other company. Such investments

its authorized employees or agents accompanied, unless otherwise 
directed by order of the Commission, by one or more of the persons 
designated pursuant to this paragraph.
    (e) Each person when depositing such securities or similar 
investments in or withdrawing them from the depository or when ordering

order which shall show (1) the date and time of the deposit, withdrawal 
or order, (2) the title and amount of the securities or other 
investments deposited, withdrawn or ordered to be withdrawn, and an 
identification thereof by certificate numbers or otherwise, (3) the 
manner of acquisition of the securities or similar investments deposited 
or the purpose for which they have been withdrawn, or ordered to be 
withdrawn, and (4) if withdrawn and delivered to another person the name 
of such person. Such notation shall be transmitted promptly to an 
officer or director of the investment company designated by its board of 
directors who shall not be a person designated for the purpose of 
paragraph (d) of this section. Such notation shall be on serially 
numbered forms and shall be preserved for at least one year.
    (f) Such securities and similar investments shall be verified by 
actual examination by an independent public accountant retained by the 
investment company at least three times during each fiscal year, at 
least two of which shall be chosen by such accountant without prior 
notice to such company. A certificate of such accountant stating that an 
examination of such securities and investments has been made, and 
describing the nature and extent of the examination, shall be attached 
to a completed Form N-17f-2 (17 CFR 274.220) and transmitted to the

Sec. 270.17f-4  Deposits of securities in securities depositories.

    (a) For the purpose of this rule, a ``securities depository'' is a 
system for the central handling of securities where all securities of 
any particular class or series of any issuer deposited within the system 
are treated as fungible and may be transferred or pledged by bookkeeping 
entry without physical delivery of the securities.
    (b) A registered management investment company (investment company) 
or any qualified custodian may deposit all or any part of the securities 
owned by the investment company in a foreign securities depository or 
clearing

[[Page 652]]

agency in accordance with Sec. 270.17f-5 (rule 17f-5) or in:
    (1) A clearing agency registered with the Commission under section 
17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (clearing agency), which acts 
as a securities depository, or
    (2) The book-entry system as provided in subpart O of Treasury 
Circular No. 300, 31 CFR part 306, subpart B of 31 CFR part 350, and the 
book-entry regulations of Federal agencies substantially in the form of 
subpart O, in accordance with the following paragraphs of this section.
    (c) An investment company may deposit the securities in a clearing 
agency which acts as a securities depository under an arrangement that 
contains the following elements:
    (1) The investment company has a system that is reasonably designed 
to prevent unauthorized officer's instructions and which provides, at 
least, for the form, content, and means of giving, recording, and 
reviewing the instructions. An ``officer's instruction'' is a request or 
direction to a clearing agency in the name of the investment company by 
one or more persons authorized by its board of directors to give it.
    (2) Upon ceasing to act for an investment company, and subject to 
its own rules on contributions to a participants fund, the clearing 
agency shall deliver all securities held for the investment company to a 
successor clearing agency, custodian, or safekeeper under Rule 17f-2 (17 
CFR 270.17f-2), to be named by the investment company. Where the 
investment company has not named one, the clearing agency shall deliver 
the investment company securities to a bank having the qualifications 
prescribed in section 26(a)(1) of the Act for trustees of unit 
investment trusts, to be held by the bank as custodian for the 
investment company under terms customary to a custodian agreement 
between banks and investment companies.
    (3) The investment company, by resolution of its board of directors, 
initially approved the arrangement, and any subsequent changes thereto.
    (d) The custodian may deposit the securities in a clearing agency 
which acts as a securities depository or the book-entry system, or both, 
under an arrangement that contains the following elements:
    (1) The custodian may deposit the securities directly or through one 
or more agents which are also qualified to act as custodians for 
investment companies.
    (2) The custodian (or its agent) shall deposit the securities in an 
account that includes only assets held by it for customers.
    (3) The custodian shall send the investment company a confirmation 
of any transfers to or from the account of the investment company. Where 
securities are transferred to that account, the custodian shall also, by 
book-entry or otherwise, identify as belonging to the investment company 
a quantity of securities in a fungible bulk of securities (i) registered 
in the name of the custodian (or its nominee) or (ii) shown on the 
custodian's account on the books of the clearing agency, the book-entry 
system, or the custodian's agent. for this purpose, the term 
``confirmation'' means advice or notice of a transaction; it is not 
intended to require preparation by a custodian of the confirmation 
required of broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
    (4) The custodian, or its agent which deposits the securities, shall 
promptly send to the investment company reports it receives from the 
appropriate Federal Reserve Bank or clearing agency on its respective 
system of internal accounting control. The custodian and all the agents 
through which the securities are deposited shall send to the investment 
company such reports on their own systems of internal accounting control 
as the investment company may reasonably request from time to time.
    (5) The investment company, by resolution of its board of directors, 
initially approved the arrangement, and any subsequent changes thereto.

best interests of the company and its shareholders.
    (4) Where a majority of directors has determined that a foreign 
custodian may no longer be considered eligible under the rule or that

the best interests of the company and its shareholders, the company must 
withdraw its assets from the care of that custodian as soon as 
reasonably practicable, and in any event within 180 days of the date 
when the directors made the determination.
    (b) Any management investment company, incorporated or organized 
under the laws of Canada and registered under the Act pursuant to the

securities, cash and cash equivalents in the care of an overseas branch 
of a qualified U.S. bank, Provided That:
    (1) Prior to the placing of any such assets with such overseas 
branch, a majority of the board of directors of the company shall have 
determined that maintaining such assets in a particular country or 
countries is consistent with the best interests of the company and its 
shareholders;
    (2) The board of directors establishes a system to monitor such 
foreign custody arrangements and to ensure that the amount of cash and 
cash equivalents maintained in the care of such overseas branch is 
limited to an amount reasonably necessary to effect the company's 
foreign securities transactions; and
    (3) A majority of the board of directors, at least annually, reviews

    \1\ See Investment Company Act Release No. 13724, January 17, 1984.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. With respect to the selection of the country where the company's 
assets will be maintained, the directors of U.S. and Canadian investment 
companies should consider:
    a. Whether applicable foreign law would restrict the access afforded 
the company's independent public accountants to books and records kept 
by an eligible foreign custodian located in that country;
    b. Whether applicable foreign law would restrict the company's 
ability to recover its

[[Page 655]]

assets in the event of the bankruptcy of an eligible foreign custodian 
located in that country;
    c. Whether applicable foreign law would restrict the company's 
ability to recover assets that are lost while under the control of an 
eligible foreign custodian located in the country;
    d. The likelihood of expropriation, nationalization, freezes, or 
confiscation of the company's assets; and
    e. Whether difficulties in converting the company's cash and cash 
equivalents to U.S. dollars are reasonably foreseeable;
    2. With respect to the selection of a foreign custodian, the 
directors of a U.S. investment company should consider:
    a. The financial strength of the foreign custodian, its general 
reputation and standing in the country in which it is located, its 
ability to provide efficiently the custodial services required and the 
relative cost for those services.
    b. Whether the foreign custodian would provide a level of safeguards 
for maintaining the company's assets not materially different from that 
provided by the company's U.S. custodian in maintaining the company's 
securities in the United States;
    c. Whether the foreign custodian has branch offices in the United 
States in order to facilitate the assertion of jurisdiction over and 
enforcement of judgments against such costodian; and
    d. In the case of a foreign securities depository, the number of 
participants in, and operating history of, the depository.
    3. The extent of a U.S. or Canadian company's exposure to loss and 
the potential effect thereof upon shareholders should be disclosed, if 
material, in the company's prospectus.

Sec. 270.17j-1  Certain unlawful acts, practices, or courses of business and requirements relating to codes of ethics with respect to registered investment 
          companies.

    (a) It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person of or principal 
underwriter for a registered investment company, or any affiliated 
person of an investment adviser of or principal underwriter for a 
registered investment company in connection with the purchase or sale, 
directly or indirectly, by such person of a security held or to be 
acquired, as defined in this section, by such registered investment 
company:

registered investment company;

made, not misleading;
    (3) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which 
operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any such registered 
investment company; or
    (4) To engage in any manipulative practice with respect to such 
registered investment company.
    (b)(1) Every registered investment company, and each investment 
adviser of or principal underwriter for such investment company, shall 
adopt a written code of ethics containing provisions reasonably 
necessary to prevent its access persons from engaging in any act, 
practice, or course of business prohibited by paragraph (a) of this 
section and shall use reasonable diligence, and institute procedures 
reasonably necessary, to prevent violations of such code.
    (2) The requirements of paragraph (b)(1) shall not apply to any 
underwriter (i) which is not an affiliated person of the registered

information described in paragraph (c)(2) with respect to transactions 
in any security in which such access person has, or by reason of such 
transaction acquires, any direct or indirect beneficial ownership in the 
security: Provided, however, That any such report may contain a 
statement that the report shall not be construed as an admission by the 
person making such report that he or she has any direct or indirect 
beneficial ownership in the security to which the report relates. For 
purposes of this section, beneficial ownership shall be interpreted in 
the same manner as it would be in determining whether a person is 
subject to the provisions of section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78p] and the rules and regulations thereunder, except 
that the determination of direct or indirect beneficial ownership shall 
apply to all securities which the access person has or acquires.

shall be required to make a report:
    (i) With respect to transactions effected for any account over which 
such person does not have any direct or indirect influence or control;
    (ii) If such person is not an ``interested person'' of a registered 
investment company within the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the Act [15 
U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(19)], and would be required to make such a report solely 
by reason of being a director to make such a report solely by reason of 
being a director of such investment company, except where such director 
knew or, in the ordinary course of fulfilling his official duties as a 
director of the registered investment company, should have known that 
during the 15-day period immediately preceding or after the date of the 
transaction in a security by the director such security is or was 
purchased or sold by such investment company or such purchase or sale by 
such investment company is or was considered by the investment company 
or its investment adviser;
    (iii) Where the principal underwriter, as to which such person is an 
access person, (A) is not an affiliated person of the registered 
investment company or any investment adviser of such investment company, 
and (B) has no officers, directors, or general partners who serve as 
officers, directors or general partners of such investment company or

CFR 275.204-2(a)(12) and 275.204-2(a)(13)] under the Investment Advisers 
Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80b-1, et seq.].
    (4) Each registered investment company, investment adviser and 
principal underwriter to which reports are required to be made pursuant 
to this section shall identify all access persons who are under a duty 
to make such reports to it and shall inform such persons of such duty.
    (d) Each registered investment company, investment adviser and 
principal underwriter which is required to adopt a code of ethics or to 
which reports are required to be made by access persons shall, at its 
principal place of business, maintain records in the manner and to the 
extent set forth below, and make such records available to the 
Commission or any representative thereof at any time and from time to 
time for reasonable periodic, special or other examination.
    (1) A copy of each such code of ethics which is, or at any time 
within the past five years has been, in effect shall be preserved in an 
easily accessible place;
    (2) A record of any violation of such code of ethics, and of any 
action taken as a result of such violation, shall be preserved in an 
easily accessible place for a period of not less than five years 
following the end of the fiscal year in which the violation occurs;
    (3) A copy of each report made by an access person pursuant to this 
rule shall be preserved for a period of not less than five years from 
the end of the fiscal year in which it is made, the first two years in 
an easily accessible place; and

the purchase or sale of securities.
    (iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (e)(1)(i), where

clients, the term ``access person'' shall mean: any director, officer, 
general partner, or advisory person of the investment adviser who, with 
respect to any registered investment company, makes any recommendation, 
participates in the determination of which recommendation shall be made, 
or whose principal function or duties relate to the determination of 
which recommendation shall be made to any registered investment company; 
or who, in connection with his duties, obtains any information 
concerning securities recommendations being made by such investment 
adviser to any registered investment company.
    (iv) An investment adviser is ``primarily engaged in a business or 
businesses other than advising registered investment companies or other 
advisory clients'' when, for each of its most recent three fiscal years 
or for the period of time since its organization, whichever is lesser, 
the investment adviser derived, on an unconsolidated basis, more than 50 
percent of (A) its total sales and revenues, and (B) its income (or 
loss) before income taxes and extraordinary items from such other 
business or businesses.

to such purchases or sales; and
    (ii) Any natural person in a control relationship to such company or 
investment adviser who obtains information concerning recommendations 
made to such company with regard to the purchase or sale of a security.
    (3) Control shall have the same meaning as that set forth in section 
2(a)(9) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(9)].
    (4) Purchase or sale of a security includes, inter alia, the writing 
of an option to purchase or sell a security.
    (5) Security shall have the meaning set forth in section 2(a)(36) of 
the Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(36)], except that it shall not include 
securities issued by the Government of the United States, bankers' 
acceptances, bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper and shares 
of registered open-end investment companies.

a majority is required by State law or otherwise, such requirement shall 
apply.
    (2) If any class or series of securities of a series company fails 
to approve an investment advisory contract in the manner required by 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the investment adviser of such company 
may continue to serve or act in such capacity for the period of time 
pending such required approval of such contract, of a new contract with 
the same or different adviser, or other definitive action: Provided, 
That the compensation received by such investment adviser during such 
period is equal to no more than its actual costs incurred in furnishing 
investment advisory services to such class or series or the amount it 
would have received under the advisory contract, whichever is less.
    (d) With respect to the submission of a change in investment policy 
to the holders of the outstanding voting securities of a series company

holders of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of any other 
class or series affected by such matter, and (2) that such matter has

company required by applicable State law or other applicable 
requirement, or (ii) the minimum vote specified by paragraph (1) of this 
paragraph (h), unless State law requires approval of such matters by a

Sec. 270.18f-3  Multiple class companies.

    Notwithstanding sections 18(f)(1) and 18(i) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 
80a-18(f)(1) and (i), respectively), a registered open-end management 
investment company or series or class thereof established in accordance 
with section 18(f)(2) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-18(f)(2)) whose shares 
are registered on Form N-1A [Secs. 239.15A and 274.11A of this chapter] 
(``company'') may issue more than one class of voting stock, provided 
that:
    (a) Each class:
    (1)(i) Shall have a different arrangement for shareholder services 
or the distribution of securities or both, and shall pay all of the 
expenses of that arrangement;
    (ii) May pay a different share of other expenses, not including 
advisory or custodial fees or other expenses related to the management 
of the company's assets, if these expenses are actually incurred in a 
different amount by that class, or if the class receives services of a 
different kind or to a different degree than other classes; and
    (iii) May pay a different advisory fee to the extent that any 
difference in amount paid is the result of the application of the same 
performance fee provisions in the advisory contract of the company to 
the different investment performance of each class;
    (2) Shall have exclusive voting rights on any matter submitted to 
shareholders that relates solely to its arrangement;
    (3) Shall have separate voting rights on any matter submitted to 
shareholders in which the interests of one class differ from the 
interests of any other class; and
    (4) Shall have in all other respects the same rights and obligations 
as each other class.
    (b) Expenses may be waived or reimbursed by the company's adviser, 
underwriter, or any other provider of services to the company.
    (c) Income, realized and unrealized capital gains and losses, and 
expenses of the company not allocated to a particular class pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section:
    (1) Except as permitted in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, shall 
be allocated to each class on the basis of the net asset value of that 
class in relation to the net asset value of the company; or
    (2) For companies operating under Sec. 270.2a-7 (including the 
provision allowing the calculation of net assets on an amortized cost 
basis), and for other companies declaring distributions of net 
investment income daily that maintain the same net asset value per share 
in each class, may be allocated:
    (i) To each share without regard to class, provided that the company 
has received undertakings from its adviser, underwriter or any other 
provider of services to the company, agreeing to waive or reimburse the 
company for payments to such service provider by one or more classes, as 
allocated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, to the extent 
necessary to assure that all classes of the company maintain the same 
net asset value per share; or
    (ii) On the basis of relative net assets (settled shares). For 
purposes of this section, ``relative net assets (settled shares)'' are 
net assets valued in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles but excluding the value of subscriptions receivable, in 
relation to the net assets of the company.
    (d) Any payments made under paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
made pursuant to a written plan setting forth the separate arrangement 
and expense allocation of each class, and any related conversion 
features or exchange privileges. Before the first issuance of a share of 
any class in reliance upon this section, and before any material 
amendment of a plan, a majority of the directors of the company, and a 
majority of the directors who are not interested persons of the company, 
shall find that the plan as proposed to be adopted or amended, including 
the expense allocation, is in the best interests of each class 
individually and the

[[Page 665]]

company as a whole; initial board approval of a plan under this 
paragraph (d) is not required, however, if the plan does not make any 
change in the arrangements and expense allocations previously approved 
by the board under an existing order of exemption. Before any vote on 
the plan, the directors shall request and evaluate, and any agreement 
relating to a class arrangement shall require the parties thereto to 
furnish, such information as may be reasonably necessary to evaluate the 
plan.
    (e) Nothing in this section prohibits a company from offering any 
class with:
    (1) An exchange privilege providing that securities of the class may 
be exchanged for certain securities of another company; or
    (2) A conversion feature providing that shares of one class of the 
company (the ``purchase class'') will be exchanged automatically for 
shares of another class of the company (the ``target class'') after a 
specified period of time, provided that:
    (i) The conversion is effected on the basis of the relative net 
asset values of the two classes without the imposition of any sales 
load, fee, or other charge;
    (ii) The expenses, including payments authorized under a plan 
adopted pursuant to Sec. 270.12b-1 (``rule 12b-1 plan''), for the target 
class are not higher than the expenses, including payments authorized 
under a rule 12b-1 plan, for the purchase class; and
    (iii) If the amount of expenses, including payments authorized under 
a rule 12b-1 plan, for the target class is increased materially without 
approval of the shareholders of the purchase class, the fund will 
establish a new target class for the purchase class on the same terms as 
applied to the target class before that increase.
    (3) A conversion feature providing that shares of a class in which 
an investor is no longer eligible to participate may be converted to 
shares of a class in which that investor is eligible to participate, 
provided that:
    (i) The investor is given prior notice of the proposed conversion; 
and
    (ii) The conversion is effected on the basis of the relative net 
asset values of the two classes without the imposition of any sales 
load, fee, or other charge.

<R05>
Sec. 270.19a-1   Written statement to accompany dividend payments by management companies.

    (a) Every written statement made pursuant to section 19 by or on 
behalf of a management company shall be made on a separate paper and 
shall clearly indicate what portion of the payment per share is made 
from the following sources:
    (1) Net income for the current or preceding fiscal year, or 
accumulated undistributed net income, or both, not including in either 
case profits or losses from the sale of securities or other properties.
    (2) Accumulated undistributed net profits from the sale of 
securities or other properties (except that an open-end company may 
treat as a separate source its net profits from such sales during its 
current fiscal year).
    (3) Paid-in surplus or other capital source.

To the extent that a payment is properly designated as being made from a 
source specified in paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section, it need 
not be designated as having been made from a source specified in this 
paragraph.
    (b) If the payment is made in whole or in part from a source 
specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section the written statement 
shall indicate, after giving effect to the part of such payment so 
specified, the deficit, if any, in the aggregate of (1) accumulated 
undistributed realized profits less losses on the sale of securities or 
other properties and (2) the net unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
of portfolio securities, all as of a date reasonably close to the end of 
the period as of which the dividend is paid. Any statement made pursuant 
to the preceding sentence shall specify the amount, if any, of such 
deficit which represents unrealized depreciation of portfolio 
securities.
    (c) Accumulated undistributed net income and accumulated 
undistributed net profits from the sale of securities or other 
properties shall be determined, at the option of the company,

[[Page 666]]

either (1) from the date of the organization of the company, (2) from 
the date of a reorganization, as defined in clause (A) or (B) of section 
2(a)(33) of the Act (54 Stat. 790; 15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(33)), (3) from the 
date as of which a write-down of portfolio securities was made in 
connection with a corporate readjustment, approved by stockholders, of 
the type known as ``quasi- reorganization,'' or (4) from January 1, 
1925, to the close of the period as of which the dividend is paid, 
without giving effect to such payment.
    (d) For the purpose of this section, open-end companies which upon 
the sale of their shares allocate to undistributed income or other 
similar account that portion of the consideration received which 
represents the approximate per share amount of undistributed net income 
included in the sales price, and make a corresponding deduction from 
undistributed net income upon the purchase or redemption of shares, need 
not treat the amounts so allocated as paid-in surplus or other capital 
source.
    (e) For the purpose of this section, the source or sources from 
which a dividend is paid shall be determined (or reasonably estimated) 
to the close of the period as of which it is paid without giving effect 
to such payment. If any such estimate is subsequently ascertained to be 
inaccurate in a significant amount, a correction thereof shall be made 
by a written statement pursuant to section 19(a) of the Act or in the 
first report to stockholders following discovery of the inaccuracy.
    (f) Insofar as a written statement made pursuant to section 19(a) of 
the Act relates to a dividend on preferred stock paid for a period of 
less than a year, a company may elect to indicate only that portion of 
the payment which is made from sources specified in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section, and need not specify the sources from which the remainder 
was paid. Every company which in any fiscal year elects to make a 
statement pursuant to the preceding sentence shall transmit to the 
holders of such preferred stock, at a date reasonably near the end of 
the last dividend period in such fiscal year, a statement meeting the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section on an annual basis.
    (g) The purpose of this section, in the light of which it shall be 
construed, is to afford security holders adequate disclosure of the 
sources from which dividend payments are made. Nothing in this section 
shall be construed to prohibit the inclusion in any written statement of 
additional information in explanation of the information required by 
this section. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit a 
dividend payment in violation of any State law or to prevent compliance 
with any requirement of State law regarding dividends consistent with 
this rule.

Sec. 270.19b-1   Frequency of distribution of capital gains.

    (a) No registered investment company which is a ``regulated 
investment company'' as defined in section 851 of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986 (``Code'') shall distribute more than one capital gain 
dividend (``distribution''), as defined in section 852(b)(3)(C) of the 
Code, with respect to any one taxable year of the company, other than a 
distribution otherwise permitted by this rule or made pursuant to 
section 855 of the Code which is supplemental to the prior distribution 
with respect to the same taxable year of the company and which does not 
exceed 10% of the aggregate amount distributed for such taxable year.
    (b) No registered investment company which is not a ``regulated 
investment company'' as defined in section 851 of the Code shall make 
more than one distribution of long-term capital gains, as defined in the 
Code, in any one taxable year of the company: Provided, That a unit 
investment trust may distribute capital gain dividends received from a 
``regulated investment company'' within a reasonable time after receipt.
    (c) The provisions of this rule shall not apply to a unit investment 
trust (hereinafter referred to as the ``Trust'')

[[Page 667]]

engaged exclusively in the business of investing in eligible trust 
securities (as defined in Rule 14a-3(b) (17 CFR 270.14a-3(b)) under this 
Act); Provided, That:
    (1) The capital gain distribution is a result of--
    (i) An issuer's calling or redeeming an eligible trust security held 
by the Trust,
    (ii) The sale of an eligible trust security by the Trust to provide 
funds for redemption of Trust units when the amount received by the 
Trust for such sale exceeds the amount required to satisfy the 
redemption distribution,
    (iii) The sale of an eligible trust security to maintain 
qualification of the Trust as a ``regulated investment company'' under 
section 851 of the Code,
    (iv) Regular distributions of principal and prepayment of principal 
on eligible trust securities, or
    (v) The sale of an eligible trust security in order to maintain the 
investment stability of the Trust; and
    (2) Capital gains distributions are clearly described as such in a 
report to the unitholder which accompanies each such distribution.
    (d) For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, sales made to 
maintain the investment stability of the Trust means sales made to 
prevent deterioration of the value of the eligible trust securities held 
in the Trust portfolio when one or more of the following factors exist:
    (1) A default in the payment of principal or interest on an eligible 
trust security;
    (2) An action involving the issuer of an eligible trust security 
which adversely affects the ability of such issuer to continue payment 
of principal or interest on its eligible trust securities; or
    (3) A change in market, revenue or credit factors which adversely 
affects the ability of such issuer to continue payment of principal or 
interest on its eligible trust securities.
    (e) If a registered investment company because of unforeseen 
circumstances in a particular taxable year proposes to make a 
distribution which would be prohibited by the provisions of this 
section, it may file a request with the Commission for authorization to 
make such a distribution. Such request shall comply with the 
requirements of Sec. 270.0-2 of this chapter and shall set forth the 
pertinent facts and explain the circumstances which the company believes 
justify such distribution. The request shall be deemed granted unless 
the Commission within 15 days after receipt thereof shall deny such 
request as not being necessary or appropriate in the public interest or 
for the protection of investors and notify the company in writing of 
such denial.
    (f) A registered investment company may make one additional 
distribution of long-term capital gains, as defined in the Code, with 
respect to any one taxable year of the company, which distribution is 
made, in whole or in part, for the purpose of not incurring any tax 
under section 4982 of the Code. Such additional distribution may be made 
prior or subsequent to any distribution otherwise permitted by paragraph 
(a) of this section.

    (a) No registered investment company issuing any redeemable 
security, no person designated in such issuer's prospectus as authorized 
to consummate transactions in any such security, and no principal 
underwriter of, or dealer in, any such security shall sell, redeem, or 
repurchase any such security except at a price based on the current net 
asset value of such security which is next computed after receipt of a 
tender of such security for redemption or of an order to purchase or 
sell such security: Provided, That:
    (1) This paragraph shall not prevent a sponsor of a unit investment 
trust (hereinafter referred to as the ``Trust'') engaged exclusively in 
the business of investing in eligible trust securities (as defined in 
Rule 14a-3(b) (17 CFR 270.14a-3(b))) from selling or repurchasing Trust 
units in a secondary market at a price based on the offering side 
evaluation of the eligible trust securities in the Trust's portfolio, 
determined at any time on the last business day of each week, effective 
for all sales made during the following week, if on the days that such 
sales or repurchases are made the sponsor receives a letter from a 
qualified evaluator stating, in its opinion, that:
    (i) In the case of repurchases, the current bid price is not higher 
than the offering side evaluation, computed on the last business day of 
the previous week; and
    (ii) In the case of resales, the offering side evaluation, computed 
as of the last business day of the previous week, is not more than one-
half of one percent ($5.00 on a unit representing $1,000 principal 
amount of eligible trust securities) greater than the current offering 
price.
    (2) This paragraph shall not prevent any registered investment 
company from adjusting the price of its redeemable securities sold 
pursuant to a merger, consolidation or purchase of substantially all of 
the assets of a company which meets the conditions specified in 
Sec. 270.17a-8.
    (b) For the purposes of this section,
    (1) The current net asset value of any such security shall be 
computed no less frequently than once daily, Monday through Friday, at 
the specific time or times during the day that the board of directors of 
the investment company sets, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this 
section, except on:
    (i) Days on which changes in the value of the investment company's 
portfolio securities will not materially affect the current net asset 
value of the investment company's redeemable securities;
    (ii) Days during which no security is tendered for redemption and no 
order to purchase or sell such security is received by the investment 
company; or

[[Page 669]]

    (iii) Customary national business holidays described or listed in 
the prospectus and local and regional business holidays listed in the 
prospectus; and
    (2) A ``qualified evaluator'' shall mean any evaluator which 
represents it is in a position to determine, on the basis of an informal 
evaluation of the eligible trust securities held in the Trust's 
portfolio, whether--
    (i) The current bid price is higher than the offering side 
evaluation, computed on the last business day of the previous week, and
    (ii) The offering side evaluation, computed as of the last business 
day of the previous week, is more than one-half of one percent ($5.00 on 
a unit representing $1,000 principal amount of eligible trust 
securities) greater than the current offering price.
    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions above, any registered separate 
account offering variable annuity contracts, any person designated in 
such account's prospectus as authorized to consummate transactions in 
such contracts, and any principal underwriter of or dealer in such 
contracts shall be permitted to apply the initial purchase payment for 
any such contract at a price based on the current net asset value of 
such contract which is next computed:
    (1) Not later than two business days after receipt of the order to 
purchase by the insurance company sponsoring the separate account 
(``insurer''), if the contract application and other information 
necessary for processing the order to purchase (collectively, 
``application'') are complete upon receipt; or
    (2) Not later than two business days after an application which is 
incomplete upon receipt by the insurer is made complete, Provided, That, 
if an incomplete application is not made complete within five business 
days after receipt,
    (i) The prospective purchaser shall be informed of the reasons for 
the delay, and
    (ii) The initial purchase payment shall be returned immediately and 
in full, unless the prospective purchaser specifically consents to the 
insurer retaining the purchase payment until the application is made 
complete.
    (3) As used in this section:
    (i) Prospective Purchaser shall mean either an individual 
contractowner or an individual participant in a group contract.
    (ii) Initial Purchase Payment shall refer to the first purchase 
payment submitted to the insurer by, or on behalf of, a prospective 
purchaser.

    (3) If the security to be purchased is junior to any class of 
outstanding security of the issuer representing indebtedness (except 
notes or other evidences of indebtedness held by a bank or other person, 
the issuance of which did not involve a public offering) all securities 
of such class shall have an asset coverage of at least 300 percent 
immediately after such purchase; and if the security to be purchased is 
junior to any class of outstanding senior security of the issuer which 
is a stock, all securities of such class shall have an asset coverage of 
at least 200 percent immediately after such purchase, and shall not be 
in arrears as to dividends.
    (4) The seller of the security is not to the knowledge of the issuer 
an affiliated person of the issuer.

[[Page 671]]

    (5) Payment of the purchase price is accompanied or preceded by a

    (7) The issuer discloses to the seller or, if the seller is acting 
through a broker, to the seller's broker, either prior to or at the time 
of purchase the approximate or estimated asset coverage per unit of the 
security to be purchased.
    (8) No brokerage commission is paid by the issuer to any affiliated 
person of the issuer in connection with the purchase.

preceding six months, informed stockholders of its intention to purchase 
stock of such class by letter or report addressed to all the 
stockholders of such class.

day of the calendar month following the month in which the purchase 
occurs, two copies of a report of purchases made during the month, 
together with a copy of any written solicitation to purchase securities 
under this rule sent or given during the month by or on behalf of the

section 23(c)(1) or (2) of the Act.
    (d) This rule relates exclusively to the requirements of section 
23(c) of the Act, and the provisions hereof shall not be construed to 
authorize any action which contravenes any other applicable law, 
statutory or otherwise, or the provision of any indenture or other 
instrument pursuant to which securities of the issuer were issued.

Sec. 270.23c-3  Repurchase offers by closed-end companies.

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    (1) Periodic interval shall mean an interval of three, six, or 
twelve months.
    (2) Repurchase offer shall mean an offer pursuant to this section by 
an investment company to repurchase common stock of which it is the 
issuer.
    (3) Repurchase offer amount shall mean the amount of common stock 
that is the subject of a repurchase offer, expressed as a percentage of 
such stock outstanding on the repurchase request deadline, that an 
investment company offers to repurchase in a repurchase offer. The 
repurchase offer amount shall not be less than five percent nor more 
than twenty-five percent of the common stock outstanding on a repurchase 
request deadline. Before each repurchase offer, the repurchase offer 
amount for that repurchase offer shall be determined by the directors of 
the company.
    (4) Repurchase payment deadline with respect to a tender of common 
stock shall mean the date by which an investment company must pay 
securities holders for any stock repurchased. A repurchase payment 
deadline shall occur seven days after the repurchase pricing date 
applicable to such tender.
    (5) Repurchase pricing date with respect to a tender of common stock 
shall mean the date on which an investment company determines the net 
asset value applicable to the repurchase of the securities. A repurchase 
pricing date shall occur no later than the fourteenth day after a 
repurchase request deadline, or the next business day if the fourteenth 
day is not a business day. In no event shall an investment company 
determine the net asset value applicable to the repurchase of the stock 
before the close of business on the repurchase request deadline.
    (i) For an investment company making a repurchase offer pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section, the number of days between the repurchase 
request deadline and the repurchase pricing date for a repurchase offer 
shall be the maximum number specified by the company pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(2)(i)(D) of this section.
    (ii) For an investment company making a repurchase offer pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section, the repurchase pricing date shall be such 
date as the company shall disclose to security holders in the 
notification pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section with respect 
to such offer.
    (iii) For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a repurchase 
pricing date may be a date earlier than the date determined pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(5) (i) or (ii) of this section if, on or immediately 
following the repurchase request deadline, it appears that the use of an 
earlier repurchase pricing date is not likely to result in significant 
dilution of the net asset value of either stock that is tendered for 
repurchase or stock that is not tendered.
    (6) Repurchase request shall mean the tender of common stock in 
response to a repurchase offer.
    (7) Repurchase request deadline with respect to a repurchase offer 
shall mean the date by which an investment company must receive 
repurchase requests submitted by security holders in response to that 
offer or withdrawals or modifications of previously submitted repurchase 
requests. The first repurchase request deadline after the effective date 
of the registration statement for the common stock that is the subject 
of a repurchase offer, or after a shareholder vote adopting the 
fundamental policy specifying a company's periodic interval, whichever 
is later, shall occur no later than two periodic intervals thereafter.
    (b) Periodic repurchase offers. A registered closed-end company or a 
business development company may repurchase common stock of which it is 
the issuer from the holders of the stock at periodic intervals, pursuant 
to repurchase offers made to all holders of the stock, Provided that:
    (1) The company shall repurchase the stock for cash at the net asset 
value determined on the repurchase pricing date and shall pay the 
holders of the stock by the repurchase payment deadline except as 
provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The company may deduct 
from the repurchase proceeds

[[Page 673]]

only a repurchase fee, not to exceed two percent of the proceeds, that 
is paid to the company and is reasonably intended to compensate the 
company for expenses directly related to the repurchase. A company may 
not condition a repurchase offer upon the tender of any minimum amount 
of shares.
    (2)(i) The company shall repurchase the security pursuant to a 
fundamental policy, changeable only by a majority vote of the 
outstanding voting securities of the company, stating:
    (A) That the company will make repurchase offers at periodic 
intervals pursuant to this section, as this section may be amended from 
time to time;
    (B) The periodic intervals between repurchase request deadlines;
    (C) The dates of repurchase request deadlines or the means of 
determining the repurchase request deadlines; and
    (D) The maximum number of days between each repurchase request 
deadline and the next repurchase pricing date.
    (ii) The company shall include a statement in its annual report to 
shareholders of the following:
    (A) Its policy under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (B) With respect to repurchase offers by the company during the 
period covered by the annual report, the number of repurchase offers, 
the repurchase offer amount and the amount tendered in each repurchase 
offer, and the extent to which in any repurchase offer the company 
repurchased stock pursuant to the procedures in paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section.
    (iii) A company shall be deemed to be making repurchase offers 
pursuant to a policy within paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section if:
    (A) The company makes repurchase offers to its security holders at 
periodic intervals and, before May 14, 1993, has disclosed in its 
registration statement its intention to make or consider making such 
repurchase offers; and
    (B) The company's board of directors adopts a policy specifying the 
matters required by paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and the 
periodic interval specified therein conforms generally to the frequency 
of the company's prior repurchase offers.
    (3)(i) The company shall not suspend or postpone a repurchase offer 
except pursuant to a vote of a majority of the directors, including a 
majority of the directors who are not interested persons of the company, 
and only:
    (A) If the repurchase would cause the company to lose its status as 
a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal 
Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. 851-860];
    (B) If the repurchase would cause the stock that is the subject of 
the offer that is either listed on a national securities exchange or 
quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a national securities 
association to be neither listed on any national securities exchange nor 
quoted on any inter-dealer quotation system of a national securities 
association;
    (C) For any period during which the New York Stock Exchange or any 
other market in which the securities owned by the company are 
principally traded is closed, other than customary week-end and holiday 
closings, or during which trading in such market is restricted;
    (D) For any period during which an emergency exists as a result of 
which disposal by the company of securities owned by it is not 
reasonably practicable, or during which it is not reasonably practicable 
for the company fairly to determine the value of its net assets; or
    (E) For such other periods as the Commission may by order permit for 
the protection of security holders of the company.
    (ii) If a repurchase offer is suspended or postponed, the company 
shall provide notice to security holders of such suspension or 
postponement. If the company renews the repurchase offer, the company 
shall send a new notification to security holders satisfying the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (4)(i) No less than twenty-one and no more than forty-two days 
before each repurchase request deadline, the company shall send to each 
holder of record and to each beneficial owner of the stock that is the 
subject of the repurchase offer a notification providing the following 
information:

[[Page 674]]

    (C) The repurchase offer amount;
    (D) The dates of the repurchase request deadline, repurchase pricing

    (G) The circumstances in which the company may suspend or postpone a 
repurchase offer pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section;
    (H) The net asset value of the common stock computed no more than 
seven days before the date of the notification and the means by which 
security holders may ascertain the net asset value thereafter; and
    (I) The market price, if any, of the common stock on the date on 
which such net asset value was computed, and the means by which security 
holders may ascertain the market price thereafter.
    (ii) The company shall file three copies of the notification with 
the Commission within three business days after sending the notification 
to security holders. Those copies shall be accompanied by copies of Form 
N-23c-3 (Sec. 274.221 of this chapter) (``Notification of Repurchase 
Offer''). The format of the copies shall comply with the requirements 
for registration statements and reports under Sec. 270.8b-12 of this 
chapter.
    (iii) For purposes of sending a notification to a beneficial owner 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, where the company knows 
that shares of common stock that is the subject of a repurchase offer 
are held of record by a broker, dealer, voting trustee, bank, 
association or other entity that exercises fiduciary powers in nominee 
name or otherwise, the company shall follow the procedures for 
transmitting materials to beneficial owners of securities that are set 
forth in Sec. 240.14a-13 of this chapter.
    (5) If security holders tender more than the repurchase offer 
amount, the company may repurchase an additional amount of stock not to 
exceed two percent of the common stock outstanding on the repurchase 
request deadline. If the company determines not to repurchase more than 
the repurchase offer amount, or if security holders tender stock in an 
amount exceeding the repurchase offer amount plus two percent of the 
common stock outstanding on the repurchase request deadline, the company 
shall repurchase the shares tendered on a pro rata basis; Provided, 
however, That this provision shall not prohibit the company from:
    (i) Accepting all stock tendered by persons who own, beneficially or 
of record, an aggregate of not more than a specified number which is 
less than one hundred shares and who tender all of their stock, before 
prorating stock tendered by others; or
    (ii) Accepting by lot stock tendered by security holders who tender 
all stock held by them and who, when tendering their stock, elect to 
have either all or none or at least a minimum amount or none accepted, 
if the company first accepts all stock tendered by security holders who 
do not so elect.
    (6) The company shall permit tenders of stock for repurchase to be 
withdrawn or modified at any time until the repurchase request deadline 
but shall not permit tenders to be withdrawn or modified thereafter.
    (7)(i) The current net asset value of the company's common stock 
shall be computed no less frequently than weekly on such day and at such 
specific time or times during the day that the board of directors of the 
company shall set.
    (ii) The current net asset value of the company's common stock shall 
be computed daily on the five business days

[[Page 675]]

preceding a repurchase request deadline at such specific time or times 
during the day that the board of directors of the company shall set.
    (iii) For purposes of section 23(b) [15 U.S.C. 80a-23(b)], the 
current net asset value applicable to a sale of common stock by the 
company shall be the net asset value next determined after receipt of an 
order to purchase such stock. During any period when the company is 
offering its common stock, the current net asset value of the common 
stock shall be computed no less frequently than once daily, Monday 
through Friday, at the specific time or times during the day that the 
board of directors of the company shall set, except on:
    (A) Days on which changes in the value of the company's portfolio 
securities will not materially affect the current net asset value of the 
common stock;
    (B) Days during which no order to purchase its common stock is 
received, other than days when the net asset value would otherwise be 
computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section; or
    (C) Customary national, local, and regional business holidays 
described or listed in the prospectus.
    (8) A majority of the directors of the company shall be directors 
who are not interested persons of the company, and the selection and 
nomination of those directors shall be committed to the discretion of 
those directors.
    (9) Any senior security issued by the company or other indebtedness 
contracted by the company either shall mature by the next repurchase 
pricing date or shall provide for the redemption or call of such 
security or the repayment of such indebtedness by the company by the 
next repurchase pricing date, either in whole or in part, without 
penalty or premium, as necessary to permit the company to repurchase 
securities in such repurchase offer amount as the directors of the 
company shall determine in compliance with the asset coverage 
requirements of section 18 [15 U.S.C. 80a-18] or 61 [15 U.S.C. 80a-60], 
as applicable.
    (10)(i) From the time a company sends a notification to shareholders 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section until the repurchase 
pricing date, a percentage of the company's assets equal to at least 100 
percent of the repurchase offer amount shall consist of assets that can 
be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business, at 
approximately the price at which the company has valued the investment, 
within a period equal to the period between a repurchase request 
deadline and the repurchase payment deadline, or of assets that mature 
by the next repurchase payment deadline.
    (ii) In the event that the company's assets fail to comply with the 
requirements in paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this section, the board of 
directors shall cause the company to take such action as it deems 
appropriate to ensure compliance.
    (iii) In supervising the company's operations and portfolio 
management by the investment adviser, the company's board of directors 
shall adopt written procedures reasonably designed, taking into account 
current market conditions and the company's investment objectives, to 
ensure that the company's portfolio assets are sufficiently liquid so 
that the company can comply with its fundamental policy on repurchases, 
and comply with the liquidity requirements of paragraph (b)(10)(i) of 
this section. The board of directors shall review the overall 
composition of the portfolio and make and approve such changes to the 
procedures as the board deems necessary.
    (11) The company, or any underwriter for the company, shall comply, 
as if the company were an open-end company, with the provisions of 
section 24(b) [15 U.S.C. 80a-24(b)] and rules issued thereunder with 
respect to any advertisement, pamphlet, circular, form letter, or other 
sales literature addressed to or intended for distribution to 
prospective investors.
    (c) Discretionary repurchase offers. A registered closed-end company 
or a business development company may repurchase common stock of which 
it is the issuer from the holders of the stock pursuant to a repurchase 
offer that is not made pursuant to a fundamental policy and that is made 
to all holders of the stock not earlier than two years after another 
offer pursuant to this paragraph (c) if the company complies

[[Page 676]]

with the requirements of paragraphs (b) (1), (3), (4), (5), (6), 
(7)(ii), (8), (10)(i), and (10)(ii) of this section.
    (d) Exemption from the definition of redeemable security. A company 
that makes repurchase offers pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this 
section shall not be deemed thereby to be an issuer of redeemable 
securities within section 2(a)(32) [15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(32)].

payment to the Commission, by a U.S. postal money order or a certified 
bank check or cash, of a fee computed in accordance with paragraph (c) 
of this section, but not less than $300.
    (b)(1) A notification pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
shall be captioned ``Notification of Election Under Rule 24f-1'' and 
shall show the file number of the registration statement of the issuer 
under the Securities Act of 1933 which was in effect, at the time of 
sale of the shares with respect to which the notification is filed, as

Sec. 270.24f-2  Registration under the Securities Act of 1933 of an indefinite number of certain investment company securities.

    (a)(1) A face amount certificate company or an open-end management 
company or unit investment trust may, subject to the provisions of this 
section, elect to register an indefinite number or amount of securities 
under the Securities Act of 1933 by including on the facing sheet of its 
registration statement a declaration that an indefinite number or amount 
of its securities is being registered by such registration statement, or 
if a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 is in 
effect as to such securities by amending such registration statement on 
the facing sheet to declare that to the number or amount of securities 
of the same class or series presently registered is added an indefinite 
number or amount of such securities. Such declaration shall take effect 
when the registration statement or post-effective amendment in which it 
is included becomes effective. The issuer shall place on the facing 
sheet of any post-effective amendment to the registration statement 
filed after the issuer has made a declaration pursuant to this paragraph 
(a)(1) a statement to the effect that the issuer has registered an 
indefinite number or amount of securities under the Securities Act of 
1933 pursuant to this section, and the date on which the Rule 24f-2 
Notice for the issuer's most recent fiscal year was filed or will be 
filed, or a statement that pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) the issuer need 
not file a Rule 24f-2 Notice because it did not sell any securities 
pursuant to such declaration during the most recent fiscal year.
    (2) A declaration filed pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, once effective, shall remain in effect as to such registration 
statement until expressly terminated by a statement on the facing sheet 
of a post-effective amendment thereto, or until involuntarily terminated 
as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (3) If such registration statement also registers a definite number 
or

[[Page 679]]

amount of securities, there shall be paid to the Commission with respect 
to such definite amount of securities a registration fee calculated in 
the manner specified in section 6(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, (15 
U.S.C. 77f(b)) and the rules and regulations thereunder.
    (b)(1) If an issuer has filed a registration statement or post-
effective amendment with a declaration authorized by paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section, it shall, with respect to such registration statement and 
within 180 days after the close of any fiscal year during which such 
declaration was in effect, file five copies of a notice (``Rule 24f-2 
Notice'') with the Commission. The Rule 24f-2 Notice shall be filed on 
Form 24F-2 [17 CFR 274.24] and shall be prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the form. The Rule 24f-2 Notice shall be accompanied by 
an opinion of counsel indicating whether the securities the registration 
of which the notice makes definite in number were legally issued, fully 
paid, and non-assessable, and the additional filing fee, if any, 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) If the Rule 24f-2 Notice is not filed within the time specified 
in paragraph (b)(1), the declaration filed pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section shall be deemed to be terminated on the next business 
day, and the registrant shall discontinue all sales of securities 
pursuant to such declaration. Separate notices as described in paragraph 
(b)(1) shall be filed as soon as practicable after such termination with 
respect to sales of securities made pursuant to the declaration during 
(i) the fiscal year as to which such notice was not timely filed, and 
(ii) the period after the close of such fiscal year but before such 
declaration was terminated. Securities sold after termination of such 
declaration shall, for purposes of Rule 24f-1, be deemed to have been 
sold in an amount in excess of the number of shares of securities of the 
same class or series included in a registration statement of such issuer 
under the Securities Act of 1933 in effect at the time of sale. Nothing 
in this paragraph (b)(2) shall require an issuer to file a Rule 24f-2 
Notice for any fiscal year in which the issuer has not sold any 
securities in reliance on a declaration authorized by paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section.
    (3) For purposes of this section, if a registrant ceases operations, 
the date the registrant ceases operations shall be deemed to be the 
close of its fiscal year. In the case of a liquidation, merger, or sale 
of all or substantially all of the assets of the registrant, the 
registrant shall be deemed to have ceased operations for purposes of 
this section on the date all or substantially all of the registrant's 
assets are distributed, the date the merger becomes effective under 
state law, or the date the assets are transferred; provided, however, 
that in the case of a merger of a registrant (``Predecessor Fund'') with 
another registrant (``Successor Fund''), or a sale of all or 
substantially all of a Predecessor Fund's assets and liabilities to a 
Successor Fund, the Predecessor Fund shall not be deemed to have ceased 
operations and the Successor Fund shall assume the obligations, fees, 
and redemption credits of the Predecessor Fund incurred pursuant to this 
section and Sec. 270.24e-2 if:
    (i) The registration statement of the Predecessor Fund is deemed the 
registration statement of the Successor Fund in a transaction described 
by Sec. 230.414 of this chapter; or
    (ii) The Successor Fund is a series of a series company (as defined 
in Sec. 270.18f-2), and immediately prior to the transaction the 
Successor Fund had no assets or liabilities, other than nominal assets 
or liabilities, and no operating history.
    (c) A Rule 24f-2 Notice shall be accompanied by the payment of a 
filing fee with respect to the securities sold during the fiscal year in 
reliance upon registration pursuant to this section and shall be based 
upon the actual aggregate sale price for which such securities were 
sold. The filing fee shall be calculated in the manner specified in 
section 6(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules and regulations 
thereunder, except that the minimum filing fee required under section 
6(b) shall not apply to fees due under this section. When the Rule 24f-2 
Notice is filed not later than 60 days after the close of the fiscal 
year during which such securities were sold pursuant to

[[Page 680]]

this section, the filing fee to be paid as to such securities shall be 
the fee, if any, calculated in the manner specified in Section 6(b) of 
the Securities Act of 1933 except that, for the purpose of such 
calculation, such fee shall be based upon the actual aggregate sale 
price for which securities (including, for this purpose, all securities 
issued pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan) were sold during the 
issuer's previous fiscal year, reduced by the difference between:
    (1) The actual aggregate redemption or repurchase price of such 
securities of the issuer redeemed or repurchased by the issuer during 
such previous fiscal year; and
    (2) The actual aggregate redemption or repurchase price of such 
redeemed or repurchased securities previously applied by the issuer 
pursuant to Sec. 270.24e-2(a) in filings made pursuant to section 
24(e)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
    (d) Payment of a fee to the Commission pursuant to this section 
shall be by United States postal money order or certified bank check or 
cash. Fees paid pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section cannot be 
credited against registration fees which become payable pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section while the declaration authorized by this 
section remains in effect. A fee required to accompany a notice filed 
with respect to the fiscal year during which such declaration is 
expressly terminated by a post-effective amendment may be reduced by up 
to the amount of the fee paid pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. 
Amounts paid pursuant to paragraph (a) in excess of the fee required to 
be paid pursuant to this paragraph (d) are not refundable.
    (e) To determine the date on which a Rule 24f-2 Notice must be filed 
with the Commission under paragraph (b)(1) of this section or the date 
that a Rule 24f-2 Notice must be filed in order to permit the issuer to 
calculate the fee due in accordance with the second sentence of 
paragraph (c) of this section, the first day of the 180 day or 60 day 
period, as the case may be, shall be the first calendar day of the 
fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the Rule 24f-2 Notice is 
to be filed.

    Note to paragraph (e): For example, a Rule 24f-2 Notice for a fiscal 
year ending on June 30 must be filed no later than December 28 or, if 
the issuer calculates the fee due in accordance with the second sentence 
of paragraph (c), no later than August 29. If the last day of the period 
falls on a non-business day (a Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday), the 
period shall end on the first business day thereafter, as provided by 
Sec. 270.0-2.

    (f) The date of filing of a Rule 24f-2 Notice with the Commission 
shall be the date on which the Rule 24f-2 Notice is actually received by 
the Commission; provided, however, that other than in the case of a Rule 
24f-2 Notice filed by direct transmission (as such term is defined in 
rule 11 of Regulation S-T [17 CFR 232.11] a Rule 24f-2 Notice received 
by the Commission after the date due under either paragraph (b)(1) or 
paragraph (c) of this section shall be deemed to have been timely filed 
if the issuer establishes that the Rule 24f-2 Notice was transmitted 
timely to a third party company or governmental entity providing 
delivery services in the ordinary course of business, which guaranteed 
delivery of the Notice to the Commission no later than the required 
filing date.

reserves the right to increase the fee, the fee shall not be greater 
than the cost of the services to be provided for one year; if the fee is 
guaranteed not to increase for a specified period of time, the fee shall 
not be greater than the average expected cost of the services to be 
provided during the period of the guarantee.

          section 27(f) of the Act.

    (a)(1) Every depositor of or principal underwriter for the issuer of 
a periodic payment plan certificate sold subject to section 27(d) or 
section 27(f) of the Act or both, shall deposit and maintain funds in a 
segregated trust account as a reserve and as security for the purpose of 
assuring the refund of charges required by sections 27(d) and 27(f) of 
the Act.
    (2) The assets of such trust account may be held as cash or invested 
only in one or more of (i) government securities as defined in section 
2(a)(16) of the Act (except equity securities) or (ii) negotiable 
certificates of deposit issued by a bank, as defined in section 2(a)(5) 
of the Act and having capital and surplus of at least $10 million: 
Provided, That no such investment may have a maturity of more than 5 
years, no more than 50 percent of the assets may be invested in 
obligations having a maturity of more than 1 year, and certificates of 
deposit of a single issuer may not constitute more than 10 percent of 
the value of the assets in the account.
    (3) Any income, gains, or losses from assets allocated to such 
account, whether or not realized, shall be credited to or charged 
against such account without regard to other income, gains, or losses of 
the depositor or principal underwriter.
    (4) The assets of such trust account may be withdrawn only as 
permitted by paragraph (f) of this section and shall in no event be 
chargeable with liabilities arising out of any aspect of the business of 
the depositor or principal underwriter other than assuring the ability 
of the depositor or principal underwriter to refund the amounts required 
by such sections.
    (b) For purposes of this section:
    (1) ``Excess sales load'' on any payment is that portion of the 
sales load in excess of 15 percent of that payment.
    (2) ``Monthly payment'' shall be the amount of the smallest monthly 
installment scheduled to be paid during the life of the plan. If 
payments are required or permitted to be made on a basis less frequently 
than monthly, an

[[Page 683]]

equivalent monthly payment shall be the amount determined by dividing 
the smallest minimum payment required or permitted in a payment period 
by the number of months included in such period.
    (3) The assets in the segregated trust account shall be valued as 
follows: (i) With respect to securities for which market quotations are 
readily available, the market value of such securities; and (ii) with 
respect to other securities, fair value as determined in good faith by 
the depositor or principal underwriter.
    (c) For every periodic payment plan certificate governed by section 
27(d), the depositor or principal underwriter shall deposit into the 
segregated trust account not less than 45 percent of the excess sales 
load on each of the first six monthly payments or their equivalent.
    (d) For all periodic payment plan certificates governed by section 
27(d) which have not been surrendered in accordance with their terms, 
and for which the depositor or principal underwriter may be liable for 
the refund of any sales load, the depositor or principal underwriter 
shall maintain in the segregated trust account an amount equal to not 
less than 15% of the total refundable sales load on the payments made on 
those certificates. The depositor or principal underwriter shall also 
maintain in the segregated trust account such additional amounts as the 
Commission by order may require for the depositor or principal 
underwriter to carry out refund obligations pursuant to sections 27(d) 
and 27(f) of the Act.
    (e) For every periodic payment plan certificate governed by section 
27(f) of the Act, and for which the depositor or principal underwriter 
has no obligation to refund any excess sales load pursuant to section 
27(d) of the Act, the depositor or principal underwriter shall deposit 
and maintain during the refund period, at least the following amounts in 
the segregated trust account:
    (1) For certificates that require monthly payments of $100 or less, 
20 percent of the difference between the gross payments made and the net 
amount invested;
    (2) For certificates that require monthly payments in excess of $100 
and for single payment plan certificates, 30 percent of the difference 
between the gross payments made and the net amount invested;
    (3) For certificates with respect to which the holder is entitled to 
receive the greater of the refund provided by section 27(f) (of the Act) 
or a refund of total payments and upon which a total of at least $1,000 
has been paid, 100 percent of the difference between the gross payments 
made and net amount invested; and
    (4) Such additional amounts as the Commission by order may require 
to carry out the obligation to refund charges pursuant to section 27(f) 
of the Act.
    (f) Assets may be withdrawn from the segregated trust account by 
each depositor or principal underwriter:
    (1) To refund excess sales load to a certificate holder exercising 
the right of surrender specified in section 27(d) of the Act; or
    (2) To refund to a certificate holder exercising the right of 
withdrawal specified in section 27(f) of the Act the difference between 
the amount of his gross payments and the net amount invested; or
    (3) For any other purpose: Provided, however, That such withdrawal 
shall not reduce the segregated trust account to an amount less than the 
sum of (i) 130 percent of the amount required to be maintained by 
paragraph (d) of this section, if any, and (ii) 100 percent of that 
amount required to be maintained by paragraph (e) of this section, if 
any.
    (g) The minimum amounts required to be maintained by paragraphs (d) 
and (e) of this section shall be computed at least monthly. Any 
additional deposits required by paragraph (d) or (e) of this section 
shall be made immediately after such computation, and any withdrawals 
permitted by paragraph (f)(3) of this section may be made only at such 
time.
    (h) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a 
depositor or principal underwriter, acting as such for two or more 
registered investment companies issuing periodic payment plan 
certificates, from combining in a

[[Page 684]]

single segregated trust account the reserves for such companies required 
by this section.
    (i) The refunds required to be made to certificate holders pursuant 
to sections 27(d) and 27(f) (of the Act) shall be paid in cash not more 
than 7 days from the date the certificate is received in proper form by 
the custodian bank or such other paying agent as may be designated under 
the periodic payment plan.

Commission, within the appropriate period of time specified, an 
Accounting of Segregated Trust Account. Form N-27D-1 (Sec. 274.127d-1 of

(Date of mailing)
Re: --(1)------.
    Dear --(2)------: This notice is required to be sent to all 
purchasers of plan certificates pursuant to laws administered by the 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. You should read it carefully 
and retain it with your financial records.
    You have missed --(3)------ after your -- (4)------ plan certificate 
was issued. Until -- (5) ------ you will be entitled to surrender your 
plan certificate and receive, in addition to the value of your account 
on the date your certificate is received, a refund of that portion of 
the sales charges you have paid in excess of 15 percent of the gross 
payments under your plan.
    For example, if your certificate had been received for surrender -- 
(6) ------ you would have received a total of $-- (7) ------ for it (the 
value of your account $-- (8) ------ plus a refund of $-- (9) ------ of 
the sales charges you have paid). After your right expires you will be 
entitled to receive only the value of your account. Of course, the value 
of your account will vary from day to day and by the date your right 
expires it may be more or less than it is today.
    In determining whether to exercise your right to terminate your 
plan, you should consider that, while the average sales charge deducted 
from your payments has amounted to -- (10) ------ percent of the total 
payments made, the sales charge for the remainder of the payments under 
the plan, if you continue the plan, will be -- (11) ------and the 
average sales charge if you complete the plan will be -- (12) ------ 
percent. Exercising your right to terminate your plan, however, will 
result in a net sales charge of 15 percent of your total payments. 
Accordingly, if you believe you may discontinue making further payments 
on your plan, it would probably be to your advantage to exercise this 
right now.
    If you wish to exercise your right to terminate your plan, you may 
return your certificate to -- (13) ------ by -- (14) ------ in 
accordance with the enclosed instructions.
Very truly yours,
                                                         -- (15) ------.

    Dear ---- (2) ----: This notice is required to be sent to all 
purchasers of plan certificates pursuant to laws administered by the 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. You should read it carefully 
and retain it with your financial records.
    Of the $---- (3) ---- you have paid on your ---- (4) ---- plan, 
representing ---- (5) ---- regular monthly payments, $---- (6) ---- or 
---- (7) ---- percent has been deducted for various charges.
[The following sentence is to be included when any periodic payment 
remains outstanding in which the sales load charges exceed 9 percent of

    A total of $---- (8) ---- or ---- (9) ---- percent of your first --
-- (10) ---- monthly payments will be deducted from those payments for 
similar charges.
    Charges of $---- (11)---- or ---- (12) ---- percent will be deducted 
from each subsequent payment. You have until ---- (13) ---- to surrender 
your certificate for any reason and receive a refund of all of the 
charges

[[Page 687]]

which have been deducted from your payments, and, in addition, the value 
of your account on the date your certificate is received.
    In determining whether or not to exercise your right you should 
consider, among other things, the projected cost of your investment and 
your ability to make the scheduled payments over the life of your plan

do not complete your program, the deduction of various charges from your 
initial payments will result in your paying effective charges in excess

<R05>
Sec. 275.0-6   Incorporation by reference in applications.

    (a) A person filing an application may, subject to the limitations 
of Sec. 228.10(f) and Sec. 229.10(d) of this chapter, incorporate by 
reference as an exhibit to such application any document or part 
thereof, including any financial statement or part thereof, previously 
or concurrently filed with the Commission pursuant to any act 
administered by the Commission. The incorporation may be made whether 
the matter incorporated was filed by such applicant or any other person. 
If any modification has occurred in the text of any such document since 
the filing thereof, the applicant shall file with the reference a 
statement containing the text of any such modification and the date 
thereof. If the number of copies of any document previously or 
concurrently filed with the Commission is less than the number required 
to be filed with the application which incorporates such document, the 
applicant shall file therewith as many additional copies of the document 
as may be necessary to meet the requirements of the application.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a certificate of 
an independent public accountant or accountants previously or 
concurrently filed may not be incorporated by reference in any 
application unless the written consent of the accountant or accountants 
to such incorporation is filed with the application.
    (c) In each case of incorporation by reference, the matter 
incorporated shall be clearly identified in the reference. An express 
statement shall be made to the effect that the specified matter is 
incorporated in the application at the particular place where the 
information is required.
    (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, no application 
shall incorporate by reference any exhibit or financial statement which 
(1) has been withdrawn, or (2) was filed under any act administered by 
the Commission in connection with a registration which has ceased to be 
effective, or (3) is contained in an application for registration, 
registration statement, or report subject, at the time of the 
incorporation by reference, to pending proceedings under section 8(b) 
(15 U.S.C. 77a-8(b)) or 8(d) (15 U.S.C. 77a-8(d)) of the Securities Act 
of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a-1 et seq.), section 8(e) (15 U.S.C. 80a-8(e)) of 
the Investment Company Act of 1940, section 15(b)(4)(A) (15 U.S.C. 78a-
15(b)(4)(A)) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a-1 et 
seq.), section 203(e)(1) (15 U.S.C. 80b-3(e)(1)) of the Investment 
Advisers Act of 1940 or to an order entered under any of those sections.
    (e) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission 
may refuse to permit incorporation by reference in any case in which in 
its judgment such incorporation would render an application incomplete, 
unclear, or confusing.
    (f) Definition of Application. For purposes of this rule, an 
``application'' means any application for an order of the Commission 
under the Act other than an application for registration as an 
investment adviser.

    Note: Prior to incorporating by reference any document as an exhibit 
to an application, applicants are advised to review Sec. 228.10(f) and 
Sec. 229.10(d) of this chapter as in effect at the time the application 
is filed to determine whether such incorporation by reference would be 
permissible under that rule.

Sec. 275.203-3  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 275.203(b)(3)-1  Definition of ``Client'' of an investment adviser for certain purposes relating to limited partnerships.

                            Preliminary Notes

    1. This rule is a safe harbor and is not intended to specify the 
exclusive method for a limited partnership, rather than each limited 
partner, to be counted as a ``client'' for purposes of section 203(b)(3) 
of the Act. The rule is not intended to create any presumptions about 
the status of any person not relying, or unable to rely, on the rule.
    2. Any person relying on this rule is reminded that section 208(d) 
of the Act makes it unlawful generally for such person to do indirectly, 
or through any other person, any act which it would be unlawful for such 
person to do directly under the Act or the rules thereunder. The fact 
that a person relying on this rule is related to a registered investment 
adviser is not sufficient, in and of itself, to preclude reliance on the 
rule. However, absent the separate and distinct operation of a 
registered adviser from a person relying on this rule, section 208(d) 
requires the two entities to be viewed as a single entity for purposes 
of section 203(b)(3) of the Act.

    (a) As used in this section:
    (1) A related person of another person is any person controlling, 
controlled by, under common control with, or any employee or employer 
of, such other person; and
    (2) A limited partner is an investment advisory client of a general 
partner or other person acting as investment adviser to the partnership, 
or any related person of the foregoing persons, if the limited partner 
receives from any such person:
    (i) Investment advisory services of a nature that the person 
providing the services would be an investment adviser, as defined in 
section 202(a)(11) of the Act, or
    (ii) Investment advice to transfer its assets from one limited 
partnership to another one; Provided, however, That a limited partner is 
not an investment advisory client of a person solely because such person 
offers, promotes, or sells interests in the limited partnership to the 
limited partner or reports periodically to the limited partners as a 
group solely with respect to the performance of, or the plans for, the 
partnership's assets (or similar matters).
    (b) For purposes of section 203(b)(3) of the Act:
    (1) A limited partnership shall be counted as a client of any 
general partner or other person acting as investment adviser to the 
partnership; and
    (2) A limited partner of the partnership shall not be counted as a 
client of the general partner or other person acting as investment 
adviser to the partnership if:
    (i) The limited partnership interests are securities; and
    (ii) The general partner or other person provides investment advice 
to the partnership based on the investment objectives of the limited 
partnership.
    (3) Paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall not be available with 
respect to any limited partner who is, separate and apart from its 
status as a limited partner, an investment advisory client of
    (i) A general partner or other person acting as investment adviser 
to the partnership, or
    (ii) Any related person thereof. The fact that paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section is not available with respect to a particular limited 
partner shall not affect the availability of that paragraph with respect 
to any other limited partner otherwise complying with paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section.
    (c) Any person relying on this rule shall not be deemed to be 
holding itself out generally to the public as an investment adviser, 
within the meaning of section 203(b)(3), solely because it participates 
in a non-public offering of limited partnership interests under the 
Securities Act of 1933.

1986 and December 31, 1986.

have prior thereto so amended its application.

5, 8, 11, 13A, 13B, 14A and 14B of Part I of any application for 
registration as an investment adviser, or in any amendment thereto, 
becomes inaccurate for any reason or if the information contained in 
response to any question in Items 9 and 10 of Part I, all of Part II 
(except Item 14), and all of Schedule H of any application for 
registration as an investment adviser, or in any amendment thereto, 
becomes inaccurate in a material manner, the investment adviser shall 
promptly file an amendment on Form ADV (Sec. 279.1 of this chapter) 
correcting such information.
    (2) For all other changes not designated in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, the investment adviser shall file an amendment on Form ADV 
correcting such information within 90 days of the end of the fiscal 
year. In addition, a balance sheet as required by Item 14 of Part II 
shall be filed within 90 days of the end of the applicant's fiscal year.
    (c) Every investment adviser whose registration is effective on the 
last day of its fiscal year shall file a Form ADV-S (Sec. 279.3 of this 
chapter) within 90 days of the end of its fiscal year unless its 
registration has been withdrawn, cancelled or revoked prior to that 
date.
    (d) Every document required pursuant to this rule shall constitute a 
``report'' within the meaning of sections 204 and 207 of the Act (15 
U.S.C. 80b-4, 80b-7).

conditions of the order, instruction, modification or cancellation; 
shall identify the person connected with the investment adviser who 
recommended the transaction to the client and the person who placed such

however, (a) That the investment adviser shall not be required to keep 
any unsolicited market letters and other similar communications of 
general public distribution not prepared by or for the investment 
adviser, and (b) that if the investment adviser sends any notice, 
circular or other advertisement offering any report, analysis, 
publication or other investment advisory service to more than 10 
persons, the investment adviser shall not be required to keep a record 
of the names and addresses of the persons to whom it was sent; except 
that if such notice, circular or advertisement is distributed to persons 
named on any list, the investment adviser shall retain with the copy of 
such notice, circular or advertisement a memorandum describing the list 
and the source thereof.
    (8) A list or other record of all accounts in which the investment

indicating the reasons therefor.
    (12)(i) A record of every transaction in a security in which the 
investment adviser or any advisory representative (as hereinafter 
defined) of such investment adviser has, or by reason of such 
transaction acquires, any direct or indirect beneficial ownership, 
except (A) transactions effected in any account over which neither the 
investment adviser nor any advisory representative of the investment 
adviser has any direct or indirect influence or control; and (B) 
transactions in securities which are direct obligations of the United 
States. Such record shall state the title and amount of the security 
involved; the date and nature of the transaction (i.e., purchase, sale 
or other acquisition or disposition); the price at which it was 
effected; and the name of the broker, dealer or bank with or through 
whom the transaction was effected. Such record may also contain a

recorded.
    (13)(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(12) of this 
section above, where the investment adviser is primarily engaged in a

advisory representative (as hereinafter defined) of such investment

adviser who makes any recommendation, who participates in the 
determination of which recommendation shall be made, or whose functions

made, or who, in connection with his duties, obtains any information 
concerning which securities are being recommended prior to the effective 
dissemination of such recommendations or of the information concerning 
such recommendations; and any of the following persons who obtain 
information concerning securities recommendation being made by such 
investment adviser prior to the effective dissemination of such 
recommendations or of the information concerning such recommendations: 
(1) Any person in a control relationship to the investment adviser, (2) 
any affiliated person of such controlling person, and (3) any affiliated 
person of such affiliated person.
    (B) Control shall have the same meaning as that set forth in section 
2(a)(9) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
    (C) An investment adviser is ``primarily engaged in a business or 
businesses other than advising registered investment companies or other 
advisory clients'' when, for each of its most recent three fiscal years

loss) before income taxes and extraordinary items, from such other 
business or businesses.
    (iii) An investment adviser shall not be deemed to have violated the

circular, advertisement, newspaper article, investment letter, bulletin 
or other communication that the investment adviser circulates or 
distributes, directly or indirectly, to 10 or more persons (other than 
persons connected with such investment adviser); provided, however, 
that, with respect to the performance of managed accounts, the retention 
of all account statements, if they reflect all debits, credits, and 
other transactions in a client's account for the period of the 
statement, and all worksheets necessary to demonstrate the calculation 
of the performance or rate of return of all managed accounts shall be

indirectly, the notice, circular, advertisement, newspaper article, 
investment letter, bulletin or other communication.
    (f) An investment adviser subject to paragraph (a) of this section, 
before ceasing to conduct or discontinuing business as an investment 
adviser shall arrange for and be responsible for the preservation of the 
books and records required to be maintained and preserved under this

medium records which, in the ordinary course of the adviser's business, 
are created by the adviser on electronic media or are received by the 
adviser solely on electronic media or by electronic data transmission.
    (h)(1) Any book or other record made, kept, maintained and preserved 
in compliance with Secs. 240.17a-3 and 240.17a-4 of this chapter under

Sec. 275.205-1   Definition of ``investment performance'' of an investment company and ``investment record'' of an appropriate index of securities prices.

    (a) Investment performance of an investment company for any period 
shall mean the sum of:
    (1) The change in its net asset value per share during such period;
    (2) The value of its cash distributions per share accumulated to the 
end of such period; and
    (3) The value of capital gains taxes per share paid or payable on 
undistributed realized long-term capital gains accumulated to the end of 
such period; expressed as a percentage of its net asset value per share 
at the beginning of such period. For this purpose, the value of 
distributions per share of realized capital gains, of dividends per 
share paid from investment income and of capital gains taxes per share 
paid or payable on undistributed realized long-term capital gains shall 
be treated as reinvested in shares of the investment company at the net 
asset value per share in effect at the close of business on the record 
date for the payment of such distributions and dividends and the date on 
which provision is made for such taxes, after giving effect to such 
distributions, dividends and taxes.

[[Page 723]]

    (b) Investment record of an appropriate index of securities prices 
for any period shall mean the sum of:
    (1) The change in the level of the index during such period; and
    (2) The value, computed consistently with the index, of cash 
distributions made by companies whose securities comprise the index 
accumulated to the end of such period; expressed as a percentage of the 
index level at the beginning of such period. For this purpose cash 
distributions on the securities which comprise the index shall be 
treated as reinvested in the index at least as frequently as the end of 
each calendar quarter following the payment of the dividend.

    (a) For purposes of this rule:

investment company's performance is equivalent to that of the index or 
other measure of performance.
    (2) Rolling period shall mean a period consisting of a specified 
number of subperiods of definite length in which the most recent 
subperiod is substituted for the earliest subperiod as time passes.

period over which the asset value of the company or fund is averaged for 
the purpose of computing the fulcrum fee may differ from the period over 
which the asset value is averaged for computing the performance related

    (1) The performance related portion of the fee is computed over a 
rolling period and the total fee is payable at the end of each subperiod 
of the rolling period; and
    (2) The fulcrum fee is computed on the basis of the asset value 
averaged over the most recent subperiod or subperiods of the rolling 
period.

    (a) General. The provisions of section 205(1) of the Act shall not 
prohibit any registered investment adviser from entering into, 
performing, renewing or extending an investment advisory contract which 
provides for compensation to the investment adviser on the basis of a 
share of the capital gains upon, or the capital appreciation of, the 
funds, or any portion of the funds, of a client, Provided, That all the 
conditions in this section are satisfied.
    (b) Nature of the client. (1) The client entering into the contract 
subject to this rule must be (i) a natural person or a company, as 
defined in paragraphs (b)(2) and (g)(1) of this section, who immediately 
after entering into the contract has at least $500,000 under the 
management of the investment adviser; or (ii) a person who the 
registered investment adviser (and any person acting on his behalf) 
entering into the contract reasonably believes, immediately prior to 
entering in to the contract, is a natural person or a company, as 
defined in paragraphs (b)(2) and (g)(1) of this section, whose net worth 
at the time the contract is entered into exceeds $1,000,000. (The net 
worth of a natural person may include assets held jointly with such 
person's spouse.)
    (2) The term company as used in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
does not include (i) a private investment company, as defined in 
paragraph (g)(2) of this section, (ii) an investment company registered 
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or (iii) a business development 
company, as defined in section 202(a)(22) of the Investment Advisers Act 
of 1940, unless each of the equity owners (other than the investment 
adviser entering into a contract under the rule) of any such company is 
a natural person or company described in this paragraph (b) of this 
section.

[[Page 726]]

    (c) Compensation formula. The compensation paid to the adviser under 
this rule with respect to the performance of any securities over a given 
period shall be based on a formula which:
    (1) Includes, in the case of securities for which market quotations 
are readily available, the realized capital losses and unrealized 
capital depreciation of the securities over the period;
    (2) Includes, in the case of securities for which market quotations 
are not readily available, (i) the realized capital losses of the 
securities over the period; and (ii) if the unrealized capital 
appreciation of the securities over the period is included, the 
unrealized capital depreciation of the securities over the period; and
    (3) Provides that any compensation paid to the adviser under this 
rule is based on the gains less the losses (computed in accordance with 
paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section) in the client's account for 
a period of not less than one year.
    (d) Disclosure. In addition to the requirements of Form ADV, the 
adviser shall disclose to the client, or the client's independent agent, 
prior to entering into an advisory contract under this rule, all 
material information concerning the proposed advisory arrangement 
including the following:
    (1) That the fee arrangement may create an incentive for the adviser 
to make investments that are riskier or more speculative than would be 
the case in the absence of a performance fee;
    (2) Where relevant, that the adviser may receive increased 
compensation with regard to unrealized appreciation as well as realized 
gains in the client's account;
    (3) The periods which will be used to measure investment performance 
throughout the contract and their significance in the computation of the 
fee;
    (4) The nature of any index which will be used as a comparative 
measure of investment performance, the significance of the index, and 
the reason the adviser believes the index is appropriate; and
    (5) Where an adviser's compensation is based in part on the 
unrealized appreciation of securities for which market quotations are 
not readily available, how the securities will be valued and the extent 
to which the valuation will be determined independently.
    (e) Arms-length contract. The investment adviser (and any person 
acting on its behalf) who enters into the contract must reasonably 
believe, immediately prior to entering into the contract, that the 
contract represents an arm's-length arrangement between the parties and 
that the client (or in the case of a client which is a company as 
defined in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the person representing the 
company), alone or together with the client's independent agent, 
understands the proposed method of compensation and its risks. The 
representative of a company may be a partner, director, officer or an 
employee of the company or the trustee, where the company is a trust, or 
any other person designated by the company or trustee, but must satisfy 
the definition of client's independent agent set forth in paragraph 
(g)(4) of this section.

(b), (c) and (e) of this section do not apply to any advisory contract 
(or renewal or extension thereof) between an investment adviser and a 
client where (i) the contract was entered into prior to and continued in 
force after November 14, 1985; and (ii) the adviser, at the time the 
contract was entered into, was not registered or required to be 
registered as an investment adviser under the Act; provided however, 
that all provisions of this rule shall apply with respect to any natural 
person or company who is not a party to the contract prior to and 
becomes a party to the contract after the effective date of this rule.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the renewal or 
extension of a contract described therein will be subject to paragraph 
(e) of this section.

by a controlling person of the investment adviser if the beneficial or 
legal interest of the person in any security issued by the investment

Sec. 275.206(3)-1   Exemption of investment advisers registered as broker-dealers in connection with the provision of certain investment advisory services.

    (a) An investment adviser which is a broker or dealer registered 
pursuant to section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 shall be 
exempt from section 206(3) in connection with any transaction in 
relation to which such broker or dealer is acting as an investment 
adviser solely (1) by means of publicly distributed written materials or 
publicly made oral statements; (2) by means of written materials or oral 
statements which do not purport to meet the objectives or needs of 
specific individuals or accounts; (3) through the issuance of 
statistical information containing no expressions of opinion as to the 
investment merits of a particular security; or (4) any combination of 
the foregoing services: Provided, however,

[[Page 728]]

That such materials and oral statements include a statement that if the 
purchaser of the advisory communication uses the services of the adviser 
in connection with a sale or purchase of a security which is a subject 
of such communication, the adviser may act as principal for its own 
account or as agent for another person.
    (b) For the purpose of this Rule, publicly distributed written 
materials are those which are distributed to 35 or more persons who pay 
for such materials, and publicly made oral statements are those made 
simultaneously to 35 or more persons who pay for access to such 
statements.

    Note: The requirement that the investment adviser disclose that it 
may act as principal or agent for another person in the sale or purchase 
of a security that is the subject of investment advice does not relieve 
the investment adviser of any disclosure obligation which, depending 
upon the nature of the relationship between the investment adviser and 
the client, may be imposed by subparagraphs (1) or (2) of section 206 or 
the other provisions of the federal securities laws.

Sec. 275.206(3)-2  Agency cross transactions for advisory clients.

    (a) An investment adviser registered under section 203 of the Act 
(15 U.S.C. 80b-3), or a person registered as a broker-dealer under 
section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o) and 
controlling, controlled by or under common control with an investment 
adviser registered under section 203 of the Act, shall be deemed in 
compliance with the provisions of section 206(3) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 
80b-6(3)) in effecting an agency cross transaction for an advisory 
client, if:
    (1) The advisory client has executed a written consent prospectively 
authorizing the investment adviser, or any other person relying on this 
rule, to effect agency cross transactions for such advisory client, 
provided that such written consent is obtained after full written 
disclosure that with respect to agency cross transactions the investment 
adviser or such other person will act as broker for, receive commissions 
from, and have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and 
responsibilities regarding, both parties to such transactions;
    (2) The investment adviser, or any other person relying on this 
rule, sends to each such client a written confirmation at or before the 
completion of each such transaction, which confirmation includes (i) a 
statement of the nature of such transaction, (ii) the date such 
transaction took place, (iii) an offer to furnish upon request, the time 
when such transaction took place, and (iv) the source and amount of any 
other remuneration received or to be received by the investment adviser 
and any other person relying on this rule in connection with the 
transaction, Provided, however, That if, in the case of a purchase, 
neither the investment adviser nor any other person relying on this rule 
was participating in a distribution, or in the case of a sale, neither 
the investment adviser nor any other person relying on this rule was 
participating in a tender offer, the written confirmation may state 
whether any other remuneration has been or will be received and that the 
source and amount of such other remuneration will be furnished upon 
written request of such customer;
    (3) The investment adviser, or any other person relying in this 
rule, sends to each such client, at least annually, and with or as part 
of any written statement or summary of such account from the investment 
adviser or such other person, a written disclosure statement identifying 
the total number of such transactions during the period since the date 
of the last such statement or summary, and the total amount of all 
commissions or other remuneration received or to be received by the 
investment adviser or any other person relying on this rule in 
connection with such transactions during such period;
    (4) Each written disclosure statement and confirmation required by 
this rule includes a conspicuous statement that the written consent 
referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be revoked at any 
time by written notice to the investment adviser, or to any other person 
relying on this rule, from the advisory client; and
    (5) No such transaction is effected in which the same investment 
adviser or

[[Page 729]]

an investment adviser and any person controlling, controlled by or under 
common control with such investment adviser recommended the transaction 
to both any seller and any purchaser.
    (b) For purposes of this rule the term agency cross transaction for 
an advisory client shall mean a transaction in which a person acts as an 
investment adviser in relation to a transaction in which such investment 
adviser, or any person controlling, controlled by, or under common 
control with such investment adviser, acts as broker for both such 
advisory client and for another person on the other side of the 
transaction.
    (c) This rule shall not be construed as relieving in any way the 
investment adviser or another person relying on this rule from acting in 
the best interests of the advisory client, including fulfilling the duty 
with respect to the best price and execution for the particular 
transaction for the advisory client; nor shall it relieve such person or 
persons from any disclosure obligation which may be imposed by 
subparagraphs (1) or (2) of section 206 of the Act or by other 
applicable provisions of the federal securities laws.

           Accounts of ``Separate'' Customers of SIPC Members


<R05>
Sec. 300.100  General.

    (a) For the purpose of sections 9(a)(2) and 16(12) of the Securities 
Investor Protection Act (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''), these 
rules will be applied in determining what accounts held by a person with 
a member of SIPC (hereinafter called a ``member'') are to be deemed 
accounts held in a capacity other than his individual capacity.
    (b) Accounts held by a customer in different capacities, as 
specified by these rules, shall be deemed to be accounts of ``separate'' 
customers.
    (c) A ``person'' as used in these rules includes, but is not limited 
to, an individual, a corporation, a partnership, an association, a joint 
stock company, a trust, an unincorporated organization, or a government 
or political subdivision thereof.
    (d) The burden shall be upon the customer to establish each capacity 
in which he claims to hold accounts separate from his individual 
capacity.


<R05>
Sec. 300.101  Individual accounts.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in these rules, all accounts held 
with a member by a person in his own name, and those which under these 
rules are deemed his individual accounts, shall be combined so as to 
constitute a single account of a separate customer.

[[Page 749]]

    (b) An account held with a member by an agent or nominee for another 
person as a principal or beneficial owner shall, except as otherwise 
provided in these rules, be deemed to be an individual account of such 
principal or beneficial owner.


<R05>
Sec. 300.102  Accounts held by executors, administrators, guardians, etc.

    (a) Accounts held with a member in the name of a decedent or in the 
name of his estate or in the name of the executor or administrator of 
the estate of the decedent shall be combined so as to constitute a 
single account of a separate customer.
    (b) An account held with a member by a guardian, custodian, or 
conservator for the benefit of a ward or for the benefit of a minor 
under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act or in a similar capacity shall be 
deemed to be held by such guardian, custodian, or conservator in a 
different capacity from any account or accounts maintained by such 
person in his individual capacity.


<R05>
Sec. 300.103  Accounts held by a corporation, partnership or unincorporated association.

    A corporation, partnership or unincorporated association holding an 
account with a member shall be deemed to be a separate customer distinct 
from the person or persons owning such corporation or comprising such 
partnership or unincorporated association if on the filing date it 
existed for a purpose other than primarily to obtain or increase 
protection under the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 300.104  Trust accounts.

    (a) A trust account held with a member shall be deemed a 
``qualifying trust account'' if it is held on behalf of a valid and 
subsisting express trust created by a written instrument. No account 
held on behalf of a trust that on the filing date existed primarily to 
obtain or increase protection under the Act shall be deemed to be a 
qualifying trust account.
    (b) A qualifying trust account held with a member shall be deemed 
held by a separate customer of the member, distinct from the trustee, 
the testator or his estate, the settlor, or any beneficiary of the 
trust.
    (c) Any account held with a member on behalf of a trust which does 
not meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this rule shall be deemed 
to be an individual account of the settlor of the trust on behalf of 
which the account is held.


<R05>
Sec. 300.105  Joint accounts.

    (a) A joint account shall be deemed to be a ``qualifying joint 
account'' if it is owned jointly, whether by the owners thereof as joint 
tenants with the right of survivorship, as tenants by the entirety or as 
tenants in common, or by husband and wife as community property, but 
only if each co-owner possesses authority to act with respect to the 
entire account.
    (b) Subject to paragraph (c) of this rule, each qualifying joint 
account with a member shall be deemed held by one separate customer of 
the member.
    (c) All qualifying joint accounts with a member owned by the same 
persons shall be deemed held by the same customer so that the maximum 
protection afforded to such accounts in the aggregate shall be the 
protection afforded to one separate customer of the member
    (d) A joint account with a member which does not meet the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this rule shall be deemed to be an 
individual or qualifying joint account of the co-owner or co-owners 
having the exclusive power to act with respect to it.

             Accounts Introduced by Other Brokers or Dealers


<R05>
Sec. 300.200  General.

    A person having one or more accounts cleared by the member on a 
fully disclosed basis for one or more introducing brokers or dealers is 
a customer of the member and shall be protected with respect to such 
account or accounts without regard to the protection available for any 
other account or accounts he may have with the member.


<R05>
Sec. 300.201  Accounts introduced by same or different broker or dealer.

    All accounts of a person which are introduced by the same broker or 
dealer shall be combined and protected as the single account of a 
separate customer,

[[Page 750]]

unless such accounts are maintained in different capacities as specified 
in Secs. 300.100 through 300.105; accounts introduced by different 
brokers or dealers shall be protected separately.

    For the purpose of these rules, adopted pursuant to section 8(e) of 
the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970, as amended (hereinafter 
referred to as ``the Act''):
    (a) The term failed to receive shall mean a contractual commitment 
of the debtor made in the ordinary course of business to pay to another 
broker or dealer the contract price in cash upon receipt from such 
broker or dealer of securities purchased: Provided, That the respective 
obligations of the parties remained outstanding until the close of 
business on the filing date as defined in section 16(7) of the Act 
(hereinafter referred to as the ``filing date'').
    (b) The term failed to deliver shall mean a contractual commitment 
of the debtor, made in the ordinary course of business, to deliver 
securities to another broker or dealer against receipt from such broker 
or dealer of the contract price in cash: Provided, That the respective 
obligations of the parties remained outstanding until the close of 
business on the filing date.
    (c) The term open contractual commitment shall mean a failed to 
receive or a failed to deliver which had a settlement date prior to the 
filing date and the respective obligations of the parties remained 
outstanding on the filing date or had a settlement date which occurs on 
or within three business days subsequent to the filing date: Provided, 
however, That the term ``open contractual commitment'' shall not include 
any contractual commitment for which the security which is the subject 
of the trade had not been issued by the issuer as of the trade date.
    (d) The term customer shall mean a person (other than a broker or 
dealer) in whose behalf a broker or dealer has executed a transaction 
out of which arose an open contractual commitment with the debtor, but 
shall not include any person to the extent that such person at the 
filing date (1) had a claim for property which by contract, agreement of 
understanding, or by operation of law, was a part of the capital of the 
broker or dealer who executed such transaction or was subordinated to 
the claims of creditors of such broker or dealer, or (2) had a 
relationship with the debtor which is specified in section 9(a)(4) of 
the Act.

[44 FR 21211, Apr. 9, 1979, as amended at 62 FR 10451, Mar. 7, 1997]

    Effective Date Note: At 62 FR 10451, Mar. 7, 1997, in Sec. 300.300, 
paragraph (a) was amended by removing the reference to ``section 16(8)'' 
and in its place adding ``section 16(7),'' and in paragraph (c) removing 
the reference to ``five business days'' and in its place adding ``three 
business days'', effective Apr. 7, 1997.


<R05>
Sec. 300.301  Contracts to be closed out or completed.

    An open contractual commitment shall be closed out or completed if:
    (a) The open contractual commitment:
    (1) Arises from a transaction in which a customer (as defined in 
Sec. 300.300) of the other broker or dealer had an interest. For the 
purposes of this rule a customer is deemed to have an interest in a 
transaction if (i) the other broker was acting as agent for the customer 
or (ii) the other dealer was not a market maker in the security 
involved, to the extent such other dealer held a firm order from the 
customer and in connection therewith: In the case of a buy order, prior 
to executing such customer's order purchased as principal the same 
number of shares or purchased shares to accumulate the number of shares 
necessary to complete the order; or in the case of a sell order, prior 
to executing such customer's order sold the same number of shares or a 
portion thereof; and
    (2)(i) Had a settlement date on or within 30 calendar days prior to 
the filing date and the respective obligations of the parties remained 
outstanding on

[[Page 751]]

the filing date or had a settlement date which occurs on or within three 
business days subsequent to the filing date; and
    (ii) Had a trade date on or within three business days prior to such 
settlement date; and
    (b) The other broker or dealer can establish to the satisfaction of 
the trustee through appropriate documentation that:
    (1) In the case of a broker or dealer who maintains his records on a 
specific identification basis:
    (i) The open contractual commitment arose out of a transaction in 
which his customer had such an interest, and
    (ii) In the case of a failed to deliver of the debtor, as of the 
filing date such broker's or dealer's customer's interest had not been 
sold to such broker or dealer; or
    (2) In the case of a broker or dealer who maintains his records 
other than on a specific identification basis, he has determined that a 
customer had such an interest in a manner consistent with that used by 
such broker or dealer prior to the filing date to allocate fails to 
receive and fails to deliver in computing the special reserve bank 
account requirement pursuant to the provisions of Rule 15c3-3 under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (17 CFR 240.15c3-3); or
    (3) In the case of a broker or dealer not described in paragraph 
(b)(1) or (2) of this section, he has made the determination in a manner 
which the trustee finds to be fair and equitable.

[44 FR 21211, Apr. 9, 1979, as amended at 62 FR 10451, Mar. 7, 1997]

    Effective Date Note: At 62 FR 10451, Mar. 7, 1997, in Sec. 300.301, 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) was amended by removing the 
references to ``five business days'' and in its place adding ``three 
business days'', effective Apr. 7, 1997.


<R05>
Sec. 300.302  Mechanics of closeout or completion.

    (a) The closeout or completion of an open contractual commitment 
meeting the requirements of Sec. 300.301 shall be effected only:
    (1) By the buy-in or sell-out of the commitment by the other broker 
or dealer in accordance with the usual trade practices initiated by the 
other broker or dealer within or promptly upon the expiration of a 
period of 30 calendar days after settlement date; or
    (2) At the option of the trustee by the delivery of securities 
against receipt of the contract price or payment of the contract price 
against the receipt of the securities at any time within 30 calendar 
days after settlement date unless the commitment previously has been 
bought-in or sold-out in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section; or
    (3) In the event of the refusal of the other broker or dealer to 
accept completion of an open contractual commitment in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or the failure of the other broker or 
dealer to promptly buy-in or sell-out a commitment in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or in the event of the failure of the 
other broker or dealer to provide the trustee with appropriate 
documentation as required by Sec. 300.303, by delivery of securities 
against receipt of the contract price or payment of the contract price 
against receipt of securities, or the buy-in or sell-out of the 
commitment or cancellation of the commitment or otherwise, as may be 
appropriate, as the trustee in his discretion will most benefit the 
estate of the debtor.
    (b) In the event of a close-out of an open contractual commitment 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the money differences 
resulting from such close-out shall be payable by the other broker or 
dealer to the trustee or by the trustee to the other broker or dealer, 
whichever would be entitled to receive such difference under the usual 
trade practices: Provided, however, (1) That prior to the payment of any 
such money difference by the trustee to such other broker or dealer with 
respect to transactions executed by such other broker or dealer for any 
separate customer account, all open contractual commitments with respect 
to such account which meet the requirements of Sec. 300.301 must have 
been completed by delivery of securities against receipt of the contract 
price or by payment of the contract price against receipt of the 
securities in conformity with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or by 
buy-in or

[[Page 752]]

sell-out in conformity with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and (2) 
that the net amount so payable by the trustee to the other broker or 
dealer shall not exceed $40,000 with respect to any separate customer 
account.


<R05>
Sec. 300.303  Report to trustee.

    Promptly upon the expiration of 30 calendar days after the filing 
date, or if by the expiration of such 30-day period notice pursuant to 
section 8(a) of the Act of the commencement of proceedings has not been 
published, then as soon as practicable after publication of such notice, 
a broker or dealer who had executed transactions in securities out of 
which arose open contractual commitments with the debtor shall furnish 
to the trustee such information with respect to the buy-in, sell-out or 
other status of open contractual commitments as called for by Forms 300-
A, B and C (Secs. 301.300a-301.300c of this chapter) including 
appropriate supporting documentation and schedules.


<R05>
Sec. 300.304  Retained rights of brokers or dealers.

    (a) Nothing stated in these rules shall be construed to prejudice 
the right of a broker or dealer to any claim against the debtor's 
estate, or the right of the trustee to make any claim against a broker 
or dealer, with respect to a commitment of the debtor which was 
outstanding on the filing date, but (1) which is not described in 
Sec. 300.300(c), or (2) which, although described in Sec. 300.300(c), 
does not meet the requirements specified in Sec. 300.301 or was not 
closed out of completed in accordance with Sec. 300.302 or was not 
reported to the trustee in conformity with Sec. 300.303 or was not 
supported by appropriate documentation.
    (b) Nothing stated in these rules shall be construed to prejudice 
the right of a broker or dealer to a claim against the debtor's estate 
for the amount by which the money difference due the broker or dealer 
upon a buy-in or sell-out may exceed the amount paid by the trustee to 
such broker or dealer.


<R05>
Sec. 300.305  Excluded contracts.

    Notwithstanding the fact that an open contractual commitment 
described in Sec. 300.300(c) meets the requirements of Sec. 300.301 and 
the other requirements of these rules, a court shall not be precluded 
from canceling such commitment, awarding damages, or granting such other 
remedy as it shall deem fair and equitable if, on application of the 
trustee or SIPC, it determines that such commitment was not entered into 
in the ordinary course of business or was entered into by the debtor, or 
the broker or dealer or his customer, for the purposes of creating a 
commitment in contemplation of a liquidation proceeding under the Act. 
Such a determination shall be made after notice and opportunity for 
hearing by the debtor, such broker or dealer, or such customer, and may 
be made before or after the delivery of securities or payment of the 
contract price or before or after any buy-in or sell-out of the open 
contractual commitment, or otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 300.306  Completion or closeout pursuant to SIPC direction.

    In its discretion SIPC may, in order to prevent a substantial 
detrimental impact upon the finanical condition of one or more brokers 
or dealers, direct the closeout or completion of an open contractual 
commitment, irrespective of whether it is described in Sec. 300.300(c) 
or meets the requirements of Sec. 300.301 or has been reported in 
conformity with Sec. 300.303 or is supported by appropriate 
documentation. SIPC shall consult with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission before SIPC makes any determinations under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 300.307  Completion with cash or securities of customer.

    The trustee may, if authorized by the court, complete an open 
contractual commitment of the debtor, regardless of whether it is 
described in Sec. 300.300(c) or meets the requirements of Sec. 300.301 
or has been reported to the trustee in conformity with Sec. 300.303, to 
the extent that such commitment is completed with customer name 
securities of the customer of the debtor for whose account the 
commitment was made, or with cash or securities paid or delivered by or 
for the account of such customer to the debtor or trustee after the 
filing date.

[[Page 753]]


<R05>
Sec. 300.400  Satisfaction of customer claims for standardized options.

    (a) For the purpose of sections 7(b)(1), 8 (b) and (d), and 16(11) 
of the Securities Investor Protection Act (hereinafter referred to as 
``the Act''), this rule will be applied in determining what a customer 
will receive in either (1) a liquidation proceeding pursuant to the Act 
or (2) a direct payment procedure pursuant to section 10 of the Act, in 
satisfaction of a claim based upon Standardized Options positions.
    (b) As promptly as practicable after the initiation of a liquidation

the rights of a trustee in a liquidation proceeding under the Act to 
avoid any securities transaction as fraudulent, preferential, or 
otherwise voidable under applicable law.

the right of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, in a direct

transaction which could have been avoided in a liquidation proceeding

<R05>
Sec. 400.1  Scope of regulations.

    (a) Title I of the Government Securities Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-
571, 100 Stat. 3208) amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (48 
Stat. 881-905; 15 U.S.C. chapter 2B) (``Act'') by adding section 15C, 
authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate regulations 
concerning the financial responsibility, protection of customer 
securities and balances, recordkeeping and reporting of brokers and 
dealers in government securities. Those regulations constitute 
subchapter A of this chapter. Unless otherwise explicitly provided, all 
regulations in this subchapter apply to all government securities 
brokers or dealers, including registered brokers or dealers and 
financial institutions.
    (b) Section 15C(a)(1)(A) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-5(a)(1)(A)) 
requires all government securities brokers and government securities 
dealers, except those who are brokers or dealers registered pursuant to 
section 15 or section 15B of the Act or financial institutions, to 
register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''). 
Regulations concerning registration are at Sec. 240.15Ca2-1 et seq. of 
this title. The Commission is responsible for the interpretation of the 
definitions of government securities broker and government securities 
dealer and of the regulations at Sec. 240.15Ca2-1 et seq.
    (c) Section 15C(a)(1)(B)(i) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-5(a)(1)(B)(i)) 
requires all government securities brokers or dealers that are also 
registered brokers or dealers to notify the Commission of their status 
as government securities brokers or dealers. Regulations concerning 
notice are at Sec. 240.15Ca1-1 of this title.
    (d) Section 15C(a)(1)(B)(i) of the Act also requires all government 
securities brokers or dealers that are financial institutions to notify 
the appropriate regulatory agency, as defined in section 3(a)(34)(G) of 
the Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(34)(G)), of their status as government 
securities brokers or dealers. The form of notice, Form G-FIN, is at 
Sec. 449.1 of this chapter. Forms are available from the appropriate 
regulatory agency.
    (e) Section 104 of the Government Securities Act Amendments of 1993 
(Pub. L. 103-202, 107 Stat. 2344) amended Section 15C of the Act (15 
U.S.C. 78o-5) by adding a new subsection (f), authorizing the Secretary 
of the Treasury to adopt rules to require specified persons holding, 
maintaining or controlling a large position in to-be-issued or recently-
issued Treasury securities to report such a position and make and keep 
records related to such a position. Part 420 of this subchapter contains 
the rules governing large position reporting.

[52 FR 27926, July 24, 1987, as amended at 61 FR 48348, Sept. 12, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 400.2  Office responsible for regulations; filing of requests for exemptions, for interpretations and of other materials.

    (a) Office responsible. The regulations in this chapter are 
promulgated by the Assistant Secretary (Domestic Finance) pursuant to a 
delegation of authority from the Secretary of the Treasury. The office 
responsible for implementation of the regulations, including 
interpretations and action on requests for exemption, classification

[[Page 759]]

or modification, is the Office of the Commissioner, Bureau of the Public 
Debt.
    (b)(1) Exemptions and classifications. Section 15C(a)(4) of the Act 
(15 U.S.C. 78o-5(a)(4)) authorizes the Secretary to exempt any 
government securities broker or dealer or class thereof, conditionally 
or unconditionally, from the requirements of registration or regulations 
promulgated under section 15C. In addition, section 15C(b)(3) of the Act 
(15 U.S.C. 78o-5(b)(3)) provides for classificatign, by the Secretary, 
of government securities brokers or dealers and authorizes the whole or 
partial exemption of classes from rules under section 15C or the 
application of different standards to different classes.
    (2) Interpretations. Although the appropriate regulatory agencies, 
as defined in Sec. 400.3, and the self-regulatory organizations, as 
defined in section 3(a)(26) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26)), have 
enforcement responsibility under section 15C of the Act, Treasury is 
responsible for interpretation of section 15C(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 
78o-5(b)) and related sections and for interpretation and amendment of 
the regulations under this chapter (with the exception of Forms G-FIN 
and G-FINW, Secs. 449.1 and 449.2 of this chapter, which are the 
responsibility of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
[``Board'']).
    (c) Requests for interpretations, exemptions, classifications. (1) 
Interpretations under this chapter may be provided, at the discretion of 
the Department, to firms or individuals actually or potentially affected 
by the Act or regulations, or to their representatives.
    (2) Exemptions and classifications under sections 15C (a), (b) and 
(d) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-5 (a), (b), and (d)) and related sections 
and Treasury regulations thereunder may be provided at the discretion of 
the Department and after consultation with the SEC and the Board, to 
firms or individuals actually or potentially affected by the Act or 
regulations, or to their representatives.
    (3) All requests for exemptions and classifications, and all 
requests for binding interpretations, shall be in writing, and shall 
conform to the following procedures.
    (i) The names of the company or companies and all other persons 
involved shall be stated. Letters pertaining to unnamed companies or 
persons or hypothetical situations will not be answered.
    (ii) The letter must contain a concise but complete statement of all 
material facts, a complete and accurate description of the entire 
transaction if the request is transactional (even though a request may 
apply to only a portion of a transaction), and a concise and unambiguous 
statement of the request, including precise statutory and regulatory 
citations.
    (iii) The letter shall indicate why the writer believes a problem 
exists or interpretation is needed, the writer's opinion on the matter, 
and the basis for such opinion.
    (iv) In addition to requests for confidential treatment under 
paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, a person may request confidential 
treatment of information that is submitted as part of, or in support of, 
a request for interpretation, exemption, or classification. A separate 
request for confidential treatment and the basis for such request shall 
be submitted at the time the information for which confidential 
treatment is requested is submitted. The request for confidential 
treatment must specifically identify the information for which such 
confidential treatment is requested. To the extent practicable, the 
information should be segregated from information for which confidential 
treatment is not requested and should be clearly marked as confidential.
    (v) Information designated as confidential in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section shall not be disclosed to a person 
requesting such information other than in accordance with the procedures 
outlined in the Department's regulations published at 31 CFR 1.6.
    (vi) An original and two copies of each request letter shall be 
submitted to the Office of the Commissioner, Bureau of the Public Debt, 
Room 553, 999 E Street NW., Washington, DC 20239-0001. The envelope 
shall be marked ``Government Securities Act Request.'' The letter shall 
indicate in the upper right hand corner of the first page the

[[Page 760]]

particular sections of the Act and of the regulations at issue.
    (4) A written response by the Department to a request filed as 
stated in paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall be binding, with 
respect to the requester, on the Department, but shall cease to be 
binding if the facts are not as stated in the request or, prospectively, 
if the Department issues a superseding interpretation. In responding to 
such a request, the Department will, where appropriate, consult with and 
may obtain the formal concurrence of the appropriate regulatory agencies 
or their staffs. The Department understands that even if formal 
concurrence is not received the appropriate regulatory agencies and 
self-regulatory organizations will give appropriate deference to binding 
interpretations of the Department. The Department also expects the SEC 
staff to reflect such interpretations in responding, pursuant to the 
established procedures of the Commission, to no-action requests 
concerning rules the SEC enforces.
    (5) The Department may decline to issue an interpretation for any 
reason and, in particular, may require that a requester make inquiry of 
its appropriate regulatory agency, the Commission or designated 
examining authority before the Department responds to a request.
    (6) The Department will also provide informal oral and written 
advice, but such advice is not binding on the Department or on any other 
agency or organization.
    (7)(i) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(iv) and (c)(7)(ii) of 
this section, every letter or other written communication requesting the 
Department to provide interpretive legal advice under the Act or to 
grant, deny or modify an exemption, classification or modification of 
the regulations, together with any written response thereto, shall be 
made available for inspection and copying as soon as practicable after 
the response has been sent or given to the person requesting it. These 
documents will be made available at the following location: Treasury 
Department Library, Room 5030, Main Treasury Building, 1500 Pennsylvania 
Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20220.
    (ii) Any person submitting a letter or communication may also 
simultaneously submit a request that the letter or communication and the 
Department's response be accorded confidential treatment for a specified 
period of time not to exceed 120 days from the date the response has 
been made or given to such person. The request shall state the basis 
upon which the request for confidential treatment has been made. If the 
Department determines that the request for confidential treatment should 
be denied, the requester will be given 30 days to withdraw either the 
request for confidential treatment or the letter or communication 
requesting an interpretation, classification, or exemption.
    (d) Effect of Commission interpretations. Interpretations of the 
Commission and its staff (including no-action positions) and of the 
designated examining authorities, of any Commission regulation expressly 
adopted by reference in these regulations shall be of the same effect as 
if the regulation being interpreted were solely the Commission's 
regulation. However, in the event the Treasury has issued a formal 
interpretation on the subject, the Treasury understands that the 
Commission will give that interpretation appropriate deference, 
particularly with respect to both subsequent no-action positions and the 
continued validity of prior no-action positions.

    (a) Application of part. This part applies to all government 
securities brokers and dealers, except as otherwise provided herein.
    (b) Registered brokers or dealers. This part does not apply to a 
registered broker or dealer that is subject to Sec. 240.15c3-1 of this 
title (SEC Rule 15c3-1).
    (c) Financial institutions. This part does not apply to a government 
securities broker or dealer that is a financial institution and that is:
    (1) Subject to the rules and regulations of its appropriate 
regulatory agency concerning capital requirements, or
    (2) A branch or agency of a foreign bank subject to regulation, 
supervision, and examination by state or Federal authorities having

    (d) Futures commission merchants. A futures commission merchant 
subject to Sec. 1.17 of this title that is a government securities 
broker or dealer but is not a registered broker or dealer shall not be

requirement of Sec. 1.17 or Sec. 240.15c3-1, except paragraph (e)(3) 
thereof, of this title, whichever is greater.
    (e) Government securities interdealer broker. (1) A government 
securities

[[Page 770]]

interdealer broker, as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, may, 
with the prior written consent of the Secretary, elect not to be subject 
to the limitations of Sec. 402.2 but rather to be subject to the 
requirements of Sec. 240.15c3-1 of this title (SEC Rule 15c3-1), except 
paragraphs (c)(2)(ix) and (e)(3) thereof, and paragraphs (e)(3) through 
(8) of this section by filing such election in writing with its 
designated examining authority. A government securities interdealer 
broker may not revoke such election without the written consent of its 
designated examining authority.
    (2)(i) Government securities interdealer broker means an entity 
engaged exclusively in business as a broker that effects, on an 
initially fully disclosed or identified group basis, transactions in 
government securities for counterparties that are government securities 
brokers or dealers who have registered or given notice pursuant to 
section 15C(a)(1) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-5(a)(1)), and that promptly 
transmits all funds and delivers all securities received in connection 
with its activities as a government securities interdealer broker and 
does not otherwise hold funds or securities for or owe money or 
securities to its counterparties and, except as provided in paragraph 
(e)(2)(ii) of this section, does not have or maintain any government 
securities in its proprietary or other accounts. For the purpose of this 
paragraph (e)(2)(i), ``identified group basis'' means that a 
counterparty has consented to the identity of the specific group of 
entities from which the other counterparty is chosen.
    (ii) A government securities interdealer broker may have or maintain 
government securities in its proprietary or other accounts only as a 
result of:
    (A) Engaging in overnight reverse repurchase or securities borrowed 
transactions solely for the purpose of facilitating the process of 
clearing government securities transactions;
    (B) Engaging in overnight repurchase or securities loaned 
transactions solely for the purpose of reducing its financing expense in 
connection with the clearance of government securities transactions;
    (C) Subordinated loans subject to satisfactory subordination 
agreements pursuant to Sec. 240.l5c3-1(d) of this title;
    (D) Collateral or depository requirements of a clearing corporation 
or association with which it participates in the clearance of government 
securities transactions; or
    (E) The investment of its excess cash.

The maturities of any government securities held or maintained under 
paragraph (e)(2)(ii) (C), (D), or (E) of this section may not exceed one

government securities interdealer broker shall at all times have and 
maintain net capital, as defined in Sec. 240.15c3-1(c)(2) of this title 
with the modifications of this paragraph (e), of not less than 
$1,000,000.
    (4) For purposes of this paragraph (e), a government securities 
interdealer broker need not deduct loans to commercial banks for one 
business day of immediately available funds (commonly referred to as 
``sales of federal funds'') held by the government securities 
interdealer broker in connection with the clearance of securities on the 
day the loan is made.
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph (e), a government securities 
interdealer broker need not deduct net pair-off receivables and money 
differences until the close of business of the third business day 
following the day the funds are due and give-up receivables outstanding 
no more than 30 days from the billing date, which shall be no later than 
the last day of the month in which they arise, as otherwise would be 
required under Sec. 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(iv)(B) of this title.
    (6) For purposes of this paragraph (e), a government securities 
interdealer broker shall deduct from net worth \1/4\ of 1 percent of the 
contract value of each government securities failed-to-deliver contract 
which is outstanding 5 business days or longer. Such deduction shall be 
increased by any excess of the contract price of the failed-to-deliver 
contract over the market value of the underlying security.
    (7) For purposes of this paragraph (e), a government securities 
interdealer broker may exclude from its aggregate indebtedness 
computation indebtedness

[[Page 771]]

adequately collateralized by government securities outstanding for not 
more than one business day and offset by government securities failed to 
deliver of the same issue and quantity. In no event may a government 
securities interdealer broker exclude any overnight bank loan 
attributable to the same government securities failed-to-deliver 
contract for more than one business day. A government securities 
interdealer broker need not deduct from net worth the amount by which 
the market value of securities failed to receive outstanding longer than 
thirty (30) calendar days exceeds the contract value of those failed to 
receive as required by Sec. 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(iv)(E) of this title.
    (8)(i) For purposes of this paragraph (e), a government securities 
interdealer broker shall deduct from net worth 5 percent of its net 
exposure to each counterparty.
    (ii) Net exposure. For purposes of this paragraph (e), net exposure 
shall equal:
    (A) The sum of the dollar amount of funds, debt instruments, other 
securities, and other inventory at risk, in the first instance, to the 
government securities interdealer broker in the event of the 
counterparty's default,
    (B) Reduced, but not to less than zero, by the sum of:
    (1) The dollar amount of funds, debt instruments, other securities, 
and other inventory at risk, in the first instance, to the counterparty 
in the event of the government securities interdealer broker's default;
    (2) The deductions taken from net worth for unsecured receivables, 
repurchase and reverse repurchase deficits, aged fails to deliver, and 
aged fails to receive arising from transactions with the counterparty;
    (3) Demand deposits in the case where the counterparty is a 
commercial bank;
    (4) Loans for one business day of immediately available funds 
(commonly referred to as ``sales of federal funds'') held by the 
government securities interdealer broker in connection with the 
clearance of securities on the day the loan is made in the case where 
the counterparty is a commercial bank;
    (5) Custodial holdings of securities in the case where the 
counterparty is a clearing bank or clearing broker of the government 
securities interdealer broker; and
    (6) Exposure to a counterparty due to holding marketable instruments 
subject to market risk haircuts under appendix A to this section 
(Sec. 402.2a) for which the counterparty is the obligor.
    (9) On the application of the government securities interdealer 
broker, the designated examining authority may extend the periods of 
time in this paragraph (e) if it determines that the extension is 
warranted because of exceptional circumstances and that the government 
securities interdealer broker is acting in good faith.
    (f) Effective date. This part shall be effective July 25, 1987, 
provided however, that until the last business day in October 1987, 
registered government securities brokers and dealers need not comply 
with Sec. 402.2 (a), (b), and (c) as long as:
    (1) A registered government securities broker or dealer that acts 
solely as an introducing broker within the meaning of Sec. 240.15c3-
1(a)(2) of this title has and maintains liquid capital, as defined in 
Sec. 402.2(d), in an amount of not less than $5,000; and
    (2) Any other registered government securities broker or dealer has 
and maintains liquid capital, as defined in Sec. 402.2(d), in an amount 
of not less than $50,000.

    (B) Reduced, but not to less than zero, by the sum of:
    (1) The dollar amount of funds, debt instruments, other securities, 
and other inventory at risk to the counterparty in the event of the

of 5 percent and the net credit exposure to a single counterparty not in 
excess of 15 percent of the government securities broker's or dealer's 
liquid capital.

stock by any of the consolidated entities or through the payment of 
dividends or any similar distribution, nor may any unsecured advance or 
loan be made to a stockholder, partner, sole proprietor, employee or 
affiliate without providing written notice, given in accordance with

securities broker or dealer, in an emergency situation, may make 
withdrawals, advances or loans that on a net basis exceed 30 percent of 
the government securities broker's or dealer's excess liquid capital in 
any 30 calendar day period without giving the advance notice required by 
this paragraph, with the prior approval of its designated examining 
authority. When a government securities broker or dealer makes a 
withdrawal with the consent of its designated examining authority, it 
shall in any event comply with paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section; and

    (iii) This paragraph (i)(1) of this section does not apply to:
    (A) Securities or commodities transactions in the ordinary course of 
business between a government securities broker or dealer and an

    (2) Withdrawal limitations. No equity capital of the government 
securities broker or dealer or a subsidiary or affiliate consolidated 
pursuant to appendix C to this section, Sec. 402.2c, may be withdrawn by 
action of a stockholder or a partner, or by redemption or repurchase of 
shares of stock by any of the consolidated entities or through the 
payment of dividends or any similar distribution, nor may any unsecured 
advance or loan be made to a stockholder, partner, sole proprietor, 
employee or affiliate if, after giving effect thereto and to any other 
such withdrawals, advances or loans and any Payments of Payment 
Obligations (as defined in Sec. 240.15c3-1d of this title, appendix D to 
SEC Rule 15c3-1, modified as provided in appendix D to this section, 
Sec. 402.2d) under satisfactory subordination agreements which are 
scheduled to occur within 180 calendar days following such withdrawal, 
advance or loan, either:
    (i) The ratio of liquid capital to total haircuts, determined as 
provided in Sec. 402.2, would be less than 150 percent; or
    (ii) Liquid capital minus total haircuts would be less than 120 
percent of the minimum capital required by Sec. 402.2(b) or 
Sec. 402.2(c) as applicable; or
    (iii) In the case of any government securities broker or dealer 
included in such consolidation, the total outstanding principal amounts 
of satisfactory subordination agreements of the government securities 
broker or dealer (other than such agreements which qualify as equity 
under Sec. 240.15c3-1(d) of this title) would exceed 70% of the debt-
equity total as defined in Sec. 240.15c3-1(d).
    (3) Miscellaneous provisions. (i) Excess liquid capital is that 
amount in excess of the amount required by the greater of Sec. 402.2(a) 
or, Secs. 402.2 (b) or (c), as applicable. For the purposes of 
paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) of this section, a government securities 
broker or dealer may use the amount of excess liquid capital, liquid 
capital and total haircuts reported in its most recently required filed 
Form G-405 for the purposes of calculating the effect of a projected 
withdrawal, advance or loan relative to excess liquid capital or total 
haircuts. The government securities broker or dealer must assure itself 
that the excess liquid capital, liquid capital or the total haircuts 
reported on the most recently required filed Form G-405 have not 
materially changed since the time such report was filed.
    (ii) The term equity capital includes capital contributions by 
partners, par or stated value of capital stock, paid-in capital in 
excess of par, retained earnings or other capital accounts. The term 
equity capital does not include securities in the securities accounts of 
partners and balances in limited partners' capital accounts in excess of 
their stated capital contributions.
    (iii) Paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) of this section shall not 
preclude a government securities broker or dealer from making required 
tax payments or preclude the payment to partners of reasonable 
compensation, and such payments shall not be included in the calculation 
of withdrawals, advances or loans for purposes of paragraphs (i)(1) and 
(i)(2) of this section.
    (iv) For the purposes of this subsection (i), any transaction 
between a government securities broker or dealer and a stockholder, 
partner, sole proprietor, employee or affiliate that results in a 
diminution of the government securities broker's or dealer's liquid 
capital shall be deemed to be an advance or loan of liquid capital.
    (j) Modification of appendices to Sec. 240.15c3-1 of this title. For 
purposes of this section, appendix C to this section (Sec. 402.2c) is 
substituted for appendix C to Rule 15c3-1 (Sec. 240.15c3-1c of this 
title), and appendix D to Rule 15c3-1 (Sec. 240.15c3-1d of this title),

Sec. 402.2a  Appendix A--Calculation of market risk haircut for purposes of Sec. 402.2(g)(2).

    The market risk haircut is the sum of the Treasury market risk 
haircut

[[Page 778]]

and the other securities haircut, calculated as follows.
    (a) Treasury market risk haircut. The ``Treasury market risk 
haircut'' equals the sum of the total governments offset portion 
haircut, the total futures and options offset haircut, the total hedging 
disallowance haircut, and the residual net position haircut, calculated 
with respect to financings and positions in Treasury market risk 
instruments, except to the extent that a permissible election is made 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section to include qualified 
positions in the calculation of the other securities haircut.
    (1) Total governments offset portion haircut. The ``total 
governments offset portion haircut'' equals the sum of the governments 
offset portion haircuts calculated for each category in 
Sec. 402.2(f)(1). The ``governments offset portion haircuts'' equal, for 
each category in Sec. 402.2(f)(1), the product of the offset haircut 
factor for that category set out in Sec. 402.2(f)(2) and the smaller of 
the absolute values of the gross long immediate position or gross short 
immediate position for that category. Schedules B and C in paragraph (c) 
of this section can be used to make this calculation.
    (i)(A) The ``gross long immediate position'' for purposes of this 
part equals, for each category except categories MB and AR in 
Sec. 402.2(f)(1), the sum of the market values of each long immediate 
position in Treasury market risk instruments with a term to maturity 
(or, in the case of a floating rate note, the time to the next scheduled 
interest rate adjustment or the term to maturity, whichever is less) 
corresponding to such category, the contract values of each reverse 
repurchase agreement with a term to maturity or time to the next 
scheduled interest rate adjustment, whichever is less, corresponding to 
that category, and the values of the cash collateral of each security 
borrowing with a term to maturity or time to next scheduled interest 
rate adjustment, whichever is less, corresponding to such category.
    (B) In the case of category MB, the ``gross long immediate 
position'' equals the sum of the market values of all long immediate 
positions in fixed rate mortgage-backed securities which are Treasury 
market risk instruments.
    (C) In the case of category AR, the ``gross long immediate 
position'' equals the sum of the market values of all long immediate 
positions in adjustable rate mortgage-backed securities which are 
Treasury market risk instruments.
    (ii)(A) The ``gross short immediate position'' for purposes of this 
section equals, for each category except categories MB and AR in 
Sec. 402.2(f)(1), the sum of the market values of each short immediate 
position in Treasury market risk instruments with a term to maturity 
(or, in the case of a floating rate note, the time to the next scheduled 
interest rate adjustment or the term to maturity, whichever is less) 
corresponding to such category, and the values of funds received from 
each financing transaction (including repurchase agreements, securities 
lending secured by cash collateral, and term financings, but excluding 
subordinated debt which meets the requirements of Sec. 240.15c3-1d of 
this title modified as provided in Sec. 402.2d) with a term to maturity 
or time to the next scheduled interest rate adjustment, whichever is 
less, corresponding to that category.
    (B) In the case of category MB, the ``gross short immediate 
position'' equals the sum of the market values of all short immediate 
positions in fixed rate mortgage-backed securities which are Treasury 
market risk instruments.
    (C) In the case of category AR, the ``gross short immediate 
position'' equals the sum of the market values of all short immediate 
positions in adjustable rate mortgage-backed securities which are 
Treasury market risk instruments.
    (iii) The term long immediate position in a Treasury market risk 
instrument means, for purposes of this part:
    (A) The net long position in a Treasury market risk instrument as of 
the trade date, except when the settlement date, in the case of a 
Treasury market risk instrument except a mortgage-backed security, is 
scheduled more than five business days in the future, and, in the case 
of a mortgage-backed security, more than thirty calendar days in the 
future;

[[Page 779]]

    (B) The net long when-issued position in a marketable U.S. Treasury 
security between announcement and issue date;
    (C) The net long when-issued position in a government agency or a 
government-sponsored agency debt security between release date and issue 
date; and
    (D) The net long when-issued position in a security described in 
Sec. 402.2(e)(1)(vi) between announcement date and issue date.
    (iv) The term short immediate position on a Treasury market risk 
instrument means, for purposes of this part:
    (A) The net short position in a Treasury market risk instrument as 
of the trade date, except when the settlement date, in the case of a 
Treasury market risk instrument except a mortgage-backed security, is 
scheduled more than five business days in the future, and, in the case 
of a mortgage-backed security, more than thirty calendar days in the 
future;
    (B) The net short when-issued position in a marketable U.S. Treasury 
security between announcement and issue date;
    (C) The net short when-issued position in a government agency or a 
government-sponsored agency debt security between release date and issue 
date; and
    (D) The net short when-issued position in a security described in 
Sec. 402.2(e)(1)(vi) between announcement date and issue date.
    (2) Net immediate position interim haircut. The ``net immediate 
position interim haircut'' equals, for each category in 
Sec. 402.2(f)(1), the product of the net position haircut factor for 
that category and the sum of the gross long immediate position and the 
gross short immediate position for that category. For purposes of this 
part, a gross long immediate position shall be a positive number and a 
gross short immediate position shall be a negative number. Schedules B 
and C in paragraph (c) of this section can be used to make this 
calculation.
    (3) Total futures and options offset haircut. The ``total futures 
and options offset haircut'' equals the sum of the futures and options 
offset haircuts calculated for each category in Sec. 402.2(f)(1). The 
``futures and options offset haircut'' equals, for each category in 
Sec. 402.2(f)(1), the product of a futures and options offset factor of 
20 percent and the smaller of the absolute values of the positive and 
negative aggregate interim haircuts for that category. Schedule D in 
paragraph (c) of this section can be used to make this calculation.
    (i) Positive aggregate interim haircut. The ``positive aggregate 
interim haircut'' equals, for each category in Sec. 402.2(f)(1), the sum 
of the positive net immediate position interim haircut (see paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section), the gross long futures and forward interim 
haircut, and the positive gross options interim haircut for that 
category. Schedule D in paragraph (c) of this section can be used to 
make this calculation.
    (A) Gross long futures and forward interim haircut. The ``gross long 
futures and forward interim haircut'' equals, for each category in 
Sec. 402.2(f)(1), the sum of the interim haircuts on each long futures 
position and long forward position placed, in the case of a futures or 
forward contract which is a Treasury market risk instrument except those 
on mortgage-backed securities, in the category corresponding to the sum 
of the term to maturity of the contract and the term to maturity of the 
underlying instrument at the time of the maturity of the contract or, in 
the case of a futures or forward contract on Treasury market risk 
mortgage-backed securities, in the category corresponding to the type of 
Treasury market risk mortgage-backed security.
    (1) For purposes of this part, the interim haircut on each long 
futures position and each long forward position is the product of the 
net position haircut factor for the category corresponding to, in the 
case of a futures or forward contract which is a Treasury market risk 
instrument except those on mortgage-backed securities, the maturity of 
the underlying instrument at the time of the maturity of the contract 
or, in the case of a futures or forward contract on Treasury market risk 
mortgage-backed securities, the type of Treasury market risk mortgage-
backed security and the value of the long futures position or long 
forward position

[[Page 780]]

evaluated at the current market price for such contract.
    (2) For purposes of this part, the gross long futures and forward 
interim haircut shall be a positive number.
    (B) Positive gross options interim haircut. The ``positive gross 
options interim haircut'' equals, for each category in Sec. 402.2(f)(1), 
the sum of the interim haircuts on each purchased call and sold put 
placed in the category in which the underlying instrument would be 
placed.
    (1) For purposes of this part, the ``interim haircut on each 
purchased call and sold put'' equals the lesser of the market value of 
the option or, (i) in the case of an option on a cash instrument, the 
product of the net position haircut factor for the category to which the 
underlying cash instrument corresponds and the market value of the 
underlying cash instrument or, (ii) in the case of an option on a 
futures contract, the interim haircut on the underlying futures 
contract.
    (2) For purposes of this part, the positive gross options interim 
haircut is a positive number.
    (ii) Negative aggregate interim haircut. The ``negative aggregate 
interim haircut'' equals, for each category in Sec. 402.2(f)(1), the sum 
of the negative net immediate position interim haircut (see paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section), the gross short futures and forward interim 
haircut, and the negative gross options interim haircut for that 
category. Schedule D in paragraph (c) of this section can be used to 
make this calculation.
    (A) Gross short futures and forward interim haircut. The ``gross 
short futures and forward interim haircut'' equals, for each category in 
Sec. 402.2(f)(1), the sum of the interim haircuts on each short futures 
position and short forward position placed, in the case of a futures or 
forward contract which is a Treasury market risk instrument except those 
on mortgage-backed securities, in the category corresponding to the sum 
of the term to maturity of the contract and the term to maturity of the 
underlying instrument at the time of the maturity of the contract or, in 
the case of a futures or forward contract on Treasury market risk 
mortgage-backed securities, in the category corresponding to the type of 
Treasury market risk mortgage-backed security.
    (1) For purposes of this part, the ``interim haircut on each short 
futures position and each short forward position'' is the product of the 
net position haircut factor for the category corresponding to, in the 
case of a futures or forward contract which is a Treasury market risk 
instrument except those on mortgage-backed securities, the maturity of 
the underlying instrument at the time of the maturity of the contract 
or, in the case of a futures or forward contract on Treasury market risk 
mortgage-backed securities, the type of Treasury market risk mortgage-
backed security and the value of the short futures position or short 
forward position evaluated at the current market price for such 
contract.
    (2) For purposes of this part, the gross short futures and forward 
interim haircut is a negative number.
    (B) Negative gross options interim haircut. The ``negative gross 
options interim haircut'' equals, for each category in Sec. 402.2(f)(1), 
the sum of the interim haircuts on each sold call and purchased put 
placed in the category in which the underlying instrument would be 
placed.
    (1) For purposes of this part, the ``interim haircut on each sold 
call and purchased put'' equals the lesser of the market value of the 
option or, (i) in the case of an option on a cash instrument, the 
product of the net position haircut factor for the category to which the 
underlying cash instrument corresponds and the market value of the 
underlying cash instrument or, (ii) in the case of an option on a 
futures contract, the interim haircut on the underlying futures 
contract.
    (2) For purposes of this part, the negative gross options interim 
haircut is a negative number.
    (4) Total hedging disallowance haircut. The ``total hedging 
disallowance haircut'' equals the sum of the hedging disallowance 
haircuts calculated pursuant to each netting of qualified netting 
interim haircuts. The ``hedging disallowance haircut'' equals the 
absolute value of the product of the applicable category pair hedging 
disallowance haircut factor specified in Sec. 402.2(f)(3) and the 
smaller in absolute value of

[[Page 781]]

any two qualified netting interim haircuts, netted in accordance with 
the provisions of this paragraph. Schedule E in paragraph (c) of this 
section can be used to make this calculation.
    (i) Qualified netting interim haircut. The term ``qualified netting 
interim haircut'' means a residual position interim haircut or a net 
residual position interim haircut.
    (A) Residual position interim haircut. The ``residual position 
interim haircut'' equals, for each category in Sec. 402.2(f)(1), the sum 
of the positive aggregate interim haircut and the negative aggregate 
interim haircut corresponding to the category, calculated in accordance 
with the provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
    (B)(1) Net residual position interim haircut. The ``net residual 
position interim haircut'' equals, for any two categories between which 
netting is permitted, the sum of (i) the residual position interim 
haircuts calculated for those categories, in the case of the category of 
the larger in absolute value of the two residual position interim 
haircuts being netted, and (ii) zero, in the case of the category of the 
smaller in absolute value of the two residual position interim haircuts 
being netted.
    (2) For the purposes of this paragraph (a)(4), netting is permitted 
only between categories for which a category pair hedging disallowance 
haircut factor has been specified in paragraph Sec. 402.2(f)(3).
    (ii) Net residual position interim haircuts shall be substituted for 
the residual position interim haircuts in the respective categories in 
which they have been placed and shall be considered as if they were 
residual position interim haircuts. New net residual position interim 
haircuts may continue to be calculated until for each category pair for 
which netting is permitted at least one of the two qualified netting 
interim haircuts is zero or both qualified netting interim haircuts are 
of the same sign.
    (5) Residual net position haircut. The ``residual net position 
haircut'' equals the sum of the absolute values of all qualified netting 
interim haircuts remaining in each category after the completion of the 
calculation of permissible nettings described in paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section. Schedule E in paragraph (c) of this section can be used to 
make this calculation.
    (b) Other securities haircut. The ``other securities haircut'' 
equals the sum of all deductions specified in Sec. 240.15c3-1 (c)(2)(vi) 
and (c)(2)(viii) of this title and Secs. 240.15c3-1a and 240.l5c3-1b of 
this title for long and short positions in securities, futures 
contracts, forward contracts, options, and other inventory which are not 
Treasury market risk instruments as defined in Sec. 402.2(e).
    (1) A registered government securities broker or dealer may elect to 
exclude from its calculation of the Treasury market risk haircut and 
include in its calculation of the other securities haircut long and 
short positions in Treasury market risk instruments if such positions 
form part of a hedge against long and short positions in securities, 
futures contracts, forward contracts, or options which are not Treasury 
market risk instruments. Only the portion of the total position in a 
Treasury market risk instrument that forms part of such hedge may be 
excluded from the calculation of the Treasury market risk haircut and 
included in the calculation of the other securities haircut.
    (2) For purposes of this paragraph (b), a gross long or short 
position in Treasury market risk instruments shall be considered part of 
a hedge if the inclusion of such position in the calculation of the 
other securities haircut would serve to reduce said haircut.
    (3) For purposes of this paragraph (b) as it relates to 
Sec. 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(M) (``undue concentration''), references to 
``10 percent of the ``net capital''' shall be understood to refer to 10 
percent of the liquid capital and references to ``Appendix (D) (17 CFR 
240.15c3-1d)'' shall be understood to refer to such section as modified 
by Sec. 402.2d.
    (c) Schedules. This paragraph sets forth schedules which may be used 
by government securities brokers or dealers in the calculation of total 
haircuts as required by this part 402. The appropriate regulatory agency 
or designated examining authority may specify other substantially 
similar forms required to be used by government securities brokers or 
dealers in the calculation of such haircuts.

                  Instructions to Schedules A through E

    Schedules A through E may be used by government securities brokers 
or dealers subject to 17 CFR 402 to determine the firm's capital-to-risk 
ratio. Section 402.2 provides that a government securities broker or 
dealer must meet the applicable minimum dollar liquid capital 
requirement and that the firm's ratio of liquid capital to risk (total 
haircuts) must be at least 1.2:1; liquid capital must exceed risk by at 
least 20 percent. Total haircuts is the risk measure used in the ratio; 
it is made up of measures of market risk and measures of credit risk. 
The market risk of a government securities broker's or dealer's 
positions is accounted for through the Treasury market risk haircut and 
the other securities haircut. Credit risk is accounted for in the 
counterparty exposure, concentration of credit, and credit volatility 
haircuts and in the computation of liquid capital through the various 
deductions and charges.
    Only positions in Treasury market risk instruments and financings 
may be used in the calculation of the Treasury market risk haircut. 
Treasury market risk instruments and financings are described in 17 CFR 
402.2 and in the instructions to the schedule where they are to be first 
entered. All other types of financial instruments are to be included in 
the calculation of the other securities haircut. Calculation of the 
other securities haircut is based on the SEC's Rule 15c3-1 (17 CFR 
240.15c3-1).
    Treasury market risk instruments may be excluded from the 
calculation of the Treasury market risk haircut if they are included in 
the calculation of the other securities haircut as part of a hedge 
against long and short positions in securities, futures contracts, 
forward contracts, or options that are not Treasury market risk 
instruments. Only the portion of the total position in a Treasury market 
risk instrument that forms part of such a hedge may be excluded, and the 
result of this transfer of the Treasury market risk instruments must be 
a reduction in the other securities haircut.
    The categories for classifying Treasury market risk instruments are 
designated in 17 CFR 402.2(f)(1). The categories, which are designated 
by a maturity range, contain all securities with remaining terms to 
maturity greater than or equal to the lower end of the range but less 
than the higher. A half year is always considered to be 6 months. In 
categories A through D, zero-coupon instruments are to be treated in the 
same manner as all other instruments. In categories E through J, the 
maturity designations in parentheses give the maturities of the zero-
coupon instruments to be placed in that category. All mortgage-backed 
securities that are Treasury market risk instruments are to be placed in 
category MB or category AR, depending on whether they are backed by 
conventional or adjustable-rate mortgages.
    All haircuts may be calculated to the nearest hundred dollars, 
unless such rounding would materially affect the liquid capital 
calculation.
    Appendix A to the Preamble published with the temporary regulations 
for 17 CFR part 402 (52 FR 19669, May 26, 1987) contains an example of 
the capital calculation. It may also be used as an aid in completing 
these schedules.

       Schedule A--Liquid Capital Requirement Summary Computation

    Schedule A is used to determine the capital-to-risk ratio by 
comparing liquid capital to total haircuts. Schedule A will be the last 
schedule completed as many of the haircuts entered on Schedule A are 
calculated on Schedules B through E.
    Line 1--Enter liquid capital, which is identical to the amount 
reported on line 3640 of the Report on Finances and Operations of 
Government Securities Brokers and Dealers, Form G-405.
    Line 2--Haircuts on ``Security and Financing Positions'' including 
contractual commitments:
    a. Enter the Total Governments Offset Portion Haircut from column 10 
of Schedule C.
    b. Enter the Total Futures and Options Offset Haircut from column 19 
of Schedule D.
    c. Enter the Total Hedging Disallowance Haircut as calculated in 
Schedule E, column 27.
    d. Enter the Residual Net Position Haircut as given in column 28 of 
Schedule E.
    e. Enter the other securities haircut as determined by applying the 
SEC haircut factors to securities, futures contracts, forward contracts, 
options and other inventory that are not Treasury market risk 
instruments as defined in 17 CFR 402.2(e). The other securities haircut 
is the sum of all applicable deductions as specified in 17 CFR 240.15c3-
1 (c)(2)(vi) and (c)(2)(viii) and in 17 CFR 240.15c3-1a and 240.15c3-1b. 
Any position(s) in Treasury market risk instruments that have been 
excluded from the calculation of the Treasury market risk haircut 
because they are part of a hedge with these other instruments are to be 
included in the calculation of this haircut.
    Line 3--Haircuts on credit exposure:
    a. Enter the total counterparty exposure haircut which is the sum of 
the counterparty exposure haircut with each counterparty, except a 
Federal Reserve Bank. A counterparty exposure haircut is equal to 5 
percent of the net credit exposure to a single counterparty which is not 
in excess of 15 percent of the government securities broker's or 
dealer's liquid capital. If the net credit exposure to a

[[Page 788]]

counterparty does exceed 15 percent of liquid capital, the excess will 
be used in calculating the total concentration of credit haircut on line 
3b.
    Net credit exposure equals the difference between the government 
securities broker's or dealer's credit exposure to a single counterparty 
and that counterparty's credit exposure to the government securities 
broker or dealer. The government securities broker's or dealer's credit 
exposure to a counterparty is equal to the sum of the dollar amount of 
funds, debt instruments, other securities, and other inventory at risk 
to the government securities broker or dealer in the event of the 
counterparty's default and the market value of purchased unlisted 
options that are Treasury market risk instruments and were written by 
the counterparty. It does not include, however, (1) the deduction taken 
from net worth for unsecured receivables, repurchase and reverse 
repurchase agreement deficits, aged fails to deliver, and aged fails to 
receive arising from transactions with the counterparty; (2) demand 
deposits in the case where the counterparty is a commercial bank; (3) 
loans of immediately available funds (commonly referred to as ``sales of 
federal funds'') held by the government securities broker or dealer in 
connection with the clearance of securities on the day the loan is made 
in the case where the counterparty is a commercial bank; (4) custodial 
holdings of securities in the case where the counterparty is a clearing 
bank or clearing broker of the government securities broker or dealer; 
or (5) credit exposure to the counterparty due to holding marketable 
instruments for which the counterparty is the obligor.
    The counterparty's credit exposure to the government securities 
broker or dealer equals the dollar amount of funds, debt instruments, 
other securities, and other inventory at risk to the counterparty in the 
event of the government security broker's or dealer's default and any 
unlisted options written by the government securities broker or dealer 
and held by the counterparty.
    b. Enter the total concentration of credit haircut which is the sum 
of all concentration of credit haircuts applied in cases where the net 
credit exposure (as defined above) to a single counterparty is in excess 
of 15 percent of the government securities broker's or dealer's liquid 
capital. The concentration of credit haircut is 25 percent of the amount 
of net credit exposure in excess of 15 percent of the government 
securities broker's or dealer's liquid capital.
    c. Enter the credit volatility haircut which equals a factor of 0.15 
percent applied to the larger of the gross long or gross short position 
in money market instruments qualifying as Treasury market risk 
instruments which mature in 45 days or more, in futures and forwards on 
these instruments that are settled on a cash or delivery basis, and in 
futures and forwards on time deposits described in 
Sec. 402.2(e)(1)(vii), that mature in 45 days or more, settled on a cash 
or delivery basis. Money market instruments qualifying as Treasury 
market risk instruments are (1) marketable certificates of deposit with 
no more than one year to maturity, (2) bankers acceptances, and (3) 
commercial paper which has no more than one year to maturity and is 
rated in one of the three highest categories by at last two nationally 
recognized statistical rating organizations.
    Line 4--Enter total haircuts which is the sum of lines 2 a through 
e, and 3 a, b, and c.
    Line 5--Enter the capital-to-risk ratio which is found by dividing 
line 1, ``Liquid capital,'' by line 4, ``Total haircuts.'' The capital-
to-risk ratio must be at least equal to 1.2:1.

  Schedule B--Calculation of Net Immediate Position in Securities and 
                               Financings

    Schedule B is used to calculate the net immediate position in and 
offset portion of securities and financings. The results are then 
carried over to Schedule C for initial haircut calculations. Futures, 
forwards, and options which are Treasury market risk instruments are to 
be entered on Schedule D.
    Positions in and financings on debt instruments other than mortgage-
backed or adjustable rate mortgage-backed securities should be placed in 
the category corresponding to their remaining term to maturity. In the 
case of a floating rate note, however, the note should be placed in the 
category corresponding to the time to the next scheduled interest rate 
adjustment or remaining term to maturity, whichever is less.
    Column 1--Under ``Financings-Long'' report in the appropriate 
category the contract value of reverse repurchase agreements and the 
value(s) of cash collateral on security borrowings. Financings so 
reported should be placed in the category corresponding to the remaining 
term to maturity or time to the next scheduled interest rate adjustment, 
whichever is less.
    Column 2--Under ``Financings-Short'' report in the appropriate 
category as a negative number the values of funds received from 
financing transactions. Include repurchase agreements, securities 
lending secured by cash collateral, and term financings, but exclude 
subordinated debt which meets the requirements of 17 CFR 240.15c3-1d as 
modified by 17 CFR 402.2d. Financings so reported should be placed in 
the category corresponding to the remaining term to maturity or time to 
the next scheduled interest rate adjustment, whichever is less.

[[Page 789]]

    Columns 3 and 4--Report in the appropriate column by maturity or 
type of mortgage-backed security under ``Securities Positions'' the sum 
of the market values of immediate positions in Treasury market risk 
instruments. The net position in each individual Treasury market risk 
instrument is to be appropriately reported as a long (+) or short (-) 
position in summation with all other positions of the same category 
(long/short). Short positions are assigned a negative value. Treasury 
market risk instruments are defined in 17 CFR 402.2(e). Those to be 
reported in Schedule B are:
    (1) Government securities as defined in 17 CFR 400.3(m) except 
equity securities and mortgage-backed securities which do not pass 
through to the security holder on a pro rata basis a distribution based 
on the monthly payments and prepayments of principal and interest on the 
underlying pool of mortgage collateral less fees and expenses;
    (2) Zero-coupon receipts or certificates based on marketable 
Treasury notes or bonds;
    (3) Marketable certificates of deposit of no more than one year to 
maturity;
    (4) Bankers acceptances;
    (5) Commercial paper of no more than one year to maturity rated in 
one of the three highest categories by at least two nationally 
recognized statistical rating organizations; and
    (6) Securities described in Sec. 402.2(e)(1)(vi).
    Report all positions as of the trade date. If the settlement date is 
scheduled for more than five business days in the future (or, in the 
case of a mortgage-backed security, more than thirty calendar days in 
the future), then report the position as a forward contract on Schedule 
D. Also, under ``Securities Positions'' in the appropriate column and 
category, report any when-issued position in a marketable Treasury 
security between announcement and issue date, any when-issued position 
in a government agency or a government-sponsored agency debt security 
between release date and issue date, and any when-issued position in a 
security described in Sec. 402.2(e)(1)(vi) between announcement date and 
issue date.
    Exclude positions in Treasury market risk instruments which form 
part of a hedge against long and short positions in securities, futures 
contracts, forward contracts, or options that are not Treasury market 
risk instruments and are to be included in the calculation of the other 
securities haircut. Only that portion of the total position in a 
Treasury market risk instrument that forms part of such a hedge may be 
excluded, and the inclusion of the Treasury market risk instruments must 
reduce the other securities haircut.
    Column 5--Under ``Total Securities and Financing Positions (+)'' 
report in the appropriate category the sum of the long financings 
(column 1) and long securities positions (column 3).
    Column 6--Under ``Total Securities and Financing Positions (-)'' 
report in the appropriate category the sum of the short financings 
(column 2) and short securities positions (column 4).
    Column 7--Under ``Offset Portions'' report in the appropriate 
category the lesser of the absolute values of the positive (column 5) or 
negative (column 6) total securities and financing positions.
    Column 8--Under ``Net Immediate Positions'' report in the 
appropriate category the sum, or net value, of the positive (column 5) 
and negative (column 6) total securities and financing positions.
    Columns 7, ``Offset Portions,'' and 8, ``Net Immediate Positions,'' 
are to be carried to Schedule C.

   Schedule C--Governments Offset Portion and Net Immediate Position 
                      Interim Haircuts Calculation

    Schedule C is used to calculate the total governments offset portion 
haircut and net immediate position interim haircuts by applying offset 
and net position haircut factors to the offset portions and net 
immediate positions in Treasury market risk instruments and financings. 
The total governments offset portion haircut is then carried to Schedule 
A, and the net immediate position interim haircuts are carried to 
Schedule D or E.
    Column 7--Transfer to column 7, ``Governments Offset Portion--$ 
Amounts,'' column seven from Schedule B, ``Offset Portions.''
    Column 9--These are the governments offset portion haircut factors 
given at 17 CFR 402.2(f)(2). They may be updated from time to time.
    Column 10--Under ``Governments Offset Portion--Haircuts'' report in 
the appropriate category the product of the corresponding values in 
column 7, ``$ Amounts,'' and in column 9, ``Factors.''
    To determine the total governments offset portion haircut, sum the 
values under ``Governments Offset Portion--Haircuts'' in column 10, and 
enter this number in the appropriate space. Carry this value to Schedule 
A, line 2a, converting, if necessary, to thousands of dollars.
    Column 8--Transfer to column 8, ``Net Immediate Positions--$ 
Amounts,'' column eight from Schedule B, ``Net Immediate Positions.''
    Column 11--These are the net immediate position haircut factors 
given at 17 CFR 402.2(f)(2). They may be updated from time to time.
    Column 12--Under ``Net Immediate Positions--Interim Haircuts'' place 
in the appropriate category the product of the corresponding values in 
column 8, ``$ Amounts,''

[[Page 790]]

and in column 11, ``Factors.'' A haircut on a short position remains 
negative.
    Carry column 12 to Schedule D, or, if there are no futures, 
forwards, or options positions, to Schedule E.

  Schedule D--Consolidation of Net Immediate Position Interim Haircuts 
             with Gross Futures and Options Interim Haircuts

    Schedule D is used to enter haircuts on futures, forwards and 
options positions and to calculate the total futures and options offset 
haircut and the residual position interim haircuts as needed for 
Schedules A and E respectively. If there are no futures and options 
positions, it is not necessary to fill out Schedule D.
    Report on Schedule D futures, forwards, and options which are 
Treasury market risk instruments as defined in Sec. 402.2(e). These 
futures, forwards, and listed option contracts may be based on any of 
the Treasury market risk instruments described in the instructions to 
columns 3 and 4 on Schedule B or on time deposits whose changes in yield 
are closely correlated with marketable certificates of deposit which are 
Treasury market risk instruments, as described in Sec. 402.2(e)(1)(vii). 
Options on Treasury market risk futures contracts and unlisted options 
on marketable Treasury bills, notes, and bonds are also to be included. 
Futures contracts may settle on a cash or delivery basis. Any of these 
contracts which are being included as part of a hedge in the calculation 
of the other securities haircut must be excluded from Schedule D.
    Report as a forward contract any position for which the time between 
trade date and settlement date is more than five business days (30 
calendar days for a mortgage-backed security). Any when-issued position 
in a marketable Treasury security established between announcement and 
issue date, any when-issued position in a government agency or a 
government-sponsored agency debt security established between release 
date and issue date, and any when-issued position in a security 
described in Sec. 402.2(e)(1)(vi) between announcement date and issue 
date is reported in the appropriate category on Schedule B under 
``Securities Positions.''
    Column 12--Transfer to column 12, ``Net Immediate Position Interim 
Haircuts,'' column 12 from Schedule C, ``Net Immediate Positions--
Interim Haircuts,'' converting, if necessary, to thousands of dollars.
    Columns 13 and 14--Under ``Gross Interim Haircuts--Futures and 
Forward'' enter in the appropriate category the sum of the interim 
haircuts on the futures or forward positions belonging to that category. 
The interim haircut on a futures or forward position equals the product 
of the value of the position evaluated at the current market price for 
such contract and the net position haircut factor that corresponds to 
either the term to maturity of the underlying instrument or, for 
mortgage-backed securities, the type of security. The term to maturity 
of the underlying instrument is the term to maturity of the deliverable 
security at the time of the maturity of the futures or forward contract. 
The haircut on a futures or forward position on a non-mortgaged-backed 
instrument is to be entered in the category corresponding to the sum of 
the remaining time to maturity of the futures or forward contract and 
the maturity of the underlying instrument. Haircuts on futures and 
forwards on mortgage-backed securities are to be entered in the 
appropriate mortgage-backed securities category. The interim haircuts on 
long futures and forwards are positive (column 13), and on short futures 
and forwards, negative (column 14).
    Columns 15 and 16--Under ``Gross Interim Haircuts--Options'' enter, 
in the category in which the instrument directly underlying the contract 
would be entered, the lesser of (1) the market value of the option or 
(2) the net immediate position interim haircut on the underlying cash 
instrument or gross futures interim haircut on the underlying futures 
contract. Note that in the case of an option on a futures contract the 
category in which the option contract is to be entered is the sum of the 
remaining time to maturity of the futures or forward contract and the 
maturity of the instrument underlying the futures or forward contract. 
The haircut factor used to determine the gross futures interim haircut 
is that factor corresponding to the term to maturity of the deliverable 
security at the time of the maturity of the futures or forward contract. 
Gross option haircuts on purchased calls and sold puts are positive, 
those on sold calls and purchased puts are negative.
    Column 17--Under ``Aggregate Interim Haircuts (+)'' enter in the 
appropriate category, the sum of any positive net immediate position 
interim haircut (column 12) and the positive gross option (column 15) 
and gross futures and forward (column 13) interim haircuts for that 
category.
    Column 18--Under ``Aggregate Interim Haircuts (-)'' enter in the 
appropriate category, the sum of any negative net immediate position 
interim haircut (column 12) and the negative gross option (column 16) 
and gross futures and forward (column 14) interim haircuts for that 
category.
    Column 19--Under ``Futures and Options Offset Portions'' enter, in 
the appropriate category, the lesser of the absolute values of the 
positive and negative aggregate interim haircuts (columns 17 and 18) for 
that category.
    The total futures and options offset portion is the sum of the 
values in column 19

[[Page 791]]

under ``Futures and Options Offset Portions.''
    The total futures and options offset haircut is the total futures 
and options offset portion multiplied by a factor of 20 percent and is 
carried to line 2b, Schedule A.
    Column 20--Enter in the appropriate category under ``Residual 
Position Interim Haircuts'' the sum, or net value, of the positive and 
negative aggregate interim haircuts. Carry this to column 20 on Schedule 
E.

 Schedule E--Calculation of Hedging Disallowance Haircuts When Netting 
                       Haircuts Across Categories

    Schedule E is used to calculate the hedging disallowance and 
residual net position haircuts which are then carried to Schedule A. The 
purpose of Schedule E is to hedge positions in different categories in 
order to reduce total haircuts. Netting the residual position interim 
haircuts reflects the risk reduction inherent in hedges between 
positions in different categories where the price volatility is 
reasonably well correlated.
    Section 402.2(f)(3) of the rule specifies the hedging disallowance 
haircut factors for the category pairs. Netting of residual position 
interim haircuts is permitted only between any two categories for which 
a hedging disallowance haircut factor is specified. Hedging disallowance 
haircuts are similar to offset haircuts in that they are applied to the 
smaller of the two residual position interim haircuts and represent the 
portion of the hedge being ``disallowed.'' A hedging disallowance 
haircut is determined each time two residual position interim haircuts 
are netted.
    There are three levels of permissible netting corresponding to the 
three hedging disallowance haircut factors: The 20 percent, 30 percent, 
and 40 percent levels. It is not necessary to net all possible pairs at 
any one level. A greater reduction in total haircuts can sometimes be 
obtained by choosing not to net a pair at one level (e.g., the 20 
percent level) so that one element of the pair can be netted against a 
third category at another level (e.g., the 30 percent level).
    Column 20--Transfer column 20, ``Residual Position Interim 
Haircuts,'' from Schedule D. If there are no futures or options 
positions, transfer instead column 12, ``Net Immediate Positions--
Interim Haircuts,'' from Schedule C.
    Column 21--Use the matrix at 17 CFR 402.2(f)(3) to determine the 
categories from which the residual position interim haircuts may be 
paired at the 20 percent level. For each pair multiply the smaller of 
the absolute values of the two residual position interim haircuts by the 
hedging disallowance haircut factor of 20 percent, and, in the category 
of the smaller, enter the resulting hedging disallowance haircut.
    Column 22--For each pair being netted at this level, enter under 
``Net Residual Position Interim Haircuts'' (1) the sum, or net value, of 
the two residual position interim haircuts (and/or net residual position 
interim haircuts) in the category of the larger (in absolute value) of 
the two interim haircuts that were netted, and (2) a zero in the 
category of the smaller.
    These net residual position interim haircuts replace the residual 
position interim haircuts (or net residual position interim haircuts) 
from which they were derived. Net residual position interim haircuts can 
in turn be used in any other allowable netting exactly as residual 
position interim haircuts would be. If further netting of that category 
at the same level is permissible and possible, it will be necessary to 
replace the net residual position interim haircut involved with a new 
(and smaller) net residual position interim haircut in column 22.
    Since the net residual position interim haircut in any category 
containing a hedging disallowance haircut is zero, further netting with 
any such category is impossible.
    After all netting has been completed for category pairs with a 20 
percent hedging disallowance haircut factor, move on to column 23.
    Column 23--Use the matrix at 17 CFR 402.2(f)(3) to determine the 
categories from which the residual position interim haircuts and/or net 
residual position interim haircuts may be paired at the 30 percent 
level. In each category, the newest (and smallest) net residual position 
interim haircut determined by netting at the 20 percent level replaces 
the old value and must be used in hedging in that category at higher 
levels. For each pair being netted, multiply the smaller of the absolute 
values of the two (net) residual position interim haircuts by the 
hedging disallowance haircut factor of 30 percent, and in the category 
of the smaller, enter the resulting hedging disallowance haircut.
    Column 24--For each pair being netted at this level, enter under 
``Net Residual Position Interim Haircuts'' (1) the sum, or net value, of 
the two residual position interim haircuts and/or net residual position 
interim haircuts in the category of the larger (in absolute value) of 
the two interim haircuts that were netted, and (2) a zero in the 
category of the smaller.
    These net residual position interim haircuts replace the residual 
position interim haircuts (or net residual position interim haircuts) 
from which they were derived. Net residual position interim haircuts can 
in turn be used in any other allowable netting exactly as residual 
position interim haircuts would be. If further netting of that category 
at the same level is permissible and possible, it will be necessary to 
replace the net residual position interim haircut involved with a

[[Page 792]]

new (and smaller) net residual position interim haircut.
    After all netting has been completed for category pairs with a 30 
percent hedging disallowance haircut factor, continue to column 25.
    Column 25--Use the matrix at 17 CFR 402.2(f)(3) to determine the 
categories from which the residual position interim haircuts and/or net 
residual position interim haircuts may be paired at the 40 percent 
level. In each category, any new net residual position interim haircut 
determined by netting at the 20 or 30 percent level replaces the old 
value and must be used in hedging with that category at the 40 percent 
level. For each pair being netted, multiply the smaller of the absolute 
values of the two (net) residual position interim haircuts by the 
hedging disallowance haircut factor of 40 percent and, in the category 
of the smaller, enter the resulting hedging disallowance haircut.
    Column 26--For each pair being netted at this level, enter under 
``Net Residual Position Interim Haircuts'' (1) the sum, or net value, of 
the two (net) residual position interim haircuts in the category of the 
larger (in absolute value) of the two interim haircuts that were netted, 
and (2) a zero in the category of the smaller. If further netting of 
that category at the same level is permissible and possible, it will be 
necessary to replace the net residual position interim haircut involved 
with a new (and smaller) net residua1 position interim haircut.
    Column 27--When all possible (net) residual position interim 
haircuts have been netted, enter under ``Hedging Disallowance Haircuts'' 
all hedging disallowance haircuts calculated in the netting procedures, 
each in its appropriate category.
    Enter under ``Total Hedging Disallowance Haircut'' the sum of all 
the hedging disallowance haircuts entered in column 27. Carry to 
Schedule A, line 2c.
    Column 28--Under ``Qualified Netting Interim Haircuts'' enter in the 
appropriate category the absolute value of the haircut given under ``Net 
Residual Position Interim Haircut'' at the highest hedging disallowance 
factor used for that category (columns 26, 24, or 22). This value will 
also be the smallest of the net residual position interim haircuts in 
that category. If the position in a given category was not used in 
hedging then enter the absolute value of the residual position interim 
haircut from column 20.
    Sum the qualified netting interim haircuts, enter this value under 
``Residual Net Position Haircut,'' and carry to Schedule A, line 2d.

<R05>
Sec. 402.2c  Appendix C--Consolidated computations of liquid capital and total haircuts for certain subsidiaries and affiliates.

    (a) Consolidation. (1) A government securities broker or dealer (the 
``parent broker or dealer''), in computing its liquid capital and total 
haircuts pursuant to Sec. 402.2:
    (i) Shall consolidate in a single computation of liquid capital the 
assets and liabilities of any subsidiary or affiliate for which the 
parent broker or dealer guarantees, endorses, or assumes directly or 
indirectly the obligations or liabilities if the parent broker or dealer 
has obtained the opinion of counsel described in paragraph (b) of this 
section with respect to such subsidiary or affiliate;
    (ii) May not consolidate in a single computation of liquid capital 
the assets and liabilities of any subsidiary or affiliate for which the 
parent broker or dealer guarantees, endorses, or assumes directly or 
indirectly the obligations or liabilities if the parent broker or dealer 
has not obtained the opinion of counsel described in paragraph (b) of 
this section with respect to such subsidiary or affiliate, but in that 
event, the parent broker or dealer shall compute its total haircuts by 
adding the total haircuts of each such subsidiary or affiliate computed 
in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 402.2 to the haircuts of the 
parent broker or dealer computed separately in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 402.2; and
    (iii) May consolidate in its computation of liquid capital the 
assets and liabilities of any majority owned and controlled subsidiary 
or affiliate for which the parent broker or dealer does not guarantee, 
endorse or assume directly or indirectly the obligations or liabilities 
if the parent broker or dealer has obtained the opinion of counsel 
described in paragraph (b) of this section with respect to such 
subsidiary or affiliate.
    (2) With respect to any subsidiary or affiliate whose assets and 
liabilities are consolidated in the parent broker's or dealer's 
computation of liquid capital according to the provisions of paragraph 
(a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(iii) of this

[[Page 793]]

section, the parent broker or dealer shall compute its haircuts in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 402.2 as if the consolidated 
entity were one firm, or, in the alternative, shall add the total 
haircuts of each consolidated subsidiary or affiliate computed in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 402.2 to the haircuts of the 
parent broker or dealer computed separately in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 402.2.
    (b) Required counsel opinion. The opinion of counsel referred to in 
paragraph (a) of this section shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of 
the Commission, through the Designated Examining Authority, that net 
asset values, or the portion thereof related to the parent broker's or 
dealer's ownership interest in a majority owned and controlled 
subsidiary or affiliate, may be caused by the parent broker or dealer or 
an appointed trustee to be distributed to the parent broker or dealer 
within 30 calendar days. Such opinion shall also set forth the actions 
necessary to cause such a distribution to be made, identify the parties 
having the authority to take such actions, identify and describe the 
rights of other parties or classes of parties, including but not limited 
to customers, general creditors, subordinated lenders, minority 
shareholder employees, litigants and governmental or regulatory 
authorities, who may delay or prevent such a distribution and such other 
assurances as the Commission or the Designated Examining Authority by 
rule or interpretation may require. Such opinion shall be current and 
periodically renewed in connection with the parent broker's or dealer's 
annual audit pursuant to Sec. 240.17a-5 of this title, as made 
applicable to government securities brokers or dealers by Sec. 405.2 of 
this chapter, or upon any material change in circumstances.
    (c) Principles of consolidation. The following minimum and non-
exclusive requirements shall govern the consolidation of a subsidiary or 
affiliate in the computation of total liquid capital and total haircuts 
of a government securities broker or dealer pursuant to this section:
    (1) The total liquid capital of the government securities broker or 
dealer shall be reduced by the estimated amount of any taxes reasonably 
anticipated to be incurred upon distribution of the assets of the 
subsidiary or affiliate.
    (2) Liabilities of a consolidated subsidiary or affiliate that are 
subordinated to the claims of present and future creditors pursuant to a 
satisfactory subordination agreement shall not be added to consolidated 
net worth unless such subordination extends also to the claims of 
present or future creditors of the parent broker or dealer and all 
consolidated subsidiaries.
    (3) Subordinated liabilities of a consolidated subsidiary or 
affiliate that are consolidated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section may not be prepaid, repaid or accelerated if any of the 
entities included in such consolidation would otherwise be unable to 
comply with the provision of Sec. 240.15c3-1d of this title, as modified 
by Sec. 402.2d.
    (4) Each government securities broker or dealer included within the 
consolidation shall at all times be in compliance with the liquid 
capital or net capital requirement to which it is subject.
    (d) Certain Precluded Acts. Even if consolidation is not required or 
allowed under paragraph (a) of this section, no parent broker or dealer 
shall guarantee, endorse or assume directly or indirectly any obligation 
or liability of a subsidiary or affiliate unless the obligation or 
liability is reflected in the parent broker's or dealer's computation of 
liquid capital.

institution has a book-entry securities account at a Federal Reserve 
Bank through which it provides clearing services (``clearing bank''), 
provided the securities are maintained in a Segregated Account of the 
government securities broker or dealer. For purposes of this paragraph 
(f)(1) and paragraph (h) of this section, a Segregated Account is an 
account (other than a clearing account) of the government securities 
broker or dealer maintained on the books of a clearing bank pursuant to 
a written clearing agreement with such clearing bank which provides 
that:
    (i) Such account is established for the purpose of segregating 
securities of counterparties or customers of such

[[Page 798]]

broker or dealer from proprietary securities of the broker or dealer;
    (ii) The broker or dealer is entitled to direct the disposition of 
the securities; and
    (iii) The clearing bank does not have, and will not assert, any 
claim or lien against such securities nor will the clearing bank grant 
any third party, including any Federal Reserve Bank, any interest in 
such securities so long as they are maintained in the segregated 
account.
    (2) For purposes of this section, Sec. 240.15c3-3(c)(2) of this 
title is redesignated as paragraph (c)(2)(i) and new paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii) is added to read as follows:

securities broker or dealer in an account designated exclusively for 
customers of the government securities broker or dealer with a 
registered broker or dealer or another registered government securities 
broker or dealer (the ``carrying broker or dealer'') in compliance with 
instructions of the registered government securities broker or dealer to 
the carrying broker or dealer that the securities are to be maintained 
free of any charge, lien or claim of any kind in favor of the carrying 
broker or dealer or any persons claiming through such carrying broker or 
dealer; or''.

    (g) For the purposes of this section, Sec. 240.15c3-3(d)(2) of this 
title is modified to read as follows:

    ``(2) Securities included on its books or records as failed to 
receive more than 30 calendar days, or in the case of mortgage-backed 
securities, more than 60 calendar days, then the government securities 
broker or government securities dealer shall, not later than the 
business day following the day on which such determination is made, take 
prompt steps to obtain possession or control of securities so failed to 
receive through a buy-in procedure or otherwise; or''

    (h) In addition to the notification required by Sec. 240.15c3-3(i) 
of this title, whenever any government securities broker or dealer 
instructs its clearing bank to place securities in a Segregated Account 
(as defined in paragraph (f)(1) of this section), and the clearing bank 
refuses to do so as of the close of business on that day, the broker or 
dealer shall, in accordance with Sec. 240.17a-11(f) of this title, give 
telegraphic notice of the notification by the clearing bank within 24 
hours and within 48 hours of the telegraphic notice, file a report 
stating what steps are being taken to correct the situation.
    (i) For purposes of this section, Sec. 240.15c3-3(l) of this title 
is modified to read as follows:

    ``(l) Delivery or disposition of securities. Nothing stated in this 
section shall be construed as affecting the absolute right of a customer 
of a government securities broker or dealer, unless otherwise agreed in 
writing, in the normal course of business operations following demand 
made on the broker or dealer, to receive the physical delivery of 
certificates if the securities are issued in certificated form, or to 
direct a transfer of or otherwise to exercise control over any 
securities if they are:
    ``(1) Fully-paid securities to which the customer is entitled;
    ``(2) Margin securities upon full payment by such customer to the 
broker or dealer of the customer's indebtedness to the broker or dealer; 
or
    ``(3) Excess margin securities not reasonably required to 
collateralize such customer's indebtedness to the broker or dealer.''.

    (j) Except with respect to a government securities interdealer 
broker subject to the financial responsibility requirements of 
Sec. 402.1(e) and a registered government securities broker or dealer 
that is a futures commission merchant registered with the CFTC, 
Sec. 240.15c3-3(e)(3) is modified for purposes of this section to read 
as follows:

    ``(3) Computations necessary to determine the amount required to be 
deposited as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be made 
weekly, as of the close of the last business day of the week, and the 
deposit so computed shall be made no later than 1 hour after the opening 
of banking business on the second following business day; provided, 
however, a government securities broker or dealer registered pursuant to 
section 15C(a)(1)(A) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-5 (a)(1)(A)) which has a

[[Page 799]]

ratio of liquid capital to total haircuts (calculated in accordance with 
part 402 of this chapter) of 1.8 or greater and which carries aggregate 
customer funds (as defined in paragraph (a)(10) of this section), as 
computed at the last required computation pursuant to this section, not 
exceeding $1 million, may in the alternative make the computation 
monthly, as of the close of the last business day of the month, and, in 
such event, shall deposit not less than 105 percent of the amount so 
computed no later than 1 hour after the opening of banking business on 
the second following business day. If a registered government securities 
broker or dealer, computing on a monthly basis, has, at the time of any 
required computation, a ratio of liquid capital to total haircuts of 
less than 1.8, such broker or dealer shall thereafter compute weekly as 
aforesaid until four successive weekly computations are made, none of 
which were made at a time when its ratio of liquid capital to total 
haircuts was less than 1.8. Computations in addition to the computation 
required in this paragraph (3), may be made as of the close of any other 
business day, and the deposits so computed shall be made no later than 1 
hour after the opening of banking business on the second following 
business day. The registered government securities broker or dealer 
shall make and maintain a record of each such computation made pursuant 
to this paragraph (3) or otherwise and preserve such record in 
accordance with Sec. 240.17a-4.''.

    (k) Except with respect to a government securities interdealer 
broker subject to the financial responsibility requirements of 
Sec. 402.1(e) and a registered government securities broker or dealer 
that is a futures commission merchant registered with the CFTC, Note 
E(5) of Sec. 240.15c3-3a of this title is modified for purposes of this 
section to read as follows:

    ``(5) Debit balances in margin accounts (other than omnibus 
accounts) shall be reduced by the amount by which any single customer's 
debit balance exceeds 25% (to the extent such amount is greater than 
$50,000) of the government securities broker's or dealer's liquid 
capital unless such broker or dealer can demonstrate that the debit 
balance is directly related to credit items in the Reserve Formula. 
Related accounts (e.g., the separate accounts of an individual, accounts 
under common control or subject to cross guarantees) shall be deemed to 
be a single customer's accounts for purposes of this provision.''.

    (l) For purposes of this section, the suspension of Sec. 240.15c3-
3(m) of this title (38 FR 12103, May 9, 1973) is no longer effective and 
the paragraph is modified to read as follows: ``(m) If a government 
securities broker or government securities dealer executes a sell order 
of a customer (other than an order to execute a sale of securities which 
the seller does not own, which for the purposes of this paragraph shall 
mean that the customer placing the sell order has identified the sale as 
a short sale to the government securities broker or dealer) and if for 
any reason whatever the government securities broker or government 
securities dealer has not obtained possession of the government 
securities, other than mortgage-backed securities, from the customer 
within 30 calendar days, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities 
within 60 calendar days, after the settlement date, the government 
securities broker or government securities dealer shall immediately 
thereafter close the transaction with the customer by purchasing, or 
otherwise obtaining, securities of like kind and quantity. For purposes 
of this paragraph (m), the term ``customer'' shall not include a broker 
or dealer who maintains a special omnibus account with another broker or

Sec. 403.5  Custody of securities held by financial institutions that are government securities brokers or dealers.

    (a) A government securities broker or dealer that is a financial 
institution shall:

[[Page 800]]

    (1) Comply with part 450 with respect to all government securities 
held for the account of customers of the financial institution in its 
capacity as a fiduciary or custodian (unless otherwise exempt pursuant 
to Sec. 450.3); and
    (2) Comply with part 450 and with paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of 
this section with respect to all fully paid and excess margin government 
securities held for customers of the financial institution in its 
capacity as government securities broker or dealer, and government 
securities that are the subject of a repurchase agreement between the 
financial institution and certain counterparties as described in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) A financial institution shall not be in violation of the 
possession or control requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section if, solely as the result of normal business operations, 
temporary lags occur between the time when a security is first required 
to be in the financial institution's possession or control and the time 
when it is actually placed in possession or control, provided that the 
financial institution takes timely steps in good faith to establish 
prompt possession or control. In the event that a financial institution 
has accepted funds from a customer for the purchase of securities and 
the financial institution does not initiate the purchase of the 
specified securities by the close of the next business day after receipt 
of such customer's funds, the financial institution shall immediately 
deposit or redeposit the funds in an account belonging to such customer 
and send the customer notice of such deposit or redeposit.
    (c)(1) On each business day a financial institution shall determine 
the quantity and issue of such securities, if any, that are required to 
be but are not in the financial institution's possession or control. As 
appropriate to bring such securities into possession or control, the 
financial institution shall:
    (i) Promptly obtain the release of any lien, charge, or other 
encumbrance against such securities;
    (ii) Promptly obtain the return of any securities loaned;
    (iii) Take prompt steps to obtain possession or control of 
securities failed to receive for more than 30 calendar days, or in the 
case of mortgage-backed securities, for more than 60 calendar days; or
    (iv) Take prompt steps to buy in securities as necessary to the 
extent any shortage of securities in possession or control cannot be 
resolved as required by any of the above procedures.
    (2) The financial institution shall prepare and maintain a current 
and detailed description of the procedures and internal controls that it 
utilizes to comply with the possession or control requirements of this 
paragraph (c), which shall be made available upon request to its 
appropriate regulatory agency.
    (3) Nothing stated in this section shall be construed as affecting 
the absolute right of a customer of a government securities broker or 
dealer, unless otherwise agreed in writing, in the normal course of 
business operations following demand made on the broker or dealer, to 
receive the physical delivery of certificates if the securities are 
issued in certificated form, or to direct a transfer of or otherwise to 
exercise control over any securities if they are:
    (i) Fully-paid securities to which the customer is entitled;
    (ii) Margin securities upon full payment by such customer to the 
broker or dealer of the customer's indebtedness to the broker or dealer; 
or
    (iii) Excess margin securities not reasonably required to 
collateralize such customer's indebtedness to the broker or dealer.
    (d)(1) A financial institution that retains custody of securities 
that are the subject of a repurchase agreement between the financial 
institution and a counterparty shall:
    (i) Obtain the repurchase agreement in writing;
    (ii) Confirm in writing the specific securities that are the subject 
of a repurchase transaction pursuant to such agreement at the end of the 
day of initiation of the transaction and at the end of any other day 
during which other securities are substituted if the substitution 
results in a change to issuer, maturity date, par amount or coupon rate 
specified in the previous confirmation;
    (iii) Advise the counterparty in the repurchase agreement that the 
funds

[[Page 801]]

held by the financial institution pursuant to a repurchase transaction 
are not a deposit and therefore are not insured by the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation, or the National Credit Union Share Insurance 
Fund, as applicable;
    (iv) If the counterparty agrees to grant the financial institution 
the right to substitute securities, include in the written repurchase 
agreement the provision by which the financial institution retains the 
right to substitute securities;
    (v) If the counterparty agrees to grant the financial institution 
the right to substitute securities, include in the written repurchase 
agreement the following disclosure statement, which must be prominently 
displayed in the written repurchase agreement immediately preceding the 
provision governing the right to substitution:

                          ``Required Disclosure

    The [seller] is not permitted to substitute other securities for 
those subject to this agreement and therefore must keep the [buyer's] 
securities segregated at all times, unless in this agreement the [buyer] 
grants the [seller] the right to substitute other securities. If the 
[buyer] grants the right to substitute, this means that the [buyer's] 
securities will likely be commingled with the [seller's] own securities 
during the trading day. The [buyer] is advised that, during any trading 
day that the [buyer's] securities are commingled with the [seller's] 
securities, they may be subject to liens granted by the [seller] to 
third parties and may be used by the [seller] for deliveries on other 
securities transactions. Whenever the securities are commingled, the 
[seller's] ability to resegregate substitute securities for the [buyer] 
will be subject to the [seller's] ability to satisfy any lien or to 
obtain substitute securities.''; and

    (vi) Maintain possession or control of securities that are the 
subject of the agreement in accordance with Sec. 450.4(a) of this 
chapter, except when exercising its right of substitution in accordance 
with the provisions of the agreement and paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this 
section.
    (2)(i) A confirmation issued in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(ii) 
of this section shall specify the issuer, maturity date, coupon rate, 
par amount and market value of the security and shall further identify a 
CUSIP or mortgage-backed security pool number, as appropriate, except 
that a CUSIP or a pool number is not required on the confirmation if it 
is identified in internal records of the broker or dealer that designate 
the specific security of the counterparty. For purposes of this 
paragraph (d)(2), the market value of any security that is the subject 
of the repurchase transaction shall be the most recently available bid 
price plus accrued interest, obtained by any reasonable and consistent 
methodology.
    (ii) A person that is a non-U.S. citizen residing outside of the 
United States or a foreign corporation, partnership, or trust may waive, 
but only in writing, the right to receive the confirmation required by 
paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (3) This paragraph (d) shall not apply to a repurchase agreement 
between the financial institution and a broker or dealer (including a 
government securities broker or dealer), a registered municipal 
securities dealer, or a director or principal officer of the financial 
institution or any person to the extent that his claim is explicitly 
subordinated to the claims of creditors of the financial institution.
    (e)(1) A government securities broker or dealer that is a branch or 
agency of a foreign bank shall keep on deposit with an insured bank (as 
that term is defined in 12 U.S.C. 1813(h)) an amount equal to the amount 
that would be required to be set aside pursuant to Sec. 240.15c3-3(e)(1) 
of this title with respect to government securities of customers of such 
branch or agency that are citizens or residents of the United States. 
The amount required to be deposited pursuant to this Sec. 403.5(e)(1) 
may be reduced by the amount of assets pledged or deposited by the 
branch or agency pursuant to regulations promulgated by a Federal or 
State banking regulatory agency that are attributable to liabilities to 
customers which are included both in the calculation of the required 
pledge or deposit of assets and in the calculation of the amount to be 
set aside pursuant to Sec. 240.15c3-3(e)(1) of this title.
    (2) The amount deposited in accordance with this section shall be 
pledged to the appropriate regulatory agency of the branch or agency 
making the deposit for the exclusive benefit of the

[[Page 802]]

customers to whom the credit balances are owed.
    (3) For purposes of making the calculation pursuant to 
Sec. 240.15c3-3(e)(1) of this title, the terms ``free credit balances,'' 
``other credit balances'' and ``credit balances'' shall not include any 
funds placed in deposits or accounts enumerated at 12 CFR 204.2.
    (4) For purposes of making the calculation pursuant to 
Sec. 240.15c3-3(e)(1) of this title, the formula set forth at 
Sec. 240.15c3-3a of this title shall be modified as follows:
    (i) For purposes of this section, references to ``securities 
account,'' ``cash account,'' ``margin account'', or other customer 
accounts for purposes of this section shall not include any deposits or

securities carried for the account of customers. (See Note B.)'';

    (v) Item 4 is modified to read as follows:

    ``4. Customers' securities failed to receive only with respect to 
transactions for which payment has been received by and is under the 
control of the branch or agency. (See Note D.)'';

    ``Note B. Item 2 shall include the principal amount of Restricted 
Letters of Credit obtained by members of Options Clearing Corporation 
which are collateralized by customers' securities. Item 2 shall not 
include bank loans to customers in the ordinary course collateralized by 
the customers' U.S. government securities.''; and

    (vii) Note C is modified to read as follows:

    ``Note C. Item 3 shall include in addition to monies payable against 
customers' securities loaned the amount by which the market value of 
securities loaned exceeds the collateral value received from the lending 
of such securities. Item 3 shall exclude cash collateral received 
pursuant to a written securities lending agreement that complies fully 
with the supervisory guidelines of its appropriate regulatory agency 
that expressly govern securities lending practices.''.
    (5) Computations necessary to determine the amount required to be 
deposited as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be made 
weekly, as of the close of the last business day of this week, and the 
deposit so computed shall be made no later than one hour after the 
opening of banking business on the second following business day.
    (6) A government securities broker or dealer that is a branch or 
agency of a foreign bank shall make and maintain a record of each 
computation made pursuant to paragraph (e)(5) of this section and 
preserve each such record for a period of not less than three years, the 
first two years in an easily accessible place.

securities,'' ``margin securities,'' and ``excess margin securities'' 
shall have the meanings described in Sec. 403.4 (b), (c) and (d).
    (2) For purposes of this section, the term ``customer'' shall 
include any person from whom or on whose behalf a financial institution 
that is a government securities broker or dealer has received or 
acquired or holds securities for the account of that person or funds 
resulting from transactions in securities for or with such person or 
that represent principal, interest, or other proceeds of such 
securities. The term shall not include a broker or dealer that is 
registered pursuant to section 15, 15B or 15C (a)(1)(A) of the Act (15 
U.S.C. 78o, 78o-4, 78o-5(a)(1)(A)) or that has filed notice of its 
status as a government securities broker or dealer pursuant to section 
15C(a)(1)(B) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-5(a)(1)(B)) except with respect 
to securities maintained by such broker or dealer in a Segregated 
Account as defined in Sec. 403.4(f)(1) and with respect to securities 
otherwise identified by such broker or dealer as customer securities for 
purposes of maintaining possession or control of such securities as 
required by this part. The term ``customer'' shall not include a 
director or principal officer of the financial institution or any other 
person to the extent that that person has a claim for property or funds, 
which by contract, agreement or understanding,

[[Page 803]]

or by operation of law, is part of the capital of the financial 
institution or is subordinated to the claims of creditors of the 
financial institution.
    (g) If a financial institution executes a sell order of a customer

the customer placing the sell order has identified the sale as a short 
sale to the financial institution) and if for any reason whatever the 
financial institution has not obtained possession of the government 
securities, except mortgage-backed securities, from the customer within 
30 calendar days, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities within 60 
calendar days, after the settlement date, the financial institution 
shall immediately thereafter close the transaction with the customer by 
purchasing, or otherwise obtaining, securities of like kind and 
quantity.
    (h) The appropriate regulatory agency of a financial institution 
that is a government securities broker or dealer may extend the period 
specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(iii) and (g) of this section on 
application of the financial institution for one or more limited periods 
commensurate with the circumstances, provided the appropriate regulatory 
agency is satisfied that the financial institution is acting in good 
faith in making the application and that exceptional circumstances 
warrant such action. Each appropriate regulatory agency should make and 
preserve for a period of not less than three years a record of each 
extension granted pursuant to this paragraph, which contains a summary 
of the justification for the granting of the extension.

Sec. 420.1  Applicability.

    (a) This part, including the Appendices, is applicable to all 
persons that participate in the government securities market, including, 
but not limited to: government securities brokers and dealers, 
depository institutions that exercise investment discretion, registered 
investment companies, registered investment advisers, pension funds, 
hedge funds and insurance companies that may control a reportable 
position in a recently-issued marketable Treasury bill, note or bond as 
those terms are defined in Sec. 420.2.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, foreign central 
banks, foreign governments and international monetary authorities are 
exempt from this part. This exemption is not applicable to a broker, 
dealer, financial institution or other entity that engages primarily in 
commercial transactions and that may be owned in whole or in part by a 
foreign government.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, Federal Reserve 
Banks are exempt from this part for the portion of any reportable 
position they control for their own account.


<R05>
Sec. 420.2  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this part:

[[Page 816]]

    (a) ``Aggregating entity'' means a single entity (e.g., a parent 
company, affiliate, or organizational component) that is combined with 
other entities, as specified in paragraph (i) of this section, to form a 
reporting entity. In those cases where an entity has no affiliates, the 
aggregating entity is the same as the reporting entity.
    (b) ``Control'' means having the authority to exercise investment 
discretion over the purchase, sale, retention or financing of specific 
Treasury securities. Only one entity should be considered to have 
investment discretion over a particular position.
    (c) ``Gross financing position'' is the sum of the gross par amounts 
of a security issue received from financing transactions, including 
reverse repurchase transactions and bonds borrowed, and as collateral 
for financial derivatives and other securities transactions (e.g., 
margin loans). In calculating the gross financing position, a reporting 
entity may not net its positions against repurchase transactions, 
securities loaned, or securities pledged as collateral for financial 
derivatives and other securities transactions. However, a reporting 
entity may elect to reduce its gross financing position by the par 
amount of the security received in transactions: in which the 
counterparty retains the right to substitute securities; that are 
subject to third party custodial relationships; or that are hold-in-
custody agreements.
    (d) ``Large position threshold'' means, with respect to a reportable 
position, the dollar par amount such position must equal or exceed in 
order for a reporting entity to be required to submit a large position 
report. The large position threshold will be announced by the Department 
and may vary with each notice of request to report large position 
information and with each specified Treasury security. However, under no 
circumstances will a large position threshold be less than $2 billion.
    (e) ``Net fails position'' is the net par amount of ``fails to 
receive'' less ``fails to deliver'' in the same security. The net fails 
position, as reported, may not be less than zero.
    (f) ``Net trading position'' is the net sum of the following 
respective positions in the specific security issue:
    (1) Cash/immediate net settled positions;
    (2) Net when-issued positions;
    (3) Net forward positions, including next-day settling;
    (4) Net futures contract positions that require delivery of the 
specific security; and
    (5) Net holdings of STRIPS principal components of the security.
    (g) ``Recently-issued'' means:
    (1) With respect to Treasury securities that are issued quarterly or 
more frequently, the three most recent issues of the security (e.g., in 
early April, the January, February, and March 2-year notes).
    (2) With respect to Treasury securities that are issued less 
frequently than quarterly, the two most recent issues of the security.
    (3) With respect to a reopened security, the entire issue of a 
reopened security (older and newer portions) based on the date the new 
portion of the reopened security is issued by the Department (or for 
when-issued securities, the scheduled issue date).
    (4) For all Treasury securities, a security announced to be issued 
or auctioned but unissued (when-issued), starting from the date of the 
issuance announcement. The most recent issue of the security is the one 
most recently announced.
    (5) Treasury security issues other than those specified in 
paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section, provided that such large 
position information is necessary and appropriate for monitoring the 
impact of concentrations of positions in Treasury securities.
    (h) ``Reportable position'' is the sum of the net trading positions, 
gross financing positions and net fails positions in a specified issue 
of Treasury securities collectively controlled by a reporting entity.
    (i) ``Reporting entity'' means any corporation, partnership, person 
or other entity and its affiliates, as further provided herein. For the 
purposes of this definition, an affiliate is any: entity that is more 
than 50% owned, directly or indirectly, by the aggregating entity or by 
any other affiliate of the

[[Page 817]]

aggregating entity; person or entity that owns, directly or indirectly, 
more than 50% of the aggregating entity; person or entity that owns, 
directly or indirectly, more than 50% of any other affiliate of the 
aggregating entity; or entity, a majority of whose board of directors or 
a majority of whose general partners are directors or officers of the 
aggregating entity or any affiliate of the aggregating entity.
    (1) Subject to the conditions prescribed in Appendix A, one or more 
aggregating entities, either separately or together with one or more 
other aggregating entities, may be recognized as a separate reporting 
entity.
    (2) Notwithstanding this definition, any persons or entities that

Sec. 420.3  Reporting.

    (a) A reporting entity is subject to the reporting requirements of 
this section only when its reportable position equals or exceeds the 
large position threshold specified by the Department for a specific 
Treasury security issue. The Department shall provide notice of such 
threshold by issuance of a press release and subsequent publication of 
the notice in the Federal Register. Such notice will identify the 
Treasury security issue to be reported (including, where applicable, 
identification of the related STRIPS principal component); the date or 
dates (as of close of business) for which the large position information 
must be reported; and the applicable large position threshold for that 
issue. It is the responsibility of a reporting entity to take reasonable 
actions to be aware of such a notice.
    (b) A reporting entity shall select one entity from among its 
aggregating entities (i.e., the designated filing entity) as the entity 
designated to compile and file a report on behalf of the reporting 
entity. The designated filing entity shall be responsible for filing any 
large position reports in response to a notice issued by the Department 
and for maintaining the additional records prescribed in the applicable 
paragraph of Sec. 420.4.
    (c)(1) In response to a notice issued under paragraph (a) of this 
section requesting large position information, a reporting entity with a 
reportable position that equals or exceeds the specified large position 
threshold stated in the notice shall compile and report the amounts of 
the reporting entity's reportable position in the order specified, as 
follows:
    (i) net trading position;
    (ii) gross financing position;
    (iii) net fails position; and
    (iv) total reportable position.
    (2) The large position report should include the following 
additional memorandum item: a total that includes the amounts of 
securities delivered through repurchase agreements, securities loaned, 
and as collateral for financial derivatives and other securities 
transactions. This total should not be reflected in the gross financing 
position.
    (3) An illustration of a sample report is contained in Appendix B. 
The net trading position shall be one net number and reported as the 
applicable positive or negative number (or zero). The gross financing 
position and net fails position should each be reported as a single 
entry. If the amount of the net fails position is zero or less, report 
zero. All position amounts should be reported on a trade date basis and 
at par in millions of dollars.
    (4) All positions must be reported as of the close of business of 
the reporting date(s) specified in the notice.
    (5) Each submitted large position report must include the following 
administrative information in addition to the reportable position: the 
name of the reporting entity, the address of the principal place of 
business, the name and address of the designated filing entity, the 
Treasury security that is being reported, the CUSIP number for the 
security being reported, the report date or dates for which information 
is being reported, the date the report was submitted, the name and 
telephone number of the person to contact regarding information 
reported, and the name and position of the authorized individual 
submitting this report.
    (6) The large position report must be signed by one of the 
following: the

[[Page 818]]

chief compliance officer; chief legal officer; chief financial officer; 
chief operating officer; chief executive officer; or managing partner or 
equivalent. The designated filing entity must also include in the 
report, immediately preceding the signature, a statement of 
certification as follows:

    By signing below, I certify that the information contained in this 
report with regard to the designated filing entity is accurate and 
complete. Further, after reasonable inquiry and to the best of my 
knowledge and belief, I certify: (i) That the information contained in 
this report with regard to any other aggregating entities is accurate 
and complete; and (ii) that the reporting entity, including all 
aggregating entities, is in compliance with the requirements of 17 CFR 
Part 420.

    (7) The report must be filed before noon Eastern time on the fourth 
business day following issuance of the press release.
    (d) A report to be filed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section 
will be considered filed when received by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York, Market Reports Division. The report may be filed with the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York by facsimile or delivered hard copy. 
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may in its discretion also 
authorize additional means of reporting.
    (e) A reporting entity that has filed a report pursuant to paragraph 
(c) of this section shall, at the request of the Department or the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, timely provide any supplemental 
information pertaining to such report.

Sec. 420.4  Recordkeeping.

    (a)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section, an aggregating entity must make and maintain records 
pursuant to this part as of its effective date, but only if the 
aggregating entity has controlled a portion of its reporting entity's 
reportable position in any Treasury security when such reportable 
position of the reporting entity has equaled or exceeded the minimum 
large position threshold specified in Sec. 420.2(d) (i.e., $2 billion) 
during the prior two-year period ending December 11, 1996. Subsequent to 
the effective date, an aggregating entity that controls a portion of its 
reporting entity's reportable position in a recently-issued Treasury 
security, when such reportable position of the reporting entity equals 
or exceeds the minimum large position threshold, shall be responsible 
for making and maintaining the records prescribed in this section.
    (2) In the case of a reporting entity whose reportable position in 
any Treasury security has equaled or exceeded the minimum large position 
threshold during the prior two-year period ending December 11, 1996, 
each such reporting entity's designated filing entity shall submit a 
letter to the Government Securities Regulations Staff, Bureau of the 
Public Debt, 999 E Street, N.W., Room 515, Washington, DC 20239, stating 
that the designated filing entity has in place, or will have in place by 
the effective date, a recordkeeping system (including policies and 
procedures) capable of making, verifying the accuracy of, and preserving 
the records required pursuant to this section. The letter shall further 
state that, after reasonable inquiry and to the best of its knowledge 
and belief, the designated filing entity represents that all other 
aggregating entities have in place, or will have in place by the 
effective date, a system (including policies and procedures) capable of 
making, verifying the accuracy of, and preserving the records required 
pursuant to this section.
    (3) The letter specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section must be 
signed by one of the following: the chief compliance officer; chief 
legal officer; chief financial officer; chief operating officer; chief 
executive officer; or managing partner or equivalent. The letter must be 
received by the Bureau of the Public Debt no later than January 10, 
1997.
    (b) Records to be made and preserved by entities that are subject to 
the recordkeeping provisions of the Commission, the Department, or the 
appropriate regulatory agencies for financial institutions. As an 
aggregating entity, compliance by a registered broker or dealer, 
registered

[[Page 819]]

government securities broker or dealer, noticed financial institution, 
depository institution that exercises investment discretion, registered 
investment adviser, or registered investment company with the applicable 
recordkeeping provisions of the Commission, the Department, or the 
appropriate regulatory agencies for financial institutions shall 
constitute compliance with this section, provided that if such entity is 
also the designated filing entity it:
    (1) Makes and keeps copies of all large position reports filed 
pursuant to this part;
    (2) Makes and keeps supporting documents or schedules used to 
compute data for the large position reports filed pursuant to this part, 
including any certifications or schedules it receives from aggregating 
entities pertaining to their holdings of a reportable position;
    (3) Makes and keeps a chart showing the organizational entities that 
are aggregated (if applicable) in determining a reportable position; and
    (4) With respect to recordkeeping preservation requirements that 
contain more than one retention period, preserves records required by 
paragraphs (b)(1)-(3) of this section for the longest record retention 
period of applicable recordkeeping provisions.
    (c) Records to be made and kept by other entities. (1) An 
aggregating entity that is not subject to the provisions of paragraph 
(b) of this section shall make and preserve a journal, blotter, or other 
record of original entry containing an itemized record of all 
transactions that fall within the definition of a reportable position, 
including information showing the account for which such transactions 
were effected and the following information pertaining to the 
identification of each instrument: the type of security, the par amount, 
the CUSIP number, the trade date, the maturity date, the type of 
transaction (e.g., a reverse repurchase agreement), and the name or 
other designation of the person from whom sold or purchased.
    (2) If such aggregating entity is also the designated filing entity, 
then in addition, it shall make and preserve the following records:
    (i) Copies of all large position reports filed pursuant to this 
part;
    (ii) Supporting documents or schedules used to compute data for the 
large position reports filed pursuant to this part, including any 
certifications or schedules it receives from aggregating entities 
pertaining to their holdings of a reportable position; and
    (iii) A chart showing the organizational entities that are 
aggregated (if applicable) in determining a reportable position.
    (3) With respect to the records required by paragraphs (c) (1) and 
(2) of this section, each such aggregating entity shall preserve such 
records for a period of not less than six years, the first two years in 
an easily accessible place. If an aggregating entity maintains its 
records at a location other than its principal place of business, the 
aggregating entity must maintain an index that states the location of 
the records, and such index must be easily accessible at all times.

            Appendix A to Part 420--Separate Reporting Entity

    Subject to the following conditions, one or more aggregating 
entity(ies) (e.g., parent, subsidiary, or organizational component) in a 
reporting entity, either separately or together with one or more other 
aggregating entity(ies), may be recognized as a separate reporting 
entity. All of the following conditions must be met for such entity(ies) 
to qualify for recognition as a separate reporting entity:
    (1) Such entity(ies) must be prohibited by law or regulation from 
exchanging, or must have established

[[Page 820]]

written internal procedures (i.e., Chinese walls) designed to prevent 
the exchange of information related to transactions in Treasury 
securities with any other aggregating entity;
    (2) Such entity(ies) must not be created for the purpose of 
circumventing these large position reporting rules;
    (3) Decisions related to the purchase, sale or retention of Treasury 
securities must be made by employees of such entity(ies). Employees of 
such entity(ies) who make decisions to purchase or dispose of Treasury 
securities must not perform the same function for other aggregating 
entities; and
    (4) The records of such entity(ies) related to the ownership, 
financing, purchase and sale of Treasury securities must be maintained 
by such entity(ies). Those records must be identifiable--separate and 
apart from similar records for other aggregating entities.
    To obtain recognition as a separate reporting entity, each 
aggregating entity or group of aggregating entities must request such 
recognition from the Department pursuant to the procedures outlined in 
paragraph 400.2(c) of this title. Such request must provide a 
description of the entity or group and its position within the reporting 
entity, and provide the following certification:
    ``[Name of the entity(ies)] hereby certifies that to the best of its 
knowledge and belief it meets the conditions for a separate reporting 
entity as described in Appendix A to 17 CFR Part 420. The above named 
entity also certifies that it has established written policies or 
procedures, including ongoing compliance monitoring processes, that are 
designed to prevent the entity or group of entities from:
    ``(1) Exchanging any of the following information with any other 
aggregating entity (a) positions that it holds or plans to trade in a 
Treasury security; (b) investment strategies that it plans to follow 
regarding Treasury securities; and (c) financing strategies that it 
plans to follow regarding Treasury securities, or
    ``(2) In any way intentionally acting together with any other 
aggregating entity with respect to the purchase, sale, retention or 
financing of Treasury securities.
    ``The above-named entity agrees that it will promptly notify the 
Department in writing when any of the information provided to obtain 
separate reporting entity status changes or when this certification is 
no longer valid.''
    Any entity, including any organizational component thereof, that 
previously has received recognition as a separate bidder in Treasury 
auctions from the Department pursuant to 31 CFR Part 356 is also 
recognized as a separate reporting entity without the need to request 
such status, provided such entity continues to be in compliance with the 
conditions set forth in Appendix A of 31 CFR Part 356.

<R05>
Sec. 450.3   Exemption for holdings subject to fiduciary standards.

    (a) The Secretary has determined that the rules and standards of the 
Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation governing 
the holding of government securities in a fiduciary capacity by 
depository institutions subject thereto are adequate. Accordingly, such 
depository institutions are exempt from this part with respect to their 
holdings of government securities in a fiduciary capacity and their 
holdings of government securities in a custodial capacity provided that 
(1) such institution has adopted policies and procedures that would 
apply to such custodial holdings all the requirements imposed by its 
appropriate regulatory agency that are applicable to government 
securities held in a fiduciary capacity, and (2) such custodial holdings 
are subject to examination by the appropriate regulatory agency for 
compliance with such fiduciary requirements.
    (b) The Secretary expects that each appropriate regulatory agency 
will notify the Department if it materially revises its rules and 
standards governing the holding of government securities in a fiduciary 
capacity.


<R05>
Sec. 450.4   Custodial holdings of government securities.

    Depository institutions that are subject to this part shall observe 
the following requirements with respect to their holdings of government 
securities for customer accounts:
    (a)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a depository 
institution shall maintain possession or control of all government 
securities held for the account of customers by segregating such 
securities from the assets of the depository institution and keeping 
them free of any lien, charge or claim of any third party granted or 
created by such depository institution.
    (2)(i) Where customer securities are maintained by a depository 
institution at another depository institution, including but not limited 
to a correspondent bank or a trust company (``custodian institution''), 
the depository institution shall be in compliance with paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section if:
    (A) The depository institution notifies the custodian institution 
that such securities are customer securities;
    (B) The custodian institution maintains such securities in an 
account that is designated for customers of the depository institution 
and that does not contain proprietary securities of the depository 
institution; and
    (C) The depository institution instructs the custodian institution 
to maintain such securities free of any lien, charge, or claim of any 
kind in favor of such custodian institution or any persons claiming 
through it.
    (ii) To the extent that a custodian institution holds securities 
that have been identified as customer securities by a depository 
institution in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the 
custodian institution shall treat such securities as customer securities 
separate from any other securities held for the account of the 
depository institution.
    (3)(i) Where securities that a depository institution is required, 
pursuant to this part 450, to keep free of all liens, charges, or other 
claims (``customer securities'') are maintained by a depository 
institution at a Federal Reserve Bank, the depository institution shall 
be in compliance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section if any lien, 
charge or other claim of such Federal Reserve Bank or any person 
claiming through it against securities of the depository institution 
expressly excludes customer securities.
    (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, a 
depository institution described in that paragraph shall be in 
compliance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section if a Federal Reserve 
Bank retains a lien on securities received during the day that are 
subsequently determined to be customer securities, provided that,
    (A) On that day, the depository institution:

[[Page 825]]

    (1) Because of extraordinary circumstances, at the end of that day 
either requests a discount window advance or is unable to eliminate an 
overdraft with its Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank 
extends credit to the depository institution in order to assure the 
safety and soundness or liquidity of the depository institution; and
    (2) After reasonable efforts, is unable to provide the Federal 
Reserve Bank with an adequate security interest in other collateral that 
is clearly identifiable as pledgeable by the depository institution 
sufficient to fully collateralize such extension of credit; and
    (B) The depository institution diligently pursues with the Federal 
Reserve Bank the substitution of other collateral for securities 
determined to be customer securities; and
    (C) The Federal Reserve Bank agrees that to the extent the lien 
extends to collateral of a value greater than the outstanding balance on 
the loan, customer securities will be the first collateral released from 
the lien.
    (4)(i) To the extent that a depository institution holds securities 
that have been identified to such depository institution as customer 
securities by a government securities broker or dealer, or that the 
government securities broker or dealer has instructed the depository 
institution to place in a segregated account, in accordance with part 
403 of subchapter A of this chapter, the depository institution shall 
treat such securities as customer securities separate from any other 
securities held for the account of the government securities broker or 
dealer and shall comply with all of the provisions of this section with 
respect to such customer securities, except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(4)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) A clearing bank that provides clearing services for a 
government securities broker or dealer and that maintains a segregated 
account as described in Sec. 403.4 of this chapter shall not be required 
to transfer securities to such account upon the instruction of the 
broker or dealer for whom such account is maintained if the clearing 
bank determines that such securities continue to be required as 
collateral for an extension of clearing credit to such dealer. Whenever 
a clearing bank does not segregate securities as of the close of 
business upon the instruction of such broker or dealer, it shall send a 
notification to the appropriate regulatory agency of the broker or 
dealer for whom such account is maintained. Such securities shall 
thereafter be segregated pursuant to the instruction of the broker or 
dealer as soon as they are no longer required by the clearing bank as 
collateral for the extension of clearing credit.
    (5) A depository institution that is subject to Part 403 is not 
required to maintain possession or control of margin securities as that 
term is defined in Sec. 403.5(f)(1).
    (6) Notwithstanding the requirement of paragraph (a)(1) to maintain 
possession or control of customer securities, a depository institution 
may lend such securities to a third party pursuant to the written 
agreement of the customer, if such loan of securities is carried out in 
full compliance with supervisory guidelines of its appropriate 
regulatory agency that expressly govern securities lending practices.
    (b)(1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, a depository institution shall issue a confirmation or a 
safekeeping receipt for each security held for a customer in accordance 
with this section with the exception of securities that are the subject 
of repurchase transactions which are subject to the requirements of 
Sec. 403.5(d) of this chapter. The confirmation or safekeeping receipt 
shall identify the issuer, maturity date, par amount and coupon rate of 
the security being confirmed. The confirmation may be supplied to the 
customer in any manner that complies with applicable Federal banking 
regulations.
    (2) A depository institution shall not be required to send the 
confirmation or safekeeping receipt required by paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section to a customer that is a non-U.S. citizen residing outside the 
United States or a foreign corporation, partnership, or trust, if such 
customer expressly waives in writing the right to receive such 
confirmation or safekeeping receipt.
    (c) Records of government securities held for customers shall be 
maintained

[[Page 826]]

and shall be kept separate and distinct from other records of the 
depository institution. Such records shall:
    (1) Provide a system for identifying each customer, and each 
government security (or the amount of each issue of a government 
security issued in book-entry form) held for the customer;
    (2) Describe the customer's interest in the government security;
    (3) Indicate all receipts and deliveries of government securities 
and all receipts and disbursements of cash by the depository institution 
in connection with such securities;
    (4) Include a copy of the safekeeping receipt or a confirmation 
issued for each government security held; and
    (5) Provide an adequate basis for audit of such information.
    (d) Counts of government securities held for customers in both 
definitive and book-entry form shall be conducted at least annually and 
such counts shall be reconciled with customer account records.
    (1) Counts of book-entry securities and of definitive securities 
held outside the possession of the depository institution shall be made 
by reconciliation of the records of the depository institution with 
those of any depository, depository institution, or Federal Reserve Bank 
on whose books the depository institution has securities accounts.
    (2) The depository institution conducting the count shall also 
verify any such securities in transfer, in transit, pledged, loaned, 
borrowed, deposited, failed to receive, failed to deliver, subject to 
repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements or otherwise subject to the 
depository institution's control or direction that are not in its 
physical possession, where the securities have been in such status for 
longer than thirty days.
    (3) The dates and results of such counts and reconciliations shall 
be documented with differences noted in a security count difference 
account not later than seven business days after the date of each 
required count and verification as provided in this paragraph (d).
    (e) For purposes of this section, a depository institution shall 
treat a government securities broker or dealer as a customer with 
respect to securities maintained by such government securities broker or 
dealer in a Segregated Account as defined in Sec. 403.4(f)(1) of this 
chapter and with respect to securities otherwise identified to the 
depository institution as customer securities for purposes of 
maintaining possession or control of such securities as required by Part 
403 of this chapter. The recordkeeping requirements of paragraph (c) of 
this section require the depository institution to treat such securities 
as customer securities separate from any other securities held for the 
account of the government securities broker or dealer, but do not 
require the depository institution to keep records identifying 
individual customers of the government securities broker or dealer.
    (f) The records required by paragraphs (c) and (d)(3) of this 
section shall be preserved for not less than six years, the first two 
years in an easily accessible place.

  Subpart N--Commission Information Collection Requirements Under the 
    Paperwork Reduction Act: OMB Control Numbers and Expiration Dates

Sec. 200.800  OMB control numbers assigned pursuant to the Paperwork 
          Reduction Act.

    (a) Purpose. This subpart collects and displays the control numbers 
and expiration dates assigned to information collection requirements of 
the Commission by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-511. The Commission intends 
that this subpart comply with the requirements of section 3507(f) of the 
Paperwork Reduction Act, which requires that agencies display a current 
control number assigned by the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget (``OMB'') for each agency information collection requirement. In 
particular, this subpart displays current OMB control numbers and 
expiration dates of those information collection requirements of the 
Commission which are rules and regulations and codified in 17 CFR either 
in full text or incorporated by reference with the approval of the 
Director of the Office of the Federal Register. Where the information 
collection requirement also exists as a separate document, as, for 
example, an information collection requirement which the Commission 
incorporates by reference in 17 CFR, the Commission, of course, will 
display on the separate document as well the current OMB control number 
and the expiration date as required by section 3507(f). Henceforth, the 
Commission will publish in the Federal Register only additions, 
deletions and corrections to particular control numbers and expiration 
dates contained in this subpart.
    (b) Display.
