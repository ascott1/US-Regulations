                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 1996), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

    (a)(1) provided for profit, i.e., with the intent of receiving 
compensation or monetary gain;
    (2) An interconnected service; and
    (3) Available to the public, or to such classes of eligible users as 
to be effectively available to a substantial portion of the public; or
    (b) The functional equivalent of such a mobile service described in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    Incumbent Wide Area SMR Licensees. Licensees who have obtained 
extended implementation authorizations in the 800 MHz or 900 MHz 
service, either by waiver or under Section 90.629 of these rules, and 
who offer real-time, two-way voice service that is interconnected with 
the public switched network.
    Interconnection or Interconnected. Direct or indirect connection 
through automatic or manual means (by wire, microwave, or other 
technologies such as store and forward) to permit the transmission or

    (b) For which a request for such interconnection is pending pursuant 
to section 332(c)(1)(B) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 
332(c)(1)(B). A mobile service offers interconnected service even if the 
service allows subscribers to access the public switched network only 
during specified hours of the day, or if the service provides general 
access to points on the public switched network but also restricts 
access in certain limited ways. Interconnected service does not include 
any interface between a licensee's facilities and the public switched

multiple basis) for private one-way or two-way land mobile radio 
communications by eligible users over designated areas of operation; and
    (c) Any service for which a license is required in a personal 
communications service under part 24 of this chapter.

commercial mobile radio service nor the functional equivalent of a 
service that meets the definition of commercial mobile radio service. 
Private mobile radio service includes the following:
    (a) Not-for-profit land mobile radio and paging services that serve 
the licensee's internal communications needs as defined in part 90 of 
this chapter. Shared-use, cost-sharing, or cooperative arrangements, 
multiple licensed systems that use third party managers or users 
combining resources to meet compatible needs for specialized internal 
communications facilities in compliance with the safeguards of 
Sec. 90.179 of this chapter are presumptively private mobile radio 
services;
    (b) Mobile radio service offered to restricted classes of eligible 
users. This includes the following services: Public Safety Radio 
Services; Special Emergency Radio Service; Industrial Radio Services 
(excluding Business Radio Services that offer customers for-profit 
interconnected services); Land Transportation Radio Services; and 
Radiolocation Services;
    (c) 220-222 MHz land mobile service and Automatic Vehicle Monitoring 
systems (part 90 of this chapter) that do not offer interconnected

whether by wire or radio, including local exchange carriers, 
interexchange carriers, and mobile service providers, that use the North 
American Numbering Plan in connection with the provision of switched 
services.

[59 FR 18495, Apr. 19, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 38402, July 24, 1996; 
61 FR 40352, Aug. 2, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 20.5  Citizenship.

    (a) This rule implements section 310 of the Communications Act, 47 
U.S.C. 310, regarding the citizenship of licensees in the commercial 
mobile radio services. Commercial mobile radio service authorizations 
may not be granted to or held by:
    (1) Any foreign government or any representative thereof;
    (2) Any alien or the representative of any alien;
    (3) Any corporation organized under the laws of any foreign 
government;
    (4) Any corporation of which any officer or director is an alien or 
of which more than one-fifth of the capital stock is owned of record or 
voted by aliens or their representatives or by a foreign government or 
representative thereof or by any corporation organized under the laws of 
a foreign country; or
    (5) Any corporation directly or indirectly controlled by any other 
corporation of which any officer or more than one-fourth of the 
directors are aliens, or of which more than one-fourth of the capital 
stock is owned of record or voted by aliens, their representatives, or 
by a foreign government or representative thereof, or by any corporation 
organized under the laws of a foreign country, if the Commission finds 
that the public interest will be served by the refusal or revocation of 
such license.
    (b) The limits listed in paragraph (a) of this section may be 
exceeded by eligible individuals who held ownership interests on May 24, 
1993, pursuant to the waiver provisions established in section 332(c)(6) 
of the Communications Act. Transfers of ownership to any other person in 
violation of paragraph (a) of this section are prohibited.

[[Page 7]]


<R05>
Sec. 20.6  CMRS spectrum aggregation limit.

    (a) 45 MHz limitation. No licensee in the broadband PCS, cellular, 
or SMR services (including all parties under common control) regulated 
as CMRS (see Sec. 20.9) shall have an attributable interest in a total 
of more than 45 MHz of licensed broadband PCS, cellular, and SMR 
spectrum regulated as CMRS with significant overlap in any geographic 
area.
    (b) SMR spectrum. To calculate the amount of attributable SMR 
spectrum for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, an entity must 
count all 800 MHz channels and 900 MHz channels located at any SMR base 
station inside the geographic area (MTA or BTA) where there is 
significant overlap. All 800 MHz channels located on at least one of 
those identified base stations count as 50 kHz (25 kHz paired), and all 
900 MHz channels located on at least one of those identified base 
stations count as 25 kHz (12.5 kHz paired), except that no more than 10 
MHz of SMR spectrum in the 800 MHz SMR service will be attributed to an 
entity when determining compliance with the cap.
    (c) Significant overlap. (1) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this 
section, significant overlap of a PCS licensed service area and CGSA(s) 
(as defined in Sec. 22.911 of this chapter) or SMR service area(s) 
occurs when at least 10 percent of the population of the PCS licensed 
service area, as determined by the 1990 census figures for the counties 
contained therein, is within the CGSA(s) and/or SMR service area(s).
    (2) The Commission shall presume that an SMR service area covers 
less than 10 percent of the population of a PCS service area if none of 
the base stations of the SMR licensee is located within the PCS service 
area. For an SMR licensee's base stations that are located within a PCS 
service area, the channels licensed at those sites will be presumed to 
cover 10 percent of the population of the PCS service area, unless the 
licensee shows that its protected service contour for all of its base 
stations covers less than 10 percent of the population of the PCS 
service area.
    (d) Ownership attribution. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this 
section, ownership and other interests in broadband PCS licensees, 
cellular licensees, or SMR licensees will be attributed to their holders 
pursuant to the following criteria:
    (1) Controlling interest shall be attributable. Controlling interest 
means majority voting equity ownership, any general partnership 
interest, or any means of actual working control (including negative 
control) over the operation of the licensee, in whatever manner 
exercised.
    (2) Partnership and other ownership interests and any stock interest 
amounting to 20 percent or more of the equity, or outstanding stock, or 
outstanding voting stock of a broadband PCS, cellular or SMR licensee 
shall be attributed, except that ownership will not be attributed unless 
the partnership and other ownership interests and any stock interest 
amount to at least 40 percent of the equity, or outstanding stock, or 
outstanding voting stock of a broadband PCS, cellular or SMR licensee if 
the ownership interest is held by a small business or a rural telephone 
company, as these terms are defined in Sec. 1.2110 of this chapter or 
other related provisions of the Commission's rules, or if the ownership 
interest is held by an entity with a non-controlling equity interest in 
a broadband PCS licensee or applicant that is a small business.
    (3) Stock interests held in trust shall be attributed to any person 
who holds or shares the power to vote such stock to any person who has 
the sole power to sell such stock, and, in the case of stock held in 
trust, to any person who has the right to revoke the trust at will or to 
replace the trustee at will. If the trustee has a familial, personal, or 
extra-trust business relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary, the 
grantor or beneficiary, as appropriate, will be attributed with the 
stock interests held in trust.
    (4) Non-voting stock shall be attributed as an interest in the 
issuing entity if in excess of the amounts set forth in paragraph (d)(2) 
of this section.
    (5) Debt and instruments such as warrants, convertible debentures, 
options, or other interests (except non-voting stock) with rights of 
conversion to voting interests shall not be attributed

[[Page 8]]

unless and until conversion is effected, except that this provision does 
not apply in determining whether an entity is a small business, a rural 
telephone company, or a business owned by minorities and/or women, as 
these terms are defined in Sec. 1.2110 of this chapter or other related 
provisions of the Commission's rules.
    (6) Limited partnership interests shall be attributed to limited 
partners and shall be calculated according to both the percentage of 
equity paid in and the percentage of distribution of profits and losses.
    (7) Officers and directors of a broadband PCS licensee or applicant, 
cellular licensee, or SMR licensee shall be considered to have an 
attributable interest in the entity with which they are so associated. 
The officers and directors of an entity that controls a broadband PCS 
licensee or applicant, a cellular licensee, or an SMR licensee shall be 
considered to have an attributable interest in the broadband PCS 
licensee or applicant, cellular licensee, or SMR licensee.
    (8) Ownership interests that are held indirectly by any party 
through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by 
successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in 
the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution 
benchmark to the resulting product, except that if the ownership 
percentage for an interest in any link in the chain exceeds 50 percent 
or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were a 100 
percent interest.
    (9) Any person who manages the operations of a broadband PCS, 
cellular, or SMR licensee pursuant to a management agreement shall be 
considered to have an attributable interest in such licensee if such 
person, or its affiliate has authority to make decisions or otherwise 
engage in practices or activities that determine, or significantly 
influence,
    (i) The nature or types of services offered by such licensee;
    (ii) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (iii) The prices charged for such services.
    (10) Any licensee or its affiliate who enters into a joint marketing 
arrangements with a broadband PCS, cellular, or SMR licensee, or its 
affiliate shall be considered to have an attributable interest, if such 
licensee, or its affiliate has authority to make decisions or otherwise 
engage in practices or activities that determine, or significantly 
influence,
    (i) The nature or types of services offered by such licensee;
    (ii) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (iii) The prices charged for such services.
    (e) Divestiture. (1) Any party holding controlling or attributable 
ownership interests in broadband PCS, cellular, and/or SMR licensees 
regulated as CMRS providers that would exceed the spectrum aggregation 
limitation defined in paragraph (a) of this section, if granted 
additional licenses, may be a party to a broadband PCS, cellular, or SMR 
application (i.e., have a controlling or attributable interest in the 
applicant), and such applicant will be eligible for licenses amounting 
to more than 45 MHz of broadband PCS, cellular, and/or SMR spectrum 
regulated as CMRS in a geographical area, pursuant to the divestiture 
procedures set forth in paragraphs (e)(2) through (e)(4) of this 
section; provided, however, that in the case of parties holding 
controlling or attributable ownership interests in broadband PCS, 
cellular, and/or SMR licensees, these divestiture procedures shall be 
available only to:
    (i) Parties with controlling or attributable ownership interests in 
broadband PCS, cellular, and/or SMR licenses where the geographic 
license areas cover 20 percent or less of the applicant's service area 
population;
    (ii) Parties with attributable interests in broadband PCS, cellular, 
and/or SMR licenses solely due to management agreements or joint 
marketing agreements; and
    (iii) Parties with non-controlling attributable interests in 
broadband PCS, cellular, and/or SMR licenses, regardless of the degree 
to which the geographic license areas cover the applicant's service area 
population. For purposes of this paragraph, a ``non-controlling 
attributable interest'' is one in

[[Page 9]]

which the holder has less than a fifty (50) percent voting interest and 
there is an unaffiliated single holder of a fifty (50) percent or 
greater voting interest.
    (2) The applicant for a license that, if granted, would exceed the 
45 MHz limitation shall certify on its application that it and all 
parties to the application will come into compliance with this 
limitation.
    (3) If such an applicant is a successful bidder in an auction, it 
must submit with its long-form application a signed statement describing 
its efforts to date and future plans to come into compliance with the 45 
MHz spectrum limitation. A similar statement must also be included with 
any application for assignment of licenses or transfer of control that, 
if granted, would exceed the spectrum aggregation limit.
    (4) If such an applicant is otherwise qualified, its application 
will be granted subject to a condition that the licensee shall come into 
compliance with the 45 MHz spectrum limitation within ninety (90) days 
of final grant.
    (i) Parties holding controlling interests in broadband PCS, 
cellular, and/or SMR licensees that conflict with the attribution 
threshold or geographic overlap limitations set forth in this section 
will be considered to have come into compliance if they have submitted 
to the Commission an application for assignment of license or transfer 
of control of the conflicting licensee (see Secs. 24.839 of this chapter 
(PCS), 22.39 of this chapter (cellular), 90.158 of this chapter (SMR)) 
by which, if granted, such parties no longer would have an attributable 
interest in the conflicting license. If no such assignment or transfer 
application is tendered to the Commission within ninety (90) days of 
final grant of the initial license, the Commission may consider the 
certification and the divestiture statement to be material, bad faith 
misrepresentations and shall invoke the condition on the initial license 
or the assignment or transfer, cancelling or rescinding it 
automatically, shall retain all monies paid to the Commission, and, 
based on the facts presented, shall take any other action it may deem 
appropriate. Divestiture may be to an interim trustee if a buyer has not 
been secured in the required period of time, as long as the applicant 
has no interest in or control of the trustee, and the trustee may 
dispose of the license as it sees fit.
    (ii) Where parties to broadband PCS, cellular, or SMR applications 
hold less than controlling (but still attributable) interests in 
broadband PCS, cellular, or SMR licensee(s), they shall submit, within 
ninety (90) days of final grant, a certification that the applicant and 
all parties to the application have come into compliance with the 
limitations on spectrum aggregation set forth in this section.

    Note 1 to Sec. 20.6: For purposes of the ownership attribution 
limit, all ownership interests in operations that serve at least 10 
percent of the population of the PCS service area should be included in 
determining the extent of a PCS applicant's cellular or SMR ownership.

    Note 2 to Sec. 20.6: When a party owns an attributable interest in 
more than one cellular or SMR system that overlaps a PCS service area, 
the total population in the overlap area will apply on a cumulative 
basis.

    Note 3 to Sec. 20.6: Waivers of Sec. 20.6(d) may be granted upon an 
affirmative showing:

    (1) That the interest holder has less than a 50 percent voting 
interest in the licensee and there is an unaffiliated single holder of a 
50 percent or greater voting interest;
    (2) That the interest holder is not likely to affect the local 
market in an anticompetitive manner;
    (3) That the interest holder is not involved in the operations of 
the licensee and does not have the ability to influence the licensee on 
a regular basis; and
    (4) That grant of a waiver is in the public interest because the 
benefits to the public of common ownership outweigh any potential 
anticompetitive harm to the market.

    (13) A mobile service that is the functional equivalent of a 
commercial mobile radio service.
    (i) A mobile service that does not meet the definition of commercial 
mobile radio service is presumed to be a private mobile radio service.
    (ii) Any interested party may seek to overcome the presumption that 
a particular mobile radio service is a private mobile radio service by 
filing a petition for declaratory ruling challenging a mobile service 
provider's regulatory treatment as a private mobile radio service.
    (A) The petition must show that: (1) The mobile service in question 
meets

[[Page 11]]

the definition of commercial mobile radio service; or
    (2) The mobile service in question is the functional equivalent of a 
service that meets the definition of a commercial mobile radio service.
    (B) A variety of factors will be evaluated to make a determination 
whether the mobile service in question is the functional equivalent of a 
commercial mobile radio service, including: consumer demand for the 
service to determine whether the service is closely substitutable for a 
commercial mobile radio service; whether changes in price for the 
service under examination, or for the comparable commercial mobile radio 
service would prompt customers to change from one service to the other; 
and market research information identifying the targeted market for the 
service under review.
    (C) The petition must contain specific allegations of fact supported 
by affidavit(s) of person(s) with personal knowledge. The petition must 
be served on the mobile service provider against whom it is filed and 
contain a certificate of service to this effect. The mobile service 
provider may file an opposition to the petition and the petitioner may 
file a reply. The general rules of practice and procedure contained in 
Secs. 1.1 through 1.52 of this chapter shall apply.
    (b) Licensees of a Personal Communications Service or applicants for 
a Personal Communications Service license proposing to use any Personal 
Communications Service spectrum to offer service on a private mobile 
radio service basis must overcome the presumption that Personal 
Communications Service is a commercial mobile radio service.
    (1) The applicant or licensee (who must file an application to 
modify its authorization) seeking authority to dedicate a portion of the 
spectrum for private mobile radio service, must include a certification 
that it will offer Personal Communications Service on a private mobile 
radio service basis. The certification must include a description of the 
proposed service sufficient to demonstrate that it is not within the 
definition of commercial mobile radio service in Sec. 20.3. Any 
application requesting to use any Personal Communications Service 
spectrum to offer service on a private mobile radio service basis will 
be placed on public notice by the Commission.
    (2) Any interested party may file a petition to deny the application 
within 30 days after the date of public notice announcing the acceptance 
for filing of the application. The petition shall contain specific 
allegations of fact supported by affidavit(s) of person(s) with personal 
knowledge to show that the applicant's request does not rebut the 
commercial mobile radio service presumption. The petition must be served 
on the applicant and contain a certificate of service to this effect. 
The applicant may file an opposition with allegations of fact supported 
by affidavit. The petitioner may file a reply. No additional pleadings 
will be allowed. The general rules of practice and procedure contained 
in Sec. 1.1 through Sec. 1.52 of this chapter and Sec. 22.30 of this 
chapter shall apply.
    (c) Any provider of private land mobile service before August 10, 
1993 (including any system expansions, modifications, or acquisitions of 
additional licenses in the same service, even if authorized after this 
date), and any private paging service utilizing frequencies allocated as 
of January 1, 1993, that meet the definition of commercial mobile radio 
service, shall, except for purposes of Sec. 20.5 (applicable August 10, 
1993 for the providers listed in this paragraph), be treated as private 
mobile radio service until August 10, 1996. After this date, these 
entities will be treated as commercial mobile radio service providers 
regulated under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 20.11  Interconnection to facilities of local exchange carriers.

    (a) A local exchange carrier must provide the type of 
interconnection reasonably requested by a mobile service licensee or 
carrier, within a reasonable time after the request, unless such 
interconnection is not technically feasible or economically reasonable. 
Complaints against carriers under section 208 of the Communications Act, 
47 U.S.C. 208, alleging a violation of this section shall follow the 
requirements of Secs. 1.711-1.734 of this chapter, 47 CFR 1.711-1.734.

[[Page 12]]

    (b) Local exchange carriers and commercial mobile radio service 
providers shall comply with principles of mutual compensation.

Sec. 20.13  State petitions for authority to regulate rates.

    (a) States may petition for authority to regulate the intrastate 
rates of any commercial mobile radio service. The petition must include 
the following:
    (1) Demonstrative evidence that market conditions in the state for 
commercial mobile radio services do not adequately protect subscribers 
to such services from unjust and unreasonable rates or rates that are 
unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. Alternatively, a state's 
petition may include demonstrative evidence showing that market 
conditions for commercial mobile radio services do not protect 
subscribers adequately from unjust and unreasonable rates, or rates that 
are unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory, and that a substantial 
portion of the commercial mobile radio service subscribers in the state 
or a specified geographic area have no alternative means of obtaining 
basic telephone service. This showing may include evidence of the range 
of basic telephone service alternatives available to consumers in the 
state.
    (2) The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of the types 
of evidence, information, and analysis that may be considered pertinent 
to determine market conditions and consumer protection by the Commission 
in reviewing any petition filed by a state under this section:
    (i) The number of commercial mobile radio service providers in the 
state, the types of services offered by commercial mobile radio service 
providers in the state, and the period of time that these providers have 
offered service in the state;
    (ii) The number of customers of each commercial mobile radio service 
provider in the state; trends in each provider's customer base during 
the most

[[Page 13]]

recent annual period or other data covering another reasonable period if 
annual data is unavailable; and annual revenues and rates of return for 
each commercial mobile radio service provider;
    (iii) Rate information for each commercial mobile radio service 
provider, including trends in each provider's rates during the most 
recent annual period or other data covering another reasonable period if 
annual data is unavailable;
    (iv) An assessment of the extent to which services offered by the 
commercial mobile radio service providers the state proposes to regulate 
are substitutable for services offered by other carriers in the state;
    (v) Opportunities for new providers to enter into the provision of 
competing services, and an analysis of any barriers to such entry;
    (vi) Specific allegations of fact (supported by affidavit of person 
with personal knowledge) regarding anti-competitive or discriminatory 
practices or behavior by commercial mobile radio service providers in 
the state;
    (vii) Evidence, information, and analysis demonstrating with 
particularity instances of systematic unjust and unreasonable rates, or 
rates that are unjust or unreasonably discriminatory, imposed upon 
commercial mobile radio service subscribers. Such evidence should 
include an examination of the relationship between rates and costs. 
Additionally, evidence of a pattern of such rates, that demonstrates the 
inability of the commercial mobile radio service marketplace in the 
state to produce reasonable rates through competitive forces will be 
considered especially probative; and
    (viii) Information regarding customer satisfaction or 
dissatisfaction with services offered by commercial mobile radio service 
providers, including statistics and other information about complaints 
filed with the state regulatory commission.
    (3) Petitions must include a certification that the state agency 
filing the petition is the duly authorized state agency responsible for 
the regulation of telecommunication services provided in the state.
    (4) Petitions must identify and describe in detail the rules the 
state proposes to establish if the petition is granted.
    (5) States have the burden of proof. Interested parties may file 
comments in support or in opposition to the petition within 30 days 
after public notice of the filing of a petition by a state under this 
section. Any interested party may file a reply within 15 days after the 
expiration of the filing period for comments. No additional pleadings 
may be filed. Except for Sec. 1.45 of this chapter, practice and 
procedure rules contained in Secs. 1.42-1.52 of this chapter shall 
apply. The provisions of Secs. 1.771-1.773 of this chapter do not apply.
    (6) The Commission shall act upon any petition filed by a state 
under this paragraph not later than the end of the nine-month period 
after the filing of the petition.
    (7) If the Commission grants the petition, it shall authorize the 
state to regulate rates for commercial mobile radio services in the 
state during a reasonable period of time, as specified by the 
Commission. The period of time specified by the Commission will be that 
necessary to ensure that rates are just and reasonable, or not unjustly 
or unreasonably discriminatory.
    (b) States that regulated rates for commercial mobile services as of 
June 1, 1993, may petition the Commission under this section before 
August 10, 1994, to extend this authority.
    (1) The petition will be acted upon by the Commission in accordance 
with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section.
    (2) The Commission shall act upon the petition (including any 
reconsideration) not later than the end of the 12-month period following 
the date of the filing of the petition by the state involved. Commercial 
mobile radio service providers offering such service in the state shall

any reconsideration of the petition are acted upon by the Commission.
    (3) The provisions of paragraph (a)(7) of this section apply to any 
petition granted by the Commission under this paragraph.

[[Page 14]]

    (c) No sooner than 18 months from grant of authority by the 
Commission under this section for state rate regulations, any interested 
party may petition the Commission for an order to discontinue state 
authority for rate regulation.
    (1) Petitions to discontinue state authority for rate regulation 
must be based on recent empirical data or other significant evidence 
demonstrating that the exercise of rate authority by a state is no 
longer necessary to ensure that the rates for commercial mobile are just 
and reasonable or not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory.
    (2) Any interested party may file comments in support of or in 
opposition to the petition within 30 days after public notice of the 
filing of the petition. Any interested party may file a reply within 15 
days after the time for filing comments has expired. No additional 
pleadings may be filed. Except for 1.45 of this chapter, practice and 
procedure rules contained in Sec. 1.42-1.52 of this chapter apply. The 
provisions of Sec. 1.771-1.773 of this chapter do not apply.
    (3) The Commission shall act upon any petition filed by any 
interested party under this paragraph within nine months after the 
filing of the petition.

Station License'') must be filed in duplicate by the licensee between 
thirty (30) and sixty (60) days prior to the expiration date of the 
license sought to be renewed. Whenever a group of station licenses in 
the same radio service are to be renewed simultaneously, a single 
``blanket'' application may be filed to cover the entire group, if the 
application identifies each station by call sign and station location 
and if two copies are provided for each station affected. Applicants 
should note also any special renewal requirements under the rules for 
each radio service.
    (d) Assignment of license. FCC Form 702 (``Application for Consent 
to Assignment of Radio Station Construction Authorization or License for 
Stations in Services Other than Broadcast'') must be submitted to assign 
voluntarily (as by, for example, contract or other agreement) or 
involuntarily (as by, for example, death, bankruptcy, or legal 
disability) the station authorization. In the case of involuntary 
assignment (or transfer of control) the application must be filed within 
10 days of the event causing the assignment (or transfer of control). 
FCC Form 702 must also be used for non-substantial (pro forma) 
assignments. In addition, FCC Form 430 (``Licensee Qualification 
Report'') must be submitted by the proposed assignee unless such 
assignee has a current and substantially accurate report on file with 
the Commission. Whenever a group of station licenses in the same radio 
services are to be assigned to a single assignee, a single ``blanket'' 
application may be filed to cover the entire group, if the application 
identifies each station by call sign and station location and if two 
copies are provided for each station affected. The assignment must be 
completed within 45 days from the date of authorization. Upon 
consummation of an approved assignment, the Commission must be notified 
by letter of the date of consummation within 10 days of its occurrence.
    (e) Partial assignment of license. In the microwave services, 
authorization for assignment from one company to another of only a part 
or portions of the facilities (transmitters) authorized under an 
existing license (as distinguished from an assignment of the facilities 
in their entirety) may be granted upon application:
    (1) By the assignee on FCC Form 494 and
    (2) By the assignor on FCC Form 494 for deletion of the assigned 
facilities, indicating concurrence in the assignee's request.

The assignment shall be consummated within 45 days from the date of 
authorization. In the event that consummation does not occur, FCC Form 
494 shall be submitted to return the assignor's license to its original 
condition.
    (f) Transfer of control of corporation holding a conditional license 
or license. FCC Form 704 (``Application for Consent to Transfer of 
Control'') must be submitted in order to voluntarily or involuntarily 
transfer control (de jure or de facto) of a corporation holding any 
conditional licenses or licenses. FCC Form 704 must also be used for 
non-substantial (pro forma) transfers of control. In addition, FCC Form 
430 (``Licensee Qualification Report'') must be submitted by the 
proposed transferee unless said transferee has a current and 
substantially accurate report on file with the Commission. The transfer 
must be completed within 45 days from the date of authorization. Upon 
consummation of an approved transfer, the Commission must be notified by 
letter of the date of consummation within 10 days of its occurrence.
    (g) Antenna Structure Registration. FCC Form 854 (Application for 
Antenna Structure Registration) accompanied by a final Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) determination of ``no hazard'' must be filed by the 
antenna structure owner to receive an antenna structure registration 
number. Criteria used to determine whether FAA notification and 
registration is required for

[[Page 23]]

a particular antenna structure are contained in Part 17 of this chapter.

Sec. 21.13  General application requirements.

    (a) Each application for a license or for consent to assignment or 
transfer of control shall:
    (1) Disclose fully the real party (or parties) in interest, 
including (as required) a complete disclosure of the identify and 
relationship of those persons or entities directly or indirectly owning 
or controlling (or both) the applicant;
    (2) Demonstrate the applicant's legal, financial, technical, and 
other qualifications to be a permittee or licensee;
    (3) Submit the information required by the Commission's Rules, 
requests, and application forms;
    (4) Except for applications in the Multipoint Distribution Service 
filed on or after September 15, 1995, state specifically the reasons why 
a grant of the proposal would serve the public interest, convenience, 
and necessity.
    (5) Be maintained by the applicant substantially accurate and 
complete in all significant respects in accordance with the provisions 
of Sec. 1.65 of this chapter; and
    (6) Show compliance with the special requirements applicable to each 
radio service and make all special showings that may be applicable 
(e.g., those required by secs. 21.900, 21.912 and 21.913).
    (b) Applications filed in the Multipoint Distribution Service shall 
not cross-reference previously filed material.
    (c) In addition to the general application requirements of 
Secs. 21.13 through 21.17 of this part, applicants shall submit any 
additional documents, exhibits, or signed written statements of fact:
    (1) As may be required by the other parts of the Commission's Rules, 
and the other subparts of Part 21 (particularly Subpart C and those

any applicant, permittee, or licensee to enable it to determine whether 
a radio authorization should be granted, denied, or revoked.
    (d) Except when the Commission has declared explicitly to the 
contrary, an informational requirement does not in itself imply the 
processing treatment of decisional weight to be accorded the response.
    (e) All applicants are required to indicate at the time their 
application is filed whether an authorization of the facilities is 
categorically excluded as defined by Sec. 1.1306 of the Commission's 
rules. If answered affirmatively, an Environmental Assessment as 
described by Sec. 1.1311, need not be filed with the application.
    (f) Whenever an individual applicant, or a partner (in the case of a 
partnership) or a full time manager (in the case of a corporation) will 
not actively participate in the day-to-day management and operation of 
proposed facilities, the applicant or licensee will submit a statement 
containing the reasons therefor and disclosing the details of the 
proposed operation, including a demonstration of how control over the 
radio facilities will be retained by the applicant. If the operation of 
a radio station is to be accomplished by contractual arrangement with an 
entity unrelated to an applicant or licensee, the applicant or licensee 
shall file a copy of the agreement or contract which shall demonstrate 
that:
    (1) The operation is accomplished according to general instructions 
provided for by the applicant;
    (2) The applicant retains effective control over the radio 
facilities and their operations; and
    (3) The applicant assumes full responsibility for both the quality 
of service and for contractor compliance with the Commission's Rules.

<R05>
Sec. 21.15  Technical content of applications.

    Applications shall contain all technical information required by the 
application form and any additional information necessary to fully 
describe the proposed facilities and to demonstrate compliance with all 
technical requirements of the rules governing the radio service involved 
(see subparts C, F and K as appropriate). The following paragraphs 
describe a number of technical requirements.
    (a)(1) Except in the case of applicants for Multipoint Distribution 
Service, applicants proposing a new station location (including receive-
only stations and passive repeaters) must indicate whether the station 
site is owned. If it is not owned, its availability for the proposed 
radio station site must be demonstrated. Under ordinary circumstances, 
this requirement will be considered satisfied if the site is under lease 
or under written option to buy or lease.
    (2) Where any lease or agreement to use land limits or conditions in 
any way the applicant's access or use of the site to provide public 
service, a copy of the lease or agreement (which clearly indicates the 
limitations or conditions) must be filed with the application, except in 
the case of applicants for stations in the Multipoint Distribution 
Service. Multipoint Distribution Service applicants must instead certify 
compliance with the limitations and conditions contained in the lease or 
option agreement.
    (3) Except for BTA and PSA authorization holders, Multipoint 
Distribution Service applicants proposing a new station location must 
certify the proposed station site will be available to the applicant for 
timely construction of the facilities during the initial construction 
period.
    (4) An applicant's failure to include a certification required under 
this Section will result in dismissal of the application. The submission 
of a false certification will subject the applicant to all remedies 
available to the Commission, including the dismissal with prejudice of 
all applications filed by the offending applicant and the revocation of 
authorizations of the offending applicant. Also, if evidence of intent 
exists, the case will be referred to the Department of Justice for 
criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1001. In addition, the submission 
of an intentionally falsified certification will be treated as a 
reflection on an applicant's basic qualifications to become or to remain 
a licensee.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Each application involving a new or modified transmitting 
antenna supporting structure, passive facility, or the addition or 
removal of a transmitting antenna, or the repositioning of an authorized 
antenna for a station must be accompanied by a vertical profile sketch 
of the total structure depicting its structural nature and clearly 
indicating the ground elevation (above sea level) at the structure site, 
the overall height of the structure above ground (including obstruction 
lights when required, lightning rods, etc.) and, if mounted on a 
building, its overall height above the building. The proposed antenna on 
the structure must be clearly identified and its height above-ground 
(measured to the center of radiation) clearly indicated. Alternatively, 
applicants in the Multipoint Distribution Service who filed applications 
on or after September 15, 1995, may provide this information in the MDS 
long-form application.
    (d) Each application proposing a new or modified antenna structure 
for a station (including a passive repeater or signal booster station) 
so as to change its overall height shall indicate whether any necessary 
notification of the FAA has been made. Complete information as to rules 
concerning the construction, marking and lighting of antenna structures 
is contained in part 17 of this chapter. See also Sec. 21.111 if the 
structure is used by more than one station.
    (e) Antenna Structure Registration Number. Applications proposing 
construction of a new antenna structure or alteration of the overall 
height of an existing antenna structure, where FAA notification prior to 
such construction or alteration is required by part 17 of this chapter, 
must include the FCC Antenna Structure Registration Number for the 
affected structure. If no such

[[Page 25]]

number has been assigned at the time the application is filed, the 
applicant must state in the application whether or not the antenna 
structure owner has notified the FAA of the proposed construction or 
alteration and applied to the FCC for an Antenna Structure Registration 
Number in accordance with Part 17 of this chapter of this structure for 
the antenna structure in question.
    (f) Except for applicants in the Multipoint Distribution Service who 
filed applications on or after September 15, 1995, an applicant 
proposing construction of one or more new stations or modification of 
existing stations where substantial changes in the operation or 
maintenance procedures are involved must submit a showing of the general 
maintenance procedures involved to insure the rendition of good public 
communications service. The showing should include but need not be 
limited to the following.
    (1) Location and telephone number (if known) of the maintenance 
center for a point to point microwave system. In lieu of providing the 
location and telephone number of the maintenance on a case by case 
basis, a licensee may file a complete list for all operational stations 
with the Commission and the Engineer-In-Charge of the appropriate radio 
district on an annual basis or at more frequent intervals as necessary 
to keep the information current.
    (2) The manner in which technical personnel are made aware of 
malfunction at any of the stations and the appropriate time required for 
them to reach any of the stations in the event of an emergency. If fault 
alarms are to be used, the items to be alarmed shall be specified as 
well as the location of the alarm center.
    (g) Applications in the Multipoint Distribution Service filed before 
September 15, 1995, proposing a new or replacement antenna (excluding 
omni-directional antennas) shall include an antenna radiation pattern 
showing the antenna power gain distribution in the horizontal plane 
expressed in decibels, unless such pattern is known to be on file with 
the Commission in which case the applicant may reference in its 
application the FCC-ID number that indicates that the pattern is on file 
with the Commission. Multipoint Distribution Service applicants who 
filed applications on or after September 15, 1995 must provide related 
information in completing an MDS long-form application.
    (h) Except for applications in the Multipoint Distribution Service 
filed on or after September 15, 1995, each application in the Point-to-
Point Radio, Local Television Transmission and Digital Electronic 
Message Service (excluding user stations) proposing a new or replacement 
antenna (excluding omni-directional antennas) shall include an antenna 
radiation pattern showing the antenna power gain distribution in the 
horizontal plane expressed in decibels, unless such pattern is known to 
be on file with the Commission in which case the applicant may reference 
in its application the FCC-ID number that indicates that the pattern is 
on file with the Commission. Multipoint Distribution Service applicants 
who filed applications on or after September 15, 1995 must provide 
related information in completing an MDS long-form application.

Sec. 21.19  Waiver of rules.

    Waivers of these rules may be granted upon application or on the 
Commission's own motion. A request for waiver shall contain a statement 
of reasons sufficient to justify a waiver. A waiver will not be granted 
except upon an affirmative showing that:

[[Page 26]]

    (a) The underlying purpose of the rule will not be served, or would 
be frustrated, by its application in the particular case, and that grant 
of the waiver is otherwise in the public interest; or
    (b) The unique facts and circumstances of a particular case render 
application of the rule inequitable, unduly burdensome or otherwise 
contrary to the public interest. Applicants must also show the lack of a 
reasonable alternative.

Sec. 21.20  Defective applications.

    (a) Unless the Commission shall otherwise permit, an application 
will be unacceptable for filing and will be returned to the applicant 
with a brief statement as to the omissions or discrepancies if:
    (1) The application is defective with respect to completeness of 
answers to questions, informational showings, execution, or other 
matters of a formal character; or
    (2) The application does not substantially comply with the 
Commission's rules, regulations, specific requests for additional 
information, or other requirements.

    (b) By way of illustration only, and not in any way limiting the 
scope of paragraph (a), the following are examples of common 
deficiencies which result in defective applications under paragraph (a):
    (1) The application is not properly executed;
    (2) The submitted filing fee (if a filing fee is required) is 
insufficient;
    (3) The application does not demonstrate how the proposed radio 
facilities will serve the public interest, convenience or necessity;
    (4) The application does not demonstrate compliance with the special 
requirements applicable to the radio service involved;
    (5) The application does not certify the availability of the 
proposed station site.
    (6) The application does not include the environmental assessment 
required for any significant environmental impact under the Commission's 
environmental rules (Part 1, Subpart I);
    (7) The application does not specify the polarization and, where 
applicable, the antenna orientation azimuth and distance;
    (8) The application does not include all necessary exhibits;
    (9) The application is filed after the cutoff date prescribed in 
Sec. 21.31 or Sec. 21.914 of this part; or
    (10) The application proposes the use of a frequency not allocated 
to such use.
    (c) Applications considered defective under paragraph (a) of this 
section may be accepted for filing if:
    (1) The application is accompanied by a request which sets forth the 
reasons in support of a waiver of (or an exception to), in whole or in 
part, any specific rule, regulation, or requirement with which the 
application is in conflict; or
    (2) The Commission, upon its own motion, waives (or allows an 
exception to), in whole or in part, any rule, regulation or requirement.
    (d) If an applicant is requested by the Commission to file any 
documents or any supplementary or explanatory information not 
specifically required in the prescribed application form, a failure to 
comply with such request within a specified time period will be deemed 
to render the application defective and will subject it to dismissal.

Sec. 21.22  Repetitious applications.

    (a) Where an applicant has been afforded an opportunity for a 
hearing with respect to a particular application for a new station, or 
for an extension or enlargement of a service or facilities, and the 
Commission has, after

[[Page 27]]

hearing or default, denied the application or dismissed it with 
prejudice, the Commission will not consider a like application involving 
service of the same kind to the same area by the same applicant, or by 
the applicant's successor or assignee, or on behalf of or for the 
benefit of the original parties in interest, until after the lapse of 12 
months from the effective date of the Commission's order. The Commission 
may, for good cause shown, waive the requirements of this section.
    (b) Where an appeal has been taken from the action of the Commission 
denying a particular application, another application for the same class 
of station and for the same area, in whole or in part, filed by the same 
applicant or by the applicant's successor or assignee, or on behalf or 
for the benefit of the original parties in interest, will not be 
considered until the final disposition of such appeal.

Sec. 21.23  Amendment of applications.

    (a) (1) Any pending application may be amended as a matter of right 
if the application has not been designated for hearing, or for 
comparative evaluation pursuant to Sec. 21.35, or for the random 
selection process, provided, however, that the amendments must comply 
with the provisions of Sec. 21.29 as appropriate and the Commission has 
not otherwise forbidden the amendment of pending applications.
    (2) A Multipoint Distribution Service application tentatively 
selected for qualification review by the random selection process may be 
amended as a matter of right up to 14 days after the date of the public 
notice announcing the tentative selection, provided, however, that the 
amendments must comply with the provisions of Sec. 21.29 as appropriate 
and the Commission has not otherwise forbidden the amendment of pending 
applications.
    (3) Provided, however, applications may not be amended if the 
amendments seek more than a pro forma change of ownership or control 
(bankruptcy, death or legal disability) of a pending Multipoint 
Distribution Service application and any amendment or application will 
be dismissed if the amendment or application seeks more than a pro forma 
change of ownership or control.
    (b) Requests to amend an application designated for hearing or for 
comparative evaluation or for tentative selection for qualification 
review by the random selection process may be granted only if a written 
petition demonstrating good cause is submitted and properly served on 
the parties of record, except that Multipoint Distribution Service 
applications tentatively selected in a random selection process may be 
amended as a matter of right as provided in paragraph (a) of this 
section. Provided, however, requests to amend applications will not be 
granted that seek more than a pro forma change of ownership or control 
(bankruptcy, death or legal disability) of a pending Multipoint 
Distribution Service application and any application seeking more than a 
pro forma change of ownership or control will be dismissed.
    (c) The Commission will classify amendments on a case-by-case basis. 
Whenever previous amendments have been filed, the most recent amendment 
will be classified by reference to how the information in question stood 
as of the latest Public Notice issued which concerned the application. 
An amendment will be deemed to be a major amendment subject to 
Sec. 21.27 and Sec. 21.31 under any of the following circumstances:
    (1) If in the Multipoint Distribution Service, the amendment results 
in a substantial modification of the engineering proposal such as (but 
not necessarily limited to):
    (i) A change in, or addition of, a radio frequency channel;
    (ii) A change in polarization of the transmitted signal;
    (iii) A change in type of transmitter emission or an increase in 
emission bandwidth of more than ten (10) percent;
    (iv) A change in the geographic coordinates of a station's 
transmitting antenna of more than ten (10) seconds of latitude or 
longitude, or both;
    (v) Any change which increases the antenna height by 3.0 meters (10 
feet) or more;

[[Page 28]]

    (vi) Any technical change which would increase the effective 
radiated power in any direction by more than one and one-half (1.5) dB; 
or
    (vii) Any changes or combination of changes which would cause 
harmful electrical interference to an authorized facility or result in a 
mutually exclusive conflict with another pending application.
    (2)  [Reserved]
    (3) If the amendment would convert a proposal, such that it may have 
a significant impact upon the environment under Sec. 1.1307 of the 
Commission's rules, which would require the submission of an 
environmental assessment, see Sec. 1.1311 of this chapter, and 
Commission environmental review, see Secs. 1.1308 and 1.1312 of this 
chapter.
    (4) If the amendment results in a substantial and material 
alteration of the proposed service.
    (5) If the amendment specifies a substantial change in benefical 
ownership or control (de jure or de facto) of an applicant such that the 
change would require, in the case of an authorized station, the filing 
of a prior assignment or transfer of control application under section 
310(d) of the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 310(d)]. Such a 
change would not be considered major where the assignment or transfer of 
control is for legitimate business purposes other than the acquisition 
of applications.
    (6) If the amendment, or the cumulative effect of the amendment, is 
determined by the Commission otherwise to be substantial pursuant to 
section 309 of the Communications Act of 1934.
    (d) The applicant must serve copies of any amendments or other 
written communications upon the following parties:
    (1) Any applicant whose application appears on its face to be 
mutually exclusive with the application being amended, including those 
applicants originally served under Sec. 21.902;
    (2) Any applicant whose application has been found by the 
Commission, as published in a public notice, to be mutually exclusive 
with the application being amended; and
    (3) Any party who has filed a petition to deny the application or 
other formal objection, when that petition or formal objection has not 
been resolved by the Commission.
    (e) The Commission may waive the service requirements of paragraph 
(e) of this section and prescribe such alternative procedures as may be 
appropriate under the circumstances to protect petitioners' interests 
and to avoid undue delay in a proceeding, if an applicant submits a 
request for waiver which demonstrates that the service requirement is 
unreasonably burdensome. Requests for waiver shall be served on 
petitioners. Oppositions to the petition may be filed within five (5) 
days after the petition is filed and shall be served on the applicant. 
Replies to oppositions will not be entertained.
    (f) Any amendment to an application shall be signed and shall be 
submitted in the same manner, and with the same number of copies, as was 
the original application. Amendments may be made in letter form if they 
comply in all other respects with the requirements of this chapter.

facilities, request may be made for special temporary authority to 
install and/or operate new or modified equipment. Any such request may 
be submitted as an informal application in the manner set forth in 
Sec. 21.5 and must contain full particulars as to the proposed operation 
including all facts sufficient to justify the temporary authority sought 
and the public interest therein. No such request will be considered 
unless the request is received by the Commission at least 10 days prior 
to the date of proposed construction or operation or, where an extension 
is sought, expiration date of the existing temporary authorization.
    (b) Special temporary authorizations may be granted without regard 
to the

[[Page 29]]

the filing of an application for such regular operation;
    (3) The authorization is to permit interim operation to facilitate 
completion of authorized construction or to provide substantially the 
same service as previously authorized; or
    (4) The authorization is made upon a finding that there are 
extraordinary circumstances requiring operation in the public interest 
and that delay in the institution of such service would seriously 
prejudice the public interest.
    (c) Temporary authorization of operations not to exceed 180 days may 
be granted under the standards of section 309(f) of the Communications 
Act where extraordinary circumstances so require. Extensions of the 
temporary authorization for a period of 180 days each may also be 
granted, but the renewal applicant bears a heavy burden to show that 
extraordinary circumstances warrant such an extension.
    (d) In cases of emergency found by the Commission, involving danger 
to life or property or due to damage of equipment, or during a national 
emergency proclaimed by the President or declared by the Congress or 
during the continuance of any war in which the United States is engaged 
and when such action is necessary for the national defense or safety or 
otherwise in furtherance of the war effort, or in cases of emergency 
where the Commission finds that it would not be feasible to secure 
renewal applications from existing licensees or otherwise to follow 
normal licensing procedure, the Commission will grant construction 
permits and station licenses, or modifications or renewals thereof, 
during the emergency found by the Commission or during the continuance 
of any such national emergency or war, as special temporary licenses, 
only for the period of emergency or war requiring such action, without 
the filing of formal applications.

                       Processing of Applications


<R05>
Sec. 21.26  Receipt of applications.

    Applications received by the Commission are given a file number for 
administrative convenience, which does not indicate the acceptance of 
the application for filing and processing. After preliminary review 
those applications covered by Sec. 21.27(a) that appear complete will be 
put on public notice as accepted for filing. Neither the assignment of a 
file number nor the listing of the application on public notice as 
accepted for filing indicates that the application has been found 
acceptable for filing or precludes the subsequent return or dismissal of 
the application if it is found to be defective or not in substantial 
compliance with the Commission's rules.

[52 FR 37779, Oct. 9, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 21.27  Public notice period.

    (a) At regular intervals, the Commission will issue a public notice 
listing:
    (1) The acceptance for filing of applications and major amendments 
thereto;
    (2) Significant Commission actions concerning applications;
    (3) The filing of certifications of completion of construction;
    (4) The receipt of applications for minor modifications made 
pursuant to Sec. 21.41;
    (5) Information which the Commission in its discretion believes of 
public significance; and
    (6) Special environmental considerations as required by Part 1 of 
this chapter.
    (7) The BTAs designated for licensing through the competitive 
bidding process and the filing date for short-form applications for 
those areas;
    (8) The auction winners in the competitive bidding process;
    (b) A public notice will not normally be issued for any of the 
following applications:

[[Page 30]]

    (1) For authorization of a minor technical change in the facilities 
of a proposed or authorized station where such a change would not be 
classified as a major amendment to a pending application, as defined by 
Sec. 21.23, or as a minor modification to a license pursuant to 
Sec. 21.41;
    (2) For temporary authorization pursuant to Sec. 21.25;
    (3) For an authorization under any of the proviso clauses of section 
308(a) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 308(a));
    (4) For consent to an involuntary assignment or transfer of control 
of a radio authorization; or
    (5) For consent to a voluntary assignment or transfer of control of 
a radio authorization, where the assignment or transfer does not involve 
a substantial change in ownership or control.
    (c) Except as otherwise provided in this Part (e.g., Sec. 21.41), no 
application that has appeared on public notice will be granted until the 
expiration of a period of thirty days following the issuance of the 
public notice listing the application, or any major amendment thereto, 
or until the expiration of a period of thirty days following the 
issuance of a public notice identifying the tentative selectee of a 
random selection process, whichever is later.

<R05>
Sec. 21.28  Dismissal and return of applications.

    (a) Except as provided under paragraph (c) of this section and under 
Sec. 21.29, any application may be dismissed without prejudice as a 
matter of right if the applicant requests its dismissal prior to 
designation for hearing or prior to selection of the comparative 
evaluation procedure of Sec. 21.35. An applicant's request for return of 
its application after it has been accepted for filing will be considered 
to be a request for dismissal without prejudice. Requests for dismissal 
shall comply with the provisions of Sec. 21.29 as appropriate.
    (b) A request to dismiss an application without prejudice will be 
considered after designation for hearing, after selection of the 
comparative evaluation procedure of Sec. 21.35, or after selection as a 
tentative selectee in a random selection proceeding, only if:
    (1) A written petition is submitted to the Commission and, in the 
case of applications designated for hearing or comparative evaluation, 
is properly served upon all parties of record;
    (2) The petition is submitted before the issuance date of a public 
notice of Commission action denying the application; and
    (3) The petition complies with the provisions of Sec. 21.29 
(whenever applicable) and demonstrates good cause.
    (c) Except as provided under Sec. 21.29, an application designated 
for inclusion in the random selection process may be dismissed without 
prejudice as a matter of right if the applicant requests its dismissal 
at least 2 days prior to a random selection proceeding. An applicant's 
request for return of its application after it has been accepted for 
filing will be considered to be a request for dismissal without 
prejudice. Requests for dismissal shall comply with the provisions of 
Sec. 21.29 as appropriate.
    (d) The Commission will dismiss an application for failure to 
prosecute or for failure to respond substantially within a specified 
time period to official correspondence or requests for additional 
information. Dismissal will be without prejudice prior to designation 
for hearing, selection of the comparative evaluation procedure of 
Sec. 21.35, or tentative selection by the random selection process, but 
may be with prejudice for unsatisfactory compliance with Sec. 21.29, or 
after designation for hearing, selection of the comparative evaluation 
process, or selection as a tentative selectee in a random selection 
proceeding.
    (e) The Commission will dismiss an application filed by a cable 
television company which fails to comply with the provisions of 
Sec. 21.912 of this part.
    (f) A Multipoint Distribution Service application will be dismissed 
if the applicant seeks to change ownership or control, except in the 
case of a pro forma change of ownership or control (bankruptcy, death, 
or legal disability).

<R05>
Sec. 21.29  Ownership changes and agreements to amend or to dismiss applications or pleadings.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, applicants 
or any other parties in interest to pending applications shall comply 
with the provisions of this section whenever:
    (1) They participate in any agreement (or understanding) which 
involves any consideration promised or received, directly or indirectly, 
including any agreement (or understanding) for merger of interests or 
the reciprocal withdrawal of applications; and
    (2) The agreement (or understanding) may result in either:
    (i) A proposed substantial change in beneficial ownership or control 
(de jure or de facto) of an applicant such that the change would 
require, in the case of an authorized station, the filing of a prior 
assignment or transfer of control application under section 310(d) of 
the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 310(d)], or
    (ii) Proposed withdrawal, amendment or dismissal of any 
application(s), amendment(s), petition(s), pleading(s), or any 
combination thereof, which would thereby permit the grant without 
hearing, comparative evaluation under of Sec. 21.35, or random selection 
of an application previously in contested status.
    (b) The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to any 
engineering agreement (or understanding) which:
    (1) Resolves frequency conflicts with authorized stations or other 
pending applications without the creation of new or increased frequency 
conflicts; and
    (2) Does not involve any consideration promised or received, 
directly or indirectly (including any merger of interests or reciprocal 
withdrawal of applications), other than the mutual benefit of resolving 
the engineering conflict.
    (c) For any agreement subject to this section, the applicant of an 
application which would remain pending pursuant to such an agreement 
will be considered responsible for the compliance by all parties with 
the procedures of this section. Failure of the parties to comply with 
the procedures of this section shall constitute a defect in those 
applications which are involved in the agreement and remain in a pending 
status.
    (d) The principals to any agreement or understanding subject to this 
section shall comply with the standards of paragraph (e) of this section 
in accordance with the following procedure:
    (1) Within ten (10) days after entering into the agreement, the 
parties thereto shall jointly notify the Commission in writing of the 
existence and general terms of such agreement, the identity of all of 
the participants and the applications involved;
    (2) Within thirty (30) days after entering into the agreement, the 
parties thereto shall file any proposed application amendments, motions, 
or requests together with a copy of the agreement which clearly sets 
forth all terms and provisions, and such other facts and information as 
necessary to satisfy the standards of paragraph (e) of this section. 
Such submission shall be accompanied by the certification by affidavit 
of each principal to the agreement declaring that the statements made 
are true, complete, and correct to the best of their knowledge and 
belief, and are made in good faith.
    (3) The Commission may request any further information which in its 
judgment it believes is necessary for a determination under paragraph 
(e) of this section.
    (e) The Commission will grant an application (or applications) 
involved in the agreement (or understanding) only if it finds upon 
examination of the information submitted, and upon consideration of such 
other matters as may be officially noticed, that the agreement is 
consistent with the public interest, and the amount of any monetary 
consideration and the cash value of any other consideration promised or 
received is not in excess of those legitimate and prudent costs directly 
assignable to the engineering, preparation, filing and advocacy of the 
withdrawn, dismissed, or amended application(s), amendment(s), 
petition(s), pleading(s), or any combination thereof. Where such costs 
represent the applicant's in-house efforts, these costs shall include 
only directly assignable costs and shall exclude general overhead 
expenses.

[[Page 32]]

[The treatment to be accorded such consideration for interstate rate 
making purposes will be determined at such time as the question may 
arise in an appropriate rate proceeding.] An itemized accounting shall 
be submitted to support the amount of consideration involved except 
where such consideration (including the fair market value of any non-
cash consideration) promised or received does not exceed one thousand 
dollars ($1,000.00). Where consideration involves a sale of facilities 
or merger of interests, the accounting shall clearly identify that 
portion of the consideration allocated for such facilities or interests 
and a detailed description thereof, including estimated fair market 
value. The Commission will not presume an agreement (or understanding) 
to be prima facie contrary to the public interest solely because it 
incorporates a mutual agreement to withdraw pending application(s), 
amendment(s), petition(s), pleading(s), or any combination thereof.
    (f) Notwithstanding Sec. 21.29(e), amendments will not be granted 
that seek more than a pro forma change of ownership or control 
(bankruptcy, death, or legal disability) of a pending Multipoint 
Distribution Service application, and any Multipoint Distribution 
Service application will be dismissed that seeks more than a pro forma 
change of ownership or control.

Sec. 21.30  Opposition to applications.

    (a) Petitions to deny (including petitions for other forms of 
relief) and responsive pleadings for Commission consideration must:
    (1) Identify the application or applications (including applicant's 
name, station location, Commission file numbers and radio service 
involved) with which it is concerned;
    (2) Be filed in accordance with the pleading limitations, filing 
periods, and other applicable provisions of Secs. 1.41 through 1.52, and 
1.821 through 1.825;
    (3) Contain specific allegations of fact (except for those of which 
official notice may be taken), which shall be supported by affidavit of 
a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof, and which shall be 
sufficient to demonstrate that the petitioner (or respondent) is a party 
in interest and that a grant of, or other Commission action regarding, 
the application would be prima facie inconsistent with the public 
interest;
    (4) Except as provided in Sec. 21.901(d)(1) of this part regarding 
Instructional Television Fixed Service licensees, be filed within thirty 
(30) days after the date of public notice announcing the acceptance for 
filing of any such application or major amendment thereto, or 
identifying the tentative selectee of a random selection proceeding in 
the Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service or for Multipoint 
Distribution Service H--channel stations (unless the Commission 
otherwise extends the deadline); and
    (5) Contains a certificate of service showing that it has been 
mailed to the applicant no later than the date of filing thereof with 
the Commission.
    (b) The Commission will classify as informal objections:
    (1) Any petition to deny not filed in accordance with paragraph (a) 
of this section;
    (2) Any petition to deny (or for other forms of relief) an 
application to which the thirty (30) day public notice period of 
Sec. 21.27(c) does not apply; or
    (3) Any comments on, or objections to, the grant of an application 
when the comments or objections do not conform to either paragraph (a) 
of this section or other Commission rules and requirements.
    (c) The Commission will consider informal objections, but will not 
necessarily discuss them specifically in a formal opinion if:
    (1) The informal objection is filed at least one day before 
Commission action on the application; and
    (2) The informal objection is signed by the submitting person (or 
his representative) and discloses his interest.

[[Page 33]]


<R05>
Sec. 21.31  Mutually exclusive applications.

    (a) The Commission will consider applications to be mutually 
exclusive if their conflicts are such that the grant of one application 
would effectively preclude by reason of harmful electrical interference, 
or other practical reason, the grant of one or more of the other 
applications. The Commission will presume ``harmful electrical 
interference'' to mean interference which would result in a material 
impairment to service rendered to the public despite full cooperation in 
good faith by all applicants or parties to achieve reasonable technical 
adjustments which would avoid electrical conflict.
    (b) An application will be entitled to be included in a random 
selection process or to comparative consideration with one or more 
conflicting applications only if:
    (1) The application is mutually exclusive with the other 
application; and
    (2) The application is received by the Commission in a condition 
acceptable for filing by whichever ``cut-off'' date is earlier:
    (i) Sixty (60) days after the date of the public notice listing the 
first of the conflicting applications as accepted for filing; or
    (ii) One (1) business day preceding the day on which the Commission 
takes final action on the previously filed application (should the 
Commission act upon such application in the interval between thirty (30) 
and sixty (60) days after the date of its public notice).
    (c) Whenever three or more applications are mutually exclusive, but 
not uniformly so, the earliest filed application established the date 
prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, regardless of whether or 
not subsequently filed applications are directly mutually exclusive with 
the first filed application. [For example, applications A, B, and C are 
filed in that order. A and B are directly mutually exclusive, B and C 
are directly mutually exclusive. In order to be considered comparatively 
with B, C must be filed within the ``cut-off'' period established by A 
even though C is not directly mutually exclusive with A.]
    (d) An application otherwise mutually exclusive with one of more 
previously filed applications, but filed after the appropriate date 
prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, will be returned without 
prejudice and will be eligible for refiling only after final action is 
taken by the Commission with respect to the previously filed application 
(or applications).
    (e) For the purposes of this section, any application (whether 
mutually exclusive or not) will be considered to be a newly filed 
application if it is amended by a major amendment (as defined by 
Sec. 21.23), except under any of the following circumstances:
    (1) The application has been designated for comparative hearing, or 
for comparative evaluation (pursuant to Sec. 21.35), and the Commission 
or the presiding officer accepts the amendment pursuant to 
Sec. 21.23(b);
    (2) The amendment resolves frequency conflicts with authorized 
stations or other pending applications which would otherwise require 
resolution by hearing, by comparative evaluation pursuant to Sec. 21.35, 
or by random selection pursuant to Sec. 21.33 provided that the 
amendment does not create new or additional frequency conflicts;
    (3) The amendment reflects only a change in ownership or control 
found by the Commission to be in the public interest, and for which a 
requested exemption from the ``cut-off'' requirements of this section is 
granted, unless the amendment is for more than a pro forma change of 
ownership or control (bankruptcy, death or legal disability) of a 
pending Multipoint Distribution Service application in which event the 
application will be dismissed;
    (4) The amendment reflects only a change in ownership or control 
which results from an agreement under Sec. 21.29 whereby two or more 
applicants entitled to comparative consideration of their applications 
join in one (or more) of the existing applications and request dismissal 
of their other application (or applications) to avoid the delay and cost 
of comparative consideration, unless the amendment is for one (or more) 
pending Multipoint Distribution Service application (or applications) in 
which event the application (or applications) will be dismissed;
    (5) The amendment corrects typographical, transcription, or similar

[[Page 34]]

clerical errors which are clearly demonstrated to be mistakes by 
reference to other parts of the application, and whose discovery does 
not create new or increased frequency conflicts; or
    (6) The amendment does not create new or increased frequency 
conflicts, and is demonstrably necessitated by events which the 
applicant could not have reasonably foreseen at the time of filing, such 
as, for example:
    (i) The loss of a transmitter or receiver site by condemnation, 
natural causes, or loss of lease or option;
    (ii) Obstruction of a proposed transmission path caused by the 
erection of a new building or other structure; or
    (iii) The discontinuance or substantial technological obsolescence 
of specified equipment, whenever the application has been pending before 
the Commission for two or more years from the date of its filing.
    (iv) The change of status by a MDS applicant from common carrier to 
non-common carrier, or from non-common carrier to common carrier.

Sec. 21.32  Consideration of applications.

    (a) Applications for an instrument of authorization will be granted 
if, upon examination of the application and upon consideration of such 
other matters as it may officially notice, the Commission finds that the 
grant will serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity.
    (b) The grant shall be without a formal hearing if, upon 
consideration of the application, any pleadings of objections filed, or 
other matters which may be officially noticed, the Commission finds 
that:
    (1) The application is acceptable for filing, and is in accordance 
with the Commission's rules, regulations, and other requirements;
    (2) The application is not subject to comparative consideration 
(pursuant to Sec. 21.31) with another application (or applications), 
except where the competing applicants have chosen the comparative 
evaluation procedure of Sec. 21.35 and a grant is appropriate under that 
procedure;
    (3) A grant of the application would not cause harmful electrical 
interference to an authorized station;
    (4) There are no substantial and material questions of fact 
presented; and
    (5) The applicant is legally, technically, financially and otherwise 
qualified, and a grant of the application would serve the public 
interest.
    (c) If the Commission should grant without a formal hearing an 
application for an instrument of authorization which is subject to a 
petition to deny filed in accordance with Sec. 21.30, the Commission 
will deny the petition by the issuance of a Memorandum Opinion and Order 
which will concisely report the reasons for the denial and dispose of 
all substantial issues raised by the petition.
    (d) Whenever the Commission, without a formal hearing, grants any 
application in part, or subject to any terms or conditions other than 
those normally applied to applications of the same type, it shall inform 
the applicant of the reasons therefor, and the grant shall be considered 
final unless the Commission should revise its action (either by granting 
the application as originally requested, or by designating the 
application for a formal evidentiary hearing) in response to a petition 
for reconsideration which:
    (1) Is filed by the applicant within thirty (30) days from the date 
of the letter or order giving the reasons for the partial or conditioned 
grant;
    (2) Rejects the grant as made and explains the reasons why the 
application should be granted as originally requested; and
    (3) Returns the instrument of authorization.
    (e) The Commission will designate an application for a formal 
hearing, specifying with particularity the matters and things in issue, 
if, upon consideration of the application, any pleadings or objections 
filed, or other matters which may be officially noticed, the Commission 
determines that:
    (1) A substantial and material question of fact is presented;
    (2) The Commission is unable for any reason to make the findings 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section and the

[[Page 35]]

application is acceptable for filing, complete, and in accordance with 
the Commission's rules, regulations, and other requirements.
    (3) The application is entitled to comparative consideration (under 
Sec. 21.31) with another application (or applications); or
    (4) The application is entitled to comparative consideration 
(pursuant to Sec. 21.31) and the applicants have chosen the comparative 
evaluation procedure of Sec. 21.35 but the Commission deems such 
procedure to be inappropriate.
    (f) The Commission may grant, deny, or take other action with 
respect to an application designated for a formal hearing pursuant to 
paragraph (e) of this section or Part 1 of this chapter.
    (g) Whenever the public interest would be served thereby the 
Commission may grant one or more mutually exclusive applications 
expressly conditioned upon final action on the applications, and then 
either conduct a random section process (in specified services under 
this rules part), designate all of the mutually exclusive applications 
for a formal evidentiary hearing or (whenever so requested) follow the 
comparative evaluation procedures of Sec. 21.35, as appropriate, if it 
appears:
    (1) That some or all of the applications were not filed in good 
faith, but were filed for the purpose of delaying or hindering the grant 
of another application;
    (2) That the public interest requires the prompt establishment of 
radio service in a particular community or area;
    (3) That a delay in making a grant to any applicant until after the 
conclusion of a hearing or a random selection proceeding on all 
applications might jeopardize the rights of the United States under the 
provision of an international agreement to the use of the frequency in 
question; or
    (4) That a grant of one application would be in the public interest 
in that it appears from an examination of the remaining applications 
that they cannot be granted because they are in violation of provisions 
of the Communications Act, other statutes, or of the provisions of this 
chapter.
    (h) Reconsideration or review of any final action taken by the 
Commission will be in accordance with Subpart A of Part 1 of this 
chapter.

Sec. 21.33  Grants by random selection.

    (a) If an application for an authorization for a Multichannel 
Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS) station or for a Multipoint 
Distribution Service (MDS) H-channel station is mutually exclusive with 
another such application, and satisfies the requirements of Secs. 21.31 
and 21.914, the applicant may be included in the random selection 
process set forth in Secs. 1.821, 1.822 and 1.824 of this chapter.
    (b) Renewal applications shall not be included in a random selection 
process.
    (c) If Multipoint Distribution Service applicants enter into 
settlements, the applicants in the settlement must be represented by one 
application only and will not receive the cumulative number of chances 
in the random selection process that the individual applicants would 
have had if no settlement had been reached.

<R05>
Sec. 21.35  Comparative evaluation of mutually exclusive applications.

    (a) In order to expedite action on mutually exclusive applications 
in services under this rules part where the competitive bidding process 
or random selection process do not apply, the applicants may request the 
Commission to consider their applications without a formal hearing in 
accordance with the summary procedure outlined in paragraph (b) in this 
section if:
    (1) The applications are entitled to comparative consideration 
pursuant to Sec. 21.31;
    (2) The applications have not been designated for formal evidentiary 
hearing; and
    (3) The Commission determines, initially or at any time during the 
procedure outlined in paragraph (b) of this section, that such procedure 
is appropriate, and that, from the information submitted and 
consideration of such

[[Page 36]]

other matters as may be officially noticed, there are no substantial and 
material questions of fact presented (other than those relating to the 
comparative merits of the applications) which would preclude a grant 
under paragraphs (a) and (b) of Sec. 21.32.
    (b) Provided that the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section 
are satisfied, applicants may request the Commission to act upon their 
mutually exclusive applications without a formal hearing pursuant to the 
summary procedure outlined below:
    (1) To initiate the procedure, each applicant will submit to the 
Commission a written statement containing:
    (i) A waiver of the applicant's right to a formal hearing;
    (ii) A request and agreement that, in order to avoid the delay and 
expense of a comparative formal hearing, the Commission should exercise 
its judgment to select from among the mutually exclusive applications 
that proposal (or proposals) which would best serve the public interest; 
and
    (iii) The signature of a principal (and the principal's attorney if 
represented).
    (2) After receipt of the written requests of all of the applicants 
the Commission (if it deems this procedure appropriate) will issue a 
notice designating the comparative criteria upon which the applications 
are to be evaluated and will request each applicant to submit, within a 
specified period of time, additional information concerning the 
applicant's proposal relative to the comparative criteria.
    (3) Within thirty (30) days following the due date for filing this 
information, the Commission will accept concise and factual argument on 
the competing proposals from the rival applicants, potential customers, 
and other knowledgeable parties in interest.

Secs. 21.36--21.37  [Reserved]

      License Transfers, Modifications, Conditions and Forfeitures


<R05>
Sec. 21.38  Assignment or transfer of station authorization.

    (a) No station license, or any rights thereunder, shall be 
transferred, assigned, or disposed of in any manner, voluntarily or 
involuntarily, directly or indirectly, or by transfer of control of any 
corporation or any other entity holding any such license, to any person 
except upon application to the Commission and upon finding by the 
Commission that the public interest, convenience and necessity will be 
served thereby.
    (b) For purposes of this section, transfers of control requiring 
Commission approval shall include any and all transactions that:
    (1) Change the party controlling the affairs of the licensee, or
    (2) Affect any change in a controlling interest in the ownership of 
the licensee, including changes in legal or equitable ownership, or
    (c) Requests for transfer of control or assignment authority shall 
be submitted on the application form prescribed by Sec. 21.11 of this 
chapter, and shall be accompanied by the applicable showings required by 
Secs. 21.13, 21.15, 21.17 and 21.39 of this chapter.
    (d) The Commission shall be promptly notified in writing when a 
licensee is voluntarily or involuntarily placed in bankruptcy or 
receivership and when an individual licensee, a member of a partnership 
which is a licensee, or a person directly or indirectly in control

[[Page 37]]

of a corporation which is a licensee, dies or becomes legally disabled. 
Within thirty days after the occurrence of such bankruptcy, 
receivership, death or legal disability, an application of involuntary 
assignment of such license, or involuntary transfer of control of such 
corporation, shall be filed with the Commission, requesting assignment 
or transfer to a successor legally qualified under the laws of the place 
having jurisdiction over the assets involved.
    (e) The assignor of a station licensed under this part may retain no 
right of reversion or reassignment of the license and may not reserve 
the right to use the facilities of the station for any period 
whatsoever. No assignment of license will be granted or authorized if 
there is a contract or understanding, express or implied, pursuant to 
which a right of reversion or reassignment of the license or right to 
use the facilities are retained as partial or full consideration for the 
assignment or transfer.
    (f) No special temporary authority, or any rights thereunder, shall 
be assigned or otherwise disposed of, directly or indirectly, 
voluntarily or involuntarily, without prior Commission approval.
    (g) An applicant for voluntary transfer of control or assignment 
under this section where the subject license was acquired by the 
transferor or assignor through a system of random selection shall, 
together with its application for transfer of control or assignment, 
file with the Commission the associated contracts for sale, option 
agreements, management agreements, or other documents disclosing the 
total consideration that the applicant would receive in return for the 
transfer or assignment of its license. This information should include 
not only a monetary purchase price, but also any future, contingent, in-
kind, or other consideration (e.g., management or consulting contracts 
either with or without an option to purchase; below-market financing).

<R05>
Sec. 21.39  Considerations involving transfer or assignment applications.

    (a) A Multipoint Distribution Service conditional license may not be 
assigned or transferred prior to the completion of construction of the 
facility and the timely filing of the certification of completion of 
construction. However, consent to the assignment or transfer of control 
of a Multipoint Distribution Service conditional license may be given 
prior to the completion of construction and the timely filing of the 
certification of completion of construction where:
    (1) The assignment or transfer does not involve a substantial change 
in ownership or control of the authorized Multipoint Distribution 
Service facilities; or
    (2) The assignment or transfer of control is involuntary due to the 
licensee's bankruptcy, death, or legal disability.
    (b) The Commission will review a proposed transaction to determine 
if the circumstances indicate ``trafficking'' in licenses whenever 
applications (except those involving pro forma assignment or transfer of 
control) for consent to assignment of a license, or for transfer of 
control of a licensee, involve facilities that were:
    (1) Authorized following a comparative hearing and have been 
operated less than one year, or;
    (2) Involve facilities that have not been constructed, or;
    (3) Involve facilities that were authorized following a random 
selection proceeding in which the successful applicant received 
preference and that have been operated for less than one year.

At its discretion, the Commission may require the submission of an 
affirmative, factual showing (supported by affidavits of a person or 
persons with personal knowledge thereof) to demonstrate that the 
proposed assignor or transferor has not acquired an authorization or 
operated a station for the principal purpose of profitable sale rather 
than public service. This showing may include, for example, a 
demonstration that the proposed assignment or transfer is due to changed 
circumstances (described in detail) affecting the licensee subsequent to 
the acquisition of the license, or that the

[[Page 38]]

proposed transfer of radio facilities is incidental to a sale of other 
facilities or merger of interests.
    (c) If a proposed transfer of radio facilities is incidental to a 
sale of other facilities or merger of interests, any showing requested 
under paragraph (a) of this section shall include an additional exhibit 
which:
    (1) Discloses complete details as to the sale of facilities or 
merger of interests;
    (2) Segregates clearly by an itemized accounting, the amount of 
consideration involved in the sale of facilities or merger of interests; 
and
    (3) Demonstrates that the amount of consideration assignable to the 
facilities or business interests involved represents their fair market 
value at the time of the transaction.
    (d) For the purposes of this section, the one year period is 
calculated using the following dates (as appropriate):
    (1) The initial date of grant of the license, excluding subsequent 
modifications;
    (2) The date of consummation of an assignment or transfer, if the 
station is acquired as the result of an assignment of license, or 
transfer of control of corporate licensee; or
    (3) The median date of the applicable commencement dates (determined 
pursuant to paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section) if the 
transaction involves two or more stations. (The median date is that date 
so selected such that fifty percent of the commencement dates of the 
total number of stations, when arranged in chronological order, lie 
below it and fifty percent lie above it. When the number of stations is 
an even number, the median date will be a value half way between the two 
dates closest to the theoretical median).

Sec. 21.40  Modification of station license.

    (a) Except as provided in Secs. 21.41 and 21.42, no modification of 
a license issued pursuant to this part (or the facilities described 
thereunder) shall be made except upon application to the Commission and 
upon finding by the Commission that:
    (1) Such modification will promote the public interest, convenience 
and necessity, or
    (2) That the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 or of any 
treaty ratified by the United States will be more fully complied with if 
such application is granted.
    (b) No application for modification to extend a license construction 
period will be granted for delays caused by lack of financing or for 
lack of site availability. Applications for time extensions for other 
reasons must include a verified statement from the application showing 
that the licensee has made diligent efforts to construct the facilities 
and:
    (1) That additional time is required due to circumstances beyond the 
applicant's control, in which case the applicant must describe such 
circumstances and must set forth with specificity and justify the 
precise extension period requested; or
    (2) That there are unique and overriding public interest concerns 
that justify such an extension, in which case the applicant must 
identify such interests and must set forth and justify a precise 
extension period.
    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b), when a station 
license has been assigned or transferred pursuant to Sec. 21.38, any 
extension of time will be limited so that the time left to construct 
after Commission grant of the transfer or assignment will be no more 
than the time remaining for construction at the date of the filing of 
the application for transfer or assignment.

Sec. 21.50  Transition of the 2.11-2.13 and 2.16-2.18 GHz bands from Domestic Public Fixed Radio Services to emerging technologies.

    (a) Licensees proposing to implement services using emerging 
technologies

[[Page 42]]

(ET Licensees) may negotiate with Domestic Public Fixed Radio Service 
licensees (Existing Licensees) in these bands for the purpose of 
agreeing to terms under which the Existing Licensees would relocate 
their operations to other fixed microwave bands or to other media, or 
alternatively, would accept a sharing arrangement with the ET Licensee 
that may result in an otherwise impermissible level of interference to 
the existing licensee's operations. ET Licensees may also negotiate 
agreements for relocation of the Existing Licensees' facilities within 
the 2 GHz band in which all interested parties agree to the relocation 
of the Existing Licensee's facilities elsewhere within these bands. 
``All interested parties'' includes the incumbent licensee, the emerging 
technology provider or representative requesting and paying for the 
relocation, and any emerging technology licensee of the spectrum to 
which the incumbent's facilities are to be relocated.
    (b) Domestic Public Fixed Radio licensees in bands allocated for 
licensed emerging technology services will maintain primary status in 
these bands until two years after the Commission commences acceptance of 
applications for an emerging technology services, and until one year 
after an emerging technology service licensee initiates negotiations for 
relocation of the fixed microwave licensee's operations or, in bands 
allocated for unlicensed emerging technology services, until one year 
after an emerging technology unlicensed equipment supplier or 
representative initiates negotiations for relocation of the fixed 
microwave licensee's operations. When it is necessary for an emerging 
technology provider or representative of unlicensed device manufacturers 
to negotiate with a fixed microwave licensee with operations in spectrum 
adjacent to that of the emerging technology provider, the transition 
schedule of the entity requesting the move will apply.
    (c) The Commission will amend the operating license of the fixed 
microwave operator to secondary status only if the following 
requirements are met:
    (1) The service applicant, provider, licensee, or representative 
using an emerging technology guarantees payment of all relocation costs, 
including all engineering, equipment, site and FCC fees, as well as any 
reasonable, additional costs that the relocated fixed microwave licensee 
might incur as a result of operation in another fixed microwave band or 
migration to another medium;
    (2) The emerging technology service entity completes all activities 
necessary for implementing the replacement facilities, including 
engineering and cost analysis of the relocation procedure and, if radio 
facilities are used, identifying and obtaining, on the incumbents' 
behalf, new microwave frequencies and frequency coordination; and
    (3) The emerging technology service entity builds the replacement 
system and tests it for comparability with the existing 2 GHz system.
    (d) The 2 GHz microwave licensee is not required to relocate until 
the alternative facilities are available to it for a reasonable time to 
make adjustments, determine comparability, and ensure a seamless 
handoff.
    (e) If within one year after the relocation to new facilities the 2 
GHz microwave licensee demonstrates that the new facilities are not 
comparable to the former facilities, the emerging technology service 
entity must remedy the defects or pay to relocate the microwave licensee 
back to its former or equivalent 2 GHz frequencies.

service area. All applicants for, and licensees of, stations in this 
service shall cooperate in the selection and use of the frequencies 
assigned in order to minimize interference and thereby obtain

[[Page 43]]

the most effective use of the authorized facilities. In the event 
harmful interference occurs or appears likely to occur between two or 
more radio systems and such interference cannot be resolved between the 
licensees thereof, the Commission may, after notice and opportunity for 
hearing, require the licensees to make such changes in operating 
techniques or equipment as it may deem necessary to avoid such 
interference.

Sec. 21.113  Quiet zones.

    Quiet zones are those areas where it is necessary to restrict 
radiation so as to minimize possible impact on the operations of radio 
astronomy or other facilities that are highly sensitive to radio 
frequency interference. The areas involved and procedures required are 
as follows:
    (a) In order to minimize possible harmful interference at the 
National Radio Astronomy Observatory site located at Green Bank, 
Pocahontas County, West Virginia, and at the Naval Radio Research 
Observatory site at Sugar Grove, Pendleton County, West Virginia, any 
applicant for a station authorization other than mobile, temporary base, 
or temporary fixed seeking authorization for a new station or to modify 
an existing station in a manner which would change either the frequency, 
power, antenna height or directivity, or location of such a station 
within the area bounded by 39 deg.15' N. on the north, 78 deg.30' W. on 
the east, 37 deg.30' N. on the south, and 80 deg.30' W. on the west 
shall, at the time of filing such application with the Commission, 
simultaneously notify the Director, National Radio Astronomy 
Observatory, Post Office Box No. 2, Green Bank, West Virginia 24944, in 
writing, of the technical particulars of the proposed operation. Such 
notification shall include the geographical coordinates of the antenna, 
antenna height, antenna directivity (if any), proposed frequency, type 
of emission, and power. In addition, the applicant shall indicate in his 
application to the Commission the date notification was made to the 
Observatory. After receipt of such applications, the Commission will 
allow a period of twenty (20) days for comments or objections in 
response to the notifications indicated. If an objection to the proposed 
operation is received during the 20-day period from the National Radio 
Astronomy Observatory for itself or on behalf of the Naval Radio 
Research Observatory, the Commission will consider all aspects of the 
problem and take whatever action is deemed appropriate.
    (b) In order to minimize possible harmful interference at the Table 
Mountain Radio Receiving Zone of the Research Laboratories of the 
Department of Commerce located in Boulder County, Colorado, applicants 
for new or modified radio facilities in the vicinity of Boulder County, 
Colorado are advised to give due consideration prior to filing 
applications, to the need to protect the Table Mountain Radio Receiving 
Zone from harmful interference. To prevent degradation of this present 
ambient radio signal level at the site, the Department of Commerce seeks 
to ensure that the field strengths of any radiated signals (excluding 
reflected signals received on this 728.4 hectare (1800 acre) site (in 
the vicinity of coordinates 40 deg. 07' 50'' N Latitude, 105 deg. 15' 
40'' W Longitude) resulting from new assignments (other than mobile 
stations) or from the modification or relocation of existing facilities 
do not exceed the following values:

\2\ Space stations shall conform to the power flux density limits at the
  earth's surface specified in appropriate parts of the FCC rules, but  
  in no case should exceed the above levels in any 4 kHz band for all   
  angles of arrival.                                                    

    (1) Advance consultation is recommended particularly for those 
applicants who have no reliable data which indicates whether the field 
strength or power flux density figures in the above table would be 
exceeded by their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In 
such instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining 
whether coordination is recommended:
    (i) All stations within 2.4. kilometers (1.5 miles);
    (ii) Stations within 4.8 kilometers (3 miles) with 50 watts or more 
average effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of 
polarization in the azimuthal direction of the Table Mountain Radio 
Receiving Zone;
    (iii) Stations within 16.1 kilometers (10 miles) with 1 kW or more 
average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of Table Mountain Receiving Zone;
    (iv) Stations within 80.5 kilometers (50 miles) with 25 kW or more 
average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of Table Mountain Receiving Zone.
    (2) Applicants concerned are urged to communicate with the Radio 
Frequency Management Coordinator, Department of Commerce, Research 
Support Services, NOAA R/E5X2, Boulder Laboratories, Boulder, CO 80303; 
telephone (303) 497-6548, in advance of filling their applications with 
the Commission.
    (3) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised 
that such consultation can avoid objections from the Department of 
Commerce or proceedings to modify any authorization which may be granted 
which, in fact, delivers a signal at the site in excess of the field 
strength specified herein.
    (c) Protection for Federal Communications Commission monitoring 
stations:
    (1) Applicants in the vicinity of an FCC monitoring station for a 
radio station authorization to operate new transmitting facilities or 
changed transmitting facilities which would increase the field strength 
produced over the monitoring station over that previously authorized are 
advised to give consideration, prior to filing applications, to the 
possible need to protect the FCC stations from harmful interference. 
Geographical coordinates of the facilities which require protection are 
listed in Sec. 0.121(c) of the Commission's Rules. Applications for 
stations (except mobile stations) which will produce on any frequency a 
direct wave fundamental field strength of greater than 10 mV/m in the 
authorized bandwidth of service (-65.8 dBW/m<SUP>2 power flux density 
assuming a free space characteristic impedance of 120 ohms) at the 
referenced coordinates, may be examined to determine extent of possible 
interference. Depending on the theoretical field strength value and 
existing root-sum-square or other ambient radio field signal levels at 
the indicated coordinates, a clause protecting the monitoring station 
may be added to the station authorization.
    (2) In the event that calculated value of expected field exceeds 10 
mV/m (-65.8 dBW/m<SUP>2) at the reference coordinates, or if there is 
any question whether field strength levels might exceed the threshold 
value, advance consultation with the FCC to discuss any protection 
necessary should be considered. Prospective applicants may communicate 
with: Chief, Compliance and Information Bureau, Federal Communications 
Commission, Washington, DC 20554, Telephone (202) 632-6980.
    (3) Advance consultation is suggested particularly for those 
applicants who have no reliable data which indicates whether the field 
strength or power flux density figure indicated would be

[[Page 47]]

exceeded by their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In 
such instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining 
whether an applicant should coordinate:
    (i) All stations within 2.4 kilometers (1.5 statute miles);
    (ii) Stations within 4.8 kilometers (3 statute miles) with 50 watts 
or more average effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of 
polarization in the azimuthal direction of the Monitoring Stations.
    (iii) Stations within 16.1 kilometers (10 miles) with 1 kW or more 
average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of the Monitoring Station.
    (iv) Stations within 80.5 kilometers (50 miles) with 25 kW or more 
average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of the Monitoring Station.
    (4) Advance coordination for stations operating above 1000 MHz is 
recommended only where the proposed station is in the vicinity of a 
monitoring station designated as a satellite monitoring facility in 
Sec. 0.121(c) of the Commission's Rules and also meets the criteria 
outlined in paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section.
    (5) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised 
that such consultation can avoid objections from the Federal 
Communications Commission or modification of any authorization which 
will cause harmful interference.

be obtained from State and municipal agencies. Data from Sectional 
Aeronautical Charts (including bench marks) or railroad depot elevations 
and highway elevations from road maps may be used where no better 
information is available. In cases where limited topographic data is 
available, use may be made of an altimeter in a car driven along roads 
extending generally radially from the transmitter site. If it appears 
necessary, additional data may be requested. United States Geological 
Survey Topographic Quadrangle Maps may be obtained from the Department 
of the Interior, Geological Survey, Washington, DC 20242. Sectional

Sec. 21.117  Transmitter location.

    (a) The applicant shall determine, prior to filing an application 
for a radio station authorization, that the antenna site specified 
therein is adequate to render the service proposed. In cases of 
questionable antenna locations, it is desirable to conduct propagation 
tests to indicate the field intensity which may be expected in the 
principal areas or at the fixed points of communication to be served, 
particularly where severe shadow problems may be expected. In 
considering applications proposing the use of such locations, the 
Commission may require site survey tests to be made pursuant to a 
developmental authorization in the particular service concerned. In such 
cases, propagation tests should be conducted in accordance with 
recognized engineering methods and should be made with a transmitting 
antenna simulating, as near as possible, the proposed antenna 
installation. Full data obtained from such surveys and its analysis, 
including a description of the methods used and the name, address and 
qualifications of the engineer making the survey, must be supplied to 
the Commission.

[[Page 48]]

    (b) The owner of the antenna structure should locate and construct 
such structure as to avoid making them hazardous to air navigation. (See 
part 17 of this chapter for provisions relating to antenna structures.) 
Such installation shall be maintained in good structural condition 
together with any required painting or lighting.

Sec. 21.118  Transmitter construction and installation.

    (a) The equipment at the operating and transmitting positions shall 
be so installed and protected that it is not accessible to, or capable 
of being operated by, persons other than those duly authorized by the 
licensee.
    (b) In any case where the maximum modulating frequency of a 
transmitter is prescribed by the Commission, the transmitter shall be 
equipped with a low-pass or band-pass modulation filter of suitable 
performance characteristics. In those cases where a modulation limiter 
is employed, the modulation filter shall be installed between the 
transmitter stage in which limiting is effected and the modulated stage 
of the transmitter.
    (c) Each transmitter employed in these services shall be equipped 
with an appropriately labeled pilot lamp or meter which will provide 
continuous visual indication at the transmitter when its control 
circuits have been placed in a condition to activate the transmitter. In 
addition, facilities shall be provided at each transmitter to permit the 
transmitter to be turned on and off independently of any remote control 
circuits associated therewith.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) At each transmitter control point the following facilities shall 
be installed:
    (1) A carrier operated device which will provide continuous visual 
indication when the transmitter is radiating, or, in lieu thereof, a 
pilot lamp or meter which will provide continuous visual indication when 
the transmitter control circuits have been placed in a condition to 
activate the transmitter.
    (2) Facilities which will permit the operator to turn transmitter 
carrier on and off at will.
    (f) Transmitter control circuits from any control point shall be so 
installed that grounding or shorting any line in the control circuit 
will not cause the transmitter to radiate: Provided, however, That this 
provision shall not be applicable to control circuits of stations which 
normally operate with continuous radiation or to control circuits which 
are under the effective operational control of responsible operating 
personnel 24 hours per day.

Sec. 21.122  Microwave digital modulation.

    (a) Microwave transmitters employing digital modulation techniques 
and operating below 15 GHz shall, with appropriate multiplex equipment, 
comply with the following additional requirement: The bit rate, in bits 
per second, shall be equal to or greater than the

[[Page 49]]

bandwidth specified by the emission designator in Hertz (e.g., to be 
acceptable, equipment transmitting at a 6 Mb/s rate must not require a 
bandwidth of greater than 6 MHz), except the bandwidth used to calculate 
the minimum rate shall not include any authorized guard band.
    (b) For purposes of compliance with the emission limitation 
requirements of Sec. 21.106(a)(2) of this part and the requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section, digital modulation techniques are 
considered as being employed when digital modulation contributes 50 
percent or more to the total peak frequency deviation of a transmitted 
radio frequency carrier. The total peak frequency deviation shall be 
determined by adding the deviation produced by the digital modulation 
signal and the deviation produced by any frequency division multiplex 
(FDM) modulation used. The deviation (D) produced by the FDM signal 
shall be determined in accordance with Sec. 2.202(f) of Part 2 of this 
chapter.
    (c) Transmitters employing digital modulation techniques shall 
effectively eliminate carrier spikes or single frequency tones in the 
output signal to the degree which would be obtained without repetitive 
patterns occurring in the signal.

fixed stations in this service. Frequencies in the band 2150-2160 MHz 
are shared with non-broadcast omnidirectional radio systems licensed 
under other parts of the Commission's Rules, and frequencies in the band 
2160-2162 MHz are shared with directional radio systems authorized in 
other common carrier services. Frequencies in the 2596-2644 MHz band are 
shared with Instructional Television Fixed Service Stations licensed 
under Part 74 of the Commission's Rules. The response channels E1, E2, 
F1, and F2 listed in Sec. 74.939(d) of this chapter are grandfathered 
for fixed stations in this band and are shared with Instructional 
Television Fixed Service Stations licensed under part 74 of the 
commission's rules; the existing response channels E3, E4, F3, and F4 
listed in Sec. 74.939(d) of this chapter are grandfathered and licensed 
under this part 21.
    (b) Applicants may be assigned a channel(s) according to one of the 
following frequency plans:
    (1) At 2150-2156 MHz (designated as channel 1),
    (2) At 2156-2162 MHz (designated as channel 2), or
    (3) At 2156-2160 MHz (designated as channel 2A), or
    (4) At 2596-2602 MHz, 2608-2614 MHz, 2620-2626 MHz, and 2632-2638 
MHz (designated as channels E1, E2, E3, and E4, respectively, with the 
four channels to be designated the E-group channels), and response 
channels E1 and E2 (1) listed in Sec. 74.939(d) of this chapter,\1\ or
    (5) At 2602-2608 MHz, 2614-2620 MHz, 2626-2632 MHz, and 2638-2644

    (d) Frequencies in the band 2596-2644 MHz and associated response 
channels will be assigned only in accordance with the following 
conditions:
    (1)  [Reserved]
    (2)  [Reserved]
    (3) All applicants for frequencies in this band must specify the 
channels being applied for; however, the Commission may on its own 
initiative assign different channels in the band if it is determined 
that such action would serve the public interest.
    (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 21.31 of this part, 
applications for frequencies in this band will be accepted only on the 
date(s) specified by the Commission.
    (5) Notwithstanding the provision of Sec. 21.31(a) all applications, 
except for those filed on or after September 15, 1995, that propose to 
locate transmission facilities within or within 24.1 kilometers (15 
miles) of the border of a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) 
will be considered together. In the case of a Standard Consolidated 
Statistical Area (SCSA) all applications that propose to locate 
facilities within or within 24.1 kilometers (15 miles) of the boundary 
of any SMSA contained in the SCSA will be considered together. In those 
cases in which an applicant proposes to locate its transmission 
facilities so that it will be located in, or within 24.1 kilometers (15 
miles) of, more than one SMSA, the applicant must specify which SMSA it 
intends to be its primary service area. Each application will be 
entitled to comparative consideration or to be included in a lottery in 
only one such service area.
    (6) Licensees or permittees of the frequencies in this band may 
petition the Commission to authorize exchange of assigned channels to 
allow adjacent channel operation. For example, one licensee may be 
assigned channels E<INF>1, F<INF>1, E<INF>2 and F<INF>2 and the other 
licensee could be assigned channels E<INF>3, F<INF>3, E<INF>4 and 
F<INF>4. Such a petition will be granted if the petitioners show that 
the exchange will result in better service to the public.
    (7) All applications for frequencies in this band, except for those 
filed on or after September 15, 1995, must contain a showing of how 
interference with the operation of adjacent channels will be avoided and 
what steps the applicant has taken to comply with Sec. 21.902(a) of this 
part.

Sec. 21.902  Frequency interference.

    (a) All applicants, conditional licensees, and licensees shall make 
exceptional efforts to avoid harmful interference to other users and to 
avoid blocking potential adjacent channel use in the same city and 
cochannel use in nearby cities. In areas where major cities are in close 
proximity, careful consideration should be given to minimum power 
requirements and to the location, height, and radiation pattern of the 
transmitting antenna. Licensees, conditional licensees, and applicants 
are expected to cooperate fully in attempting to resolve problems of 
potential interference before bringing the matter to the attention of 
the Commission.
    (b) As a condition for use of frequency in this service, each 
applicant, conditional licensee, and licensee is required to:
    (1) Not enter into any lease or contract or otherwise take any 
action that would unreasonably prohibit location of another station's 
transmitting antenna at any given site inside its own protected service 
area.
    (2) Cooperate fully and in good faith to resolve interference and 
transmission security problems.
    (3) Engineer the system to provide at least 45 dB of cochannel 
interference protection within the 56.33 km (35 mile) protected service 
area of any authorized or previously proposed station that transmit, or 
may transmit, signals for standard television reception.
    (4) Engineer the station to provide at least 0 dB of adjacent 
channel interference protection within the 56.33 km (35 mile) protected 
service area of any authorized or previously proposed station that 
transmits, or may transmit, signals for standard television reception.
    (5) (i) Engineer the station to limit the calculated free space 
power flux density to -73 dBW/m<SUP>2 at the boundary of a 56.33 km (35 
mile) protected service area, where there is an unobstructed signal path 
from the transmitting antenna to the boundary; or alternatively, obtain 
the written consent of the entity authorized for the adjoining area to 
exceed the -73 dBW/m<SUP>2 limiting signal strength at the common 
boundary.
    (ii) In determining signal path conditions, the following shall be 
used: a 9.1 meter (30 feet) receiving antenna height, the transmitting 
antenna height, terrain elevations and 4/3 earth radius propagation 
conditions.
    (6) If a proposed station is within 80 km (50 miles) of the Canadian 
or Mexican border, the station must be designed to meet the requirements 
set forth in international treaties.
    (c) The following interference studies must be prepared, must be 
available to the Commission upon request, and may be submitted as part 
of any application:
    (1) An analysis of the potential for harmful interference within the 
56.33 km (35 mile) protected service areas of any authorized or 
previously proposed incumbent station:
    (i) if the coordinates of the applicant's proposed transmitter are 
within 160.94 km (100 miles) of the center coordinates of any authorized 
or previously proposed incumbent station with protected service area of 
56.33 km (35 miles) as specified in Sec. 21.902(d); or
    (ii) if the great circle path between the applicant's proposed 
transmitter and the protected service area of any authorized, or 
previously-proposed, cochannel or adjacent-channel station(s) is within 
241.4 kilometers or less and 90 percent or more of the path is over 
water or within 16.1 kilometers of the coast or shoreline of the 
Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, any of the Great 
Lakes, or any bay associated with any of the above (see Secs. 21.901(a) 
and 74.902 of this chapter);

[[Page 60]]

    (2) Applicants may design interference studies in any manner that 
demonstrates the avoidance of harmful interference, as defined in this 
subpart.
    (i) In lieu of interference studies, applicants may submit in 
accordance with Sec. 21.938 a written statement of no objection to the 
operation of the MDS station.
    (ii) The Commission may direct applicants to submit interference 
studies of a specific nature.
    (3) Except for new stations proposed in applications filed after 
September 15, 1995, in the case of a proposal to operate a non-colocated 
station within the protected service area of an authorized, or 
previously proposed, adjacent channel station, an analysis that 
identifies the areas within the protected service areas of both the 
authorized or previously proposed adjacent channel station and the 
proposed station that cannot be protected as specified in 
Sec. 21.902(b)(4) and an explanation of why the proposed station cannot 
be colocated with the existing or previously proposed station.
    (4) In the case of a proposal for use of channel 2, an analysis of 
the potential for harmful interference with any authorized point-to-
point station located within 80.5 kilometers (50 miles) which utilizes 
the 2160-2162 MHz band; and
    (d) (1) Subject to the limitations contained in paragraph (e) of 
this section, each MDS station licensee shall be protected from harmful 
electrical interference, as determined by the theoretical calculations, 
within a protected service area of which the boundary will be 56.3255 
kilometers (35 miles) from the transmitter site.
    (2) As of September 15, 1995, the location of these protected 
service area boundaries shall become fixed. The center of the circular 
area shall be the geographic latitude and longitude of the transmitting 
antenna site specified in station authorizations or previously proposed 
applications filed at the Commission before September 15, 1995. 
Subsequent transmitter site changes will not change the location of the 
56.3255 kilometers (35 mile) protected service area boundaries.
    (e) No MDS licensee will be protected from harmful interference 
caused by:
    (1) Any station with an earlier filing date.
    (2) Any station that was authorized before July 1984.
    (3) Any multichannel MDS station whose application was pending on 
September 9, 1983.
    (f) In addressing potential harmful interference in this service, 
the following definitions, procedures and other criteria shall apply:
    (1) Co-channel interference is defined as the ratio of the desired 
signal to the undesired signal present in the desired channel, at the 
output of a reference receiving antenna oriented to receive the maximum 
desired signal. Harmful interference will be considered present when a 
free space calculation for an unobstructed signal path determines that 
this ratio is less than 45 dB.
    (2) Adjacent channel interference is defined as the ratio of the 
desired signal to undesired signal present in an adjacent channel, at 
the output of a reference receiving antenna oriented to receive the 
maximum desired signal level. Harmful interference will be considered 
present when a free space calculation for an unobstructed signal path 
determines that this ratio is less than 0 dB. In the alternative, 
harmful interference will be considered present for an Instructional 
Television Fixed Service (ITFS) station constructed before May 26, 1983, 
when a free space calculation determines that this ratio is less than 10 
dB, unless the license for a Multipoint Distribution Service station in 
the 2596-2690 MHz frequency band is conditioned on the proffer to the 
affected ITFS station licensee of equipment capable of providing a ratio 
of 0 dB or more at no expense to the ITFS station licensee, and also 
conditioned, if necessary, on installation of such equipment, absent a 
showing by the affected ITFS station licensee demonstrating good cause 
and that the proposed equipment will not provide a ratio of 0 dB or more 
or that installation of such equipment, at no expense to the ITFS 
station licensee, is not possible.
    (3) For purposes of this section all interference calculations 
involving receive antenna performance shall use the reference antenna 
characteristics shown in figure 1.

[[Page 62]]

    (4) For purposes of this section, the received signal power level 
(RSL)<INF>dBW at the output of the FCC reference receiving antenna is 
obtained from the following formulas (or an equivalent adaptation):

(RSL)<INF>dBW=(EIRP)<INF>dBW-(L<INF>FS)<INF>dB+(G<INF>AR)<INF>dB
where the free space loss (L<INF>FS) is
(L<INF>FS)<INF>dB=20 log (4<INF>d/)<INF>dB 

in which the parameters are defined as follows:
    (RSL)<INF>dBW is the received power in decibels referenced to one 
watt.
    (EIRP)<INF>dBW is the equivalent isotropically radiated power in 
decibels above one watt.
    d is the distance of the signal path in meters.
    <greek-l> is the wavelength of the signal in meters.
    G<INF>AR is the dB gain of the reference receiving antenna above an 
isotropic antenna (obtained from Figure 1 of this section.)
    (5) A determination of signal path conditions shall use a 9.1 meters 
(30 feet) receiving antenna height, the transmitting antenna height, 
terrain elevation, and assume 4/3 earth radius propagation conditions.
    (6) An application will not be accepted for filing if cochannel or 
adjacent channel interference is predicted at the boundary of the 56.33 
km (35 mile) protected service area of an authorized or previously 
proposed incumbent station based on the following criteria:
    (i) interference calculations shall be made only for directions 
where there is an unobstructed signal path from the site of a proposed 
station to the boundary of any protected area.
    (ii) calculations of received power levels in units of dBW from the 
proposed station will be made at one degree intervals around the 
protected service area.
    (iii) the assumed value of the desired signal level at the boundary 
of an incumbent station shall be -83 dBW, which is the calculated 
received power in free space at a distance of 56.33 km (35 miles), given 
at EIRP of 2000 watts and a receiver antenna gain of 20 dBi.
    (iv) harmful interference will be considered to occur at locations 
along the boundary wherever the ratio between the desired signal level 
of -83 dBw and the received power from a proposed cochannel or adjacent 
channel station is less than 45 dB or 0 dB for cochannel or adjacent 
channel proposals, respectively.
    (7) Alternatively, MDS applications will be accepted on the basis of 
an executed written interference agreement between potentially affected 
parties filed in accordance with Sec. 21.938.
    (g)(1) All interference studies prepared pursuant to paragraph (c) 
of this section must be served on all licensees, conditional licensees, 
and applicants for the stations required to be studied by this section. 
This service must include a copy of the FCC application and occur on or 
before the date the application is filed with the Commission.
    (2) MDS licensees, conditional licensees and applicants of 
facilities with 56.33 km (35 mile) protected service areas shall notify 
in writing the holders of authorizations for adjoining BTAs or PSAs of 
application filings for modified station licenses, provided the proposed 
facility would produce an unobstructed signal path to any location 
within the adjoining BTA or PSA. This service must include a copy of the 
FCC application and occur on or before the date the application is filed 
with the Commission.
    (h) For purposes of Sec. 21.31(a), an MDS application, except for 
those applications filed on or after September 15, 1995, filed for a 
facility that would cause harmful electrical interference within the 
protected service area of any authorized or previously proposed station 
will be presumed to be mutually exclusive with the application for such 
authorized or previously proposed station.
    (i) (1) For each application for a new station, or amendment 
thereto, or modification application, or amendment thereto, proposing 
Multipoint Distribution Service (MDS) facilities on the E, F, or H

paragraph (i)(6)(1) of this section.
    (j) If the initial application for facilities in the 2596-2644 
frequency band was filed on September 9, 1983, an applicant proposing to

Management and Budget.


<R05>
Sec. 21.903  Purpose and permissible service.

    (a) Multipoint Distribution Service stations are generally intended 
to provide one-way radio transmission (usually in an omnidirectional 
pattern)

[[Page 65]]

from a stationary transmitter to multiple receiving facilities located 
at fixed points. When service is provided on a common carrier basis, 
subscriber supplied information is transmitted to points designated by 
the subscriber. When service is provided on a non-common carrier basis, 
transmissions may include information originated by persons other than 
the licensee, licensee- manipulated information supplied by other 
persons, or information originated by the licensee. Point-to-point radio 
return links from a subscriber's location to a MDS operator's facilities 
may be authorized in the 18,580 through 18,820 MHz and 18,920 through 
19,160 MHz bands. Rules governing such operation are contained in 
subpart I of part 101 of this chapter, the Point-to-Point Microwave 
Radio Service.
    (b) Unless otherwise directed or conditioned in the applicable 
instrument of authorization, Multipoint Distribution Service stations 
may render any kind of communications service consistent with the 
Commission's rules on a common carrier or on a non-common carrier basis, 
Provided That:
    (1) Unless service is rendered on a non-common carrier basis, the 
common carrier controls the operation of all receiving facilities 
(including any equipment necessary to convert the signal to a standard 
television channel but excluding the television receiver); and
    (2) Unless service is rendered on a non-common carrier basis, the 
common carrier's tariff allows the subscriber the option of owning the 
receiving equipment (except for the decoder) so long as:
    (i) The customer provides the type of equipment as specified in the 
tariff;
    (ii) Such equipment is in suitable condition for the rendition of 
satisfactory service; and
    (iii) Such equipment is installed, maintained, and operated pursuant 
to the common carrier's instructions and control.
    (c) The carrier's tariff shall fully describe the parameters of the 
service to be provided, including the degree of privacy of 
communications a subscriber can expect in ordinary service. If the 
ordinary service does not provide for complete security of transmission, 
the tariff shall make provision for service with such added protection 
upon request.

<R05>
Sec. 21.904  Transmitter power.

    (a) The maximum equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) of a 
transmitter station in this service shall not exceed 2000 watts (33 dBW) 
except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) If a station uses a transmitting antenna with a non-
omnidirectional horizontal plane radiation pattern, the maximum 
equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) in dBW in a given 
direction shall be determined by the following formula:

EIRP=33 dBW+10 log (360/beamwidth) [where 10 log (360/beamwidth) 
          <ls-thn-eq>6 dB].

Beamwidth is the total horizontal plane beamwidth of the transmitting 
antenna system in degrees, measured at the half-power points.
    (c) An increase in station transmitter power, above currently-
authorized or previously proposed values, to the maximum values provided 
in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, may be authorized, if the 
requested power increase would not cause harmful interference to any 
authorized or previously proposed co-channel or adjacent-channel station 
with a transmitter site within 80.5 kilometers (50 miles) of the 
applicant's transmitter site, or if an applicant demonstrates that:
    (1) A station, that must be protected from interference, potentially 
could suffer interference that would be eliminated by increasing the 
power of the interfered-with station; and
    (2) The interfered-with stations may increase it own power 
consistent with the rules; and
    (3) The applicant requesting authorization of a power increase 
agrees to pay all expenses associated with the increase in power to the 
interfered-with station.
    (d) For television transmission if the authorized bandwidth is 4.0 
MHz or more for the visual and accompanying aural signal, the peak power 
of the accompanying aural signal must not exceed 10 percent of the peak 
visual

[[Page 66]]

power of the transmitter. The Commission may order a reduction in aural 
signal power to diminish the potential for harmful interference.

60 FR 36554, July 17, 1995; 60 FR 57367, Nov. 15, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 21.905  Emissions and bandwidth.

    (a) A station transmitting a television signal shall not exceed a 
bandwidth of 6 MHz (for both visual signal and accompanying aural 
signal), and will normally employ vestigial sideband, amplitude 
modulation (C3F) for the visual signal, and frequency modulation (F3E) 
or (G3E) for the accompanying aural signal.
    (b) For purposes other than standard television transmission, 
different types of emissions may be authorized if the applicant 
describes fully the modulation and bandwidth desired, and demonstrates 
that the bandwidth desired is no wider than needed to provide the 
intended service. However, in no event shall the necessary or occupied 
bandwidth, whichever is greater, exceed 6 MHz.
    (c) Any licensee of a station in the 2150-2162 MHz or 2596-2644 MHz, 
2650-2656 MHz, 2662-2668 MHz, or 2674-2680 MHz frequency bands, after 
notice and opportunity for hearing, may be required to use the frequency 
offset technique to avoid or to minimize harmful interference to another 
licensed station in the 2150-2162 MHz and 2596-2544 MHz, 2650-2656 MHz, 
2662-2668 MHz, and 2674-2680 MHz frequency bands or to make other 
changes as provided in Secs. 21.100, 21.107, 21.900, 21.901, 21.902, 
21.904, 21.905(a), 21.905(b), 21.906, 21.907, and 21.908 of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 21.906  Antennas.

    (a) Transmitting antennas shall be omnidirectional, except that a 
directional antenna with a main beam sufficiently broad to provide 
adequate service may be used either to avoid possible interference with 
other users in the frequency band, or to provide coverage more 
consistent with distribution of potential receiving points. When an 
applicant proposes to employ a directional antenna, the applicant shall 
provide the Commission with information regarding the orientation of the 
directional antenna, expressed in degree of azimuth, with respect to 
true north.
    (b) The use of horizontal or vertical plane wave polarization, or 
right hand or left hand rotating elliptical polarization may be used to 
minimize the hazard of harmful interference between systems.
    (c) Transmitting antennas located within 56.3 kilometers (35 miles) 
of the Canadian border should be directed so as to minimize, to the 
extent that is practical, emissions toward the border.
    (d) Directive receiving antennas shall be used at all points and 
shall be elevated no higher than necessary to assure adequate service. 
Receiving antenna height shall not exceed the height criteria of Part 17 
of this chapter, unless authorization for use of a specific maximum 
antenna height (above ground and above mean sea level) for each location 
has been obtained from the Commission prior to the erection of the 
antenna. Requests for such authorization shall show the inclusive dates 
of the proposed operation. (See Part 17 of this chapter concerning the 
construction, marking and lighting of antenna structures.)

Sec. 21.907  Transmission standards.

    (a) A licensee assigned a 6 MHz channel must be able to provide one 
type of monochrome and color television service which complies with the 
VHF transmission standards set forth in Sec. 73.682(a) of this chapter, 
except that the provision of Sec. 21.906(b) shall replace the 
requirements of Sec. 73.682(a)(14) of this chapter.
    (b) A licensee assigned a 4 MHz channel must be able to provide one 
type of monochrome and/or color television service which complies with 
VHF transmission standards set forth in Sec. 73.682(a) of this chapter, 
except that:
    (1) The provision of Sec. 21.906(b) shall replace the requirements 
of Sec. 73.682(a)(14) of this chapter, and

and (a)(20) of this chapter shall not apply.
    (c) In addition to the standard television transmission service 
specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the licensee may 
offer a television service not meeting such standards if the tariff or 
contract clearly describes the type and quality of the service and 
distinguishes it from the standard service, and if the transmitter is 
type-accepted for such use.
    (d) For services other than television, a licensee may provide 
transmissions as described in the tariff or contract if the authorized 
bandwidth is not exceeded and the transmitter is type-accepted for such 
use.
    (e) In order to insure that transmitting information is not likely 
to be received in intelligible form by unauthorized subscribers or 
licensees, a licensee may vary the transmission standards specified in 
paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, provided that the encoded 
information is recoverable without perceptible degradation as compared 
to the same information transmitted in accordance with paragraphs (a), 
(b), and (c) of this section.

Sec. 21.908  Television transmitting equipment.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the requirements 
of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) of Sec. 73.687 of this chapter 
shall apply to stations in this service transmitting standard television 
signals.
    (b) On or after November 1, 1991, the maximum out-of-band power of a 
transmitter operating in the frequency bands 2150-2162 MHz, 2596-2644 
MHz, 2650-2656 MHz, 2662-2668 MHz, and 2674-2680 MHz shall be attenuated 
38 dB relative to the peak visual carrier at the channel edges and 
constant slope attenuation from this level to 60 dB relative to the peak 
visual carrier at 1 MHz below the lower band edge and 0.5 MHz above the 
upper band edge. All out-of-band emissions extending beyond these 
frequencies shall be attenuated at least 60 dB below the peak visual 
carrier power. However, should harmful interference occur as a result of 
emissions outside the assigned channel, additional attenuation may be 
required. A transmitter licensed prior to November 1, 1991, that remains 
at the station site initially licensed, and does not comply with this 
paragraph, may continue to be used for its life if it does not cause 
harmful interference to the operation of any other licensee. Any non-
conforming transmitter replaced after November 1, 1991, must be replaced 
by a transmitter meeting the requirements of this paragraph.
    (c) The requirements of Sec. 73.687(c)(2) of this chapter will be 
considered to be satisfied insofar as measurements of operating power 
are concerned if the transmitter station is equipped with instruments 
for determining the combined visual and aural operating power. However, 
licensees must maintain the operating powers within the limits specified 
in Sec. 21.904 of this part. Measurements of the separate visual and 
aural operating powers must be made at sufficiently frequent intervals 
to insure compliance with the rules, and in no event less than once a 
month.
    (d) Television transmitting equipment designed for stations whose 
authorized bandwidth in 4 MHz or less for the visual and accompanying 
aural signal is subject to the provisions of Sec. 21.101 of this part 
with respect to the frequency tolerance of the visual and aural 
carriers. Such equipment is also subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section, except that the provisions of Sec. 73.687 (a), (b), and 
(c)(1) of this chapter shall not apply.
    (e) As a further exception to the other requirements of this 
section, transmitting equipment characteristics may vary from these 
requirements to the extent necessary to insure that transmitted 
information is not likely to be received in intelligible form by 
unauthorized subscribers or licensees, provided such variations permit 
recovery of the transmitted information without perceptible degradation 
as compared to the same information transmitted without such variations.

Sec. 21.909  MDS response stations.

    (a) An MDS response station is authorized to provide communication 
by voice and/or data signals with its associated MDS station. An MDS 
response

[[Page 68]]

station may be operated only by the licensee of the MDS station or its 
subscriber and only at receiving location of the MDS station with which 
it is communicating. More than one response station may be operated at 
the same or different receiving locations. All MDS response stations 
communicating with a single MDS station shall operate within the same 
frequency channel. The specified frequency channel which may be used by 
the response station is determined by the channel assigned to the MDS 
station with which it communicates. The specified frequency channel may 
be subdivided to provide a distinct operating frequency for each of more 
than one response station.
    (b) Authorization of an MDS response station is subject to the 
following terms and conditions:
    (1) The response station shall not cause interference to any station 
operating beyond the service area of the MDS station with which it 
communicates.
    (2) The antenna structure height employed at any location shall not 
exceed the criteria set forth in Sec. 17.7 of this chapter.
    (c) The response channels associated with channels E3, E4, F3, F4, 
H1, H2, and H3 are allocated to the private operational-fixed service 
(part 94 of this chapter).

Sec. 21.910  Special procedures for discontinuance, reduction or impairment of service by common carrier MDS licensees.

    Any MDS licensee who has elected common carrier status and who seeks 
to discontinue service on a common carrier basis and instead provide 
service on a non-common carrier basis or who otherwise intends to reduce 
or impair service, shall be subject to the following procedures:
    (a) The carrier shall notify all affected customers of the planned 
discontinuance, reduction or impairment. Notice shall be in writing to 
each affected customer unless the Commission authorizes in advance, for 
good cause shown, another form of notice. Notice shall include the 
following:
    (1) Name and address of carrier;
    (2) Date of planned service discontinuance, reduction or impairment;
    (3) Points or geographic areas of service affected;
    (4) Whether Single-channel or Multichannel Multipoint Distribution 
Service is the service affected; and
    (5) The following statement:

    The FCC will normally authorize this proposed discontinuance of 
service (or reduction or impairment) unless it is shown that end-users 
will be adversely affected thereby. Affected customers wishing to object 
should file objections within 45 days after receipt of this 
notification, and address them to the Domestic Radio Branch, Domestic 
Facilities Division, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 
20554, referencing the Sec. 21.910 Application of (carrier's name). 
Comments should include specific information about the impact of this 
proposed discontinuance (or reduction or impairment) upon end-users, 
including any inability by the customer to acquire reasonable substitute 
service from another provider. The affected customer must state that it 
has provided a copy of the objection to the carrier seeking 
discontinuance.

    (b) The carrier shall file with this Commission, or or after the 
date on which notice has been given to all affected customers, an 
application which shall contain the following:
    (1) Caption--``Section 21.910 Application'';
    (2) Information listed in Sec. 21.901(a) (1) through (4) above;
    (3) Brief description of the dates and methods of notice of all 
affected customers;
    (4) A statement of whether any customer has opposed the notice; and
    (5) Any other information the Commission may require.
    (c) The application to discontinue, reduce or impair service shall 
be automatically granted on the 76th day after its filing with the 
Commission without any Commission notification to the applicant unless 
an objection has been filed or the Commission has notified the applicant 
that the grant will not be automatically effective.

Sec. 21.912  Cable television company eligibility requirements.

    (a) Nothwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 21.900 of this part, 
initial or modified authorizations for stations in the 2150-2162 MHz and 
2596-2680 MHz frequency bands may not be granted to a cable operator if 
a portion of the Multipoint Distribution Service (MDS) station's 
protected services area is within the portion of the franchise area 
actually served by the cable operator's cable system. No cable operator 
may acquire such authorization either directly, or indirectly through an 
affiliate owned operated, or controlled by or under common control with 
a cable operator.
    (b) No licensee of a station in this service may lease transmission 
time or capacity to a cable operator either directly, or indirectly 
through an affiliate owned, operated, controlled by, or under common 
control with a cable operator, if a portion of the Multipoint 
Distribution Service (MDS) station's protected services area is within 
the portion of the franchise area actually served by the cable 
operator's cable system.
    (c) Applications for new stations, station modifications, 
assignments or transfers of control by cable operators of stations in 
the 2150-2162 MHz and 2596-2680 MHz frequency bands shall include a 
showing that no portion of the protected service area of the MDS station 
is within the portion of the franchise area actually served by the cable 
operator's cable system, or of any entity indirectly affiliated, owned, 
operated, controlled by, or under common control with the cable 
operator.

    Note 1: (A) In applying the provisions of this section an 
attributable ownership interest shall be defined by reference to the 
definitions contained in the notes to Sec. 76.501, provided however, 
that:

    (i) The single majority shareholder provisions of Note 2(b) to 
Sec. 76.501 and the limited partner insulation provisions of Note 2(g) 
to Sec. 76.501 shall not apply; and
    (ii) The provisions of Note 2(a) to Sec. 76.501 regarding five (5) 
percent interests shall include all voting or nonvoting stock or limited 
partnership equity interests of five (5) percent or more.
    (B) The term ``area served by a cable system'' means any area 
actually passed by the cable operator's cable system and which can be 
connected for a standard connection fee.
    (C) As used in this section ``cable operator'' shall have the same 
definition as in Sec. 76.5.

    Note 2: The Commission will entertain requests to waive the 
restrictions in paragraph (a) of this section where necessary to ensure 
that all significant portions of the franchise area are able to obtain 
multichannel video service. Such waiver requests should be filed

[[Page 70]]

in accordance with special relief procedures set forth in Sec. 76.7.
    (d) The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section 
will not apply to one MDS or MMDS channel used to provide locally-
produced programming to cable headends. Locally-produced programming is 
programming produced in or near the cable operator's franchise area and 
not broadcast on a television station available within that franchise 
area. A cable operator will be permitted one MDS channel in an MMDS 
protected service area for this purpose, and no more than one MDS 
channel in an MMDS protected service area may be used by a cable 
television company or its affiliate or lessor pursuant to this 
paragraph. The licensee for a cable operator providing local programming 
pursuant to a lease must include in a notice filed with the Common 
Carrier Bureau a cover letter explicitly identifying itself or its 
lessee as a local cable operator and stating that the lease was executed 
to facilitate the provision of local programming. The first application 
or the first lease notification in an area filed with the Commission 
will be entitled to the exemption. The limitations on one MDS channel 
per party and per area include any cable/MDS operations grandfathered 
pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section or cable/ITFS operations 
grandfathered pursuant to Sec. 74.931(e) of this chapter.\1\ The cable 
operator must demonstrate in its MDS/MMDS application that the proposed 
local programming will be provided within one year from the date its 
application is granted. Local programming service pursuant to a lease 
must be provided within one year of the date of the lease or one year of 
grant of the licensee's application for the leased channel, whichever is 
later. If an MDS license for these purposes is granted and the 
programming is subsequently discontinued, the license will be 
automatically forfeited the day after local programming service is 
discontinued.
    (e) Applications filed by cable television companies, or affiliates, 
for MDS channels prior to February 8, 1990, will not be subject to the 
prohibitions of this section. Applications filed on February 8, 1990, or 
thereafter will be returned. Lease arrangements between cable and MDS 
entities for which a lease or a firm agreement was signed prior to 
February 8, 1990, will also not be subject to the prohibitions of this 
section. Leases between cable television companies, or affiliates, and 
MDS/MMDS station licensees, conditional licensees, or applicansts 
executed on February 8, 1990, or thereafter, are invalid.
    (1) Applications filed by cable operators, or affiliates, for MMDS 
channels prior to February 8, 1990, will not be subject to the 
prohibitions of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) 
below, applications filed on February 8, 1990, or thereafter will be 
returned. Lease arrangements between cable and MDS entities for which a 
lease or a firm agreement was signed prior to February 8, 1990, will 
also not be subject to the prohibitions of this section. Except as 
provided in paragraph (e)(2) below, leases between cable operators, or 
affiliates, and MDS/MMDS station licensees, conditional licensees, or 
applicants executed on or before February 8, 1990, or thereafter are 
invalid.
    (2) Applications filed by cable operators, or affiliates for MDS 
channels after February 8, 1990, and prior to October 5, 1992, will not 
be subject to the prohibition of this section, if, pursuant to the then 
existing overbuild or rural exceptions, the applications were allowed 
under the then existing cable/MMDs cross-ownership prohibitions. Lease 
arrangements between cable operators and MDS entities for which a lease 
or firm agreement was signed after February 8, 1990, and prior to 
October 5, 1992, will not be subject to the prohibitions of this 
section, if, pursuant to the then existing rural and overbuild 
exceptions, the lease arrangements were allowed.
    (3) The limitations on cable television ownership in this section do 
not apply to any cable operator in any franchise area in which a cable 
operator is subject to effective competition as determined under section 
623(l) of the Communications Act.
    (f) Interested persons may file a petition to deny an application 
filed pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section within 30 days after the 
Commission gives public notice that the application

[[Page 71]]

or petition has been filed. Petitions must be served upon the applicant, 
and must contain a complete and detailed showing, supported by 
affidavit, of any facts or considerations relied upon. The applicant may 
file an opposition to the petition to deny within 30 days after the 
filing of the petition, and must serve copies upon all persons who have 
filed petitions to deny. The Commission, after consideration of the 
pleadings, will determine whether the public interest, convenience and 
necessity would be served by the grant or denial of the application, in 
whole or in part. The Commission may specify other procedures, such as 
oral argument, evidentiary hearing or further written submission 
directed to particular aspects, as it deems appropriate.

    Notes: In these grandfathered situations, we will consider granting 
waivers to permit the use of a second MDS channel for the delivery of 
locally produced programming. Because allocating a second channel to 
this use would further reduce the channel capacity available for 
wireless cable service, we will require an applicant for the second 
channel to demonstrate, at a minimum, that it is ready and able to 
provide additional locally produced programming to area cable systems, 
and that no other practical means of delivering the programming are 
available to it. In considering requests for waiver, we will also take 
into account the competitive environment for the production and delivery 
of locally produced programming in the relevant markets.

receivers, and the street address of the signal booster;
    (3) No registered receiver of an ITFS E or F channel station, 
constructed prior to May 26, 1983, is located within a 1.6 kilometer (1 
mile) radius of the coordinates of the booster, or in the alternative, 
that a consent statement has been obtained from the affected ITFS 
licensee;
    (4) No environmental assessment location as defined at Sec. 1.1307 
of this chapter is affected by installation and/or operation of the 
signal booster;
    (5) Each MDS and/or ITFS station licensee with protected service 
areas or registered receivers within a 8.0 kilometer (5 mile) radius of 
the coordinates of the booster has been given notice of its 
installation;
    (6) Consent has been obtained from each MDS or ITFS station licensee 
whose signal is repeated by the signal booster;
    (7) The signal booster site is within the protected service area of 
the MDS station, if the signal of an MDS station is repeated;
    (8) The power flux density at the edge of the MDS station's 
protected service area does not exceed -73.0 dBW/m<SUP>2, if the signal 
of an MDS station is repeated;
    (9) The antenna structure will extend less than 6.10 meters (20 
feet) above the ground or natural formation or less than 6.10 meters (20 
feet) above an existing manmade structure (other than an antenna 
structure); and
    (10) The MDS or ITFS licensee understands and agrees that in the 
event harmful interference is claimed by the filing of an objection or 
petition to deny, the licensee must terminate operation within two (2) 
hours of written notification by the Commission, and must not recommence 
operation until receipt of written authorization to do so by the 
Commission.

Sec. 21.930   Five-year build-out requirements.

    (a)(1) A BTA authorization holder has a five-year build-out period, 
beginning on the date of the grant of the BTA authorization and 
terminating on the 5th year anniversary of the grant of the 
authorization, within which it may develop and expand MDS station 
operations within its service area.
    (2) This period is not extended by the grant of subsequent 
authorizations (i.e., grant of a station license or modification).
    (3) Timely certifications of completion of construction for each MDS 
station within a BTA or partitioned service area must be filed upon 
completion of construction of a station.

[[Page 75]]

    (b) Each BTA authorization holder has the exclusive right to build, 
develop, expand and operate MDS stations within its BTA service area 
during the five-year build-out period. The Commission will not accept 
competing applications for MDS station licenses within the BTA service 
area during this period.
    (c)(1) Within five years of the grant of a BTA authorization, the 
authorization holder must construct MDS stations to provide signals 
pursuant to Sec. 21.907 that are capable of reaching at least two-thirds 
of the population of the applicable service area, excluding the 
populations within protected service areas of incumbent stations.
    (2) Sixty days prior to the end of the five-year build out period, 
the BTA authorization holder must file with the Commission proof that 
demonstrates the holder has met the requirements of Sec. 21.930(c)(1). 
The most recent census figures available from the U.S. Department of 
Commerce, Bureau of Census prior to the expiration of the authorization 
holder's five-year build-out period will be used to determine compliance 
with population-based requirements. In no event shall census figures 
gathered prior to 1990 be used.
    (d)(1) If the Commission finds that the BTA authorization holder has 
demonstrated that it has met the requirements of Sec. 21.930(c)(1), the 
Commission will issue a declaration that the holder has met such 
requirements.
    (2) If the Commission finds that the BTA authorization holder has 
not provided a signal as required in Sec. 21.930(c)(1), the Commission 
shall partition from the BTA any unserved area, using county lines as a 
guide, and shall re-authorize service to the unserved area pursuant to 
the MDS competitive bidding procedures of this subpart. Applications for 
such unserved areas are not acceptable for filing until a filing date is 
announced through a public notice.
    (i) The competitive bidding procedures set forth in Secs. 21.950 to 
21.961 shall be followed by applicants seeking authority to provide MDS 
service to the unserved partitioned area.
    (ii) The BTA authorization holder originally authorized to provide 
service is ineligible to participate in the competitive bidding process 
for the unserved areas partitioned from its BTA.

Sec. 21.931  Partitioned service areas (PSAs).

    (a)(1) The holder of a BTA authorization may enter into contracts 
with eligible parties to partition any portion of its service area 
according to county boundaries, or according to other geopolitical 
subdivision boundaries, or multiple contiguous counties or geopolitical 
subdivisions within the BTA service area.
    (2)(i) Partitioning contracts must be filed with the Commission 
within 30 days of the date that such agreements are reached.
    (ii) The contracts must include descriptions of the areas being 
partitioned and include any documentation necessary to convey to the 
Commission the precise boundaries of the partitioned area.
    (3) Parties to partitioning contracts must file concurrently with 
such contracts one of the following, where appropriate:
    (i) an MDS long-form application for authority to operate a new MDS 
station within the PSA;
    (ii) applications for assignment or transfer of existing stations 
with the PSA; or
    (iii) a statement of intention as defined in Sec. 21.956(a) along 
with a completed FCC Form 430.
    (b) The eligibility requirements applicable to BTA authorization 
holders also apply to those individuals and entities seeking PSA 
authorizations.
    (c) Any individual or entity acquiring the rights to a partitioned 
area of a BTA also acquires the rights to any previously authorized 
individual stations located within the partitioned area that were held 
by the previous authorization holder, provided that grantable 
applications for assignment and transfer of control, FCC Forms 702 and 
704, are filed for existing stations and that acceptable amendments to 
pending long-form applications are filed. Pending long-form applications 
filed by the previous authorization holder for transmitter sites within 
the

[[Page 76]]

PSA may also be dismissed without prejudice at the applicant's request.
    (d) Authorizations for PSAs will be issued in accordance with 
Sec. 21.958; however, when individual stations within an PSA are 
assigned along with the partitioned area, the authorization will be 
granted concurrently with the grant of the applications for assignment 
and transfer of the existing stations.
    (e) Subsequent to issuance of the authorization for a PSA, thee 
partitioned area will be treated as a separate protected service area.
    (f)(1) When any area within a BTA becomes a PSA, the remaining 
counties and other geopolitical subdivisions within that BTA will also 
be subsequently treated and classified as a PSA(s).
    (2) At the time a BTA is partitioned, the Commission shall cancel 
the BTA authorization initially issued and issue a PSA authorization to 
the former BTA authorization holder.
    (g) The duties and responsibilities imposed upon BTA authorization 
holders in this part and throughout the Commission's rules, such as 
Sec. 21.930(c)(1), apply to the holders of PSA authorizations.
    (h) The build-out period for PSAs voluntarily partitioned shall be 
the remainder of the five-year build-out period applicable to the BTA or 
PSA from which the PSA was drawn. For PSA authorizations issued pursuant 
to Sec. 21.930(d)(2) and the competitive bidding process, the build-out 
period is five years, beginning on the date of the grant of the PSA 
authorization. The requirements of Sec. 21.930(c)(1) also apply to the 
holders of authorizations for PSAs.

Sec. 21.938  BTA and PSA technical and interference provisions.

    (a) BTA or PSA authorization holders are expected to cooperate with 
one another by designing their stations in a manner that protects 
service in adjoining BTAs and PSAs including consideration of 
interference abatement techniques such as cross polarization, frequency 
offset, directional antennas, antenna beam tilt, EIRP decrease, 
reduction of antenna height, and terrain shielding.
    (b) Unless the affected parties have executed a written interference 
agreement in accordance with Sec. 21.937, stations licensed to a BTA or 
PSA authorization holder must not cause harmful electromagnetic 
interference to the following:
    (1) the protected service area of other authorization holders in 
adjoining BTAs or PSAs.
    (2) the 56.33 km (35 mile) protected service areas of authorized or 
previously proposed MDS stations (incumbents).
    (3) registered receive sites and protected service areas of 
authorized or previously proposed stations in the Instructional 
Television Fixed Service pursuant to the manner in which interference is 
defined in Sec. 74.903(a).
    (c)(1) ITFS applicants may locate a new station in an unused portion 
of a BTA or PSA where interference to a previously-proposed or 
authorized MDS

[[Page 78]]

station of a BTA or PSA authorization holder would not be predicted.
    (2) With respect to ITFS applications only and for purposes of 
determining the existence of harmful electromagnetic interference as 
caused to MDS stations licensed to BTA or PSA authorization holders by 
subsequently proposed ITFS stations within that BTA, MDS stations 
licensed to BTA and PSA authorization holders and will have a protected 
service area of 56.33 km (35 miles), centered on the antenna site of the 
MDS stations.
    (3) The 56.33 km (35 mile) protected service area afforded to a 
previously-proposed or authorized MDS station of a BTA or PSA 
authorization holder with respect to a subsequently proposed ITFS 
station is entitled to the interference protection standards of 
Sec. 21.902.
    (4) An ITFS station authorized before September 15, 1995 may be 
modified, provided the power flux density of that station does not 
exceed -73 dBw/m2 at locations along the 56.33 km (35 mile) circle 
centered on the then-existing transmitting antenna site or service area 
of collocated incumbent MDS station, as applicable.
    (d) Unless the affected parties have executed a written interference 
agreement in accordance with Sec. 21.937, it shall be the responsibility 
of a BTA or PSA authorization holder to correct at its expense any 
condition of harmful electromagnetic interference caused to authorized 
MDS service at locations within other BTAs or PSAs or within the 56.33 
km (35 mile) protected service areas of authorized or previously 
proposed ITFS and MDS stations (incumbents), or at authorized or 
previously proposed ITFS receive sites.
    (e) Unless specifically expected, BTA or PSA authorization holders 
are governed by the interference protection and other technical 
provisions applicable to the Multipoint Distribution Service.
    (f) The calculated free space power flux density from an MDS 
station, other than an incumbent MDS station, may not exceed -73 dBW/m2 
at locations on BTA or PSA boundaries for which there is an unobstructed 
signal path from the transmitting antenna to the boundary, unless the 
applicant has obtained the written consent of the authorization holder 
for the adjoining BTA or PSA.
    (g)(1) Authorization holders for BTAs or PSAs must notify 
authorization holders of adjoining areas of their application filings 
for new or modified stations; provided the proposed facility would 
produce an unobstructed signal path anywhere within the adjoining BTA or 
PSA.
    (2) This service of written notification must include a copy of the 
FCC application and occur on or before the date the application is filed 
with the Commission.
    (3) With regard to incumbent MDS stations, authorization holders for 
BTAs or PSAs must comply with the requirements of Sec. 21.902.
    (h) Where a PSA adjoins a BTA and both authorizations are held by 
the same individual or entity, the PSA shall be considered an extension 
of the protected service area of the BTA regarding the interference 
protection, limiting signal strength, and notification provisions of 
this section.

Sec. 21.951  MDS competitive bidding procedures.

    (a) The following competitive bidding procedures will generally be 
used in MDS auctions. Additional, specific procedures may be set forth 
by public notice. The Commission may also design and test alternative 
procedures. See 47 C.F.R. Secs. 1.2103 and 1.2104.
    (1) Competitive bidding design. Simultaneous multiple round bidding 
will be used in MDS auctions, unless the Commission specifies by public 
notice the use of sequential oral (open outcry) bidding or sealed 
bidding (either sequential or simultaneous). Combinatorial bidding may 
also be used with any type of auction design.
    (2) Competitive bidding mechanisms. The Commission may utilize the 
following mechanisms in MDS auctions:
    (i) Sequencing. The Commission will establish and may vary the 
sequence in which the BTA service areas will be auctioned.
    (ii) Grouping. In the event the Commission uses either a 
simultaneous multiple round competitive bidding design or combinational 
bidding, the Commission will determine which BTA service areas will be 
auctioned simultaneously or in combination.
    (iii) Reservation price. The Commission may establish a reservation 
price, either disclosed or undisclosed, below which a BTA service area 
subject to auction will not be awarded.
    (iv) Minimum bid increments. The Commission will, by announcement 
before or during an MDS auction, require minimum bid increments in 
dollar or percentage terms.
    (v) Stopping rules. The Commission will establish stopping rules 
before or during multiple round MDS auctions in order to terminate an 
auction within a reasonable time.
    (vi) Activity Rules. The Commission will establish activity rules 
which require a minimum amount of bidding activity. In the event that 
the Commission establishes an activity rule in connection with a 
simultaneous multiple round auction, the Commission will allow bidders 
to request and to receive automatically waivers of such rule, the number 
of which will be determined by the Commission.
    (vii) Suggested minimum bid. The Commission may establish suggested 
minimum bids on each BTA service area subject to auction. Bids below the 
suggested minimum bid would count as activity under the activity rule 
only if no bids at or above the suggested minimum bid are received.
    (b) Identities of bidders. The Commission will generally release 
information concerning the identities of bidders before each auction but 
may choose, on an auction-by-auction basis, to withhold the identity of 
the bidders associated with bidder identification numbers. The 
Commission will announce by public notice before the MDS auction where 
the bidders' identities will be revealed.
    (c) Commission control of auction. The Commission may delay, 
suspend, or cancel an MDS auction in the event of a natural disaster, 
technical obstacle, evidence of security breach, unlawful bidding 
activity, administrative necessity, or for any other reason that affects 
the fair and efficient conduct of the competitive bidding. The 
Commission also has the authority, at its sole discretion, to resume the 
competitive bidding starting from the beginning of the current or some 
previous round or cancel the competitive bidding in its entirety.

Sec. 21.952  Bidding application procedures.

    (a) Short-form applications. To participate in MDS auctions, all 
applicants must submit short-form applications, along with all required 
certifications and exhibits specified by such forms, pursuant to the 
provisions of Sec. 1.2105(a) and any Commission public notices. See 47 
CFR 1.2105(a).
    (b) Filing of short-form applications. Prior to any MDS auction, the 
Commission will issue a public notice announcing the availability of BTA 
service areas and, in the event that mutually exclusive short-form 
applications (as defined by Sec. 21.925(a)(2)) are filed,

[[Page 80]]

the date of the auction for those BTA service areas. This public notice 
also will specify the date on or before which applicants intending to 
participate in an MDS auction must file their short-form applications in 
order to be eligible for that auction, and it will contain information 
necessary for completion of the application as well as other important 
information such as the material which must accompany the forms, any 
filing fee that must accompany the application or any upfront payment 
that will need to be submitted, and the location where the application 
must be filed.
    (c) Modification and dismissal of short-form applications.
    (1) Any short-form application that is not signed in some manner or 
form, including by electronic means, and does not contain all requisite 
certifications is unacceptable for filing and cannot be corrected 
subsequent to any applicable filing deadline. Such short-form 
application will be dismissed with prejudice.
    (2) The Commission will provide bidders a limited opportunity to 
cure certain defects specified herein and to resubmit an amended short-
form application. For MDS, we classify all amendments to a short-form 
application as major, except those to correct minor errors or defects, 
such as typographical errors, or those to reflect ownership changes or 
formation of bidding consortia or joint bidding arrangements 
specifically permitted under Sec. 21.953. A short-form application may 
be modified to make minor amendments. However, applicants who fail to 
correct defects in their short-form applications in a timely manner as 
specified by public notice will have their applications dismissed with 
no opportunity for resubmission.
    (3) A short-form application will be considered to be a newly filed 
application if it is amended by a major amendment and may not be 
resubmitted after applicable filing deadlines.

Sec. 21.953  Prohibition of collusion.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this 
section, after the filing of short-form applications, all applicants in 
an MDS auction are prohibited from cooperating, collaborating, 
discussing or disclosing in any manner the substance of their bids or 
bidding strategies, or discussing or negotiating settlement agreements, 
with other applicants until after the winning bidder makes the required 
down payment, unless such applicants are members of a bidding consortium 
or other joint bidding arrangement identified on the applicant's short-
form application. Communications among applicants concerning matters 
unrelated to the MDS auction will be permitted after the filing of 
short-form applications.
    (b) Applicants may modify their short-form applications to reflect 
formation of consortia or changes in ownership at any time before or 
during an auction, provided such changes do not result in a change in 
control of the applicant, and provided that the parties forming 
consortia or entering into ownership agreements have not applied for the 
same BTA service area.
    (c) After the filing of short-form applications, applicants may make 
agreements to bid jointly for BTA service areas, provided the parties to 
the agreement have not applied for the same service areas.
    (d) After the filing of short-form applications, a holder of a non-
controlling attributable interest in an entity submitting a short-form 
application may, under the circumstances specified in Sec. 1.2105(c)(4), 
acquire an ownership interest in, form a consortium with, or enter into 
a joint bidding arrangement with, other applicants for the same BTA 
service areas. See 47 CFR 1.2105(c)(4).
    (e) To reflect the changes in ownership or in the membership of 
consortia or joint bidding arrangements specified in paragraphs (b), (c) 
and (d) of this section, applicants must amend their short-form 
applications by submitting a revised short-form application, filed 
within two business days of any such change; such modifications will not 
be considered major amendments of the applications within the meaning of 
Sec. 21.952(c)(2). However, any amendment which results in the change of 
control of an applicant will be considered a major amendment of the 
short-form.
    (f) For purposes of this section, the terms ``applicant'' and ``bids

<R05>
Sec. 21.954  Submission of up front payments.

    (a) The Commission will require applicants to submit an upfront 
payment prior to the MDS auction. The amount of the upfront payment for 
each BTA service area being auctioned and the procedures for submitting 
it will be set forth in a public notice. Upfront payments may be made by 
wire transfer or by cashier's check drawn in U.S. dollars from a 
financial institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation and must be made payable to the Federal 
Communications Commission. No interest will be paid on upfront payments.
    (b) For MDS auctions, the Commission will require each applicant to 
submit an upfront payment equal to the largest combination of activity 
units (as defined in the Commission's activity rules established 
pursuant to Sec. 21.951(a)(2)(vi)) associated with the BTAs on which the 
applicant anticipates being active in any single round or bidding. 
Applicants who are small businesses eligible for reduced upfront 
payments will be required to submit an upfront payment amount in 
accordance with Sec. 21.960(c). If an upfront payment is not in 
compliance with the Commission's rules, or if insufficient funds are 
tendered to constitute a valid upfront payment, the applicant shall have 
a limited opportunity to correct its submission to bring it up to the 
minimum valid upfront payment prior to the auction. An applicant who 
fails to submit a sufficient upfront payment to qualify it to bid on any 
BTA service area being auctioned will be ineligible to bid, its 
application will be dismissed, and any upfront payment it has made will 
be returned.
    (c) The upfront payment(s) of a bidder will be credited toward any 
down payment required for the BTA service areas on which the bidder is 
the winning bidder. Where the upfront payment amount exceeds the 
required down payment of a winning bidder, the Commission may refund the 
excess amount after determining that no bid withdrawal payments are 
owned by that bidder. In the event a payment is assessed pursuant to 
Sec. 21.959(a) for bid withdrawal or default, upfront payments or down 
payments on deposit with the Commission will be used to satisfy the bid 
withdrawal or default payment before being applied toward any additional 
payment obligations that the winning bidder may have.

[60 FR 36559, July 17, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 21.955  Submission of down payments

    (a) After bidding has ended on all BTA service areas, the Commission 
will identify and notify the winning bidders and declare the bidding 
closed in the MDS auction. Within five (5) business days after being 
notified that it is a winning bidder on a particular BTA service 
area(s), a winning bidder must submit to the Commission's lockbox bank 
such additional funds as are necessary to bring its total deposits 
(upfront payment plus down payment) up to twenty (20) percent of its 
winning bid(s). This down payment may be made by wire transfer or by 
cashier's check in U.S. dollars from a financial institution whose 
deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and 
must be made payable to the Federal Communications Commission.
    (b) Winning bidders who are small businesses eligible for 
installment payments under Sec. 21.960(b) are only required to bring 
their total deposits up to ten (10) percent of their winning bids. Such 
small businesses must pay the remainder of the twenty (20) percent down 
payment within five (5) business days following release of the public 
notice stating that their BTA authorizations are ready to be issued.
    (c) Down payments will be held by the Commission until the winning 
bidder has been issued its BTA authorization and has paid the remaining 
balance of its winning bid, in which case it will not be returned, or 
until the winning bidder is found unqualified to be a station licensee 
or has defaulted, in which case it will be returned, less applicable 
default payments. No interest will be paid on any down payment.

Sec. 21.956  Filing of long-form applications or statements of intention.

    (a)(1) Within 30 business days of being notified of its status as a 
winning bidder, each winning bidder for a BTA service area will be 
required to submit either:
    (i) an initial long-form application for an MDS station license, 
along with any required exhibits; or
    (ii) a statement of intention with regard to the BTA service area, 
along with any required exhibits, showing the encumbered nature of the 
BTA, identifying all previously authorized or proposed MDS and ITFS 
facilities, and describing in detail the winning bidder's plan for 
obtaining the previously authorized and/or proposed MDS stations within 
the BTA.
    (2) A winning bidder that fails to submit either the initial long-
form application or statement of intention as required under this 
section, and fails to establish good cause for any late-filed 
application or statement, shall be deemed to have defaulted and will be 
subject to the payments set forth in Sec. 21.959(a).
    (b) Each initial long-form application for an MDS station license 
within an auction winner's BTA service area, and each statement of 
intention with regard to an auction winner's BTA service area, must also 
include the following:
    (1) FCC Form 430;
    (2) an exhibit detailing the terms and conditions and parties 
involved in any bidding consortia, joint venture, partnership or other 
agreement or arrangement the winning bidder had entered into relating to 
the competitive bidding process prior to the time bidding was completed 
(see 47 CFR 1.207(d));
    (3) an exhibit complying with 47 CFR Secs. 1.2110(i) and 21.960(e), 
if the winning bidder submitting the long-from application or statement 
of intention claims status as a designated entity. (c) Subsequent long-
form applications for additional MDS station licenses within the BTA 
service areas of winning bidders may be submitted at any time during the 
five year build-out period and need not contain the exhibits specified 
in paragraph (b)(2) through (3) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 21.957  Petitions to deny against long-from applications; comments on statements of intention.

    (a) Within thirty (30) days after the Commission gives public notice 
that a long-form application for an MDS station license submitted by a 
winning bidder within its BTA service area has been accepted for filing, 
petitions to deny that application may be filed. Any such petitions and 
oppositions thereto must comply with the requirements of Secs. 47 CFR 
1.2108 and 21.30.
    (b) Parties wishing to comment on or oppose the issuance of a BTA 
authorization issued in connection with the filing of a statement of 
intention by a winning bidder must do so prior to the Commission's 
issuance of the BTA authorization.

<R05>
Sec. 21.958  Full payment and issuance of BTA authorizations.

    Each winning bidder, except for small businesses eligible for 
installment payments under Sec. 21.960(b), must pay the balance of its 
winning bid for its BTA service area(s) in a lump sum within five (5) 
business days following the release of the public notice stating that 
the BTA authorization(s) is ready to be issued. A winning bidder who 
submitted a long-form application for an MDS station license within its 
BTA service area pursuant to Sec. 21.956(a) will receive its BTA 
authorization concurrent with the grant of its MDS conditional station 
license within its BTA service area. A winning bidder who submitted a 
statement of intention with regard to its BTA service area pursuant to 
Sec. 21.956(a) will receive its BTA authorization following the 
Commission's review of its statement of intention. The Commission will 
issue a BTA authorization to a winning bidder within ten (10) business 
days following notification of receipt of full payment of the amount of 
the winning bid.

[60 FR 36559, July 17, 1995]

[[Page 83]]


<R05>
Sec. 21.959  Withdrawal, default and disqualification.

    (a) When the Commission conducts an MDS simultaneous multiple round 
auction, the Commission will impose additional payment requirements on 
bidders who withdraw high bids during the course of an auction, who 
default on down or full payments due after an auction closes, or who are 
disqualified. The withdrawal and default payments set forth below will 
be deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the 
withdrawing, defaulting or disqualified bidder has deposited with the 
Commission.
    (1) Bid withdrawal prior to close of auction. A bidder who withdraws 
a high bid during the course of an auction will be subject to a payment 
equal to the difference between the amount bid and the amount of the 
winning bid the next time the license is offered by the Commission. No 
withdrawal payment will be assessed if the subsequent winning bid 
exceeds the withdrawn bid.
    (2) Default or disqualification after close of auction. If a winning 
bidder defaults or is disqualified after the close of such an auction, 
the defaulting bidder will be subject to the payment in paragraph (1) 
above, plus an additional payment equal to three (3) percent of the 
subsequent winning bid. If the subsequent winning bid exceeds the 
defaulting bidder's bid amount, the three percent payment will be 
calculated based on the defaulting bidder's bid amount.
    (b) If the Commission were to conduct a sequential oral (open 
outcry) auction or sealed bid auction for MDS, the Commission may modify 
the payments set forth in paragraph (a) of this section to be paid in 
the event of bid withdrawal, default or disqualification; provided, 
however, that such payments shall not exceed the payments specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (1) In the case of sealed bidding:
    (i) If a bid is withdrawn before the Commission releases the initial 
public notice announcing the winning bidder(s), no bid withdrawal 
payment will be assessed.
    (ii) If a bid is withdrawn after the Commission release the initial 
public notice announcing the winning bidder(s), the bid withdrawal 
payment will be equal to the difference between the high bid amount and 
the amount of the next highest bid. Losing bidders will only be subject 
to this bid withdrawal payment for a period of thirty (30) days after 
the Commission release the initial public notice announcing the winning 
bidders.
    (2) In the case of oral sequential (open outcry) bidding:
    (i) If a bid is withdrawn before the bidder has declared the bidding 
to be closed for the BTA service area bid on, no bid withdrawal payment 
will be assessed.
    (ii) If a bid is withdrawn after the Commission has declared the 
bidding to be closed for the BTA service area bid on, the bid withdrawal 
payment of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section will apply.
    (c) If a winning bidder withdraws it bid after the Commission has 
declared competitive bidding closed or fails to remit the required down 
payment within five (5) business days after the Commission has declared 
competitive bidding closed, the bidder will be deemed to have defaulted, 
its application will be dismissed, and it will be liable for the default 
payment specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. In such event, 
the Commission may either re-auction the BTA service area to existing or 
new applicants or offer it to the other highest bidders (in descending 
order) at their final bids.
    (d) A winning bidder who is found unqualified to be an MDS station 
licensee, fails to remit the balance of its winning bid in a timely 
manner, or defaults or is disqualified for any reason after having made 
the required down payment, will be deemed to have defaulted and will be 
liable for the payment set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. In 
such event, the Commission will generally conduct another auction for 
the BTA service area, affording new parties an opportunity to file 
applications for such service area.
    (e) Bidders who are found to have violated the antitrust laws or the 
Commission's rules in connection with their participation in the MDS 
competitive bidding process may be subject, in addition to any other 
applicable sanctions, to loss of their upfront payment, down payment or 
full bid

amount, and may be prohibited from participating in future auctions.

[60 FR 36560, July 17, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 21.960  Designated entity provisions for MDS.

    (a) Designated entities. As specified in this section, designated 
entities that are winning bidders for BTA service areas are eligible for 
special incentives in the auction process. See 47 CFR 1.2110.
    (b) Installment payments. Small businesses and small business 
consortia may elect to pay the full amount of their winning bids for BTA 
service areas in installments over a ten (10) year period running from 
the date that their BTA authorizations are issued.
    (1) Each eligible winning bidder paying for its BTA authorization(s) 
on an installment basis must deposit by wire transfer or cashier's check 
in the manner specified in Sec. 21.955 sufficient additional funds as 
are necessary to bring its total deposits to ten (10) percent of its 
winning bid(s) within five (5) business days after the Commission has 
declared it the winning bidder and closed the bidding. Failure to remit 
the required payment will make the bidder liable for the payments set 
forth in Sec. 21.959(a)(2).
    (2) Within five (5) business days following release of the public 
notice stating that the BTA authorization of a winning bidder eligible 
for installment payments is ready to be issued, the winning bidder shall 
pay another ten (10) percent of its winning bid, thereby commencing the 
eligible bidder's installment payment plan. The Commission will issue 
the BTA authorization to the eligible winning bidder within ten (10) 
business days following notification of receipt of this additional ten 
(10) percent payment. Failure to remit the required payment will make 
the bidder liable for the payments set forth in Sec. 21.959(a)(2).
    (3) Upon issuance of a BTA authorization to a winning bidder 
eligible for installment payments, the Commission will notify such 
eligible BTA authorization holder of the terms of its installment 
payment plan. For MDS, such installment payment plans will:
    (i) Impose interest based on the rate of ten (10) year U.S. Treasury 
obligations at the time of issuance of the BTA authorization, plus two 
and one half (2.5) percent;
    (ii) Allow installment payments for a ten (10) year period running 
from the date that the BTA authorization is issued;
    (iii) Begin with interest-only payments for the first two (2) years; 
and
    (iv) Amortize principal and interest over the remaining years of the 
ten (10) year period running from the date that the BTA authorization is 
issued.
    (4) A BTA authorization issued to an eligible winning bidder that 
elects installment payments shall be conditioned upon the full and 
timely performance of the BTA authorization holder's payment obligations 
under the installment plan.
    (i) If an eligible holder making installment payments is more than 
ninety (90) days delinquent in any payment, it shall be in default.
    (ii) Upon default or in anticipation of default of one or more 
installment payments, a holder may request that the Commission permit a 
three (3) to six (6) month grace period, during which no installment 
payments need be made. In considering whether to grant a request for a 
grace period, the Commission may consider, among other things, the 
holder's payment history, including whether the holder has defaulted 
before, how far into the payment period the default occurs, the reasons 
for default, whether the holder has met construction build-out 
requirements within its BTA service area, the holder's financial 
condition, and whether the holder is seeking an eligible buyer. If the 
Commission grants a request for a grace period, or otherwise approves a 
restructured payment schedule, interest will continue to accrue and will 
be amortized over the remaining years of the ten (10) year payment 
period.
    (iii) Following expiration of any grace period without successful 
resumption of payment or upon denial of a grace period request, or upon 
default with no such request submitted, the BTA authorization will 
automatically cancel and the Commission will initiate debt collection 
procedures pursuant to Part 1, Subpart O of the Commission's rules.

[[Page 85]]

    (5) Unjust enrichment. (i) If an eligible BTA authorization holder 
that utilizes installment financing under this paragraph seeks to assign 
or transfer control of its BTA authorization to an entity not meeting 
the eligibility standards for installment payments, the holder must make 
full payment of the remaining unpaid principal and any unpaid interest 
accrued through the date of assignment or transfer as a condition of 
approval. If an eligible BTA authorization holder that utilizes 
installment financing under this subsection seeks to partition, pursuant 
to Sec. 21.931, a portion of its BTA containing one-third or more of the 
population of the area within its control in the licensed BTA to an 
entity not meeting the eligibility standards for installment payments, 
the holder must make full payment of the remaining unpaid principal and 
any unpaid interest accrued through the date of partition as a condition 
of approval.
    (ii) If a BTA authorization holder that utilizes installment 
financing under this subsection seeks to make any change in ownership 
structure that would result in the holder losing eligibility for 
installment payments, the holder shall first seek Commission approval 
and must make full payment of the remaining unpaid principal and any 
unpaid interest accrued through the date of the change in ownership 
structure as a condition of approval. Increases in gross revenues that 
result from revenues from operations, business development or expanded 
service shall not be considered changes in ownership structure under 
this paragraph.
    (c) Reduced upfront payments. A prospective bidder that qualifies as 
a small business, or as a small business consortia, is eligible for a 
twenty-five (25) percent reduction in the amount of the upfront payment 
required by Sec. 21.954. To be eligible to bid on a particular BTA, a 
small business will be required to submit an upfront payment equal to 
seventy-five (75) percent of the upfront payment amount specified for 
that BTA in the public notice listing the upfront payment amounts 
corresponding to each BTA service area being auctioned.
    (d) Bidding credits. A winning bidder that qualifies as a small 
business, or as a small business consortia, may use a bidding credit of 
fifteen (15) percent to lower the cost of its winning bid on any of the 
BTA authorizations awarded in the MDS auction.
    (1) Unjust enrichment. (i) If a BTA authorization holder that 
utilizes a bidding credit under this paragraph seeks to assign or 
transfer control of its BTA authorization to an entity not meeting the 
eligibility standards for bidding credits, the authorization holder must 
reimburse the government for the amount of the bidding credit, plus 
interest at the rate imposed for installment financing at the time the 
authorization was awarded, before assignment or transfer will be 
permitted. If an eligible BTA authorization holder that utilizes a 
bidding credit under this paragraph seeks to partition, pursuant to 
Sec. 21.931, a portion of its BTA containing one-third or more of the 
population of the area within its control in the licensed BTA to an 
entity not meeting the eligibility standards for bidding credits, the 
authorization holder must reimburse the government for the amount of the 
bidding credit, plus interest at the rate imposed for installment 
financing at the time the authorization was awarded, before the 
partitioning will be permitted. The amount of the required reimbursement 
will be reduced over time. An assignment, transfer or partition in the 
first two years after issuance of the BTA authorization will result in a 
reimbursement of one hundred (100) percent of the value of the bidding 
credit; during year three, of seventy-five (75) percent of the bidding 
credit; in year four, of fifty (50) percent; in year five, twenty-five 
(25) percent; and thereafter, no reimbursement.
    (ii) If a BTA authorization holder that utilizes a bidding credit 
under this subsection seeks to make any change in ownership structure 
that would result in the holder losing eligibility for bidding credits, 
the holder shall first seek Commission approval and must reimburse the 
government for the amount of the bidding credit, plus interest at the 
rate imposed for installment financing at the time the authorization was 
awarded, as a condition of approval. The amount of the required 
reimbursement will be reduced over

[[Page 86]]

time. Such a change in ownership structure in the first two years after 
issuance of the BTA authorization will result in the reimbursement of 
one hundred (100) percent of the value of the bidding credit; during 
year three, of seventy-five (75) percent of the bidding credit; in year 
four, of fifty (50) percent; in year five, twenty-five (25) percent; and 
thereafter, no reimbursement. Increases in gross revenues that result 
from revenues from operations, business development or expanded service 
shall not be considered changes in ownership structure under this 
paragraph.
    (e) Short-form application certification; Long-form application or 
statement of intention disclosure. An MDS applicant claiming designated 
entity status shall certify on its short-form application that it is 
eligible for the incentives claimed. A designated entity that is a 
winning bidder for a BTA service area(s) shall, in addition to 
information required by Sec. 21.956(b), file an exhibit to either its 
initial long-form application for an MDS station license, or to its 
statement of intention with regard to the BTA, which discloses the gross 
revenues for each of the past three years of the winning bidder and its 
affiliates. This exhibit shall describe how the winning bidder claiming 
status as a designated entity satisfies the designated entity 
eligibility requirements, and must list and summarize all agreements 
that affect designated entity status, such as partnership agreements, 
shareholder agreements, management agreements and other agreements, 
including oral agreements, which establish that the designated entity 
will have both de facto and de jure control of the entity. See 47 CFR 
1.2110(i).
    (f) Records maintenance. All holders of BTA authorizations acquired 
by auction that claim designated entity status shall maintain, at their 
principal place of business or with their designated agent, an updated 
documentary file of ownership and revenue information necessary to 
establish their status. Holders of BTA authorizations or their 
successors in interest shall maintain such files for a ten (10) year 
period running from the date that their BTA authorizations are issued. 
The files must be made available to the Commission upon request.
    (g) Audits. BTA authorization holders claiming eligibility under 
designated entity provisions shall be subject to audits by the 
Commission, using in-house or contract resources. Selection for an audit 
may be random, on information, or on the basis of other factors. Consent 
to such audits is part of the certification included in the short-form 
application. Such consent shall include consent to the audit of the 
holders' books, documents and other material (including accounting 
procedures and practices), regardless of form or type, sufficient to 
confirm that such holders' representations are, and remain, accurate. 
Such consent shall also include inspection at all reasonable times of 
the facilities, or parts thereof, engaged in providing and transacting 
business or keeping records regarding licensed MDS offerings, and shall 
also include consent to the interviewing of principals, employees, 
customers, and suppliers of the BTA authorization holders.

Sec. 22.105  Written applications, standard forms, microfiche, magnetic disks.

    Except for authorizations granted under the emergency conditions set 
forth in section 308 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 
U.S.C. 308), the FCC may grant authorizations only upon written 
application (FCC Form 401) received by it. A separate written 
application is required for each authorization. Applicants shall submit 
any documents, exhibits, or other written statements of fact that the 
FCC may require in determining whether to grant, deny or dismiss an 
application.

Cellular Radiotelephone Service--the name of the applicant, the city and 
state of the application and the call sign of the station, if the 
application refers to an existing station.
    (ii) For initial applications in the Cellular Radiotelephone 
Service--the name of the applicant, the market name, the market number, 
and the channel block.
    (4) The microfiche copies of opposition and reply pleadings may be 
submitted after the required paper originals, in accordance with 
Sec. 1.45 of this chapter.
    (e) Paper original required. The paper originals of notifications, 
amendments, reports, correspondence and applications, other than initial 
Phase I unserved area applications in the Cellular Radiotelephone 
Service, must be submitted at the same time as the microfiche required 
by paragraph (d) of this section. The paper originals of initial Phase I 
unserved area applications selected in random selection processes must 
be submitted 7 days after the release of the public notice announcing 
the tentative selectee. The paper originals of opposition and reply 
pleadings must be submitted within the time frames established by 
Sec. 1.45 of this chapter. Each paper original must be stamped 
``ORIGINAL'' on the top page. In addition to the paper original, paper 
copies of pleadings must be submitted as required by Sec. 1.51 of this 
chapter.
    (f) Correspondence. Correspondence concerning a submitted 
application must clearly identify the name of the filer, nature of the

<R05>
Sec. 22.106  Filing fees; place.

    Applications, amendments, notifications and other filings must be 
submitted to the FCC at the appropriate address, with the appropriate 
filing fee. The fee amounts and addresses are listed in part 1, subpart 
G of this chapter (Sec. 1.1105 in particular), and in the publication 
``Common Carrier Services Fee Filing Guide'' which is available from the 
Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554.


<R05>
Sec. 22.107  General application requirements.

    In general, applications for authorizations, assignments of 
authorizations, or consent to transfer of control of licensees in the 
Public Mobile Services must:
    (a) Demonstrate the applicant's qualifications to hold an 
authorization in the Public Mobile services;
    (b) State how a grant would serve the public interest, convenience, 
and necessity;
    (c) Contain all information required by FCC rules or application 
forms;
    (d) Propose operation of a facility in compliance with all rules 
governing the Public Mobile service;
    (e) Be amended as necessary to remain substantially accurate and 
complete in all significant respects, in accordance with the provisions 
of Sec. 1.65 of this chapter; and,
    (f) Be signed in accordance with Sec. 1.743 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 22.108   Parties to applications.

    Each application for an authorization, assignment of authorization, 
or for consent to transfer of control in the Public Mobile Service must 
disclose fully the real party or parties in interest to the application. 
Such disclosure must include:
    (a) A list of the applicant's subsidiaries, if any. For the purposes 
of this section, a subsidiary is any business for which the applicant or 
any officer, director, stockholder or key manager of the applicant owns 
5% or more of the stock, warrants, options or debt securities. This list 
must include a description of each subsidiary's principal business and 
relationship to the applicant.
    (b) A list of the applicant's affiliates, if any. For the purposes 
of this section, an affiliate is:
    (1) Any business that holds a 5% or more interest in the applicant; 
or,
    (2) Any business in which a 5% or more interest is held by a 
business that also holds a 5% or more interest in the applicant.
    (c) A list of the names, addresses, citizenship and principal 
business of any person holding 5% or more of each class of stock, 
warrants, options or debt securities of the applicant, indicating the 
amount and percentage held, and providing the name, address, citizenship 
and principal place of business of any person, if other than the holder, 
for whose benefit such interest is held. If any such persons are related 
by blood or marriage, the relationship must be disclosed.
    (d) For initial cellular applications, the name and address of each 
partner, his or her citizenship and the share or interest participation 
in the partnership. This information must be provided for all partners, 
regardless of their respective ownership interests in the partnership. A 
signed and dated copy of the partnership agreement must be included in 
the application. See Sec. 22.953(a)(5)(v).


<R05>
Sec. 22.115   Content of applications.

    Applications must contain all applicable information requested on 
the standard form and any additional information required by the rules 
in this part.
    (a) The following requirements are common to all Public Mobile 
Services:
    (1) Site availability. At the time of filing, applicants must have 
obtained reasonable assurance that all antenna sites specified in their 
applications are available for the proposed use.
    (2) Antenna structure registration. Applications proposing the use 
of one or more new or existing antenna structures must contain the FCC 
Antenna Structure Registration Number, if assigned, of each such antenna 
structure for which Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) notification 
is or was required by part 17 of this chapter prior to its construction. 
If, at the time an application is filed, an FCC Antenna Structure 
Registration Number has not

[[Page 98]]

been assigned for any such antenna structure, the applicant must 
indicate in the application whether or not, as of the date the 
application is filed, the antenna structure owner has registered the 
antenna structure with the FCC in accordance with part 17 of this 
chapter.
    (3) FAA notification. Before constructing a new antenna structure or 
increasing the height of an existing structure, an antenna structure 
owner may be required to obtain an FAA determination of No Hazard to Air 
Navigation. To obtain this determination, the FAA must be notified of 
the planned construction or alteration. Criteria used to determine 
whether FAA notification is required for any particular antenna 
structure are contained in part 17 of this chapter.
    (i) Applications proposing to use a new antenna structure or an 
existing antenna structure for which the height is increased must 
indicate whether FAA notification is required by part 17 of this 
chapter.
    (ii) If FAA notification is required by part 17 of this chapter, a 
copy of the FAA determination should be included in the application. 
However, if the FAA determination is not available at the time the 
application is filed, the application must include the following 
information in regard to the FAA notification: the name of the person 
that submitted the notification, the date the notification was 
submitted, and the location of the FAA office to which the notification 
was submitted.
    (iii) If FAA notification is not required by part 17 of this 
chapter, the application must indicate such and, unless the reason 
therefor is obvious (e.g. antenna structure height is less than 6.10 
meters above ground level), must contain a statement explaining why FAA 
notification is not required.
    (4) Antenna locations. Applications for stations at fixed locations 
must describe each transmitting antenna site by its geographical 
coordinates and also by its street address, or by reference to a nearby 
landmark. Geographical coordinates must be specified in degrees, 
minutes, and seconds to the nearest second of latitude and longitude.

    Note to paragraph (a)(4) of Sec. 22.115: The FAA has announced that 
effective October 15, 1992, it will use geographic coordinates based on 
the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83). Until further notice, however, 
the FCC will continue to use geographical coordinates based the 1927 
North American Datum (NAD27). Applicants may supply geographical 
coordinates based on NAD83 in addition to those required (NAD27).

    (5) Environmental concerns. Each applicant is required to indicate 
at the time its application is filed whether or not an FCC grant of the 
application may have a significant environmental effect, as defined by 
Sec. 1.1307 of this chapter. If answered affirmatively, an Environmental 
Assessment, required by Sec. 1.1311 of this chapter, must be filed with 
the application and environmental review by the FCC must be completed 
prior to construction.
    (b) Reference to material on file. Questions on application forms 
that call for specific technical data, or that can be answered yes or no 
or with another short answer, must be answered on the form. Otherwise, 
if documents, exhibits, or other lengthy showings already on file with 
the FCC contain information required in an application, the application 
may incorporate such information by reference, provided that:
    (1) The reference information comprises more than one 8\1/2\'' x 
11'' page and is current and accurate in all material respects; and,
    (2) The reference states specifically where the referenced 
information can actually be found, including:
    (i) The station call sign or application file number, if the 
reference is to station files or previously filed applications;
    (ii) The title of the proceeding, the docket number, and any legal 
citations, if the reference is to a docketed proceeding.
    (c) Service specific requirements. Applications for authorization in 
the Cellular Radiotelephone Service must contain specific information as 
required by Sec. 22.929 and Sec. 22.953. Applications for authorization 
in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service must contain specific 
information as required by Sec. 22.529, Sec. 22.559 and Sec. 22.589. 
Applications for authorization in the Rural Radiotelephone Service must 
contain the information required by Sec. 22.709. Applications for 
authorization in the Offshore

[[Page 99]]

Radio Service must contain the information required by Sec. 22.1037. 
Applications for authorization in the Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service 
must contain specific information as required by Sec. 22.803 and 
Sec. 22.875, as appropriate.

[59 FR 59507, Nov. 17, 1994, as amended at 59 FR 59954, Nov. 21, 1994; 
61 FR 4365, Feb. 6, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 22.117  Content of notifications.

    Notifications must contain all applicable information requested on 
the standard form and any additional information required by the rules 
in this part. See Secs. 22.124, 22.137, 22.142, 22.163, 22.165, 22.941, 
and 22.946.


<R05>
Sec. 22.119  Requests for rule waivers.

    The FCC may waive the requirements of rules in this part on its own 
motion or upon written request.
    (a) Requests for waiver of rules must contain a complete explanation 
as to why the waiver is desired. The FCC may grant a request for waiver 
if it is shown that:
    (1) The underlying purpose of the rule(s) would not be served or 
would be frustrated by application to the instant case, and that a grant 
of the requested waiver would be in the public interest; or
    (2) In view of unique or unusual factual circumstances of the 
instant case, application of the rule(s) would be inequitable, unduly 
burdensome or contrary to the public interest, or that the applicant has 
no reasonable alternative.
    (b) The FCC, in its discretion, may give public notice of the filing 
of a waiver request and seek comment from the public or affected 
parties.
    (c) Denial of a rule waiver request associated with an application 
renders that application defective unless it contains an alternative 
proposal that fully complies with the rules, in which event the 
application is processed using the alternative proposal as if the waiver 
had not been requested. Applications rendered defective may be dismissed 
without prejudice.


<R05>
Sec. 22.120  Application processing; initial procedures.

    This section contains rules governing the initial processing of 
applications for authority to operate a station in the Public Mobile 
Services.
    (a) File numbers. Applications received by the FCC are assigned file 
numbers. Assignment of a file number to an application is for 
administrative convenience and does not constitute a determination that 
the application is acceptable for filing. Assignment of a file number 
does not preclude the subsequent return or dismissal of an application. 
For administrative efficiency, the FCC, in its discretion, occasionally 
consolidates separate applications filed simultaneously by the same 
applicant into a single application (with one file number) and splits 
applications comprising two or more severable proposals into separate 
applications (with different file numbers).
    (b) Received date. The FCC records the date on which each 
application is received. This date is used to determine compliance with 
applicable cut-off dates or filing windows and for other purposes.
    (c) Initial review for completeness (prescreening). Each application 
is reviewed for completeness. The purpose of this initial review is to 
identify applications that are defective in an obvious way (e.g. not 
signed, missing pages, improper or missing fee payment). Applications 
found to be defective in this review are unacceptable for filing and may 
be returned to the applicant with a brief statement indicating the 
nature of the defect(s) found. Applications for which no obvious defects 
are discovered in the initial review are acceptable for filing.
    (d) Public notice; acceptance for filing. The FCC periodically 
issues Public Notices that list applications that are acceptable for 
filing. The listing of an application on a Public Notice as acceptable 
for filing provides notices to the public that the application has been 
filed; it does not preclude dismissal of the application if it is 
subsequently found to be defective or otherwise subject to dismissal 
under Sec. 22.128.

[[Page 100]]


<R05>
Sec. 22.121  Repetitious, inconsistent or conflicting applications.

    Repetitious, inconsistent or conflicting applications are not 
accepted for filing by the FCC. Unless the FCC in a particular case 
determines otherwise, such applications are not returned to the 
applicant.
    (a) While an application is pending, any subsequent inconsistent or 
conflicting application submitted by, on behalf of, or for the benefit 
of the same applicant, its successor or assignee will not be accepted 
for filing.
    (b) If an applicant has been afforded an opportunity for a hearing 
with respect to an application for a new station or an enlargement of 
service area, and the FCC has, after hearing or default, denied the 
application or dismissed it with prejudice, the FCC will not consider a 
like application for service of the same type to the same area by that 
applicant, or by its successor or assignee, or on behalf of or for the 
benefit of the parties in interest to the original application, until 
one year after the effective date of the FCC's action on the original 
application.
    (c) If an appeal has been taken from the action of the FCC denying a 
particular application, a like application for service of the same type 
to the same area, in whole or in part, filed by that applicant or by its 
successor or assignee, or on behalf or for the benefit of the parties in 
interest to the original application, will not be considered until the 
final disposition of such appeal.
    (d) If an authorization is automatically terminated because of 
failure to commence service to subscribers (see Sec. 22.144), the FCC 
will not consider an application for another authorization to operate a 
station on the same channel in the same geographical area by that party, 
or by its successor or assignee, or on behalf of or for the benefit of 
the parties in interest to the terminated authorization, until one year 
after the date the authorization terminated. This paragraph does not 
apply to authorizations in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service.

[59 FR 59507, Nov. 17, 1994; 59 FR 64856, Dec. 16, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 22.122  Amendment of applications.

    Pending applications may be amended as a matter of right if they 
have not been designated for hearing or listed in a Public Notice for a 
random selection or competitive bidding process, except as provided in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and in Sec. 22.949.
    (a) If a petition to deny or other formal objection has been filed, 
a copy of any amendment (or other filing) must be served on the 
petitioner. If the FCC has issued a Public Notice stating that the 
application appears to be mutually exclusive with another application 
(or applications), a copy of any amendment (or other filing) must be 
served on any such mutually exclusive applicant (or applicants).
    (b) Amendments to applications that resolve mutual exclusivity may 
be filed at any time, subject to the requirements of Sec. 22.129.
    (c) Amendments to applications designated for hearing may be allowed 
by the presiding officer and amendments to applications selected in a 
random selection process may be allowed by the FCC for good cause shown. 
In such instances, a written petition demonstrating good cause must be 
submitted and served upon the parties of record.


<R05>
Sec. 22.123  Classification of filings as major or minor.

    Applications and amendments to applications are classified as major 
or minor. Categories of major and minor filings are listed in section 
309 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 U.S.C. 309). In 
general, a major filing is a request for an FCC action that has the 
potential to affect parties other than the applicant. Filings are minor 
if they are not classified as major.
    (a) Ownership or control change. Filings are major if they specify a 
substantial change in beneficial ownership or control (de jure or de 
facto), unless such change is involuntary or if the filing merely amends 
an application to reflect a change in ownership or control that has 
already been approved by the FCC.
    (b) Developmental. Applications are major if they request a 
developmental authorization pursuant to Sec. 22.409, or a

[[Page 101]]

regular authorization for facilities operating under a developmental 
authorization.
    (c) Renewal. Applications of renewal of authorizations are major.
    (d) Environmental. Filings are major if they request authorization 
for a facility that would have a significant environmental effect, as 
defined by Secs. 1.1301 through 1.1319 of this chapter.
    (e) Paging and Radiotelephone Service. In the Paging and 
Radiotelephone Service, filings are major if they:
    (1) Request an authorization that would establish for the filer a 
new service area or fixed transmission path on a request channel;
    (2) Request an authorization that would extend the service area of 
an existing station to include area not served by station(s) authorized 
to the filer on a requested channel;
    (3) Request an authorization that would extend the interfering 
contours of an existing station beyond the composite interfering 
contours of station(s) authorized to the filer on a request channel;
    (4) Request an authorization that would increase the effective 
radiated power or antenna height above average terrain in any azimuth 
from an existing fixed transmitter authorized to the filer;
    (5) Request an authorization that would relocate an existing fixed 
transmitter;
    (6) Amend a pending application to change a requested channel;
    (7) Amend a pending application in a way that would extend the 
service area of a station on a requested channel to include area that--
    (i) Would not have been served by that station as previously 
proposed in the application and--
    (ii) Is not already served by the station on the requested channel;
    (8) Amend a pending application in a way that would extend the 
interfering contours of a station on a requested channel beyond--
    (i) The composite interfering contours of that station as previously 
proposed in the application and--
    (ii) The composite interfering contours of any other stations 
authorized to the filer on a requested channel;
    (9) Amend a pending application to increase the proposed effective 
radiated power or antenna height above average terrain in any azimuth of

clearly demonstrated (e.g. by reference to other parts of the 
application) to be mistakes, and whose discovery and correction does not 
change information previously listed in a Public Notice.


<R05>
Sec. 22.124  Notification processing.

    This section contains rules governing the processing of 
notifications (filed on FCC Form 489) in the Public Mobile Services.
    (a) File numbers. Notifications received by the FCC are assigned 
file numbers. Assignment of a file number to a notification is for 
administrative convenience and does not constitute a determination that 
the notified action has been examined and not rejected by the FCC. 
Assignment of a file number does not preclude the return of a 
notification subsequently found to be defective.
    (b) Defective notifications. A notification is defective if:
    (1) It is unsigned or incomplete with respect to required answers to 
questions, informational showings, or other matters of a formal 
character;
    (2) It notifies of an action that does not comply with one or more 
of the FCC rules;
    (3) It notifies of an action for which an application for 
authorization is required;
    (4) It is submitted without the required microfiche; or,
    (5) It is untimely filed.
    (c) Review. After a file number is assigned, each notification is 
reviewed. The purpose of this review is to identify notifications that 
are unacceptable (e.g. not signed, missing pages, improper or missing 
fee payment). Notifications found to be unacceptable may be returned to 
the licensee with a brief statement describing the deficiency. If a 
notification is found to be unacceptable, the FCC may direct the 
licensee to return the station to compliance with its previous license 
terms. Acceptable notifications are added to the appropriate station 
files.


<R05>
Sec. 22.125  Application for special temporary authorizations.

    In circumstances requiring immediate or temporary use of Public 
Mobile Services stations, carriers may request special temporary 
authority (STA) to operate new or modified

[[Page 103]]

equipment. Such requests may be submitted as informal applications (see 
Sec. 22.105) and must contain complete details about the proposed 
operation and the circumstances that fully justify and necessitate the 
grant of STA. Such requests should be filed in time to be received by 
the FCC at least 10 days prior to the date of proposed operation or, 
where an extension is sought, 10 days prior to the expiration date of 
the existing STA. Requests received less than 10 days prior to the 
desired date of operation may be given expedited considerations only if 
compelling reasons are given, in writing, for the delay in submitting 
the request. Otherwise, such late-filed requests are considered in turn, 
but action might not be taken prior to the desired date of operation. 
Requests for STAs must be accompanied by the proper filing fee.
    (a) Grant without Public Notice. STAs may be granted without being 
listed in a Public Notice, or prior to 30 days after such listing, if:
    (1) The STA is to be valid for 30 days or less and the applicant 
does not plan to file an application for regular authorization of the 
subject operation;
    (2) The STA is to be valid for 60 days or less, pending the filing 
of an application for regular authorization of the subject operation;
    (3) The STA is to allow interim operation to facilitate completion 
of authorized construction or to provide substantially the same service 
as previously authorized; or
    (4) The STA is made upon a finding that there are extraordinary 
circumstances requiring operation in the public interest and that delay 
in the institution of such service would seriously prejudice the public 
interest.
    (b) Limit on STA term. The FCC may grant STAs valid for a period not 
to exceed 180 days under the provisions of Sec. 309(f) of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, (47 U.S.C. 309(f)) if 
extraordinary circumstances so require, and pending the filing of an 
application for regular operation. The FCC may grant extensions of STAs 
for a period of 180 days, but the applicant must show that extraordinary 
circumstances warrant such an extension.


<R05>
Sec. 22.127  Public notices.

    Periodically, the FCC issues Public Notices listing major filings 
and other information of public significance. Categories of Public 
Notice listings are as follows:
    (a) Accepted for filing. Acceptance for filing of applications and 
major amendments thereto.
    (b) Actions. FCC actions on pending applications previously listed 
as accepted for filing.
    (c) Informative listings. Information that the FCC, in its 
discretion, believes to be of public significance. Such listings do not 
create any rights to file oppositions or other pleadings.


<R05>
Sec. 22.128  Dismissal of applications.

    The FCC may dismiss any application for authorization, assignment of 
authorization, or consent to transfer of control in the Public Mobile 
Services, upon request by the applicant, or if the application is 
untimely filed, or if the application is mutually exclusive with another 
application that is selected or granted in accordance with the rules in 
this part, or for failure to prosecute, or if the requested spectrum is 
not available, or if the application is found to be defective. Such 
dismissal may be ``without prejudice,'' meaning that the FCC may accept 
from the applicant another application for the same purpose at any later 
time, or ``with prejudice,'' meaning that the FCC will not accept from 
the applicant another application for the same purpose for a period of 
one year. Unless otherwise provided in this part, a dismissed 
application will not be returned to the applicant.
    (a) Dismissal at request of applicant. Any applicant may request 
that its application be returned or dismissed. A request for the return 
of an application after it has been listed on Public Notice as 
tentatively accepted for filing is considered to be a request for 
dismissal of that application without prejudice.
    (1) If the applicant requests dismissal of its application with 
prejudice, the FCC will dismiss that application with prejudice.
    (2) If the applicant requests dismissal of its application without 
prejudice, the FCC will dismiss that application without prejudice, 
unless:

[[Page 104]]

    (i) It has been designated for comparative hearing;
    (ii) It has been selected in a random selection process; or,
    (iii) It is an application for which the applicant submitted the 
winning bid in a competitive bidding process.
    (3) If the applicant requests dismissal of its application for which 
it submitted the winning bid in a competitive bidding process, the FCC 
will dismiss that application with prejudice. If the applicant requests 
dismissal of its application after that application has been designated 
for comparative hearing or selected in a random selection process, it 
may submit a written petition requesting that the dismissal be without 
prejudice. Such petition must demonstrate good cause and comply with 
Sec. 22.129 and be served upon all parties of record. The FCC may grant 
such petition and dismiss the application without prejudice or deny the 
petition and dismiss the application with prejudice.
    (b) Dismissal of mutually exclusive applications not granted. The 
FCC may dismiss mutually exclusive applications:
    (1) For which the applicant did not submit the winning bid in a 
competitive bidding process;
    (2) That are included in a random selection process but are not 
granted; or,
    (3) That receive comparative consideration in a hearing but are not 
granted by order of the presiding officer.
    (c) Dismissal for failure to prosecute. The FCC may dismiss 
applications for failure of the applicant to prosecute or for failure of 
the applicant to respond substantially within a specified time period to 
official correspondence or requests for additional information. Such 
dismissal will generally be without prejudice if the failure to 
prosecute or respond occurred prior to designation of the application 
for comparative hearing or prior to selection of the application in a 
random selection process, but may be with prejudice in cases of non-
compliance with Sec. 22.129. Dismissal will generally be with prejudice 
if the failure to prosecute or respond occurred after designation of the 
application for comparative hearing or after selection of the 
application in a random selection process. The FCC may dismiss 
applications with prejudice for failure of the applicant to comply with 
requirements related to a competitive bidding process.
    (d) Dismissal as defective. The FCC may dismiss without prejudice 
applications that it finds to be defective. Applications for 
authorization or assignment of authorization are defective if:
    (1) They are unsigned or incomplete with respect to required answers 
to questions, informational showings, or other matters of a formal 
character; or,
    (2) They request an authorization that would not comply with one or 
more of the FCC rules and do not contain a request for waiver of these 
rule(s), or in the event that the FCC denies such a waiver request, do 
not contain an alternative proposal that fully complies with the rules;
    (e) Dismissal because spectrum not available. The FCC may dismiss 
applications that request spectrum which is unavailable because:
    (1) It is not allocated for assignment in the Public Mobile Services 
(see Part 2 of this chapter);
    (2) It was previously assigned to another licensee on an exclusive 
basis or cannot be assigned to the applicant without causing 
interference; or
    (3) Reasonable efforts have been made to coordinate the proposed 
facility with foreign administrations under applicable international 
agreements, and an unfavorable response (harmful interference 
anticipated) has been received.
    (f) Dismissal as untimely. The FCC may dismiss without prejudice 
applications that are prematurely or late filed, including applications 
filed prior to the opening date or after the closing date of a filing 
window, or after the cut-off date for a mutually exclusive application 
filing group.


<R05>
Sec. 22.129  Agreements to dismiss applications, amendments or pleadings.

    Parties that have filed an application in the Public Mobile Services 
that is mutually exclusive with one or more other applications, and then 
enter into an agreement to resolve the mutual exclusivity by withdrawing 
or requesting dismissal of the application or an amendment thereto, must 
obtain the approval of the FCC. Parties that have

[[Page 105]]

filed or threatened to file a petition to deny, informal objection or 
other pleading against a pending application in the Public Mobile 
Services and then seek to withdraw or request dismissal of, or refrain 
from filing, the petition, either unilaterally or in exchange for a 
financial consideration, must obtain the approval of the FCC.
    (a) The party withdrawing or requesting dismissal of its 
application, petition to deny, informal objection or other pleading or 
refraining from filing a pleading must submit to the FCC a request for 
approval of the withdrawal or dismissal, a copy of any written agreement 
related to the withdrawal or dismissal, and an affidavit setting forth:
    (1) A certification that neither the party nor its principals has 
received or will receive any money or other consideration in excess of 
the legitimate and prudent expenses incurred in preparing and 
prosecuting the application, petition to deny, informal objection or 
other pleading in exchange for the withdrawal or dismissal of the 
application, petition to deny, informal objection or other pleading, or 
threat to file a pleading, except that this provision does not apply to 
dismissal or withdrawal of applications pursuant to bona fide merger 
agreements;
    (2) The exact nature and amount of any consideration received or 
promised;
    (3) An itemized accounting of the expenses for which it seeks 
reimbursement; and
    (4) The terms of any oral agreement related to the withdrawal or 
dismissal of the application, petition to deny, informal objection or 
other pleading or threat to file a pleading.
    (b) In addition, within 5 days of the filing date of the applicant's 
or petitioner's request for approval, each remaining party to any 
written or oral agreement must submit an affidavit setting forth:
    (1) A certification that neither the applicant nor its principals 
has paid or will pay money or other consideration in excess of the 
legitimate and prudent expenses of the petitioner in exchange for 
withdrawing or dismissing the application, petition to deny, informal 
objection or other pleading; and
    (2) The terms of any oral agreement relating to the withdrawal or 
dismissal of the application, petition to deny, informal objection or 
other pleading.
    (c) No person shall make or receive any payments in exchange for 
withdrawing a threat to file or refraining from filing a petition to 
deny, informal objection, or any other pleading against an application. 
For the purposes of this section, reimbursement by an applicant of the 
legitimate and prudent expenses of a potential petitioner or objector, 
incurred reasonably and directly in preparing to file a petition to 
deny, will not be considered to be payment for refraining from filing a 
petition to deny or an informal objection. Payments made directly to a 
potential petitioner or objector, or a person related to a potential 
petitioner or objector, to implement non-financial promises are 
prohibited unless specifically approved by the FCC.
    (d) For the purposes of this section:
    (1) Affidavits filed pursuant to this section must be executed by 
the filing party, if an individual, a partner having personal knowledge 
of the facts, if a partnership, or an officer having personal knowledge 
of the facts, if a corporation or association.
    (2) Applications, petitions to deny, informal objections and other 
pleadings are deemed to be pending before the FCC from the time the 
application or petition to deny is filed with the FCC until such time as 
an order of the FCC granting, denying or dismissing the application, 
petition to deny, informal objection or other pleading is no longer 
subject to reconsideration by the FCC or to review by any court.
    (3) ``Legitimate and prudent expenses'' are those expenses 
reasonably incurred by a party in preparing to file, filing, prosecuting 
and/or settling its application, petition to deny, informal objection or 
other pleading for which reimbursement is sought.
    (4) ``Other consideration'' consists of financial concessions, 
including, but not limited to, the transfer of assets or the provision 
of tangible pecuniary benefit, as well as non-financial concessions that 
confer any type of benefit on the recipient.

<R05>
Sec. 22.130  Petitions to deny, responsive pleadings.

    Petitions to deny any major filing may be filed by parties able to 
demonstrate standing to file such petitions. Responsive pleadings to 
such petitions may be filed in accordance with the provisions of this 
section.
    (a) Content and requirements. Petitions to deny and responsive 
pleadings must:
    (1) Clearly identify the pertinent major filing(s);
    (2) Comply with all applicable requirements of Sec. 1.41 through 
Sec. 1.52 of this chapter;
    (3) Contain specific allegations of fact which, except for facts of 
which official notice may be taken, are supported by affidavit of a 
person or persons with personal knowledge thereof, and which are 
sufficient to demonstrate that the petitioner (or respondent) is a party 
in interest and that a grant or other FCC action regarding the major 
filing would be inconsistent with the public interest;
    (4) Be filed within 30 days after the date of the Public Notice 
listing the major filing; and.
    (5) Contain a certificate of service showing that a copy has been 
mailed to the applicant no later than the date of filing with the FCC.
    (b) Expansion. Petitions to deny a major amendment to an application 
may raise only matters directly related to the major amendment that 
could not have been raised in connection with the application as 
originally filed. This paragraph does not apply to petitioners who gain 
standing because of the major amendment.
    (c) Dismissal. The FCC may, by letter, dismiss any petition to deny 
a major filing if the petition does not comply with the requirements of 
this section, if the issues raised become moot, or if the petitioner or 
his/her attorney fails to appear at a settlement conference pursuant to 
Sec. 22.135. The reason(s) for the dismissal are stated in the letter. 
When a petition to deny is dismissed, any related responsive pleadings 
are also dismissed.


<R05>
Sec. 22.131  Procedures for mutually exclusive applications.

    Two or more pending applications are mutually exclusive if the grant 
of one application would effectively preclude the grant of one or more 
of the others under Commission rules governing the Public Mobile 
Services involved. The Commission uses the general procedures in this 
section for processing mutually exclusive applications in the Public 
Mobile Services. Additional specific procedures are prescribed in the 
subparts of this part governing the individual Public Mobile Services 
(see Secs. 22.509, 22.717, and 22.949) and in part 1 of this chapter.
    (a) Separate applications. Any applicant that files an application 
knowing that it will be mutually exclusive with one or more applications 
should not include in the mutually exclusive application a request for 
other channels or facilities that would not, by themselves, render the 
application mutually exclusive with those other applications. Instead, 
the request for such other channels or facilities should be filed in a 
separate application.
    (b) Filing groups. Pending mutually exclusive applications are 
processed in filing groups. Mutually exclusive applications in a filing 
group are given concurrent consideration. The Commission may dismiss as 
defective (pursuant to Sec. 22.128) any mutually exclusive 
application(s) whose filing date is outside of the date range for 
inclusion in the filing group. The types of filing groups used in day-
to-day application processing are specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section. A filing group is one of the following types:
    (1) Renewal filing group. A renewal filing group comprises a timely-
filed application for renewal of an authorization and all timely-filed 
mutually exclusive competing applications (see Sec. 22.145).
    (2) Same-day filing group. A same-day filing group comprises all 
mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is the same day, which 
is normally the filing date of the first-filed application(s).
    (3) Thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group. A 30-day notice and 
cut-off filing group comprises mutually exclusive applications whose 
filing date is no

[[Page 107]]

later than thirty (30) days after the date of the Public Notice listing 
the first-filed application(s) (according to the filing dates) as 
acceptable for filing.
    (4) Window filing group. A window filing group comprises mutually 
exclusive applications whose filing date is within an announced filing 
window. An announced filing window is a period of time between and 
including two specific dates, which are the first and last dates on 
which applications (or amendments) for a particular purpose may be 
accepted for filing. In the case of a one-day window, the two dates are 
the same. The dates are made known to the public in advance.
    (c) Procedures. Generally, the Commission may grant one application 
in a filing group of mutually exclusive applications and dismiss the 
other application(s) in the filing group that are excluded by that 
grant, pursuant to Sec. 22.128.
    (1) Selection methods. In selecting the application to grant, the 
Commission may use competitive bidding, random selection, or comparative 
hearings, depending upon the type of applications involved.
    (2) Dismissal of applications. The Commission may dismiss any 
application in a filing group that is defective or otherwise subject to 
dismissal under Sec. 22.128, either before or after employing selection 
procedures.
    (3) Type of filing group used. Except as otherwise provided in this 
part, the type of filing group used in the processing of two or more 
mutually exclusive applications depends upon the purpose(s) of the 
applications.
    (i) If one of the mutually exclusive applications is a timely-filed 
application for renewal of an authorization, a renewal filing group is 
used.
    (ii) If any mutually exclusive application filed on the earliest 
filing date is an application for modification and none of the mutually 
exclusive applications is a timely-filed application for renewal, a 
same-day filing group is used.
    (iii) If all of the mutually exclusive applications filed on the 
earliest filing date are applications for initial authorization, a 30-
day notice and cut-off filing group is used, except that, for Phase I 
unserved area applications in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service, a 
one-day window filing group is used (see Sec. 22.949).
    (4) Disposition. If there is only one application in any type of 
filing group, the Commission may grant that application and dismiss 
without prejudice any mutually exclusive applications not in the filing 
group. If there is more than one mutually exclusive application in a 
filing group, the Commission disposes of these applications as follows:
    (i) Applications in a renewal filing group. All mutually exclusive 
applications in a renewal filing group are designated for comparative 
consideration in a hearing.
    (ii) Applications in a 30-day notice and cut-off filing group.
    (A) If all of the mutually exclusive applications in a 30-day notice 
and cut-off filing group are applications for initial authorization, and 
none is an application for facilities in the Rural Radiotelephone 
Service, the Commission shall administer competitive bidding procedures 
in accordance with subpart Q of part 1 of this chapter. After such 
procedures, the application of the successful bidder may be granted and 
the other applications may be dismissed without prejudice.
    (B) If any of the mutually exclusive applications in a 30-day notice 
and cut-off filing group is an application for modification or an 
application for facilities in the Rural Radiotelephone Service, the 
Commission may attempt to resolve the mutual exclusivity by facilitating 
a settlement between the applicants. If a settlement is not reached 
within a reasonable time, the Commission may designate all applications 
in the filing group for comparative consideration in a hearing. In this 
event, the result of the hearing disposes of all the applications in the 
filing group.
    (iii) Applications in a same-day filing group. If there are two or 
more mutually exclusive applications in a same-day filing group, the 
Commission may attempt to resolve the mutual exclusivity by facilitating 
a settlement between the applicants. If a settlement is not reached 
within a reasonable time,

[[Page 108]]

the Commission may designate all applications in the filing group for 
comparative consideration in a hearing. In this event, the result of the 
hearing disposes of all of the applications in the filing group.
    (iv) Applications in a window filing group. Applications in a window 
filing group are processed in accordance with the procedures for a 30-
day notice and cut-off filing group in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this 
section.
    (d) Terminology. For the purposes of this section, terms have the 
following meanings:
    (1) The filing date of an application is the date on which that 
application was received in a condition acceptable for filing or the 
date on which the most recently filed major amendment to that 
application was received, whichever is later, excluding major amendments 
in the following circumstances:
    (i) The major amendment reflects only a change in ownership or 
control found by the Commission to be in the public interest;
    (ii) The major amendment as received is defective or otherwise found 
unacceptable for filing; or
    (iii) The application being amended has been designated for hearing 
and the Commission or the presiding officer accepts the major amendment.
    (2) An application for initial authorization is:
    (i) Any application requesting an authorization for a new system or 
station;
    (ii) Any application requesting authorization for an existing 
station to operate on an additional channel, unless the additional 
channel is for paired two-way radiotelephone operation, is in the same 
frequency range as the existing channel(s), and will be operationally 
integrated with the existing channel(s) such as by trunking;
    (iii) Any application requesting authorization for a new transmitter 
at a location more than 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from any existing 
transmitters of the applicant licensee on the requested channel or 
channel block; or
    (iv) Any application to expand the CGSA of a cellular system (as 
defined in Sec. 22.911), except during the five-year build-out period.
    (3) An application for modification is any application other than an 
application for initial authorization or renewal.

[59 FR 59954, Nov. 21, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 22.132  Grant of applications.

    Applications for authorization may be granted thirty days after the 
issuance date of a Public Notice listing an application or the latest 
filed major amendment thereto as acceptable for filing.
    (a) Criteria for grants. The FCC grants applications without a 
hearing if, after examination of the application and consideration of 
any petitions or other pleadings and of such other matters as it may 
officially notice, the FCC finds that:
    (1) A grant will serve the public interest, convenience, and 
necessity;
    (2) There are no substantial and material questions of fact 
presented;
    (3) The applicant is eligible and qualified under applicable FCC 
regulations and policies;
    (4) The application is acceptable for filing, and complies with the 
FCC rules and other applicable requirements;
    (5) The application has not been designated for a hearing after 
being selected in a random selection process;
    (6) There are no applications entitled to comparative consideration 
with the application being granted; and
    (7) Operation of the proposed station would not cause interference 
to any authorized station(s).
    (b) Grant of petitioned applications. The FCC may grant, without a 
formal hearing, applications against which petitions to deny has been 
filed. If any petition(s) to deny are pending (i.e. have not been 
dismissed pursuant to Sec. 22.130(c) or withdrawn by the petitioner) 
when an application is granted, the FCC denies the petition(s) and 
issues a concise statement of the reason(s) for the denial, disposing of 
all substantive issues raised in the petitions.
    (c) Partial and conditional grants. The FCC may grant applications 
in part, and/or subject to conditions other than those normally applied 
to authorizations of the same type. When the FCC does this, it will 
inform the applicant of the reasons therefor. Such partial or

[[Page 109]]

conditional grants are final unless the FCC revises its action in 
response to a petition for reconsideration. Such petitions for 
reconsideration must be filed by the applicant within thirty days after 
the date of the letter or order stating the reasons for the partial or 
conditional grant, and must reject the partial or conditional grant and 
return the instrument of authorization.
    (d) Designation for hearing. The FCC may designate applications for 
a hearing, specifying with particularity the matters in issue, if, after 
consideration of the application, any petitions or other pleadings, and 
other matters which it may officially notice, the FCC is unable to make 
one or more of the findings listed in paragraph (a) of this section. The 
FCC may grant, deny or take other action with respect to applications 
designated for a hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 22.135  Settlement conference.

    Parties are encouraged to use alternative dispute resolution 
procedures to settle disputes (see subpart E of part 1 of this chapter). 
In any contested proceeding, the FCC, in its discretion, may direct the 
parties or their attorneys to appear before it for a conference.
    (a) The purposes of such conferences are:
    (1) To obtain admissions of fact or stipulations between the parties 
as to any or all of the matters in controversy;
    (2) To consider the necessity for or desirability of amendments to 
the pleadings, or of additional pleadings or evidentiary submissions;
    (3) To consider simplification or narrowing of the issues;
    (4) To encourage settlement of the matters in controversy by 
agreement between the parties; and
    (5) To consider other matters that may aid in the resolution of the 
contested proceeding.
    (b) Conferences are scheduled by the FCC at a time and place it may 
designate, to be conducted in person or by telephone conference call.
    (c) The failure of any party or attorney, following reasonable 
notice, to appear at a scheduled conference will be deemed a failure to 
prosecute, subjecting that party's application or petition to dismissal 
by the FCC pursuant to Sec. 22.128(c) or Sec. 22.130(c).

Sec. 22.137  Assignment of authorization; transfer of control.

    Authorizations in the Public Mobile Services may be assigned by the 
licensee to another party, voluntarily or involuntarily, directly or 
indirectly, or by transfer of control of a licensee holding such 
authorizations, only upon approval by the FCC. The assignee is 
responsible for ascertaining that the station facilities are and will 
remain in compliance with the terms and conditions of the authorization 
to be assigned.
    (a) Application required. The assignor or transferor must file an 
application for approval of assignment or transfer of control (FCC Form 
490). In the case of involuntary assignment, such application must be 
filed no later than 30 days after the event causing the assignment. The 
assignee or transferee must file a report qualifying it as a common 
carrier (FCC Form 430) unless a current report is already on file with 
the FCC.
    (b) Notification of completion. Assignments and transfers of control 
must be completed within 60 days of FCC approval. The assignee or 
transferee must notify the FCC by letter of the date of completion of 
the assignment or transfer of control. If an assignment or transfer of 
control is not completed within this time, the assignor or transferor 
must so notify the FCC by letter, and the assignee or transferee must 
submit the authorization(s) to the FCC for cancellation or request an 
extension of time to complete the assignment or transfer of control. If 
the assignment or transfer of control is not completed, the 
authorization(s) remain with the assignor or transferor.
    (c) Partial assignment of authorization. If the authorization for 
some, but not all, of the facilities of a Public Mobile Services station 
is assigned to another party, voluntarily or involuntarily, such action 
is a partial assignment of authorization.
    (1) To request FCC approval of a partial assignment of 
authorization, the following must be filed in addition to the forms 
required by paragraph (a) of this section:

[[Page 110]]

    (i) The assignor must notify the FCC (FCC Form 489) of the 
facilities to be deleted from its authorization upon completion of the 
assignment.
    (ii) The assignee must apply for authority (FCC Form 600) to operate 
a new station including the facilities for which authorization is 
assigned, or to modify the assignee's existing station to include the 
facilities for which authorization was assigned.
    (2) Partial assignments must be completed within 60 days of FCC 
approval. If an approved partial assignment is not completed within this 
time, the assignor must notify the FCC (FCC Form 489), and the assignee 
must submit the authorization(s) to the FCC for cancellation or request 
an extension of time to complete the assignment. If the assignment is 
not completed, the authorization(s) remain with the assignor.
    (d) Limitations. The FCC may deny applications for assignment of 
authorization or consent to transfer of control if:
    (1) The FCC is unable to make the findings contained in 
Sec. 22.132(a) with respect to both parties to the assignment or 
transfer;
    (2) The authorization was obtained for the principal purpose of 
speculation or profitable resale, rather than provision of common 
carrier telecommunication services to the public; or,
    (3) The authorization is for a commercial aviation system in the 
Air-ground Radiotelephone Service or an unserved area cellular system in 
the Cellular Radiotelephone Service and the system has not been 
constructed or operated, or has been operated for less than one year.
    (i) Licensees must not enter into agreements (e.g. option agreements 
or management contracts) to assign authorizations before or during the 
first year of operation, even if the assignment is to take place after 
the first year of operation.
    (ii) Notwithstanding the introductory texts of paragraphs (d) and 
(d)(3) of this section, the FCC may grant applications for pro forma 
assignments during the first year of operation.

<R05>
Sec. 22.139  Trafficking.

    Carriers must not obtain or attempt to obtain an authorization in 
the Public Mobile services for the principal purpose of speculation or 
profitable resale of the authorization, but rather for the provision of 
common carrier telecommunication services to the public.
    (a) Applications for approval of assignment of authorization may be 
reviewed by the FCC to determine if the circumstances indicate 
trafficking in Public Mobile services authorizations.
    (b) The FCC may require submission of an affirmative, factual 
showing, supported by affidavit of persons with personal knowledge 
thereof, to demonstrate that the assignor did not acquire the 
authorization for the principal purpose of speculation or profitable 
resale of the authorization. This showing may include, for example, a 
demonstration that the proposed assignment is due to changed 
circumstances (described in detail) affecting the licensee after the 
grant of the authorization, or that the proposed assignment is 
incidental to a sale of other facilities or a merger of interests.


<R05>
Sec. 22.142  Commencement of service; notification requirement.

    Stations must begin providing service to subscribers no later than 
the date of required commencement of service specified on the 
authorization. If service to subscribers has not begun by the date of 
required commencement of service, the authorization terminates, in whole 
or in part, without action by the FCC, pursuant to Sec. 21.144. 
Additional requirements for construction of facilities apply to cellular 
systems (see Sec. 22.946) and commercial aviation air-ground systems 
(see Sec. 22.873).
    (a) Construction period. The period between the date of grant of an 
authorization and the date of required commencement of service is 
referred to as the construction period. The terms of construction 
periods are given in the subparts of this part governing each Public 
Mobile Service.
    (b) Notification requirement. Licensees must notify the FCC (FCC 
Form 489) of commencement of service to subscribers. The notification 
must be mailed or

[[Page 111]]

delivered to the filing place (see Sec. 22.106) no later than 15 days 
after service begins.
    (1) The notification must state whether the station was constructed 
exactly as authorized or with minor changes.
    (2) If service to subscribers has begun using some, but not all, of 
the authorized transmitters, the notification must show to which 
specific transmitters it applies. Additional notifications must be filed 
if and when other transmitters commence providing service to 
subscribers. If the licensee no longer intends to construct and/or 
operate the remaining authorized transmitters, the notification should 
so state.
    (3) This section does not require licensees to notify the FCC of 
facilities added or modified pursuant to the provisions of Secs. 22.163 
and 22.165. It applies only to facilities specifically listed in 
authorizations for which a construction period is provided.
    (c) Requests for extension. Before the date of required commencement 
of service, licensees may file an application (FCC Form 600) requesting 
an extension of the construction period.
    (1) The FCC may grant applications for extension of the construction 
period if the licensee shows that failure to commence providing service 
to subscribers is due to causes beyond its control.
    (2) The FCC does not grant applications for extension of the 
construction period if failure to commence providing service to 
subscribers is due to delays caused by lack of financing, failure to 
obtain an antenna site, or failure to order equipment in a timely 
manner. If the licensee orders equipment within 90 days of authorization 
grant, a presumption of diligence is created.
    (3) The FCC does not grant applications for extension of the 
construction period if the licensee fails to commence providing service 
to subscribers because it intends to assign the authorization. The FCC 
does not grant applications for extension of the construction period 
solely to allow an assignee to complete facilities the assignor failed 
to construct.
    (d) Automatic extension for relocation. If, prior to the end of the 
construction period, a licensee files an application (FCC Form 600) to 
relocate a transmitter because of involuntary loss of the proposed site 
or for other reasons due to causes beyond the licensee's control, the 
construction period is automatically extended pending disposition of 
that application.
    (1) Extension of the construction period for one transmitter under 
this paragraph does not extend the construction period for other 
transmitter under the same authorization that are not to be relocated.
    (2) The filing of applications for modifications other than 
involuntary relocation does not automatically extend the construction 
period.

[59 FR 59507, Nov. 17, 1994, as amended at 59 FR 59954, Nov. 21, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 22.143  Construction prior to grant of application.

    Applicants may construct facilities in the Public Mobile services 
prior to grant of their applications, subject to the provisions of this 
section, but must not operate such facilities until the FCC grants an 
authorization. If the conditions stated in this section are not met, 
applicants must not begin to construct facilities in the Public Mobile 
Services.
    (a) When applicants may begin construction. An applicant may begin 
construction of a facility 35 days after the date of the Public Notice 
listing the application for that facility as acceptable for filing, 
except that an applicant whose application to operate a new cellular 
system was selected in a random selection process may begin construction 
of that new cellular system 35 days after the date of the Public Notice 
listing it as the tentative selectee.
    (b) Notification to stop. If the FCC for any reason determines that 
construction should not be started or should be stopped while an 
application is pending, and so notifies the applicant, orally (followed 
by written confirmation) or in writing, the applicant must not begin 
construction or, if construction has begun, must stop construction 
immediately.
    (c) Assumption of risk. Applicants that begin construction pursuant 
to this section before receiving an authorization do so at their own 
risk and have

[[Page 112]]

no recourse against the United States for any losses resulting from:
    (1) Applications that are not granted;
    (2) Errors or delays in issuing Public Notices;
    (3) Having to alter, relocate or dismantle the facility; or
    (4) Incurring whatever costs may be necessary to bring the facility 
into compliance with applicable laws, or FCC rules and orders.
    (d) Conditions. Except as indicated, all pre-grant construction is 
subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The application is not mutually exclusive with any other 
application, except for successful bidders and tentative selectees in 
the Cellular Radiotelephone Service;
    (2) No petitions to deny the application have been filed;
    (3) The application does not include a request for a waiver of one 
or more FCC rules;
    (4) For any construction or alteration that would exceed the 
requirements of Sec. 17.7 of this chapter, the licensee has notified the 
appropriate Regional Office of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA 
Form 7460-1), filed a request for antenna height clearance and 
obstruction marking and lighting specifications (FCC Form 854) with the 
FCC, PRB, Support Services Branch, Gettysburg, PA 17325;
    (5) The applicant has indicated in the application that the proposed 
facility would not have a significant environmental effect, in 
accordance with Secs. 1.1301 through 1.1319 of this chapter; and,
    (6) Under applicable international agreements and rules in this 
part, individual coordination of the proposed channel assignment(s) with 
a foreign administration is not required.


<R05>
Sec. 22.144  Termination of authorizations.

    Authorizations in the Public Mobile Services remain valid until 
terminated in accordance with this section, except that the FCC may 
revoke an authorization pursuant to section 312 of the Communications 
Act of 1934, as amended (47 U.S.C. 312).
    (a) Expiration. Authorizations automatically terminate, without 
specific FCC action, on the expiration date specified therein, unless a 
timely application for renewal is filed (see Sec. 22.145). No 
authorization granted under the provisions of this part shall be for a 
longer term than ten years. See 47 U.S.C. 307(c).
    (b) Failure to commence providing service to subscribers. 
Authorizations automatically terminate, in whole or in part, without 
specific FCC action, on the date of required commencement of service, if 
service to subscribers is not commenced by that date (see Sec. 22.142), 
except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (1) Authorizations do not terminate while a timely filed application 
for extension of the construction period is pending (see 
Sec. 22.142(c)).
    (2) If a timely filed application for extension of the construction 
period is dismissed or denied, the authorization automatically 
terminates, in whole or in part, without specific FCC action, on the day 
after the applicant or the applicant's attorney is notified of the FCC's 
action dismissing or denying the application for extension of the 
construction period.
    (c) Service discontinued. Authorizations automatically terminate, 
without specific FCC action, if service is permanently discontinued as 
provided in Sec. 22.317.
    (d) STAs. Special Temporary Authorizations (STAs) automatically 
terminate, without specific FCC action, at the end of the period 
specified therein, except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, or upon failure to comply with the terms and conditions 
therein.
    (1) STAs do not terminate while a timely filed request for an 
extension of the STA term, in accordance with Sec. 22.125(b), is 
pending.
    (2) If a timely filed request for extension of the STA term is 
dismissed or denied, the STA automatically terminates, without specific 
FCC action, on the day after the applicant or the applicant's attorney 
is notified of the FCC's action dismissing or denying the request for 
extension.
    (e) Cancellation. Authorizations submitted by licensees for 
cancellation terminate when the FCC gives Public Notice of such action.

[[Page 113]]


<R05>
Sec. 22.145  Renewal application procedures.

    Applications for renewal (FCC Form 405) of expiring authorizations 
must be filed by the licensee prior to, but no earlier than 30 days 
before, the expiration date of the authorization. A separate application 
is required for each authorization (call sign). Competing applications 
from parties wishing to challenge the renewal must be filed during the 
same 30 day period. Additional renewal requirements applicable only to 
specific Public Mobile Services are set forth in the subparts governing 
those services.


<R05>
Sec. 22.150  Standard pre-filing technical coordination procedure.

    For operations on certain channels in the Public Mobile Services, 
carriers must attempt to coordinate the proposed use of spectrum with 
other spectrum users prior to filing an application for authority to 
operate a station. Rules requiring this procedure for specific channels 
and types of stations are contained in the subparts governing the 
individual Public Mobile Services.
    (a) Coordination comprises two steps--notification and response. 
Each step may be accomplished orally or in writing.
    (b) Notification must include relevant technical details of the 
proposal. At minimum, this should include the following:
    (1) Geographical coordinates of the antenna site(s).
    (2) Transmitting and receiving channels to be added or changed.
    (3) Transmitting power, emission type and polarization.
    (4) Transmitting antenna pattern and maximum gain.
    (5) Transmitting antenna height above ground level.
    (c) Applicants and licensees receiving notification must respond 
promptly, even if no channel usage conflicts are anticipated. If any 
notified party fails to respond within 30 days, the applicant may file 
the application without a response from that party.
    (d) The 30-day period begins on the date of receipt of the 
notification by the party being notified. If the notification is by 
mail, this date may be ascertained by:
    (1) The return receipt on certified mail,
    (2) The enclosure of a card to be dated and returned by the party 
being notified, or
    (3) A reasonable estimate of the time required for the mail to reach 
its destination. In this case, the date when the 30-day period will 
expire must be stated in the notification.
    (e) All channel usage conflicts discovered during the coordination 
process should be resolved prior to filing of the application. If the 
applicant is unable or unwilling to resolve a particular conflict, the 
application may be accepted for filing if it contains a statement 
describing the unresolved conflict and a brief explanation of the 
reasons why a resolution was not achieved.
    (f) If a number of changes in the technical parameters of a proposed 
facility become necessary during the course of the coordination process, 
an attempt should be made to minimize the number of separate 
notifications. If the changes are incorporated into a completely revised 
notice, the items that were changed from the previous notice should be 
identified.
    (g) In situations where subsequent changes are not numerous or 
complex, the party receiving the changed notification should make an 
effort to respond in less than 30 days. If the applicant believes a 
shorter response time is reasonable and appropriate, it should so 
indicate in the notice and suggest a response date.
    (h) If a subsequent change in the technical parameters of a proposed 
facility could not affect the facilities of one or more of the parties 
that received an initial notification, the applicant is not required to 
coordinate that change with these parties. However, these parties must 
be advised of the change and of the opinion that coordination is not 
required.

Sec. 22.157  Distance computation.

    The method given in this section must be used to compute the 
distance between any two locations, except that, for computation of 
distance involving stations in Canada and Mexico, methods for distance 
computation

[[Page 114]]

specified in the applicable international agreement, if any, must be 
used instead. The method set forth in this paragraph is considered to be 
sufficiently accurate for distances not exceeding 475 km (295 miles).
    (a) Convert the latitudes and longitudes of each reference point 
from degree-minute-second format to degree-decimal format by dividing 
minutes by 60 and seconds by 3600, then adding the results to degrees.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17NO94.000

    (b) Calculate the mean geodetic latitude between the two reference 
points by averaging the two latitudes:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17NO94.001

    (c) Calculate the number of kilometers per degree latitude 
difference for the mean geodetic latitude calculated in paragraph (b) of 
this section as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17NO94.002

    (d) Calculate the number of kilometers per degree of longitude 
difference for the mean geodetic latitude calculated in paragraph (b) of 
this section as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17NO94.003

    (e) Calculate the North-South distance in kilometers as follows:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17NO94.004
    
    (f) Calculate the East-West distance in kilometers as follows:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17NO94.005
    
    (g) Calculate the distance between the locations by taking the 
square root of the sum of the squares of the East-West and North-South 
distances:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17NO94.006

    (h) Terms used in this section are defined as follows:
    (1) LAT1<INF>dd and LON1<INF>dd are the coordinates of the first 
location in degree-decimal format.
    (2) LAT2<INF>dd and LON2<INF>dd are the coordinates of the second 
location in degree-decimal format.
    (3) ML is the mean geodetic latitude in degree-decimal format.
    (4) KPD<INF>lat is the number of kilometers per degree of latitude 
at a given mean geodetic latitude.
    (5) KPD<INF>lon is the number of kilometers per degree of longitude 
at a given mean geodetic latitude.
    (6) NS is the North-South distance in kilometers.
    (7) DIST is the distance between the two locations, in kilometers.


<R05>
Sec. 22.159  Computation of average terrain elevation.

    Average terrain elevation must be calculated by computer using 
elevations from a 30 second point or better topographic data file. The 
file must be identified. If a 30 second point data file is used, the 
elevation data must be processed for intermediate points using 
interpolation techniques; otherwise, the nearest point may be used. In 
cases of dispute, average terrain elevation determinations can also be 
done manually, if the results differ significantly from the computer 
derived averages.
    (a) Radial average terrain elevation is calculated as the average of 
the elevation along a straight line path from 3 to 16 kilometers (2 and 
10 miles) extending radially from the antenna site. If a portion of the 
radial path extends over foreign territory or water, such portion must 
not be included in the computation of average elevation unless the 
radial path again passes over United States land between 16 and 134 
kilometers (10 and 83 miles) away from the station. At least 50 evenly 
spaced data points for each radial should be used in the computation.

[[Page 115]]

    (b) Average terrain elevation is the average of the eight radial 
average terrain elevations (for the eight cardinal radials).
    (c) For locations in Dade and Broward Counties, Florida, the method 
prescribed above may be used or average terrain elevation may be assumed 
to be 3 meters (10 feet).


<R05>
Sec. 22.161  Application requirements for ASSB.

    Applications for base stations employing amplitude compandored 
single sideband modulation (ASSB) must contain the following 
information:
    (a) The application must describe fully the modulation 
characteristics, emission and occupied bandwidth, and specify the center 
frequency of the emission for each channel, carrier frequency, and pilot 
channels, if any. The emission must fall completely within a channel 
assignable for two-way operation in the Paging and Radiotelephone 
Service, Rural Radiotelephone Service or Offshore Radiotelephone 
Service.
    (b) The application must contain interference studies between 
stations within an authorized bandwidth, whether FM-to-ASSB, ASSB-to-FM, 
or ASSB-to-ASSB in accordance with the following: For ASSB stations, the 
transmitter nearest to the protected station must be used. The effective 
radiated power in the direction of the protected station must be the sum 
of the peak effective radiated power of all transmitters in the group, 
in the direction of the protected station. The antenna center of 
radiation height above average terrain must be the highest antenna 
center of radiation height of any transmitter in the group in the 
direction of the protected station. The channel of the group is assumed 
to be the same as that of the protected station (co-channel), and 
studies must be made in accordance with Sec. 22.567.


<R05>
Sec. 22.163  Minor modifications to existing stations.

    Licensees may make modifications to existing stations without 
obtaining prior Commission approval provided:
    (a) Classification as minor. The modifications must be minor. 
Modifications to a station are minor if an application filed solely for 
the purpose of obtaining authorization for such modifications would not 
be classified as major in accordance with Sec. 22.123.
    (b) International coordination. The modifications are limited to 
those for which individual coordination of the channel assignment(s) 
with a foreign administration, under applicable international agreements 
and rules in this part, is not required.
    (c) Antenna structure clearance required. For any construction or 
alteration that would exceed the requirements of Sec. 17.7 of this 
chapter, licensees must notify the appropriate Regional Office of the 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA Form 7460-1) and file a request for 
antenna height clearance and obstruction marking and lighting 
specifications (FCC Form 854) with the FCC, PRB, Support Services 
Branch, Gettysburg, PA 17325.
    (d) Provision of information upon request. Licensees must supply 
administrative or technical information concerning the modified 
facilities upon request by the FCC. At the time modifications are made 
pursuant to this section, licensees must make a record of the pertinent 
technical and administrative information so that such information is 
readily available. See Sec. 22.303.
    (e) Notification required for modifications affecting CGSA. 
Licensees in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service must notify the FCC 
(FCC Form 489) of any modifications made under this section that cause a 
change in the Cellular Geographic Service Area boundary (including the 
removal of a transmitter or transmitters). The notification must include 
full size and reduced maps, and supporting engineering, as described in 
Sec. 22.953(a)(5) (i) through (iii). If the modification involves a 
contract service area boundary (SAB) extension (see Sec. 22.912), the 
notification must include a statement as to whether the five year build-
out period for the system on the relevant channel block in the market 
into which the SAB extends has elapsed, and whether the SAB extends into 
any unserved area in that market. The notification must be mailed or 
delivered to the filing place (see Sec. 22.106) no later than 15 days 
after the modification is made.

<R05>
Sec. 22.165  Additional transmitters for existing systems.

    A licensee may operate additional transmitters at additional 
locations on the same channel or channel block as its existing system 
without obtaining prior Commission approval provided:
    (a) International coordination. The locations and/or technical 
parameters of the additional transmitters are such that individual 
coordination of the channel assignment(s) with a foreign administration, 
under applicable international agreements and rules in this part, is not 
required.
    (b) Antenna structure clearance required. For any construction or 
alteration that would exceed the requirements of Sec. 17.7 of this 
chapter, licensees must notify the appropriate Regional Office of the 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA Form 7460-1) and file a request for 
antenna height clearance and obstruction marking and lighting 
specifications (FCC Form 854) with the FCC, PRB, Support Services 
Branch, Gettysburg, PA 17325.
    (c) Environmental. The additional transmitters must not have a 
significant environmental effect as defined by Secs. 1.1301 through 
1.1319 of this chapter.
    (d) Paging and Radiotelephone Service. The provisions in this 
paragraph apply for stations in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service.
    (1) The service area and interfering contours of the additional 
transmitter(s) must be totally encompassed by the composite service area 
contour and predicted interfering contour, respectively, of the existing 
station on the same channel; except that this limitation does not apply 
to nationwide network paging stations or in-building radiation systems.
    (2) Additional transmitters in the 43 MHz frequency range operate 
under developmental authority, subject to the conditions set forth in 
Sec. 22.411.
    (3) The additional transmitters must not operate on control channels 
in the 72-76 MHz, 470-512 MHz, 928 MHz, 932 MHz, 941 MHz or 959 MHz 
frequency ranges.
    (e) Cellular Radiotelephone Service. During the five year build-out 
period, the service area boundaries of the additional transmitters, as 
calculated by the method set forth in Sec. 22.911(a), must remain within 
the market, except that the service area boundaries may extend beyond 
the market boundary into area that is part of the CGSA or is already 
encompassed by the service area boundaries of previously authorized 
facilities. After the five year build-out period, the service area 
boundaries of the additional transmitters, as calculated by the method 
set forth in Sec. 22.911(a), must remain within the CGSA. Licensees must 
notify the FCC (FCC Form 489) of any transmitters added under this 
section that cause a change in the CGSA boundary. The notification must 
include full size and reduced maps, and supporting engineering, as 
described in Sec. 22.953(a)(5) (i) through (iii). If the addition of 
transmitters involves a contract service area boundary (SAB) extension 
(see Sec. 22.912), the notification must include a statement as to 
whether the five year build-out period for the system on the relevant 
channel block in the market into which the SAB extends has elapsed, and 
whether the SAB extends into any unserved area in the market. The 
notification must be mailed or delivered to the filing place (see 
Sec. 22.106) no later than 15 days after the addition is made.
    (f) Air-ground Radiotelephone Service. Ground stations may be added 
to Commercial Aviation air-ground systems at previously established 
ground station locations, pursuant to Sec. 22.859, subject to compliance 
with the applicable technical rules. This section does not apply to 
General Aviation air-ground stations.
    (g) Rural Radiotelephone Service. A ``service area'' and 
``interfering contours'' must be determined using the same method as for

effective nondiscrimination clause in new or renegotiated union 
agreements.
    (C) Avoiding use of selection techniques or tests that have the 
effect of discriminating against minority groups or females.

[[Page 120]]

    (iii) To assure nondiscriminatory placement and promotion. (A) 
Instructing employees of the licensee who make decisions on placement 
and promotion that minority employees and females are to be considered 
without discrimination, and that job areas in which there is little or 
no minority or female representation should be reviewed to determine 
whether this results from discrimination.
    (B) Giving minority groups and female employees equal opportunity 
for positions which lead to higher positions. Inquiring as to the 
interest and skills of all lower-paid employees with respect to any of 
the higher-paid positions, followed by assistance, counseling, and

file a notification of such filing with the FCC in lieu of a report.
    (d) Complaints of violations of Equal Employment Programs. 
Complaints alleging employment discrimination against a common carrier 
licensee are considered by the FCC in the following manner:
    (1) If a complaint raising an issue of discrimination is received 
against a licensee who is within the jurisdiction of the EEOC, it is 
submitted to that agency. The FCC maintains a liaison with that agency 
that keeps the FCC informed of the disposition of complaints filed 
against common carrier licensees.
    (2) Complaints alleging employment discrimination against a common 
carrier licensee who does not fall under the jurisdiction of the EEOC 
but is covered by appropriate enforceable State law, to which penalties 
apply, may be submitted by the FCC to the respective State agency.
    (3) Complaints alleging employment discrimination against a common 
carrier licensee who does not fall under

                         Technical Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 22.351  Channel assignment policy.

    The channels allocated for use in the Public Mobile Services are 
listed in the applicable subparts of this part. Channels and channel 
blocks are assigned in such a manner as to facilitate the rendition of 
service on an interference-free basis in each service area. Except as 
otherwise provided in this part, each channel or channel block is 
assigned exclusively to one common carrier in each service area. All 
applicants for, and licensees of, stations in the Public Mobile Services 
shall cooperate in the selection and use of channels in order to 
minimize interference and obtain the most efficient use of the allocated 
spectrum.

[[Page 122]]


<R05>
Sec. 22.352  Protection from interference.

    Public Mobile Services stations operating in full accordance with 
applicable FCC rules and the terms and conditions of their 
authorizations are normally considered to be non-interfering. If the FCC 
determines, however, that interference which significantly interrupts or 
degrades a radio service is being caused, it may, after notice and an 
opportunity for a hearing, require modifications to any Public Mobile 
station as necessary to eliminate such interference.
    (a) Failure to operate as authorized. Any licensee causing 
interference to the service of other stations by failing to operate its 
station in full accordance with its authorization and applicable FCC 
rules shall discontinue all transmissions, except those necessary for 
the immediate safety of life or property, until it can bring its station 
into full compliance with the authorization and rules.
    (b) Intermodulation interference. Licensees should attempt to 
resolve such interference by technical means.
    (c) Situations in which no protection is afforded. Except as 
provided elsewhere in this part, no protection from interference is 
afforded in the following situations:
    (1) Interference to base receivers from base or fixed transmitters. 
Licensees should attempt to resolve such interference by technical means 
or operating arrangements.
    (2) Inteference to mobile receivers from mobile transmitters. No 
protection is provided against mobile-to-mobile interference.
    (3) Interference to base receivers from mobile transmitters. No 
protection is provided against mobile-to-base interference.
    (4) Interference to fixed stations. Licensees should attempt to 
resolve such interference by technical means or operating arrangements.
    (5) Anomalous or infrequent propagation modes. No protection is 
provided against interference caused by tropospheric and ionospheric 
propagation of signals.
    (6) Facilities for which the FCC not notified. No protection is 
provided against interference to the service of any additional or 
modified transmitter operating pursuant to Sec. 22.163 or Sec. 22.165, 
unless and until the licensee notifies the FCC (FCC Form 489) of the 
additional or modified transmitter.
    (7) In-building radiation systems. No protection is provided against 
interference to the service of in-building radiation systems (see 
Sec. 22.383).


<R05>
Sec. 22.353  Blanketing interference.

    Licensees of Public Mobile Services stations are responsible for 
resolving cases of blanketing interference in accordance with the 
provisions of this section.
    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, licensees 
must resolve any cases of blanketing interference in their area of 
responsibility caused by operation of their transmitter(s) during a one-
year period following commencement of service from new or modified 
transmitter(s). Interference must be resolved promptly at no cost to the 
complainant.
    (b) The area of responsibility is that area in the immediate 
vicinity of the transmitting antenna of stations where the field 
strength of the electromagnetic radiation from such stations equals or 
exceeds 115 dB<greek-m>V/m. To determine the radial distance to the 
boundary of this area, the following formula must be used:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17NO94.007

where d is the radial distance to the boundary, in kilometers
p is the radial effective radiated power, in kilowatts

The maximum effective radiated power in the pertinent direction, without 
consideration of the antenna's vertical radiation pattern or height, 
must be used in the formula.

    (c) Licensees are not required to resolve blanketing interference to 
mobile receivers or non-RF devices or blanketing interference occurring 
as a result of malfunctioning or mistuned receivers, improperly 
installed consumer antenna systems, or the use of high gain antennas or 
antenna booster amplifiers by consumers.
    (d) Licensees that install transmitting antennas at a location where 
there are already one or more transmitting antennas are responsible for 
resolving

[[Page 123]]

any new cases of blanketing interference in accordance with this 
section.
    (e) Two or more licensees that concurrently install transmitting 
antennas at the same location are jointly responsible for resolving 
blanketing interference cases, unless the FCC can readily determine 
which station is causing the interference, in which case the licensee of 
that station is held fully responsible.
    (f) After the one year period of responsibility to resolve 
blanketing interference, licensees must provide upon request technical 
information to complainants on remedies for blanketing interference.


<R05>
Sec. 22.355  Frequency tolerance.

<R05>
Sec. 22.357   Emission types.

    Any authorized station in the Public Mobile Services may transmit 
any emission type provided that the resulting emission complies with the 
appropriate emission mask. See Secs. 22.359 and 22.917.

[59 FR 59956, Nov. 21, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 22.359  Emission masks.

    Unless otherwise indicated in the rules governing a specific radio 
service, all transmitters intended for use in the Public Mobile Services 
must be designed to comply with the emission masks outlined in this 
section. If an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes 
harmful interference, the FCC may, at its discretion, require greater 
attenuation than specified in this section.
    (a) Analog modulation. For transmitters other than those employing 
digital modulation techniques, the mean or peak envelope power of 
adjacent channel emissions must be attenuated below the output mean or 
peak envelope power of the total emission (P, in Watts) in accordance 
with the following schedule:
    (1) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the 
assigned channel by more than 50 percent up to and including 100 percent 
of the authorized bandwidth:

at least 25 dB:

    (2) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the 
assigned channel by more than 100 percent up to and including 250 
percent of the authorized bandwidth:

at least 35 dB:

    (3) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the 
assigned channel by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth:

at least 43 + 10 log P dB, or 80 dB, whichever is the lesser 
attenuation.

    (b) Digital modulation. For transmitters not equipped with an audio 
low pass filter and for transmitters employing digital modulation 
techniques, the mean or peak envelope power of sideband emissions must 
be attenuated below the mean or peak envelope power of the total 
emission (P, in Watts) in accordance with the following schedule:
    (1) For transmitters that operate in the frequency ranges 35 to 44 
MHz, 72 to 73 MHz, 75.4 to 76.0 MHz and 152 to 159 MHz,
    (i) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the 
assigned channel by a displacement frequency f<INF>d (in kHz) of more 
than 5 kHz but not more than 10 kHz:

at least 83 log (f<INF>d<divide>5) dB;

    (ii) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the 
assigned channel by a displacement frequency f<INF>d (in kHz) of more 
than 10 kHz but not more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth:

at least 29 log f<INF>d<SUP>2<divide>11) dB or 50 dB, whichever is the 
lesser attenuation;

    (iii) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the 
assigned channel by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth:

at least 43 + 10 log P dB, or 80 dB, whichever is the lesser 
attenuation.

    (2) For transmitters that operate in the frequency ranges 450 to 512 
MHz and 929 to 932 MHz,
    (i) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the 
assigned channel by a displacement frequency f<INF>d (in kHz) of more 
than 5 kHz but not more than 10 kHz:


[[Page 124]]


at least 83 log (f<INF>d<divide>5) dB;

    (ii) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the 
assigned channel by a displacement frequency f<INF>d (in kHz) of more 
than 10 kHz but not more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth:

at least 116 log (f<INF>d<divide>6.1) dB, or 50 + 10 log P dB, or 70 dB, 
whichever is the lesser attenuation;

    (iii) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the 
assigned channel by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth:

at least 43 + 10 log P dB, or 80 dB, whichever is the lesser 
attenuation.

    (c) Measurement procedure. Either peak or average power may be used, 
provided that the same technique is used for both the adjacent channel 
or sideband emissions and the total emission. The resolution bandwidth 
of the measuring instrument must be set to 300 Hz for measurements on 
any frequency removed from the center frequency of the assigned channel 
by no more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth and 30 kHz for 
measurements on any frequency removed from the center frequency of the 
assigned channel by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth.


<R05>
Sec. 22.361  Standby facilities.

    Licensees of stations in the Public Mobile Services may install 
standby transmitters for the purpose of continuing service in the event 
of failure or during required maintenance of regular transmitters 
without obtaining separate authorization, provided that operation of the 
standby transmitters would not increase the service areas or 
interference potential of the stations, and that such standby 
transmitters use the same antenna as the regular transmitters they 
temporarily replace.

Sec. 22.365  Antenna structures; air navigation safety.

    Licensees that own their antenna structures must not allow these 
antenna structures to become a hazard to air navigation. In general, 
antenna structure owners are responsible for registering antenna 
structures with the FCC if required by part 17 of this chapter, and for 
installing and maintaining any required marking and lighting. However, 
in the event of default of this responsibility by an antenna structure 
owner, each FCC permittee or licensee authorized to use an affected 
antenna structure will be held responsible by the FCC for ensuring that 
the antenna structure continues to meet the requirements of part 17 of 
this chapter. See Sec. 17.6 of this chapter.
    (a) Marking and lighting. Antenna structures must be marked, lighted 
and maintained in accordance with Part 17 of this chapter and all 
applicable rules and requirements of the Federal Aviation 
Administration.
    (b) Maintenance contracts. Antenna structure owners (or licensees 
and permittees, in the event of default by an antenna structure owner) 
may enter into contracts with other entities to monitor and carry out 
necessary maintenance of antenna structures. Antenna structure owners 
(or licensees

[[Page 125]]

and permittees, in the event of default by an antenna structure owner) 
that make such contractual arrangements continue to be responsible for 
the maintenance of antenna structures in regard to air navigation 
safety.

Sec. 22.367  Wave polarization.

    Public mobile station antennas must be of the correct type and 
properly installed such that the electromagnetic emissions have the 
polarization required by this section.
    (a) Vertical. Waves radiated by the following must be vertically 
polarized:
    (1) Base, mobile, dispatch, and auxiliary test transmitters in the 
Paging and Radiotelephone Service;
    (2) Transmitters in the Offshore Radiotelephone Service;
    (3) Transmitters on channels in the 72-76 MHz frequency range;
    (4) Base, mobile and auxiliary test transmitters in the Cellular 
Radiotelephone Service;
    (5) Control and repeater transmitters on channels in the 900-960 MHz 
frequency range;
    (6) Rural subscriber stations communicating with base transmitters 
in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service pursuant to Sec. 22.563.
    (7) Ground and airborne mobile transmitters in the Air-ground 
Radiotelephone Service.
    (b) Horizontal. Waves radiated by transmitters in the Public Mobile 
Services, other than transmitters required by paragraph (a) of this 
section to radiate a vertically polarized wave must be horizontally 
polarized, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of 
this section.
    (c) Circular. If communications efficiency would be improved and/or 
interference reduced, the FCC may authorize transmitters other than 
those listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section to 
radiate a circularly polarized wave.
    (d) Any polarization. Public Land Mobile stations transmitting on 
channels higher than 960 MHz are not limited as to wave polarization.


<R05>
Sec. 22.369  Quiet zones.

    Quiet zones are those areas where it is necessary to restrict 
radiation so as to minimize possible impact on the operations of radio 
astronomy or other facilities that are highly sensitive to interference. 
The areas involved and procedures required are as follows:
    (a) NRAO, NRRO. The requirements of this paragraph are intended to 
minimize possible interference at the National Radio Astronomy 
Observatory site located at Green Bank, Pocahontas County, West 
Virginia, and at the Naval Radio Research Observatory site at Sugar 
Grove, Pendleton County, West Virginia.
    (1) Carriers planning to construct and operate a new or modified 
Public Mobile Services station at a permanent fixed location within the 
area bounded by N.39 deg.15' on the north, W.78 deg.30' on the east, 
N.37 deg.30' on the south, and W.80 deg.30' on the west must notify the 
Director, National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Post Office Box No. 2, 
Green Bank, West Virginia 24944, in writing, of the technical details of 
the proposed operation. The notification must include the geographical 
coordinates of the antenna location, the antenna height, antenna 
directivity (if any), the channel, the emission type and power.
    (2) When an application for authority to operate a station is filed 
with the FCC, the notification required in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section should be sent at the same time. The application must state the 
date that notification in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section was made. After receipt of such applications, the FCC will allow 
a period of 20 days for comments or objections in response to the 
notifications indicated.
    (3) If an objection is received during the 20-day period from the 
National Radio Astronomy Observatory for itself or on behalf of the 
Naval Radio Research Observatory, the FCC will, after consideration of 
the record, take whatever action is deemed appropriate.
    (b) Table Mountain. The requirements of this paragraph are intended 
to minimize possible interference at the Table Mountain Radio Receiving 
Zone of the Research Laboratories of the Department of Commerce located 
in Boulder County, Colorado.
    (1) Carriers planning to construct and operate a new or modified 
Public Mobile Services station at a permanent

[[Page 126]]

fixed location in the vicinity of Boulder County, Colorado are advised 
to give consideration, prior to filing applications, to the need to 
protect the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone from interference. To 
prevent degradation of the present ambient radio signal level at the 
site, the Department of Commerce seeks to ensure that the field 
strengths of any radiated signals (excluding reflected signals) received 
on this 1800 acre site (in the vicinity of coordinates 40 deg.07'50'' 
North Latitude, 105 deg.14'40'' West Longitude) resulting from new 
assignments (other than mobile stations) or from the modification or 
relocation of existing facilities do not exceed the values given in 
Table C-3 of this section.

          Table C-3.--Field Strength Limits for Table Mountain          
------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Frequency range           Field strength      Power flux density 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.6 to 470 MHz..............  10 mV/m.............  -65.8 dBW/m<SUP>2        
470 to 890 MHz..............  30 mV/m.............  -56.2 dBW/m<SUP>2        
890 to 3000 MHz.............  1 mV/m..............  -85.8 dBW/m<SUP>2        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Equivalent values of power flux density are calculated assuming   
  free space characteristic impedance of 376.7 <greek-OH> (120<greek-p> 
  <greek-OH>).                                                          

    (2) Advance consultation is recommended, particularly for applicants 
that have no reliable data to indicate whether the field strength or 
power flux density figures in the above table would be exceeded by their 
proposed radio facilities. In general, coordination is recommended for:
    (i) Stations located within 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles);
    (ii) Stations located within 4.8 kilometers (3 miles) transmitting 
with 50 watts or more effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary 
plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the Table Mountain 
Radio Receiving Zone;
    (iii) Stations located with 16 kilometers (10 miles) transmitting 
with 1 kW or more ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the 
azimuthal direction of Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone;
    (iv) Stations located within 80 kilometers (50 miles) transmitting 
with 25 kW or more ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the 
azimuthal direction of Table Mountain Receiving Zone.
    (3) Applicants concerned are urged to communicate with the Radio 
Frequency Management Coordinator, Department of Commerce, Research 
Support Services NOAAR/E5X2, Boulder Laboratories, Boulder, CO 80303; 
telephone (303) 497-6548, in advance of filing their applications with 
the FCC.
    (4) The FCC will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, such consultation may 
avoid the filing of objections from the Department of Commerce or 
institution of proceedings to modify the authorizations of stations that 
radiate signals with a field strength or power flux density at the site 
in excess of those specified herein.
    (c) Federal Communications Commission protected field offices. The 
requirements of this paragraph are intended to minimize possible 
interference to FCC monitoring activities.
    (1) Carriers planning to construct and operate a new or modified 
Public Mobile Services station at a permanent fixed location in the 
vicinity of an FCC protected field office are advised to give 
consideration, prior to filing applications, to the need to avoid 
interfering with the monitoring activities of that office. FCC protected 
field offices are listed in Sec. 0.121 of this chapter.
    (2) Applications for stations (except mobile stations) that could 
produce on any channel a direct wave fundamental field strength of 
greater than 10 mV/m (-65.8 dBW/m\2\ power flux density assuming a free 
space characteristic impedance of 120<dagger> <greek-OH>) in the 
authorized bandwidth at the protected field office may be examined to 
determine the potential for interference with monitoring activities. 
After consideration of the effects of the predicted field strength of 
the proposed station, including the cumulative effects of the signal 
from the proposed station with

[[Page 127]]

other ambient radio field strength levels at the protected field office, 
the FCC may add a condition restricting radiation toward the protected 
field office to the station authorization.
    (3) In the event that the calculated field strength exceeds 10 mV/m 
at the protected field office site, or if there is any question whether 
field strength levels might exceed that level, advance consultation with 
the FCC to discuss possible measures to avoid interference to monitoring 
activities should be considered. Prospective applicants may communicate 
with: Chief, Compliance and Information Bureau, Federal Communications 
Commission, Washington, DC 20554.
    (4) Advance consultation is recommended for applicants that have no 
reliable data to indicate whether the field strength or power flux 
density figure indicated would be exceeded by their proposed radio 
facilities. In general, coordination is recommended for:
    (i) Stations located within 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles);
    (ii) Stations located within 4.8 kilometers (3 miles) with 50 watts 
or more average effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of 
polarization in the azimuthal direction of the protected field offices.
    (iii) Stations located within 16 kilometers (10 miles) with 1 kW or 
more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of the protected field office;
    (iv) Stations located within 80 kilometers (50 miles) with 25 kW or 
more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of the protected field office;
    (5) Advance coordination for stations transmitting on channels above 
1000 MHz is recommended only if the proposed station is in the vicinity 
of a protected field office designated as a satellite monitoring 
facility in Sec. 0.121 of this chapter.
    (6) The FCC will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, such consultation may 
serve to avoid the need for later modification of the authorizations of 
stations that interfere with monitoring activities at protected field 
offices.

Sec. 22.371  Disturbance of AM broadcast station antenna patterns.

    Public Mobile Service licensees that construct or modify towers in 
the immediate vicinity of AM broadcast stations are responsible for 
measures necessary to correct disturbance of the AM station antenna 
pattern which causes operation outside of the radiation parameters 
specified by the FCC for the AM station, if the disturbance occurred as 
a result of such construction or modification.
    (a) Non-directional AM stations. If tower construction or 
modification is planned within 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) of a non-
directional AM broadcast station tower, the Public Mobile Service 
licensee must notify the licensee of the AM broadcast station in advance 
of the planned construction or modification. Measurements must be made 
to determine whether the construction or modification affected the AM 
station antenna pattern. The Public Mobile Service licensee is 
responsible for the installation and continued maintenance of any 
detuning apparatus necessary to restore proper non-directional 
performance of the AM station tower.
    (b) Directional AM stations. If tower construction or modification 
is planned within 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) of a directional AM broadcast 
station array, the Public Mobile Service licensee must notify the 
licensee of the AM broadcast station in advance of the planned 
construction or modification. Measurements must be made to determine 
whether the construction or modification affected the AM station antenna 
pattern. The Public Mobile Service licensee is responsible for the 
installation and continued maintenance of any detuning apparatus 
necessary to restore proper performance of the AM station array.


<R05>
Sec. 22.373  Access to transmitters.

building radiation systems, must be installed such that they are readily 
accessible only to persons authorized by the licensee to operate or 
service them.
    (b) Transmitters must be designed and installed such that any 
adjustments or controls that could cause the transmitter to deviate from 
its authorized operating parameters are readily accessible only to 
persons authorized by the licensee to make such adjustments.
    (c) Transmitters (other than hand-carried or pack-carried mobile 
transmitters) and control points must be equipped with a means of 
indicating when the control circuitry has been put in a condition that 
should cause the transmitter to radiate.
    (d) Transmitters must be designed such that they can be turned off 
independently of any remote control circuits.
    (e) Transmitters used with in-building radiation systems must be 
installed such that, to the extent possible, they are readily accessible 
only to persons authorized by the licensee to access them.
    (f) Transmitters used with in-building radiation systems must be 
designed such that, in the event an unauthorized person does gain 
access, that person can not cause the transmitter to deviate from its 
authorized operating parameters in such a way as to cause interference 
to other stations.


<R05>
Sec. 22.377  Type-acceptance of transmitters.

    Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, transmitters 
used in the Public Mobile Services, including those used with signal 
boosters, in-building radiation systems and cellular repeaters, must be 
type-accepted for use in the radio services regulated under this part. 
Transmitters must be type accepted when the station is ready for 
service, not necessarily at the time of filing an application.
    (a) The FCC may list as type-accepted only transmitters that are 
capable of meeting all technical requirements of the rules governing the 
service in which they will operate. The procedure for obtaining type-
acceptance is set forth in part 2 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 22.379  Replacement of equipment.

    Licensees may replace any equipment in Public Mobile Service 
stations without applying for authorization or notifying the FCC, 
provided that:
    (a) If a transmitter is replaced, the replacement transmitter must 
be type-accepted for use in the Public Mobile Services;
    (b) The antenna structure must not become a hazard to air navigation 
and its height must not be not increased;
    (c) The interference potential of the station must not be increased;
    (d) The Effective radiated power, emission type, antenna radiation 
pattern and center of radiation height above average terrain are not 
changed.


<R05>
Sec. 22.381  Auxiliary test transmitters.

    Auxiliary test transmitters may be used only for testing the 
performance of fixed receiving equipment located remotely from the 
control point. Auxiliary test transmitters may transmit only on channels 
designated for mobile transmitters.


<R05>
Sec. 22.383  In-building radiation systems.

    Licensees may install and operate in-building radiation systems 
without applying for authorization or notifying the FCC, provided that 
the locations of the in-building radiation systems are within the

<R04>
                 Subpart D--Developmental Authorizations


<R05>
Sec. 22.401  Description and purposes of developmental authorizations.

    Communications common carriers may apply for, and the FCC may grant, 
authority to construct and operate one or more transmitters subject to 
the rules in this subpart and other limitations, waivers and/or 
conditions that may be prescribed. Authorizations granted on this basis 
are developmental authorizations. In general, the FCC grants 
developmental authorizations in situations and circumstances where it 
cannot reasonably be determined in advance whether a particular 
transmitter can be operated or a particular service can be provided 
without causing interference to the service of existing stations. For 
example, the FCC may grant developmental authorizations for:
    (a) Field strength surveys to evaluate the technical suitability of 
antenna locations for stations in the Public Mobile Services;
    (b) Experimentation leading to the potential development of a new 
Public Mobile Service or technology; or,
    (c) Stations transmitting on channels in certain frequency ranges, 
to provide a trial period during which it can be individually determined 
whether such stations can operate without causing excessive interference 
to existing services.


<R05>
Sec. 22.403  General limitations.

    The provisions and requirements of this section are applicable to 
all developmental authorizations.
    (a) Developmental authorizations are granted subject to the 
condition that they may be cancelled by the FCC at any time, upon notice 
to the licensee, and without the opportunity for a hearing.
    (b) Except as otherwise indicated in this subpart, developmental 
authorizations normally terminate one year from the date of grant. The 
FCC may, however, specify a different term.
    (c) Stations operating under developmental authorizations must not 
interfere with the services of regularly authorized stations.
    (d) A grant of a developmental authorization does not provide any 
assurance that the FCC will grant an application for regular 
authorization to operate the same transmitter(s), even if operation 
during the developmental period has not caused interference and/or the 
developmental program is successful.


<R05>
Sec. 22.409  Developmental authorization for a new Public Mobile Service or technology.

    The FCC may grant applications for developmental authority to 
construct and operate transmitters for the purpose of developing a new 
Public Mobile Service or a new technology not regularly authorized under 
this part, subject to the requirements of this section. Such 
applications may request the use of any portion of the spectrum 
allocated for Public Mobile Services in the Table of Frequency 
Allocations contained in part 2 of this chapter, regardless of whether 
that spectrum is regularly available under this part. Requests to use 
any portion of the spectrum for a service or purpose other than that 
indicated in the Table of Frequency Allocations in part 2 of this 
chapter may be made only in accordance with the provisions of part 5 of 
this chapter.
    (a) Preliminary determination. The FCC will make a preliminary 
determination with respect to the factors in paragraphs (a)(1) through 
(a)(3) of this section before acting on an application for developmental 
authority pursuant to this section. These factors are:
    (1) That the public interest, convenience or necessity warrants 
consideration of the establishment of the proposed service or 
technology;
    (2) That the proposal appears to have potential value to the public 
that could warrant the establishment of the new service or technology;
    (3) That some operational data should be developed for consideration 
in any rule making proceeding which may be initiated to establish such 
service or technology.
    (b) Petition required. Applications for developmental authorizations 
pursuant to this section must be accompanied by

[[Page 130]]

a petition for rule making requesting the FCC to amend its rules as may 
be necessary to provide for the establishment of the proposed service or 
technology.
    (c) Application requirements. Authorizations for developmental 
authority pursuant to this section will be issued only upon a showing 
that the applicant has a definite program of research and development 
which has reasonable promise of substantial contribution to the services 
authorized by this part. The application must contain an exhibit 
demonstrating the applicant's technical qualifications to conduct the 
research and development program, including a description of the nature 
and extent of engineering facilities that the applicant has available 
for such purpose. Additionally, the FCC may, in its discretion, require 
a showing of financial qualification.
    (d) Communication service for hire prohibited. Stations authorized 
under developmental authorizations granted pursuant to this section must 
not be used to provide communication service for hire, unless otherwise 
specifically authorized by the FCC.
    (e)  Adherence to program. Carriers granted developmental 
authorization pursuant to this section must substantially adhere to the 
program of research and development described in their application for 
developmental authorization, unless the FCC directs otherwise.
    (f) Report requirements. Upon completion of the program of research 
and development, or upon the expiration of the developmental 
authorization under which such program was permitted, or at such times 
during the term of the station authorization as the FCC may deem 
necessary to evaluate the progress of the developmental program, the 
licensee shall submit a comprehensive report, containing:
    (1) A description of the progress of the program and a detailed 
analysis of any result obtained;
    (2) Copies of any publications produced by the program;
    (3) A listing of any patents applied for, including copies of any 
patents issued;
    (4) Copies of any marketing surveys or other measures of potential 
public demand for the new service;
    (5) A description of the carrier's experiences with operational 
aspects of the program including--
    (i) The duration of transmissions on each channel or frequency range 
and the technical parameters of such transmissions; and,
    (ii) Any interference complaints received as a result of operation 
and how these complaints were investigated and resolved.
    (g) Confidentiality. Normally, applications and developmental 
reports are a part of the FCC's public records. However, an applicant or 
licensee may request that the FCC withhold from public records specific 
exhibits, reports and other material associated with a developmental 
authorization.
    (h) Renewal. Expiring developmental authorizations issued pursuant 
to this section may be renewed if the carrier--
    (1) Shows that further progress in the program of research and 
development requires additional time to operate under developmental 
authorization;
    (2) Complied with the reporting requirements of paragraph (e) of 
this section; and,
    (3) Immediately resolved to the FCC's satisfaction all complaints of 
interference caused by the station operating under developmental 
authority.


<R05>
Sec. 22.411  Developmental authorization of 43 MHz paging transmitters.

    Because of the potential for interference to the intermediate 
frequency stages of receivers in broadcast television sets and video 
recorders, 43 MHz paging channels are assigned only under developmental 
authorizations subject to the requirements of this section, except as 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (a) Carrier responsibility. Carriers so authorized shall operate the 
43 MHz paging service under developmental authority for a period of two 
years. During the two year developmental period, carriers must resolve 
any broadcast television receiver intermediate frequency interference 
problems that may occur as a result of operation of the 43 MHz paging 
transmitter(s). Carriers

[[Page 131]]

shall inform subscribers receiving service on the channels assigned 
under developmental authority during the developmental period that this 
service could be terminated by the FCC on short notice if such action 
were to become necessary to eliminate interference. Carriers shall 
notify the appropriate FCC Field Office, in advance, of the date on 
which service to subscribers is to begin.
    (b) Periodic surveys. To determine the extent of any interference to 
broadcast television receivers resulting from operation of 43 MHz paging 
stations authorized pursuant to this section, carriers shall conduct 
semi-annual surveys during the first two years of operation. The first 
such survey is to begin on the date when service to subscribers 
commences. For each survey, the carrier shall contact at least 25 
television viewers to determine whether they have experienced 
interference.
    (1) The carrier shall contact viewers located throughout the 
geographic area encompassed by a 3 kilometer (2 mile) radius of the 43 
MHz paging transmitter antenna site. The carrier must not attempt to 
obtain a misleading survey by contacting only viewers less likely to be 
experiencing interference. For example, the carrier must not contact 
only the viewers located most distant from the paging transmitter 
antenna site. Instead, the carrier shall contact viewers located near 
the paging transmitter antenna site.
    (2) The carrier shall not, in subsequent surveys, contact viewers 
who were contacted in a previous survey; provided that, in the event 
that all of the viewers within 3 kilometers (2 miles) have been 
contacted, viewers located near the paging transmitter antenna site 
shall be contacted again.
    (c) Periodic reports. Following each survey, the carrier shall 
submit to the FCC a written report disclosing and evaluating the extent 
of any interference. These reports must include:
    (1) The number of the report (1 to 4);
    (2) The station call sign;
    (3) The file number of the application that resulted in the 
developmental authorization;
    (4) An exact description of the transmitter location(s);
    (5) The date(s) and time of day when the survey was conducted;
    (6) The survey method used (e.g. telephone, on-site, etc.);
    (7) The names, addresses and telephone numbers of the viewers 
contacted;
    (8) If interference resulted from operation of the 43 MHz paging 
station, a summary of how the interference problem was resolved;
    (9) The names and telephone numbers of any technical personnel 
consulted and/or employed to resolve interference problems.
    (d) Exceptions. The FCC may grant a regular authorization in the 
Paging and Radiotelephone Service for a 43 MHz paging station in the 
following circumstances:
    (1) After the two-year developmental period, provided that broadcast 
TV interference complaints have been resolved by the carrier in a 
satisfactory manner. Licensees that hold a developmental authorization 
for a 43 MHz paging station and wish to request a regular authorization 
must file an application (FCC Form 600) prior to the expiration of the 
developmental period.
    (2) In the case of the assignment of or a transfer of control of a 
regular authorization of a 43 MHz paging station in the Paging and 
Radiotelephone Service, provided that the station has been in continuous 
operation providing service with no substantial interruptions.

Sec. 22.413  Developmental authorization of 72-76 MHz fixed transmitters.

    Because of the potential for interference with the reception by 
broadcast television sets and video recorders of full service TV 
stations transmitting on TV Channels 4 and 5, 72-76 MHz channels are 
assigned for use within 16 kilometers (10 miles) of the antenna of any 
full service TV station transmitting on TV Channel 4 or 5 only under 
developmental authorizations subject to the requirements of this 
section, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (a) Carrier responsibility. Carriers so authorized shall operate the 
72-76 MHz

[[Page 132]]

fixed station under developmental authority for a period of at least six 
months. During the developmental period, carriers must resolve any 
broadcast television receiver interference problems that may occur as a 
result of operation of the 72-76 MHz transmitter(s).
    (b) Exceptions. The FCC may grant a regular authorization in the 
Paging and Radiotelephone Service for a 72-76 MHz fixed station under 
the following circumstances:
    (1) After six months of operation under developmental authorization, 
and provided that broadcast TV interference complaints have been 
resolved by the carrier in a satisfactory manner, the FCC may grant a 
regular authorization. Licensees that hold a developmental authorization 
for a 72-76 MHz fixed station and wish to request a regular 
authorization must file an application (FCC Form 600) prior to the 
expiration of the developmental authorization.
    (2) In the case of the assignment of or a transfer of control of a 
regular authorization of a 72-76 MHz fixed station in the Paging and 
Radiotelephone Service, the FCC may grant such assignment or consent to 
such transfer of control provided that the station has been in

Sec. 22.415  Developmental authorization of 928-960 MHz fixed transmitters.

    Channels in the 928-929 MHz and 952-960 MHz ranges may be assigned 
under developmental authorizations to fixed transmitters in point-to-
multipoint systems at locations that are short-spaced (i.e. do not meet 
the 113 kilometer (70 mile) separation requirement of Sec. 22.625), 
subject to the requirements of this section.
    (a) Carrier responsibility. Applications for developmental 
authorizations pursuant to this section must contain an engineering 
analysis that shows that no interference will be caused or received. 
Carriers so authorized shall operate the short-spaced transmitter for a 
period of one year.
    (b) Exceptions. The FCC may grant a regular authorization in the 
Paging and Radiotelephone Service for a short-spaced fixed station under 
the following circumstances:
    (1) After one year of operation under developmental authorization, 
and provided that no interference has been caused, the FCC may grant a 
regular authorization. Licensees that hold a developmental authorization 
and wish to request a regular authorization must file an application 
(FCC Form 600) prior to the expiration of the developmental 
authorization.
    (2) In the case of the assignment of or a transfer of control of a 
regular authorization of a short-spaced fixed station in the Paging and

rural radiotelephone service under the following circumstances:
    (1) After one year of operation under developmental authorization, 
and provided that no interference has been caused to other operations, 
the FCC may grant a regular authorization. Licensees that hold a 
developmental authorization to use meteor burst propagation modes to 
provide rural radiotelephone service and wish to request a regular 
authorization must file an application (FCC Form 600) prior to the 
expiration of the developmental authorization.
    (2) In the case of the assignment of or a transfer of control of a 
regular authorization of a central office or rural subscriber station 
authorizing the use of meteor burst propagation modes in the Rural 
Radiotelephone Service, the FCC may grant such assignment or consent to 
such transfer of control provided that the station has been in operation 
providing service with no substantial interruptions.

              Subpart E--Paging and Radiotelephone Service


<R05>
Sec. 22.501  Scope.

    The rules in this subpart govern the licensing and operation of 
public mobile paging and radiotelephone stations. The licensing and 
operation of these stations are also subject to rules elsewhere in this 
part that apply generally to the Public Mobile Services. However, in 
case of conflict, the rules in this subpart govern.


<R05>
Sec. 22.507  Number of transmitters per station.

    This section concerns the number of transmitters licensed under each 
station authorization in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service. Each 
station must have at least one transmitter. There is no limit to the 
number of transmitters that a station may comprise. However, 
transmitters within a station should be operationally related and/or 
should serve the same general geographical area. Operationally related 
transmitters are those that operate together as a system (e.g. trunked 
systems, simulcast systems), rather than independently. Furthermore, the 
FCC may split wide-area systems into two or more stations for 
administrative convenience. Except for nationwide paging and other 
operationally related transmitters, transmitters that are widely 
separated geographically are not licensed under a single authorization. 
The FCC may consolidate separately authorized stations upon request (FCC 
Form 600) of the licensee, if appropriate under this section.

    Note to Sec. 22.507: Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 22.507, 
until further notice there can be no more than 99 transmitters per 
station.

Sec. 22.509   Procedures for mutually exclusive applications in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service.

    Mutually exclusive applications in the Paging and Radiotelephone 
Service, including those that are mutually exclusive with applications 
in the Rural Radiotelephone Service, are processed in accordance with 
Sec. 22.131 and with this section.
    (a) Applications in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service may be 
mutually exclusive with applications in the Rural Radiotelephone Service 
if they seek authorization to operate facilities on the same channel in 
the same area, or the technical proposals are otherwise in conflict. See 
Sec. 22.567.
    (b) A modification application in either service filed on the 
earliest filing date may cause all later-filed mutually exclusive 
applications of any type in either service to be ``cut off'' (excluded 
from a same-day filing group) and dismissed, pursuant to 
Sec. 22.131(c)(3)(ii) and Sec. 22.131(c)(4).
    (c) Competitive bidding will not be used as a selection procedure 
for any filing group that contains one or more applications for 
facilities in the Rural Radio Service. If a settlement between the 
applicants cannot be reached in a reasonable time, the applications may 
be designated for comparative consideration in a hearing. See 
Sec. 22.13(c)(4)(ii).

    (b) Basic power limit. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the ERP of transmitters on the VHF channels must not exceed 500 
Watts.
    (c) Height-power limit. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the ERP of transmitters on the VHF channels must not exceed the 
amount that would result in an average distance to the service contour 
of 32.2 kilometers (20 miles). The average distance to the service 
contour is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of the distances 
determined using the procedures specified in Sec. 22.537 for the eight 
cardinal radial directions, excluding cardinal radial directions for 
which 90% or more of the distance so calculated is over water.
    (d) Encompassed interfering contour areas. Transmitters are exempt 
from the basic power and height-power limits of this section if the area 
within their interfering contours is totally encompassed by the 
interfering contours of operating co-channel base transmitters 
controlled by the same licensee. For the purpose of this paragraph, 
operating transmitters are authorized transmitters that are providing 
service to subscribers.
    (e) Adjacent channel protection. The ERP of transmitters must not 
exceed 500 Watts if they:
    (1) Transmit on a channel in the 152-159 MHz frequency range and are 
located less than 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) from any station licensed in 
the Private Radio Services that receives on an adjacent channel; or,

[[Page 136]]

    (2) Transmit on channel 158.10 or 158.70 MHz and are located less 
than 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) from any station licensed in the Public 
Mobile Services that receives on either of the following adjacent 
channels: 158.07 MHz or 158.67 MHz.
    (f) Signal boosters. The effective radiated power of signal boosters 
must not exceed 5 watts ERP under any normal operating condition.

Sec. 22.537  Technical channel assignment criteria.

    The rules in this section establish technical assignment criteria 
for the channels listed in Sec. 22.531. These criteria permit channel 
assignments to be made in a manner such that reception by public paging 
receivers of signals from base transmitters, within the service area of 
such base transmitters, is protected from interference caused by the 
operation of independent co-channel base transmitters.
    (a) Contour overlap. The FCC may grant an application requesting 
assignment of a channel to a proposed base transmitter only if:
    (1) The interfering contour of the proposed transmitter does not 
overlap the service contour of any protected co-channel transmitter 
controlled by a carrier other than the applicant, unless that carrier 
has agreed in writing to accept any interference that may result from 
operation of the proposed transmitter; and,
    (2) The service contour of the proposed transmitter does not overlap 
the interfering contour of any protected co-channel transmitter 
controlled by a carrier other than the applicant, unless the applicant 
agrees to accept any interference that may result from operation of the 
protected co-channel transmitter; and,
    (3) The area and/or population to which service would be provided by 
the proposed transmitter is substantial, and service gained would exceed 
that lost as a result of agreements to accept interference.
    (b) Protected transmitter. For the purposes of this section, 
protected transmitters are authorized transmitters for which there is a 
current FCC public record and transmitters proposed in prior-filed 
pending applications.
    (c) VHF service contour. For paging stations transmitting on the VHF 
channels, the distance from the transmitting antenna to the service 
contour along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows:
d=1.243 x h<SUP>0.40 x p<SUP>0.20
where d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts
    (1) Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 
must be used as the value for h in the above formula.
    (2) The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than 
27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction or 0.1 Watt, whichever 
is more.
    (3) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the service 
contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is 
routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function 
of angle. However, in resolving petitions to deny, the FCC may calculate 
the distance to the service contour using the formula in paragraph (c) 
of this section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the inter-station 
radial and additional radials above and below the inter-station radial 
at 2.5 deg. intervals.
    (d) VHF interfering contour. For paging stations transmitting on the 
VHF channels, the distance from the transmitting antenna to the 
interfering contour along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows:
d=6.509 x h<SUP>0.28 x p<SUP>0.17
where d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts
    (1) Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 
must be used as the value for h in the above formula.
    (2) The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than 
27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction or 0.1 Watt, whichever 
is more.
    (3) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the interfering 
contour along any radial other than the eight

[[Page 137]]

cardinal radials is routinely calculated by linear interpolation of 
distance as a function of angle. In resolving petitions to deny, 
however, the FCC may calculate the distance to the interfering contour 
using the formula in paragraph (d) of this section with actual HAAT and 
ERP data for the inter-station radial and additional radials above and 
below the inter-station radial at 2.5 deg. intervals.
    (e) 931 MHz service contour. For paging stations transmitting on the 
931 MHz channels, the service contour is a circle, centered on the 
transmitting antenna, with a radius determined from Table E-1 of this 
section.

Sec. 22.539  Additional channel policies.

    The rules in this section govern the processing of applications for 
a paging channel when the applicant has applied for or been granted an 
authorization for other paging channels in the same geographic area. 
This section applies to applications proposing to use the channels 
listed in Sec. 22.531, excluding the nationwide network paging channels 
and broadcast station subcarriers, or the channels listed in 
Sec. 22.561, where the application proposes to use those channels to 
provide paging service only. The general policy of the FCC is to assign 
one paging channel in an area to a carrier per application cycle. That 
is, a carrier must apply for one paging channel, receive the 
authorization, construct the station, provide service to subscribers, 
and notify the FCC of commencement of service to subscribers (FCC Form 
489) before applying for an additional paging channel in that area.
    (a) VHF transmitters in same area. Any transmitter on any VHF 
channel listed in Sec. 22.531 is considered to be in the same geographic 
area as another transmitter on any other VHF channel listed in 
Sec. 22.531 if:
    (1) One transmitter location is within the service area of the other 
transmitter; or,
    (2) the area within the overlap of the service contours of the two 
transmitters constitutes 50 percent or more of the service area of 
either of the transmitters.
    (b) 931 MHz transmitters in same area. Any transmitter on any 931 
MHz channel is considered to be in the same geographic area as another 
transmitter on any channel listed in Sec. 22.531 if it is located less 
than 64.4 kilometers (40 miles) from the transmitter. Likewise, any 
transmitter on any channel listed in Sec. 22.531 is considered to be in 
the same geographic area as another transmitter on any 931 MHz channel 
if it is located less than 64.4 kilometers (40 miles) from that 
transmitter.
    (c) Initial channel. The FCC will not assign more than one channel 
for new paging stations. Paging stations are considered to be new if 
there are no authorized transmitters on any channel listed in 
Sec. 22.531 controlled by the applicant in the same geographic area.
    (d) Additional channel. Applications for transmitters to be located 
in the same geographic area as an authorized station controlled by the 
applicant, but to operate on a different channel, are considered as 
requesting an additional channel for the authorized station, unless 
paragraph (e) of this section applies.
    (e) Additional transmitters on same channel. Notwithstanding other 
provisions of this section, applications for transmitters to be located 
in the same geographic area as an authorized station controlled by the 
applicant, and to operate on the same paging channel, are not considered 
to be requests for an additional paging channel.
    (f) Amendment of pending application. If the FCC receives and 
accepts for filing an application for a transmitter to be located in the 
same geographic area as a transmitter proposed in a pending application 
previously filed by the applicant, but on a different channel, the 
subsequent application is considered as a major amendment to change the 
technical proposal of the prior application, unless paragraph (e) 
applies. The filing date of any application so amended is the date the 
FCC received the subsequent application.
    (g) Dismissal of premature applications for additional channel. If 
the FCC receives an application requesting an additional channel for an 
authorized station prior to receiving notification that the station is 
providing service to subscribers on the authorized channel(s), the FCC 
may dismiss that application without prejudice in accordance with 
Sec. 22.128.


<R05>
Sec. 22.551  Nationwide network paging service.

    The rules in this section govern the application for and provision 
of nationwide network paging service on the channels reserved 
specifically for such service in Sec. 22.531(b).
    (a) Nationwide network organizers. If and when a nationwide network 
paging channel becomes available for assignment, the FCC will issue a 
Public Notice inviting applications from carriers

[[Page 139]]

seeking to organize a nationwide network paging service. The Public 
Notice will provide complete details regarding application requirements 
and procedures.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Affiliated local carriers. Parties seeking to become affiliated 
local carriers in a nationwide network paging service must have specific 
completed contracts with the network organizer with which they are 
proposing to affiliate. Applications may contain a letter, in lieu of 
the contracts, indicating that the applicant has a completed contract 
with the organizer.
    (d) Liability for technical operation. Nationwide network organizers 
and affiliated local carriers are jointly and severally liable for the 
technical operation of the local network stations.


<R05>
Sec. 22.559  One-way paging application requirements.

    In addition to information required by Subparts b and d of this part 
and Sec. 22.529, applications for authorization to operate a paging 
transmitter on the channels listed in Sec. 22.531 must contain the 
applicable supplementary information described in this section.
    (a) Interference exhibit. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section, an exhibit demonstrating compliance with Sec. 22.537 with 
regard to protected transmitters is required for applications to operate 
a transmitter on the VHF channels. This exhibit must:
    (1) Identify each protected transmitter located within 109 
kilometers (68 miles) of the proposed transmitter in directions in which 
the distance to the interfering contour is 76.5 kilometers (47.5 miles) 
or less, and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) of the proposed 
transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering 
contour exceeds 76.5 kilometers (47.5 miles).
    (2) For each protected transmitter identified, show the results of 
distance calculations indicating that there would be no overlap of 
service and interfering contours, or alternatively, indicate that the 
licensee of or applicant for the protected transmitter and/or the 
applicant, as required, have agreed in writing to accept any 
interference resulting from operation of the proposed transmitter.
    (b) Encompassment exhibit. An exhibit showing that the area within 
the interfering contour of the proposed transmitter would be totally 
encompassed by interfering contours of operating co-channel base 
transmitters controlled by the applicant is required for applications to 
operate a transmitter with ERP exceeding the basic power and height-
power limits of Sec. 22.535. For VHF transmitters, this encompassment 
exhibit may substitute for the interference exhibit required in 
paragraph (a) of this section.

                   One-Way or Two-Way Mobile Operation


<R05>
Sec. 22.561  Channels for one-way or two-way mobile operation.

    The following channels are allocated for paired assignment to 
transmitters that provide (or support other transmitters that provide) 
one-way or two-way public land mobile service. These channels may be 
assigned for use by mobile or base transmitters as indicated, and to 
fixed transmitters (including control, repeater or other fixed 
transmitters). The mobile channels may also be assigned for use by base 
or fixed transmitters under certain circumstances (see Sec. 22.567(h)). 
Unless otherwise indicated, all channels have a bandwidth of 20 kHz and 
are designated by their center frequencies in MegaHertz.

    (b) Basic power limit. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the ERP of base transmitters must not exceed 500 Watts.
    (c) Height-power limits. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the ERP of base transmitters must not exceed the amount that 
would result in an average distance to the service contour of 41.6 
kilometers (26 miles) for VHF channels or 30.7 kilometers (19 miles) for 
UHF channels. The average distance to the service contour is calculated 
by taking the arithmetic mean of the distances determined using the 
procedures specified in Sec. 22.567 for the eight cardinal radial 
directions, excluding cardinal radial directions for which 90% or more 
of the distance so calculated is over water.
    (d) Encompassed interfering contour areas. Base transmitters are 
exempt from the basic power and height-power limits of this section if 
the area within their interfering contours is totally encompassed by the 
interfering contours of operating co-channel based transmitters 
controlled by the same licensee. For the purpose of this paragraph, 
operating transmitters are authorized transmitters that are providing 
service to subscribers.
    (e) Adjacent channel protection. The ERP of base and fixed 
transmitters must not exceed 500 Watts if they transmit on channel 
454.025 MHz and are located less than 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) from any 
Private Radio Services station receiving on adjacent channel 454.0000 
MHz.
    (f) Mobile transmitters. The transmitter output power of mobile 
transmitters must not exceed 60 watts.
    (g) Other transmitters. The ERP of dispatch and auxiliary test 
transmitters must not exceed 100 watts.

Sec. 22.567  Technical channel assignment criteria.

    The rules in this section establish technical assignment criteria 
for the channels listed in Sec. 22.561. The criteria in paragraphs (a) 
through (f) of this section permit channel assignments to be made in a 
manner such that reception by public mobile receivers of signals from 
base transmitters, within the service area of such base transmitters, is 
protected from interference caused by the operation of independent co-
channel base and fixed transmitters in the Paging and Radiotelephone 
Service and central office stations, including Basic Exchange Telephone 
Radio Systems (BETRS), in the Rural Radiotelephone Service. Additional 
criteria in paragraph (g) of this section permit channel assignments to 
be made in a manner such that BETRS communications are protected from 
interference caused by the operation of independent co-channel base and 
fixed transmitters in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service and other 
central office stations in the Rural Radiotelephone Service. Separate 
criteria in paragraph

[[Page 141]]

(h) of this section apply only to assignment of the channels designated 
in Sec. 22.561 as mobile channels to base and fixed transmitters, and 
permit these channel assignments to be made in a manner such that 
reception by public base and fixed receivers of signals from associated 
mobile and fixed transmitters is protected from interference caused by 
the operation of independent co-channel base and fixed transmitters.
    (a) Contour overlap. The FCC may grant an application requesting 
assignment of a channel to a proposed base, fixed or central office 
station transmitter only if:
    (1) The interfering contour of the proposed transmitter does not 
overlap the service contour of any protected co-channel transmitter 
controlled by a carrier other than the applicant, unless that carrier 
has agreed in writing to accept any interference that may result from 
operation of the proposed transmitter; and
    (2) The service contour of the proposed transmitter does not overlap 
the interfering contour of any protected co-channel transmitter 
controlled by a carrier other than the applicant, unless the application 
contains a statement that the applicant agrees to accept any 
interference that may result from operation of the protected co-channel 
transmitter; and
    (3) The area and/or population to which service would be provided by 
the proposed transmitter is substantial, and service gained would exceed 
that lost as a result of agreements to accept interference.
    (b) Protected transmitter. For the purposes of this section, 
protected transmitters are authorized transmitters for which there is a 
current FCC public record and transmitters proposed in prior-filed 
pending applications, in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service and the 
Rural Radiotelephone Service.
    (c) VHF service contour. For base stations transmitting on the VHF 
channels, the radial distance from the transmitting antenna to the 
service contour along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows:

d=1.609 x h<SUP>0.40  x p<SUP>0.20

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts
    (1) Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 
must be used as the value for h in the above formula.
    (2) The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than 
27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction, or 0.1 Watt, whichever 
is more.
    (3) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the service 
contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is 
routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function 
of angle. However, in resolving petitions to deny, the FCC may calculate 
the distance to the service contour using the formula in paragraph (c) 
of this section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the inter-station 
radial and additional radials above and below the inter-station radial 
at 2.5 deg. intervals.
    (d) VHF interfering contour. For base and fixed stations 
transmitting on the VHF channels, the radial distance from the 
transmitting antenna to the interfering contour along each cardinal 
radial is calculated as follows:
    (1) If the radial antenna HAAT is less than 150 meters:

d=8.577 x h<SUP>0.24 x p<SUP>0.19

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 must 
be used as the value for h in the above formula.
    (2) If the radial antenna HAAT is 150 meters or more:

d=12.306 x h<SUP>0.23 x p<SUP>0.14

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    (3) The value used for p in the above formulas must not be less than 
27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction, or 0.1 Watt, whichever 
is more.
    (4) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the interfering 
contour along any radial other than the eight

[[Page 142]]

cardinal radials is routinely calculated by linear interpolation of 
distance as a function of angle. However, in resolving petitions to 
deny, the FCC may calculate the distance to the interfering contour 
using the appropriate formula in paragraph (d) of this section with 
actual HAAT and ERP data for the inter-station radial and additional 
radials above and below the inter-station radial at 2.5 deg. intervals.
    (e) UHF service contour. For base stations transmitting on the UHF 
channels, the radial distance from the transmitting antenna to the 
service contour along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows:

d=1.726 x h<SUP>0.35 x p<SUP>0.18

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    (1) Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 
must be used as the value for h in the above formula.
    (2) The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than 
27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction, or 0.1 Watt, whichever 
is more.
    (3) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the service 
contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is 
routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function 
of angle. However, in resolving petitions to deny, the FCC may calculate 
the distance to the service contour using the formula in paragraph (e) 
of this section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the inter-station 
radial and addition radials above and below the below the inter-station 
radial at 2.5 deg. intervals.
    (f) UHF interfering contour. For base and fixed stations 
transmitting on the UHF channels, the radial distance from the 
transmitting antenna to the interfering contour along each cardinal 
radial is calculated as follows:
    (1) If the radial antenna HAAT is less than 150 meters:

d=9.471 x h<SUP>0.23 x p<SUP>0.15

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 must 
be used as the value for h in the above formula.
    (2) If the radial antenna HAAT is 150 meters or more:

d=6.336 x h<SUP>0.31 x p<SUP>0.15

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    (3) The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than 
27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction, or 0.1 Watt, whichever 
is more.
    (4) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the interfering 
contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is 
routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function 
of angle. However, in resolving petitions to deny, the FCC may calculate 
the distance to the interfering contour using the appropriate formula in 
paragraph (f) of this section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the 
inter-station radial and additional radials above and below the inter-
station radial at 2.5 deg. intervals.
    (g) Protection for BETRS. In applying the provisions of paragraph 
(a) of this section, if either or both of the transmitters involved is a 
BETRS central office station, the following contour substitutions must 
be used:
    (1) The service contour of the BETRS central office station(s) is a 
circle, centered on the central office station antenna, with a radius of 
40 kilometers (25 miles).
    (2) The interfering contour of any station of any type, when 
determining whether it would overlap the service contour of a BETRS 
central office station, is calculated as follows:

d=36.364 x h<SUP>0.2 x  p<SUP>0.1

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 must 
be used as the value for h in the above formula. The value used for p in 
the above

[[Page 143]]

formula must not be less than 27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any 
direction, or 0.1 Watt, whichever is more.
    (h) Assignment of mobile channels to base or fixed transmitters. 
Mobile channels may be assigned to base or fixed transmitters if the 
following criteria are met:
    (1) The paired base channel, as designated in Sec. 22.561, is 
assigned to base transmitters in the same geographical area operated by 
the same licensee.
    (2) The authorization is granted subject to the condition that no 
interference be caused to fixed receivers in use on or prior to the date 
of the grant.


<R05>
Sec. 22.569  Additional channel policies.

    The rules in this section govern the processing of applications for 
a mobile channel when the applicant has applied or been granted an 
authorization for other mobile channels in the same geographic area. 
This section applies to applications proposing to use the channels 
listed in Sec. 22.561, except applications that propose to use these 
channels to provide paging service only, which are subject to 
Sec. 22.539, instead of this section. The general policy of the FCC is 
to assign no more than two channels in an area to a carrier per 
application cycle. That is, a carrier must apply for no more than two 
channels, receive the authorization, construct the station, provide 
service to subscribers, and notify the FCC of commencement of service to 
subscribers (FCC Form 489) before applying for additional mobile 
channels in that area.
    (a) Transmitters in same area. Any transmitter on any channel listed 
in Sec. 22.561 is considered to be in the same geographic area as 
another transmitter or any other channel listed in Sec. 22.561 if:
    (1) One transmitter location is within the service area of the other 
transmitter; or,
    (2) The area within the overlap of the service contours of the two 
transmitters constitutes 50 percent or more of the service area of 
either of the transmitters.
    (b) Initial channel. The FCC will not assign more than two channels 
for new stations. Stations are considered to be new if there are no 
authorized transmitters on any channel listed in Sec. 22.561 controlled 
by the applicant in the same geographic area.
    (c) Additional channel. Applications for transmitters to be located 
in the same geographic area as an authorized station controlled by the 
applicant, but to operate on a different channel, are considered as 
requests for an additional channel for the authorized station, unless 
paragraph (d) of this section applies.
    (d) Additional transmitters on same channel. Notwithstanding other 
provisions of this section, applications for transmitters to be located 
in the same geographic area as an authorized station controlled by the 
applicant, and to operate on the same channel, are not considered as 
requests for an additional channel.
    (e) [Reserved]
    (f) Dismissal of application constituting cumulative request for 
more than two channels. If the FCC receives an application for a 
transmitter to be located in the same geographic area as a transmitter 
proposed in a pending application previously filed by the applicant, but 
on different channels such that, considered together, the applications 
would constitute a request for more than two channels, the FCC may 
dismiss the subsequent application without prejudice.
    (g) Dismissal of premature applications for additional channel. If 
the FCC receives an application requesting two additional channels (or 
one additional channel) for an authorized station prior to receiving 
notification that the station is providing service to subscribers on all 
(or all except one) of the authorized channels, the FCC may dismiss that 
application without prejudice.


<R05>
Sec. 22.571  Responsibility for mobile stations.

    Mobile stations that are subscribers in good standing to a two-way 
service in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service, when receiving service 
from that station, are considered to be operating under the 
authorization of that station. Licensees are responsible for exercising 
effective operational control over mobile stations receiving service 
through their stations. Mobile stations that are subscribers in good 
standing

[[Page 144]]

to a two-way service in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service, while 
receiving service from a different station, are considered to be 
operating under the authorization of such different station. The 
licensee of such different station is responsible, during such temporary 
period, for exercising effective operational control over such mobile 
stations as if they were subscribers to it.


<R05>
Sec. 22.573  Use of base transmitters as repeaters.

    As an additional function, base transmitters may be used as 
repeaters. Licensees must be able to turn the base transmitter on or off 
from the control point regardless of whether a subscriber-operated 
transmitter is transmitting.


<R05>
Sec. 22.575  Use of mobile channel for remote control of station functions.

    Carriers may remotely control station functions (e.g. shut down or 
reactivate base transmitters, turn aviation obstruction warning lights 
on or off, etc.) using a control transmitter operating on a mobile 
channel, subject to the conditions in this section and in 
Sec. 22.567(h).
    (a) The control transmitter must be capable of overriding 
transmissions from subscriber-operated transmitters if necessary. 
Subscriber-operated transmitters must not be capable of being used to 
deliberately or accidentally prevent the licensee from controlling the 
station.
    (b) The licensee must implement measures designed to prevent station 
functions from being controlled by persons not authorized by the 
licensee to control the station.
    (c) The control transmitter location must be within the composite 
service contour of the licensee's authorized station on the paired base 
channel.


<R05>
Sec. 22.577  Dispatch service.

    Carriers licensed under this subpart may provide dispatch service in 
accordance with the rules in this section.
    (a) Installation without prior FCC approval. A station licensee may 
install or remove dispatch points for subscribers without obtaining 
prior FCC approval. A station licensee may install or remove dispatch 
transmitters for subscribers without applying for specific 
authorization, provided that the following conditions are met.
    (1) Each dispatch transmitter must be able to transmit only on the 
mobile channel that is paired with the channel used by the base station.
    (2) The antenna of the dispatch transmitter must not exceed the 
criteria in Sec. 17.7 of this chapter that determine whether the FAA 
must be notified of the proposed construction.
    (3) The output power of the dispatch transmitter must not exceed 10 
Watts.
    (4) The dispatch transmitter must be incapable of overriding the 
functioning of any control transmitter that may be using the same 
channel.
    (5) The dispatch transmitter must be under the continuous 
supervision of the licensee.
    (b) Notification. Licensees must notify the FCC (FCC Form 489) 
whenever a dispatch transmitter is installed pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this section. The notification must include the name and address of 
the subscriber(s) for which the dispatch transmitter was installed, the 
location of the dispatch transmitter, the height of antenna structure 
above ground and above mean sea level, the channel(s) used, and the call 
sign and location of the base station.
    (c) Termination without hearing. Operation of a dispatch transmitter 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be terminated by 
the FCC without a hearing upon notice to the licensee.
    (d) Dispatch transmitters requiring authorization. A dispatch 
transmitter that does not meet all of the requirements of paragraph (a) 
of this section may be installed only upon grant of an application for 
authorization therefor (FCC Form 600).
    (e) Permissible communications. A dispatch transmitter operated by a 
subscriber may communicate only with mobile transmitters operated by 
that subscriber through the associated base transmitter.

Sec. 22.579  Operation of mobile transmitters across U.S.-Canada border.

    Mobile stations licensed by Canada may receive two-way service while 
in the United States from stations licensed under this part, after 
authorization has been granted by the FCC. Mobile stations that normally 
operate under the authority of base stations licensed under this part 
may receive two-way service while in Canada from stations licensed under 
this part or by Canada, upon authorization by Canada.


<R05>
Sec. 22.589  One-way or two-way application requirements.

    In addition to information required by subparts B and D of this part 
and Sec. 22.529, applications for authorization to operate a transmitter 
on the channels listed in Sec. 22.561 must contain the applicable 
supplementary information described in this section.
    (a) Interference exhibit. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section, an exhibit demonstrating compliance with Sec. 22.567 with 
regard to protected transmitters is required. This exhibit must:
    (1) For UHF channels, identify each protected transmitter located 
within 108 kilometers (67 miles) of the proposed transmitter in 
directions in which the distance to the interfering contour is 76.4 
kilometers (47.5 miles) or less, and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) 
of the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the 
interfering contour exceeds 76.4 kilometers (47.5 miles); and identify 
each protected Basic Exchange Telephone Radio System central office 
transmitter in the Rural Radiotelephone Service within 231 kilometers 
(144 miles),
    (2) For VHF channels, identify each protected transmitter located 
within 135 kilometers (84 miles) of the proposed transmitter in 
directions in which the distance to the interfering contour is 93.3 
kilometers (58 miles) or less, and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) of 
the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the 
interfering contour exceeds 93.3 kilometers (58 miles).
    (3) For each protected transmitter identified, show the results of 
distance calculations indicating that there would be no overlap of 
service and interfering contours, or alternatively, indicate that the 
licensee of or applicant for the protected transmitter and/or the 
applicant, as required, have agreed in writing to accept any 
interference resulting from operation of the proposed transmitter.
    (b) Encompassment exhibit. An exhibit showing that the area within 
the interfering contour of the proposed transmitter would be totally 
encompassed by interfering contours of operating co-channel base 
transmitters controlled by the applicant is required for applications to 
operate a transmitter with ERP exceeding the basic power and height-
power limits of Sec. 22.565. This encompassment exhibit may substitute 
for the interference exhibit required in paragraph (a) of this section.

Sec. 22.591  Channels for point-to-point operation.

    The following channels are allocated for assignment to fixed 
transmitters that support other transmitters that provide public mobile 
service. Unless otherwise indicated, all channels have a bandwidth of 20

    (a) The 72-76 MHz channels may be assigned under developmental 
authority pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 22.413. The 72-76 MHz 
channels may also be used in point-to-multipoint configurations. The 72-
76 MHz channels are also allocated for assignment in the Private Radio 
Services (see Part 90 of this chapter).
    (b) Channels in the frequency ranges 2110-2130 and 2160-2180 MHz are 
also allocated for assignment in the broadband Personal Communications 
Service (see part 24 of this chapter), the Multipoint Distribution 
Service and the Point-to-Point Microwave Radio Service (see part 21 of 
this chapter). Assignment of channels in these ranges is subject to the 
transition rules in Sec. 22.602.
    (c) Channels in the frequency ranges 488.250-490.750 and 491.250-
493.750 MHz may be assigned only to inter-island fixed stations located 
in the State of Hawaii.

Sec. 22.593  Effective radiated power limits.

    The effective radiated power of fixed stations operating on the 
channels listed in Sec. 22.591 must not exceed 150 Watts. The equivalent 
isotropic radiated power of fixed stations operating in the frequency 
ranges 2110-2130 and 2160-2180 MHz must not exceed the limits set forth 
in Part 21 of this chapter for stations operating in these frequency 
ranges.


<R05>
Sec. 22.599  Assignment of 72-76 MHz channels.

    Because of the potential for interference to the reception of TV 
Channels 4 and 5 by broadcast television sets and video recorders, 
assignments of the 72-76 MHz channels are subject to the following 
conditions:
    (a) Assignments of 72-76 MHz channels for use within 129 kilometers 
(80 miles) of a full service TV station transmitting on TV Channel 4 or 
5 are subject to the condition that the licensee must eliminate any 
interference caused to television reception on TV Channels 4 and 5. If 
the FCC notifies the licensee of an interference problem and the 
licensee does not resolve the problem within 90 days of such 
notification, operation of the interfering 72-76 MHz fixed station must 
be immediately discontinued.
    (b) 72-76 MHz channels may be assigned for use within 16 kilometers 
(10 miles) of a full service TV station transmitting on TV Channel 4 or 
5 under a developmental authorization, pursuant to Sec. 22.413. However, 
for use within 50 meters (164 feet) of a TV station transmitting on TV 
Channel 4 or 5, 72-76 MHZ channels may be assigned under a regular 
authorization, rather than a developmental authorization.


<R05>
Sec. 22.601  Assignment of microwave channels.

    Assignment of the microwave channels listed in Sec. 22.591 is 
subject to the transition rules in Sec. 22.602. No new systems will be 
authorized under this part.
    (a) Coordination required. Before filing applications for authority 
to modify existing stations on these channels or major amendments to 
such applications, carriers must coordinate the planned channel usage, 
using the procedure outlined in Sec. 22.150, with affected parties in 
this radio service and the Point-to-Point Microwave Service and the 
Multipoint Distribution Service. Affected parties are licensees and 
other applicants with previously filed pending applications whose 
stations could affect or be affected by the proposed modification of the 
existing station in terms of interference.
    (b) System parameters. In designing a system modification, the 
applicant

[[Page 147]]

must select sites, equipment and channels that will avoid harmful 
interference to other users. All parties must cooperate fully and make 
reasonable efforts to resolve technical problems and conflicts that may 
inhibit the most effective and efficient use of the radio spectrum; 
however, a party receiving notification is not obligated to suggest 
changes or re-design a proposal in cases involving conflicts. The 
applicant must identify in the application all parties with which the 
technical proposal was coordinated. In the event that technical problems 
are not resolved or if an affected party does not respond to 
coordination efforts within 30 days after notification, an explanation 
must be contained in the application. Where technical conflicts are 
resolved by an agreement between the parties that requires special 
procedures to reduce the likelihood of harmful interference (such as the 
use of artificial site shielding), or would result in a reduction of 
quality or capacity of either system, the details thereof must be 
contained in the application.
    (c) Bandwidth. Applicants must request the minimum emission 
bandwidth necessary. The FCC does not authorize bandwidths larger than 
800 kHz under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 22.602   Transition of the 2110-2130 and 2160-2180 MHz channels to emerging technologies.

    The microwave channels listed in Sec. 22.591 have been allocated for 
use by emerging technologies (ET) services. No new systems will be 
authorized under this part. The rules in this section provide for a 
transition period during which existing Paging and Radiotelephone 
Service (PARS) licensees using these channels may relocate operations to 
other media or to other fixed channels, including those in other 
microwave bands. For PARS licensees relocating operations to other 
microwave bands, authorization must be obtained under Part 101 of this 
chapter.
    (a) Licensees proposing to implement ET services may negotiate with 
PARS licensees authorized to use these channels, for the purpose of 
agreeing to terms under which the PARS licensees would--
    (1) Relocate their operations to other fixed microwave bands or 
other media, or alternatively,
    (2) Accept a sharing arrangement with the ET licensee that may 
result in an otherwise impermissible level of interference to the PARS 
operations.
    (b) PARS operations on these channels will continue to be co-primary 
with other users of this spectrum until two years after the FCC 
commences acceptance of applications for ET services, and until one year 
after an ET licensee initiates negotiations for relocation of the fixed 
microwave licensee's operations.
    (c) Voluntary Negotiations. During the two year voluntary 
negotiation period, negotiations are strictly voluntary and are not 
defined by any parameters. However, if the parties have not reached an 
agreement within one year after the commencement of the voluntary 
period, the PARS licensee must allow the ET licensee (if it so chooses) 
to gain access to the existing facilities to be relocated so that an 
independent third party can examine the PARS licensee's 2 GHz system and 
prepare an estimate of the cost and the time needed to relocate the PARS 
licensee to comparable facilities. The ET licensee must pay for any such 
estimate.
    (d) Mandatory Negotiations. If a relocation agreement is not reached 
during the two year voluntary period, the ET licensee may initiate a 
mandatory negotiation period. This mandatory period is triggered at the 
option of the ET licensee, but ET licensees may not invoke their right 
to mandatory negotiation until the voluntary negotiation period has 
expired. Once mandatory negotiations have begun, a PARS licensee may not 
refuse to negotiate and all parties are required to negotiate in good 
faith. Good faith requires each party to provide information to the 
other that is reasonably necessary to facilitate the relocation process. 
In evaluating claims that a party has not negotiated in good faith, the 
FCC will consider, inter alia, the following factors:
    (1) Whether the ET licensee has made a bona fide offer to relocate 
the PARS licensee to comparable facilities in accordance with Section 
101.75(b) of this chapter;

[[Page 148]]

    (2) If the PARS licensee has demanded a premium, the type of premium 
requested (e.g., whether the premium is directly related to relocation, 
such as system-wide relocations and analog-to-digital conversions, 
versus other types of premiums), and whether the value of the premium as 
compared to the cost of providing comparable facilities is 
disproportionate (i.e., whether there is a lack of proportion or 
relation between the two);
    (3) What steps the parties have taken to determine the actual cost 
of relocation to comparable facilities;
    (4) Whether either party has withheld information requested by the 
other party that is necessary to estimate relocation costs or to 
facilitate the relocation process. Any party alleging a violation of our 
good faith requirement must attach an independent estimate of the 
relocation costs in question to any documentation filed with the 
Commission in support of its claim. An independent cost estimate must 
include a specification for the comparable facility and a statement of 
the costs associated with providing that facility to the incumbent 
licensee.
    (e) Involuntary period. After the periods specified in paragraph (b) 
of this section have expired, ET licensees may initiate involuntary 
relocation procedures under the Commission's rules. ET licensees are 
obligated to pay to relocate only the specific microwave links to which 
their systems pose an interference problem. Under involuntary 
relocation, a PARS licensee is required to relocate, provided that:
    (1) The ET applicant, provider, licensee or representative 
guarantees payment of relocation costs, including all engineering, 
equipment, site and FCC fees, as well as any legitimate and prudent 
transaction expenses incurred by the PARS licensee that are directly 
attributable to an involuntary relocation, subject to a cap of two 
percent of the hard costs involved. Hard costs are defined as the actual 
costs associated with providing a replacement system, such as equipment 
and engineering expenses. ET licensees are not required to pay PARS 
licensees for internal resources devoted to the relocation process. ET 
licensees are not required to pay for transaction costs incurred by PARS 
licensees during the voluntary or mandatory periods once the involuntary 
period is initiated or for fees that cannot be legitimately tied to the 
provision of comparable facilities;
    (2) The ET applicant, provider, licensee or representative completes 
all activities necessary for implementing the replacement facilities, 
including engineering and cost analysis of the relocation procedure and, 
if radio facilities are involved, identifying and obtaining, on the 
incumbents behalf, new channels and frequency coordination; and,
    (3) The ET applicant, provider, licensee or representative builds 
the replacement system and tests it for comparability with the existing 
2 GHz system.
    (f) Comparable Facilities. The replacement system provided to an 
incumbent during an involuntary relocation must be at least equivalent 
to the existing PARS system with respect to the following three factors:
    (1) Throughput. Communications throughput is the amount of 
information transferred within a system in a given amount of time. If 
analog facilities are being replaced with analog, the ET licensee is 
required to provide the PARS licensee with an equivalent number of 4 kHz 
voice channels. If digital facilities are being replaced with digital, 
the ET licensee must provide the PARS licensee with equivalent data 
loading bits per second (bps). ET licensees must provide PARS licensees 
with enough throughput to satisfy the PARS licensee's system use at the 
time of relocation, not match the total capacity of the PARS system.
    (2) Reliability. System reliability is the degree to which 
information is transferred accurately within a system. ET licensees must 
provide PARS licensees with reliability equal to the overall reliability 
of their system. For digital data systems, reliability is measured by 
the percent of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a desired value, 
and for analog or digital voice transmissions, it is measured by the 
percent of time that audio signal quality meets an established 
threshold. If an analog voice system is replaced with

[[Page 149]]

a digital voice system, only the resulting frequency response, harmonic 
distortion, signal-to-noise ratio and its reliability will be considered 
in determining comparable reliability.
    (3) Operating Costs. Operating costs are the cost to operate and 
maintain the PARS system. ET licensees must compensate PARS licensees 
for any increased recurring costs associated with the replacement 
facilities (e.g. additional rental payments, increased utility fees) for 
five years after relocation. ET licensees may satisfy this obligation by 
making a lump-sum payment based on present value using current interest 
rates. Additionally, the maintenance costs to the PARS licensee must be 
equivalent to the 2 GHz system in order for the replacement system to be 
considered comparable.
    (g) The PARS licensee is not required to relocate until the 
alternative facilities are available to it for a reasonable time to make 
adjustments, determine comparability, and ensure a seamless handoff.
    (h) The Commission's Twelve-Month Trial Period. If, within one year 
after the relocation to new facilities, the PARS licensee demonstrates 
that the new facilities are not comparable to the former facilities, the 
ET applicant, provider, licensee or representative must remedy the 
defects or pay to relocate the PARS licensee to one of the following: 
its former or equivalent 2 GHz channels, another comparable frequency 
band, a land-line system, or any other facility that satisfies the 
requirements specified in paragraph (f) of this section. This trial 
period commences on the date that the PARS licensee begins full 
operation of the replacement link. If the PARS licensee has retained its 
2 GHz authorization during the trial period, it must return the license 
to the Commission at the end of the twelve months.
    (i) After April 25, 1996, all major modifications and extensions to 
existing PARS systems operating on channels in the 2110-2130 and 2160-
2180 MHz bands will be authorized on a secondary basis to future ET 
operations. All other modifications will render the modified PARS 
license secondary to future ET operations unless the incumbent 
affirmatively justifies primary status and the incumbent PARS licensee 
establishes that the modification would not add to the relocation costs 
of ET licensees. Incumbent PARS licensees will maintain primary status 
for the following technical changes:
    (1) Decreases in power;
    (2) Minor changes (increases or decreases) in antenna height;
    (3) Minor location changes (up to two seconds);
    (4) Any data correction which does not involve a change in the 
location of an existing facility;
    (5) Reductions in authorized bandwidth;
    (6) Minor changes (increases or decreases) in structure height;
    (7) Changes (increases or decreases) in ground elevation that do not 
affect centerline height;
    (8) Minor equipment changes.
    (j) Sunset. PARS licensees will maintain primary status in the 2110-
2130 and 2160-2180 MHz bands unless and until an ET licensee requires 
use of the spectrum. ET licensees are not required to pay relocation 
costs after the relocation rules sunset (i.e. ten years after the 
voluntary period begins for the first ET licensees in the service). Once 
the relocation rules sunset, an ET licensee may require the incumbent to 
cease operations, provided that the ET licensee intends to turn on a 
system within interference range of the incumbent, as determined by TIA 
Bulletin 10-F or any standard successor. ET licensee notification to the 
affected PARS licensee must be in writing and must provide the incumbent 
with no less than six months to vacate the spectrum. After the six-month 
notice period has expired, the PARS licensee must turn its license back 
into the Commission, unless the parties have entered into an agreement 
which allows the PARS licensee to continue to operate on a mutually 
agreed upon basis. If the parties cannot agree on a schedule or an 
alternative arrangement, requests for extension will be accepted and 
reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The Commission will grant such 
extensions only if the incumbent can demonstrate that:

[[Page 150]]

    (1) It cannot relocate within the six-month period (e.g., because no 
alternative spectrum or other reasonable option is available), and;
    (2) The public interest would be harmed if the incumbent is forced 
to terminate operations (e.g., if public safety communications services 
would be disrupted).

Sec. 22.603  488-494 MHz fixed service in Hawaii.

    Before filing applications for authorization of inter-island control 
and/or repeater stations, applicants must coordinate the planned channel 
usage with existing licensees and other applicants with previously filed 
applications, using the procedure outlined in Sec. 22.150. Applicants 
and licensees shall cooperate fully and make reasonable efforts to 
resolve any channel usage conflicts. In situations where technical 
solutions to such conflicts cannot be devised, the FCC may select a 
channel or channels to assign or may designate the application(s) for 
hearing. To be acceptable for filing, applications and major technical 
amendments must contain a certification that coordination has been 
completed and an exhibit listing the name(s) of the licensees and 
applicants with which the planned channel usage has been coordinated.

Sec. 22.623  System configuration.

    This section requires a minimum configuration for point-to-
multipoint systems using the channels listed in Sec. 22.621.
    (a) 928-960 MHz. The channels may be assigned, individually or 
paired, only to fixed transmitters in a system that controls at least 
four public mobile base transmitters that transmit on the same channel. 
If a 932-933 MHz channel and a 941-942 MHz channel are assigned as a 
pair, the 941-942 MHz channel must be assigned only to control 
transmitters; the 932-933 MHz channel may be assigned to control or 
fixed relay transmitters.
    (b) 470-512 MHz. These channels may be assigned only individually 
(unpaired), to control transmitters that directly control at least four 
public mobile base transmitters that transmit on the same channel. Fixed 
relay transmitters are not authorized.
    (c) Selection and assignment. The FCC selects and assigns a channel 
when granting applications for authorization to operate a new station to 
transmit in the 470-512, 932-933 and 941-942 MHz frequency ranges. 
Applicants having a preference may request the assignment of a specific 
channel or channel pair, but the FCC may in some cases be unable to 
satisfy such requests.

Sec. 22.625  Transmitter locations.

    This section governs where point-to-multipoint transmitters on the 
channels listed in Sec. 22.621 may be located.
    (a) 928-960 MHz. In this frequency range, the required minimum 
distance separation between co-channel fixed transmitters is 113 
kilometers (70 miles). However, this requirement may be waived if the 
applicant submits an engineering analysis that shows that no 
interference would be caused to either system. In such a case, a 
developmental authorization may be issued (see Sec. 22.415). If no 
interference is experienced during the term of the developmental 
authorization, the licensee may apply for a regular authorization.
    (b) 470-512 MHz. The purpose of the rule in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section is to define the areas in which the 470-512 MHz channels are 
allocated for public mobile use. The purpose of the rules in paragraphs 
(b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section is to reduce the likelihood that 
interference to television reception from public mobile operations on 
these channels will occur.
    (1) Control transmitter locations. Control transmitter locations 
must be within 80 kilometers (50 miles) of the designated locations in 
this paragraph.

    (2) Protection from intermodulation interference. Control 
transmitter locations must be at least 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) from the 
main transmitter locations of all TV stations transmitting on TV 
channels separated by 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, or 8 TV channels from the TV 
channel containing the frequencies on which the control station will 
transmit. This requirement is intended to reduce the likelihood of 
intermodulation interference.
    (3) Co-channel protection from control transmitters with high 
antennas. This paragraph applies only to control transmitters that 
utilize an antenna height of more than 152 meters (500 feet) above 
average terrain. The distance between the location of such a control 
transmitter and the applicable protected TV station location specified 
in this paragraph must equal or exceed the sum of the distance from the 
control transmitter location to the radio horizon in the direction of 
the specified location and 89 kilometers (55 miles--representing the 
distance from the main transmitter location of the TV station to its 
Grade B contour in the

[[Page 153]]

direction of the control transmitter). The protected TV station 
locations in this paragraph are the locations of record as of September 
1974, and these do not change even though the TV stations may have been 
subsequently relocated.
    (i) The protected TV station locations are as follows:

    (b) 470-512 MHz limits. The purpose of the rules in paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section is to reduce the likelihood that 
interference to television receiption from public mobile operations on 
these channels will occur. The protected TV station locations specified 
in this section are the locations of record as of September 1974, and 
these do not change even though the TV stations may have been 
subsequently relocated.
    (1) Co-channel protection. The ERP of control transmitters must not 
exceed the limits in the tables in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(iii) 
of this section. The limits depend upon the height above average terrain 
of the control transmitter antenna and the distance between the control 
transmitter and the nearest protected TV station location in paragraph

<R05>
Sec. 22.651  470-512 MHz channels for trunked mobile operation.

    The following channels are allocated for assignment to transmitters 
providing trunked public mobile service within the specified urban 
areas. All channels have a bandwidth of 20 kHz and are designated by 
their center frequencies in MegaHertz.

                                 Houston

<R05>
Sec. 22.653  Eligibility.

    Only licensees already authorized to provide trunked mobile service 
or their successors in interest are eligible to apply for additional use 
of these channels for trunked mobile service, and then only in the urban 
areas already authorized.


<R05>
Sec. 22.655  Channel usage.

    The FCC is redesignating the public mobile channels in the 470-512 
MHz range from trunked mobile operation to point-to-multipoint operation 
as the demand for trunked mobile service decreases.
    (a) The licensees in each market shall measure channel usage at 
least once every 3 months. These measurements shall be reported to the 
FCC within 30 days. Measurements shall be taken during the busiest 12-
hour periods on 3 days (within a 7-day period) having normal usage. The 
information must be reported separately for each of the 3 days selected, 
must be reported by dates, and must disclose the following:
    (1) The number of mobile units in service during each of the days 
specified;
    (2) The number of calls completed each hour;
    (3) The total number of minutes during each hour that the channels 
were utilized for communications by the mobile units;
    (4) The average channel usage for the busiest hour for the 3 days 
measured; and
    (5) Any additional information that more accurately reflects channel 
usage.
    (b) If the measured probability of blocking decreases below 25%, the 
FCC will redesignate channels not needed to maintain blocking at 25% or 
less. The number of channels needed to maintain blocking below 25% will 
be determined from the channel usage reports and the Erlang C tables.
    (c) Although two or more channels are necessary to provide trunked 
service, the FCC may, pursuant to this section, reduce to one the number 
of channels assigned. In such cases, the licensee may provide non-
trunked two-way public mobile service on the one remaining channel.


<R05>
Sec. 22.657  Transmitter locations.

    The purpose of the rules in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
is to define the areas in which the 470-512 MHz channels are allocated 
for public mobile use. The purpose of the rules in paragraphs (c) 
through (f) of this section is to reduce the likelihood that 
interference to television reception from public mobile operations on 
these channels will occur. The protected TV station locations specified 
in paragraphs (d), (e)(1) and (f) of this section are the locations of 
record as of September 1974, and these do not change even though the TV 
stations may have been subsequently relocated.
    (a) Base transmitter locations. Base transmitter locations must be 
within 80 kilometers (50 miles) of the designated locations in this 
paragraph. Mobile transmitters must not be operated at locations more 
than 129 kilometers (80 miles) from the designated locations in this 
paragraph.

    (b) Mobile area of operation. Mobile transmitters must not be 
operated at locations more than 48 kilometers (30 miles) from all 
associated base stations.
    (c) Protection from intermodulation interference. Base transmitter 
locations must be at least 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) from the current main 
transmitter locations of all TV stations transmitting on TV channels 
separated by 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, or 8 TV channels from the TV channel 
containing the frequencies on which the base station will transmit. This 
requirement is intended to reduce the likelihood of intermodulation 
interference.
    (d) Adjacent channel protection from mobile transmitters. Base 
transmitter locations must be at least 145 kilometers (90 miles) from 
the applicable protected TV station locations specified in this 
paragraph. This requirement is intended to provide a 0 dB minimum 
desired to undesired signal strength ratio

    (f) Co-channel protection from base transmitters with high antennas. 
This paragraph applies only to base transmitter locations in the New 
York-Northeastern New Jersey urban area that utilize an antenna height 
of more than 152 meters (500 feet) above average terrain. The distance 
between the location of such a base transmitter and the applicable 
protected TV station location specified in this paragraph must equal or 
exceed the sum of the distance from the base transmitter location to the 
radio horizon in the direction of the specified location and 89 
kilometers (55 miles--representing the distance from the main 
transmitter location of the TV station to its Grade B contour in the 
direction of the base transmitter). The distance to the radio horizon is 
calculated as follows:

    (g) The FCC may waive specific distance separation requirements of 
paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section if the applicant submits an 
engineering analysis which demonstrates that terrain effects and/or 
operation with less effective radiated power would satisfy the 
applicable minimum desired to undesired signal strength ratios at the 
Grade B contours of the protected TV stations. For this purpose, the 
Grade B contour of a TV station is deemed to be a circle with a 89 
kilometer (55 mile) radius, centered on the protected TV station 
location, and along which the median TV signal field strength is 64 
dB<greek-m>V/m. In any showing intended to demonstrate compliance with 
the minimum desired to undesired signal ratio requirements of this 
section, all predicted field strengths must have been determined using 
the UHF TV propagation curves contained in part 73 of this chapter.

<R04>
                 Subpart F--Rural Radiotelephone Service


<R05>
Sec. 22.701  Scope.

    The rules in this subpart govern the licensing and operation of 
stations and systems in the Rural Radiotelephone Service. The licensing 
and operation of these stations and systems is also subject to rules 
elsewhere in this part that apply generally to the Public Mobile 
Services. In case of conflict, however, the rules in this subpart 
govern.


<R05>
Sec. 22.702  Eligibility.

    Existing and proposed communications common carriers are eligible to 
hold authorizations to operate conventional central office, interoffice 
and rural stations in the Rural Radiotelephone Service. Only local 
exchange carriers that have been state certified to provide basic 
exchange telephone service (or others having state approval to provide 
such service) in the pertinent area are eligible to hold authorizations 
for Basic Exchange Telephone Radio Systems (BETRS). Subscribers are also 
eligible to hold authorizations to operate rural subscriber stations in 
the Rural Radiotelephone Service.


<R05>
Sec. 22.703  Separate rural subscriber station authorization not required.

    A separate authorization is not required for rural subscriber 
stations for which the effective radiated power does not exceed 60 Watts 
and for which FAA notification of construction or alteration of the 
antenna structure is not required (see criteria in Sec. 17.7 of this 
chapter). Authority to operate such rural subscriber stations is 
conferred by the authorization of the central office or base station 
from which they receive service.


<R05>
Sec. 22.705  Rural radiotelephone system configuration.

    Stations in the Rural Radiotelephone Service are authorized to 
communicate as follows:
    (a) Rural subscriber stations are authorized to communicate with and 
through the central office station(s) with which they are associated. 
However, where the establishment of a central office station in this 
service is not feasible, rural subscriber stations may be authorized to 
communicate with and through a base station in the Paging and 
Radiotelephone Service.
    (b) Central office stations may communicate only with rural 
subscriber stations.
    (c) Interoffice stations may communicate only with other interoffice 
stations.


<R05>
Sec. 22.709  Rural radiotelephone service application requirements.

    In addition to information required by subparts B and D of this 
part, applications for authorization to operate a station in the Rural 
Radiotelephone Service must contain the applicable supplementary 
information described in this section.
    (a) Interoffice stations. Applications for authority to operate a 
new interoffice station or to add transmitters or points of 
communications to an existing interoffice station must contain an 
exhibit demonstrating that the requested facilities would be used only 
for interconnecting central office stations and explaining why the use 
of alternative existing radio or wire facilities is not feasible.
    (b) Technical information required. For each transmitter in the 
Rural Radiotelephone Service, the following information is required by 
FCC Form 600 Schedule B:
    (1) Location description; city; county; state; geographical 
coordinates correct to <plus-minus>1 second, the datum used (NAD 27 or 
NAD 83), site elevation above mean sea level, proximity to adjacent 
market boundaries and international borders;
    (2) Antenna manufacturer, model number and type, antenna height to 
tip above ground level, the height of the center of radiation of the 
antenna above the average terrain, the height of the antenna center of 
radiation above the average elevation of the terrain along each of the 8 
cardinal radials, antenna gain in the maximum lobe, the beamwidth of the 
maximum lobe of the antenna, a polar plot of the horizontal gain pattern 
of the antenna, the electric field polarization of the wave emitted by 
the antenna when installed as proposed;

[[Page 161]]

    (3) The center frequency of each channel requested, the maximum 
effective radiated power, the effective radiated power in each of the 
cardinal radial directions, any non-standard emission types to be used, 
including bandwidth and modulation type, the transmitter classification 
(e.g. central office), and the locations and call signs, if any, of any 
fixed points of communication.
    (c) No landline facilities. Each application for a central office 
station must contain an exhibit showing that it is impracticable to 
provide the required communication service by means of landline 
facilities.
    (d) Interference exhibit. Applications for central office, 
interoffice and relay stations must include an exhibit identifying co-
channel facilities and demonstrating, in accordance with Sec. 22.715 
that the proposed station, if authorized, would not cause interference 
to the service of those co-channel facilities. This exhibit must:
    (1) For UHF channels, identify each protected transmitter located 
within 108 kilometers (67 miles) of the proposed transmitter in 
directions in which the distance to the interfering contour is 76.4 
kilometers (47.5 miles) or less, and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) 
of the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the 
interfering contour exceeds 76.4 kilometers (47.5 miles); and identify 
each protected Basic Exchange Telephone Radio System central office 
transmitter in the rural Radiotelephone Service within 231 kilometers 
(144 miles).
    (2) For VHF channels, identify each protected transmitter located 
within 135 kilometers (84 miles) of the proposed transmitter in 
directions in which the distance to the interfering contour is 93.3 
kilometers (58 miles) or less, and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) of 
the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the 
interfering contour exceeds 93.3 kilometers (58 miles).
    (3) For each protected transmitter identified, show the results of 
distance calculations indicating that there would be no overlap of 
service and interfering contours, or alternatively, indicate that the 
licensee of or applicant for the protected transmitter and/or the 
applicant, as required, have agreed in writing to accept any 
interference resulting from operation of the proposed transmitter.
    (e) Blocking probability. Applications for authority to operate 
basic exchange telephone radio systems (BETRS) that request more than 
two channel pairs must include an exhibit containing calculations 
showing that the number of channels requested is the minimum necessary 
to achieve the required grade of service (in terms of blocking 
probability), and that there will be adequate spectrum available in the 
area to meet realistic estimates of current and future demand for 
paging, two-way mobile and rural radiotelephone services (see 
Sec. 22.719(c)). Applications for authority to operate new conventional 
rural radiotelephone systems that request more than two channel pairs 
must include a statement explaining why BETRS technology is not being 
proposed.

Sec. 22.717  Procedure for mutually exclusive applications in the Rural Radiotelephone Service.

    Mutually exclusive applications in the Rural Radiotelephone Service, 
including those that are mutually exclusive with applications in the 
Paging and Radiotelephone Service, are processed in accordance with 
Sec. 22.131 and with this section.
    (a) Applications in the Rural Radiotelephone Service may be mutually 
exclusive with applications in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service if 
they seek authorization to operate facilities on the same channel in the 
same area, or the technical proposals are otherwise in conflict. See 
Sec. 22.567.
    (b) A modification application in either service filed on the 
earliest filing date may cause all later-filed mutually exclusive 
applications of any type in either service to be ``cut off'' (excluded 
from a same-day filing group) and dismissed, pursuant to 
Sec. 22.131(c)(3)(ii) and Sec. 22.131(c)(4).
    (c) Competitive bidding will not be used as a selection procedure 
for any filing group that contains one or more applications for 
facilities in the Rural Radio Service. if a settlement between the 
applicants cannot be reached in a reasonable time, the applications may 
be designated for comparative consideration in a hearing. See 
Sec. 22.131(c)(4)(ii).

<R05>
Sec. 22.719  Additional channel policy for rural radiotelephone stations.

    The rules in this section govern the processing of applications for 
central office stations that request a rural radiotelephone channel pair 
when the applicant has applied for or been granted an authorization for 
other rural radiotelephone channel pairs in the same area. The general 
policy of the FCC is to promote effective use of the spectrum by 
encouraging the use of spectrum-efficient technologies (i.e. BETRS) and 
by assigning the minimum number of channels necessary to provide 
service.
    (a) Transmitters in same area. Any central office station 
transmitter on any channel pair listed in Sec. 22.725 is considered to 
be in the same area as another central office station transmitter on any 
other channel pair listed in Sec. 22.725 if the transmitting antennas 
are located within 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) of each other.
    (b) Initial channel pairs. The FCC does not assign more than two 
channel pairs for new central office stations, unless there are more 
than eight rural subscriber stations to be served. Stations are 
considered to be new if there are no authorized transmitters on any 
channel listed in Sec. 22.725 controlled by the applicant in the same 
geographic area.
    (c) Additional channel pairs. Applications for central office 
station transmitters to be located in the same area as an authorized 
central office station controlled by the applicant, but to operate on a 
different channel pair(s) are considered as requests for additional 
channel pair(s) for the authorized central office station. The FCC may 
grant applications for additional channel pairs provided that the need 
for each additional channel pair (after the first two) is established 
and fully justified in terms of achieving the required grade of service 
(blocking probability), and the applicant demonstrates that there will 
still be adequate spectrum available in the area to meet realistic 
estimates of current and future demand for paging, two-way mobile and 
rural radiotelephone services. In the case of conventional rural 
radiotelephone central office stations, an explanation must be provided 
as to why BETRS technology is not being used instead of additional 
channel pairs.

               Conventional Rural Radiotelephone Stations


<R05>
Sec. 22.725  Channels for conventional rural radiotelephone stations.

    The following channels are allocated for paired assignment to 
transmitters that provide conventional rural radiotelephone service. 
These channels may be assigned for use by central office or rural 
subscriber stations as indicated, and interoffice stations. These 
channels may be assigned also for use by relay stations in systems where 
it would be impractical to provide rural radiotelephone service without 
the use of relay stations. All channels have a bandwidth of 20 kHz and 
are designated

    (b) Basic power limit. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the ERP of central office station transmitters must not exceed 
500 Watts.
    (c) Height-power limits. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the ERP of central office station transmitters must not exceed 
the amount that would result in an average distance to the ``service 
contour'' of 41.6 kilometers (26 miles) for VHF channels or 30.7 
kilometers (19 miles) for UHF channels. The average distance to the 
``service contour'' is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of the 
distances determined using the procedures specified in Sec. 22.567 for 
the eight cardinal radial directions, excluding cardinal radial 
directions for which 90% or more of the distance so calculated is over 
water.
    (d) Encompassed interfering contour areas. Central office station 
transmitters are exempt from the basic power and height-power limits of 
this section if the area within their interfering contours is totally 
encompassed by the interfering contours of operating co-channel central 
office station transmitters controlled by the same licensee. For the 
purpose of this paragraph, operating transmitters are authorized 
transmitters that are providing service to subscribers.
    (e) Adjacent channel protection. The ERP of central office station 
transmitters must not exceed 500 Watts if they transmit on channel 
454.025 MHz and are located less than 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) from any 
Private Radio Services station receiving on adjacent channel 454.000 
MHz.
    (f) Meteor burst stations. The transmitter output power for stations 
using meteor burst propagation modes must not exceed 2000 Watts for 
central office

[[Page 164]]

stations and 500 Watts for rural subscriber stations.


<R05>
Sec. 22.729  Meteor burst propagation modes.

    The rules in this section govern stations in this service that use 
meteor burst propagation modes to provide rural radiotelephone service 
in Alaska.
    (a) Channel assignments. The channels 42.40 and 44.10 MHz may be 
assigned to central office stations and rural subscriber stations, 
respectively, on a primary basis. The channels 44.20 and 45.90 MHz may 
be assigned to central office and rural subscriber stations, 
respectively, on a secondary basis to Private Radio services stations 
using meteor burst propagation modes.
    (b) Transmitting power. The transmitter output power must not exceed 
2000 Watts for central office stations and 500 Watts for rural 
subscriber stations.
    (c) Station locations. Co-channel central office stations of 
different licensees must be at least 241 kilometers (150 miles) apart. A 
rural subscriber station and a central office station of different 
licensees must be at least 241 kilometers (150 miles) apart if the rural 
subscriber stations of the different licensees operate on the same 
channel. The FCC may waive the requirements of this paragraph if the 
affected users agree to a cooperative sharing arrangement.
    (d) Emission type. Only type F1D emission is authorized.
    (e) Bandwidth. The authorized bandwidth is 20 kHz.
    (f) Station identification. Station identification is required only 
for the central office station.
    (g) Interference. Stations authorized under the provisions of this 
section must not cause harmful interference to the service of stations 
in other radio services.
    (h) Developmental authorization. Meteor burst communications systems 
may be authorized under developmental authorizations pursuant to 
Sec. 22.419.


<R05>
Sec. 22.731  Emission limitations.

    Upon application for multichannel operation, the FCC may authorize 
emission bandwidths wider than those specified in Sec. 22.357, provided 
that spectrum utilization is equal to or better than that achieved by 
single channel operation.


<R05>
Sec. 22.733  Priority of service.

    Within the Rural Radiotelephone Service, the channels listed in 
Sec. 22.725 are intended primarily for use in rendition of public 
message service between rural subscriber and central office stations and 
to provide radio trunking facilities between central offices. The 
channels may also be used, however, for the rendition of private leased-
line communication service provided that such usage would not reduce or 
impair the extent or quality of communication service that would be 
available, in the absence of private leased-line service, to the general 
public receiving or subsequently requesting public message service from 
a central office.


<R05>
Sec. 22.737  Temporary fixed stations.

    The FCC may, upon proper application therefor, authorize the 
construction and operation of temporary fixed stations. Temporary fixed 
stations are to be used as rural subscriber, interoffice, or central 
office stations when those stations are unavailable or when service from 
those stations is disrupted by storms or emergencies.
    (a) Six month limitation. If it is necessary for a temporary fixed 
station to remain at the same location for more than six months, the 
licensee of that station must apply for authorization to operate the 
station at the specific location at least 30 days before the end of the 
six month period.
    (b) International communications. Communications between the United 
States and Canada or Mexico must not be carried using a temporary fixed 
station without prior authorization from the FCC. Licensees desiring to 
carry such communications should apply sufficiently in advance to allow 
for the time necessary to coordinate with Canada or Mexico.

    (a) Channel 454.675 MHz is assigned to each and every ground 
station, to be used only for automatically alerting airborne mobile 
stations of incoming calls.
    (b) All airborne mobile channels are assigned for use by each and 
every airborne mobile station.


<R05>
Sec. 22.809   Transmitting power limits.

    The transmitting power of ground and airborne mobile transmitters 
operating on the channels listed in Sec. 22.805 must not exceed the 
limits in this section.
    (a) Ground station transmitters. The effective radiated power of 
ground stations must not exceed 100 Watts and must not be less than 50 
Watts, except as provided in Sec. 22.811.
    (b) Airborne mobile transmitters. The transmitter power output of 
airborne mobile transmitters must not exceed 25 Watts and must not be 
less than 4 Watts.


<R05>
Sec. 22.811   Idle tone.

    Whenever a ground station transmitter authorized to transmit on any 
of the communications channels listed in Sec. 22.805 is available for 
service but is not providing service, a modulated signal must be 
continuously transmitted on the communication channel assigned to that 
transmitter. While this modulated signal is transmitted, the transmitter 
power must be between 10 and 20 dB lower than the normal transmitting 
power.


<R05>
Sec. 22.813   Technical channel pair assignment criteria.

    The rules in this section establish technical assignment criteria 
for the channel pairs listed in Sec. 22.805. These

[[Page 167]]

criteria are intended to provide substantial service volumes over areas 
that have significant local and regional general aviation activity, 
while maintaining the continuous nationwide in-route coverage of the 
original geographical layout.
    (a) Distance separation for co-channel ground stations. The FCC may 
grant an application requesting assignment of a communication channel 
pair to a proposed ground transmitter only if the proposed antenna 
location is at least 800 kilometers (497 miles) from the antenna 
location of the nearest co-channel ground transmitter in the United 
States, its territories and possessions; and 1000 kilometers (621 miles) 
from the antenna location of the nearest co-channel ground transmitter 
in Canada.
    (b) Dispersion. The FCC may grant an application requesting 
assignment of a communication channel pair to a proposed ground 
transmitter only if there are no more than five different communication 
channel pairs already assigned to ground transmitters with antenna 
locations within a 320 kilometer (199 mile) radius of the proposed 
antenna location.


<R05>
Sec. 22.815   Construction period for general aviation ground stations.

    The construction period (see Sec. 22.142) for general aviation 
ground stations is 12 months.


<R05>
Sec. 22.817   Additional channel policies.

    The rules in this section govern the processing of applications for 
authority to operate a ground station transmitter on any ground station 
communication channel listed in Sec. 22.805 when the applicant has 
applied or been granted an authorization for other ground station 
communication channels in the same area. The general policy of the FCC 
is to assign one ground station communication channel in an area to a 
carrier per application cycle, up to a maximum of six ground station 
communication channels per area. That is, a carrier must apply for one 
ground station communication channel, receive the authorization, 
construct the station, and notify the FCC of commencement of service 
before applying for an additional ground station communication channel 
in that area.
    (a) Air-ground transmitters in same area. Any transmitter on any of 
the ground station channels listed in Sec. 22.805 is considered to be in 
the same area as another transmitter on any ground station channel 
listed in Sec. 22.805 if it is located less than 350 kilometers (217 
miles) from that transmitter.
    (b) Initial channel. The FCC will not assign more than one ground 
station communication channel for new ground stations. Ground stations 
are considered to be new if there are no authorized ground station 
transmitters on any channel listed in Sec. 22.805 controlled by the 
applicant in the same area.
    (c) Additional channel. Applications for ground transmitters to be 
located in the same area as an authorized ground station controlled by 
the applicant, but to operate on a different ground station 
communication channel, are considered as requesting an additional 
channel for the authorized station.
    (d) Amendment of pending application. If the FCC receives and 
accepts for filing an application for a ground station transmitter to be 
located in the same area as a ground station transmitter proposed in a 
pending application previously filed by the applicant, but on a 
different ground station communication channel, the subsequent 
application is treated as a major amendment to change the technical 
proposal of the prior application. The filing date of any application so 
amended is the date the FCC received the subsequent application.
    (e) Dismissal of premature applications for additional channel. If 
the FCC receives an application requesting an additional ground station 
communication channel for an authorized ground station prior to 
receiving notification that the station is providing service to 
subscribers on the authorized channel(s), the FCC may dismiss that 
application without prejudice.
    (f) Dismissal of applications for seventh channel. If the FCC 
receives an application requesting an additional ground station 
communication channel for an authorized ground station which would, if 
granted, result in that station being assigned more than six ground 
station communication channels in the

[[Page 168]]

same area, the FCC may dismiss that application without prejudice.


<R05>
Sec. 22.819   AGRAS compatibility requirement.

    Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, stations 
transmitting on the channels listed in Sec. 22.805 must operate in 
compliance with the technical and operational requirements contained in 
the document, ``Technical Reference, Air-ground Radiotelephone Automated 
Service (AGRAS), System Operation and Equipment Characteristics'', dated 
April 12, 1985.
    (a) Until January 1, 1996, stations may continue to operate in 
compliance with the previous standard adopted in Docket 16073.
    (b) Copies of the document referenced in this section may be 
obtained from the FCC's copying contractor.


<R05>
Sec. 22.821   Authorization for airborne mobile stations.

    An authorization separate from any ground station authorization is 
required for each airborne mobile station that operates on the channels 
listed in Sec. 22.805. The operator of the airborne mobile station must 
apply for the authorization (FCC Form 409). The application must contain 
an affirmative representation that the applicant has made definite 
arrangements with a wireline common carrier for service and billing.

                 Commercial Aviation Air-Ground Systems


<R05>
Sec. 22.857  Channel plan for commercial aviation air-ground systems.

    The 849-851 and 894-896 MHz frequency ranges are allocated for block 
assignment to nationwide air-ground systems providing radiotelephone 
service to passengers aboard commercial aircraft. These frequency ranges 
may also be used to provide service to persons in general aviation or 
other aircraft. Ground stations transmit on channels in the 849-851 MHz 
range. Airborne mobile stations transmit on channels in the 894-896 MHz 
range. Systems using these channels must conform to the channel plan 
described in this section.
    (a) Channel blocks. The spectrum allocated for commercial aviation 
air-ground systems is divided into ten channel blocks, numbered 1 
through 10. All ground stations in each geographical area must use the 
same channel block for communication with airborne mobile stations in 
flight, in accordance with Sec. 22.859.
    (1) Each channel block is subdivided into 6 control channels labeled 
P-1 through P-6, and 29 communications channels labeled C-1 through C-
29.
    (2) The authorized channel bandwidths are as follows:
    (i) Each control channel has a bandwidth of 3.2 kHz.
    (ii) Each communications channel has a bandwidth of 6 kHz.
    (b) The center frequencies (in MegaHertz) of the communications and 
control channels are listed in Tables G-1 and G-2 of this section.

                                                           Table G-1.--Ground Station Channels

    (a) Carriers authorized to construct and operate air-ground 
radiotelephone systems on the channels listed in Sec. 22.857 may also 
construct and operate low power ground stations designed to provide 
service to airborne mobile stations on the ground, provided that no 
interference is caused to service provided by ground stations located in 
accordance with the geographical channel block layout or with paragraph 
(b) of this section. The antenna location of each such low power ground 
station may be anywhere that is at least 483 kilometers (300 miles) from 
all antenna locations of ground stations using the

[[Page 172]]

same channel block(s) in accordance with the geographical channel block 
layout or with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Ground station locations may be more than 1.61 kilometers (one 
mile) from all of the locations listed in this section, provided that 
they are at least 885 kilometers (550 miles) from all antenna locations 
of ground stations using the same channel block(s) in accordance with 
the geographical channel block layout or with this paragraph.


<R05>
Sec. 22.861  Emission limitations.

    Any appropriate emission type may be used to provide air-ground 
radiotelephone service on the channels listed in Sec. 22.857, provided 
that the emission limitations of this section are met.
    (a) Emission mask. The emission mask described in this paragraph 
applies instead of those in Sec. 22.359. The power of any emission in 
each of the adjacent channels must be at least 30 dB below the power of 
the total emission. The power of any emission in any of the channels 
other than the one being used and the adjacent channels must be at least 
50 dB below the power of the total emission.
    (b) Airborne mobile transmitters. The power of any emission in each 
of the adjacent channels must not exceed -130 dBm at any ground station 
receiver, assuming a 0 dBi receive antenna. The power of any emission in 
any of the channels other than the one being used and the adjacent 
channels must not exceed -148 dBm at any ground station receiver, 
assuming a 0 dBi receive antenna.
    (c) Ground station transmitters. The effective radiated power (ERP) 
of any emission outside of the frequency ranges set forth in Sec. 22.857 
must not exceed -10 dBm. The ERP of any emission in each of the adjacent 
channels must not exceed +10 dBm. The ERP of any emission in any of the 
channels other than the one being used and the adjacent channels must 
not exceed -5 dBm.
    (d) If an emission on any frequency outside of the authorized 
bandwidth causes harmful interference, the FCC may require greater 
attenuation of that emission than required in paragraph (a) of this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 22.863  Transmitter frequency tolerance.

    Ground station transmitter frequencies must be maintained within 0.1 
parts per million (ppm) of the channel reference or center frequencies. 
Doppler shift correction must be used to ensure that the frequencies of 
the signals of airborne mobile stations received at ground stations 
remain within 0.2 ppm of the channel reference or center frequencies.


<R05>
Sec. 22.865  Automatic channel selection procedures.

    Operation of stations using the channels listed in Sec. 22.857 must 
be in accordance with the procedures in this section.
    (a) A communications channel is not available for use by a ground 
station if it is already in use by another ground station at the same 
location. Ground station equipment must automatically determine whether 
channels are in use by other ground stations at the same location, and 
may employ radio frequency signal monitoring to do so. For example, a 
communications channel may be determined to be in use if the received 
signal power on that channel at the ground station exceeds -115 dBm, 
which, assuming a 0 dB gain 895 MHz receive antenna, corresponds to a 
field strength of approximately 19 dB<greek-m>V/m. Ground stations may 
employ an alternative method of determining whether a communications 
channel is in use provided that such procedure is at least as reliable 
as radio frequency signal monitoring.
    (b) Data indicating which communications channels are available for 
use are transmitted by ground stations on the assigned control channels.
    (c) A call is originated when an airborne mobile station selects a 
communications channel based on the received data from ground stations 
and other factors, and transmits an identification code (which 
identifies the specific ground station from which service is requested) 
on the selected communications channel. The ground station from which 
service has been requested may

[[Page 173]]

then obtain any necessary billing information and complete the call.
    (d) A ground station may not transmit on a communications channel 
unless it has received the proper identification code. After a ground 
station has begun to transmit on a communications channel, that channel 
is not available to ground stations other than the one from which 
service has been requested until the call is terminated.
    (e) A call is terminated by the ground station when either a hang-up 
signal is transmitted by the airborne mobile station, or the signal from 
the airborne mobile station on the communications channel is lost for a 
period of 15 continuous seconds. The hang-up signal is the on-off keying 
(50% duty cycle) of an unmodulated carrier over a period of one second 
with pulse duration of 5 milliseconds. However, if all carriers 
authorized to operate air-ground systems using the channels listed in 
Sec. 22.857 agree that an alternative hang-up signal and/or procedure 
would be more efficient or beneficial, such alternative hang-up signal 
and/or procedure may be used. The carriers must jointly give prior 
notification to the FCC if an alternative hang-up signal and/or 
procedure is used.


<R05>
Sec. 22.867  Effective radiated power limits.

    The effective radiated power (ERP) of ground and airborne stations 
operating on the channels listed in Sec. 22.857 must not exceed the 
limits in this section.
    (a) The ERP of airborne mobile station transmitters must not exceed 
30 Watts.
    (b) The ERP of ground station transmitters must not exceed 100 
Watts.
    (c) The ERP of low power ground station transmitters operating 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of Sec. 22.859 must not exceed 1 Watt.

Sec. 22.871  Control channel transition period.

    The rules in this section provide for a period of transition during 
which the experimental air-ground system operating on the channels 
listed in Sec. 22.857 will be discontinued and replaced by a system 
operating in full compliance with the rules in this subpart. The 
experimental system may continue to exclusively use a 3.2 kHz control 
channel contained within the bandwidth of communications channel C-2 of 
each channel block until September 9, 1996. After that date 
communications channel C-2 will be available for use by all carriers 
authorized to operate an air-ground system on the channels listed in 
Sec. 22.857.


<R05>
Sec. 22.873  Construction period for commercial aviation air-ground systems.

               Subpart H--Cellular Radiotelephone Service


<R05>
Sec. 22.900  Scope.

    The rules in this subpart govern the licensing and operation of 
cellular radiotelephone systems. Licensing and operation of these 
systems are also subject to rules elsewhere in this part that apply 
generally to the Public Mobile Services. In case of conflict, however, 
the rules in this subpart govern.


<R05>
Sec. 22.901  Cellular service requirements and limitations.

    Cellular system licensees must provide cellular mobile 
radiotelephone service upon request to all cellular subscribers in good 
standing, including roamers, while such subscribers are located within 
any portion of the authorized cellular geographic service area (see 
Sec. 22.911) where facilities have been constructed and mobile service 
to subscribers has commenced. A cellular system licensee may refuse or 
terminate service, however, subject to any applicable state or local 
requirements for timely notification to any subscriber who operates a 
cellular telephone in an airborne aircraft in violation of Sec. 22.925 
or otherwise fails to cooperate with the licensee in exercising 
operational control over mobile stations pursuant to Sec. 22.927.
    (a) Service area information. Licensees must inform prospective 
subscribers of the area in which reliable service can be expected.
    (b) Lack of capacity. If a licensee refuses a request for cellular 
service because of a lack of system capacity, it must report that fact 
to the FCC in writing, explaining how it plans to increase capacity.
    (c) Dispatch service. Cellular systems may provide dispatch service.
    (d) Alternative technologies and co-primary services. Licensees of 
cellular systems may use alternative cellular technologies and/or 
provide fixed services on a co-primary basis with their mobile 
offerings, including personal communications services (as defined in 
Part 24 of this chapter) on the spectrum within their assigned channel 
block. Cellular carriers that provide mobile services must make such 
service available to subscribers whose mobile equipment conforms to the 
cellular system compatibility specification (see Sec. 22.933).
    (1) Licensees must perform or obtain an engineering analysis to 
ensure that interference to the service of other cellular systems will 
not result from the implementation of co-primary fixed services or 
alternative cellular technologies.
    (2) Alternative technology and co-primary fixed services are exempt 
from the channeling requirements of Sec. 22.905, the modulation 
requirements of Sec. 22.915, the wave polarization requirements of 
Sec. 22.367, the compatibility specification in Sec. 22.933 and the 
emission limitations of Secs. 22.357 and 22.917, except for emission 
limitations that apply to emissions outside the assigned channel block.

Sec. 22.911) where facilities have been constructed and service to 
subscribers has commenced. A cellular system licensee may refuse or 
terminate service, however, subject to any applicable state or local 
requirements for timely notification, to any subscriber who operates a 
cellular telephone in an airborne aircraft in violation of Sec. 22.925 
or otherwise fails to cooperate with the licensee in exercising 
operational control over mobile stations pursuant to Sec. 22.927.

                                * * * * *

    (d) Alternative technologies and auxiliary services. Licensees of 
cellular systems may use alternative cellular technologies and/or 
provide auxiliary common carrier services, including personal 
communications services (as defined in part 24 of this chapter) on the 
spectrum within their assigned channel block, provided that cellular 
service is available to subscribers whose mobile equipment conforms to 
the cellular system compatibility specification (see Sec. 22.933).
    (1) Licensees must perform or obtain an engineering analysis to 
ensure that interference to the service of other cellular systems will 
not result from the implementation of auxiliary services or alternative 
cellular technologies.
    (2) Alternative technology and auxiliary service operations are 
exempt from the channeling requirements of Sec. 22.905, the modulation 
requirements of Sec. 22.915, the wave polarization requirements of

<R05>
Sec. 22.903  Conditions applicable to former Bell Operating Companies.

    Ameritech Corporation, Bell Atlantic Corporation, BellSouth 
Corporation, NYNEX Corporation, Pacific Telesis Group, Southwestern Bell 
Corporation, U.S. West, Inc., their successors in interest and 
affiliated entities (BOCs) may engage in the provision of cellular 
service only in accordance with the conditions in this section, unless 
otherwise authorized by the FCC. BOCs may, subject to other provisions 
of law, have a controlling or lesser interest in or be under common 
control with separate corporations that provide cellular service only 
under the following conditions:
    (a) Access to landline facilities: BOCs must not sell, lease or 
otherwise make available to the separate corporation any transmission 
facilities that are used in any way for the provision of its landline 
telephone services, except on a compensatory, arm's-length basis. 
Separate corporations must not own any facilities for the provision of 
landline telephone service. Access to landline exchange and transmission 
facilities for the provision of cellular service must be obtained by 
separate corporations on the same terms and conditions as those 
facilities are made available to other entities.
    (b) Independence. Separate corporations must operate independently 
in the provision of cellular service. Each separate corporation must--
    (1) Maintain its own books of account;
    (2) Have separate officers;

on a compensatory basis.
    (d) Transactions. All transactions between the separate corporation 
and the BOC or its affiliates that involve the transfer, either direct 
or by accounting or other record entries, of money, personnel, 
resources, other assets or any things of value, shall be reduced to 
writing. A copy of any contract, agreement or other arrangement entered 
between such entities with regard to interconnection with landline 
network exchange and transmission facilities must be filed with the FCC 
within thirty days after the contract, agreement, or other arrangement 
is made. A copy of all other contracts, agreements or arrangements 
between such entities shall be kept available by the separate 
corporation for inspection upon reasonable request by the FCC. The 
provision shall not apply to any transaction governed by the provision 
of an effective state or federal tariff.
    (e) Promotion. BOCs must not engage in the sale or promotion of 
cellular

[[Page 177]]

service on behalf of the separate corporation. However, this does not 
prohibit joint advertising or promotional efforts by the landline 
carrier and its cellular affiliate.
    (f) Proprietary information. BOCs must not provide to any such 
separate corporation any customer proprietary information, unless such 
information is publicly available on the same terms and conditions.
    (g) Provision of other Public Mobile services. Separate corporations 
may include, as part of their operations, the provision of other Public 
Mobile services.

[59 FR 59507, Nov. 17, 1994; 60 FR 9891, Feb. 22, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 22.907  Coordination of channel usage.

    Licensees in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service must coordinate, 
with the appropriate parties, channel usage at each transmitter location 
within 121 kilometers (75 miles) of any transmitter locations authorized 
to other licensees or proposed by tentative selectees or other 
applicants, except those with mutually exclusive applications.
    (a) Licensees must cooperate and make reasonable efforts to resolve 
technical problems that may inhibit effective and efficient use of the 
cellular radio spectrum; however, licensees are not obligated to suggest 
extensive changes to or redesign other licensees' cellular systems. 
Licensees must make reasonable efforts to avoid blocking the growth of 
other cellular systems that are likely to need additional capacity in 
the future.
    (b) If technical problems are addressed by an agreement or operating 
arrangement between the licensees that would result in a reduction of 
quality or capacity of either system, the licensees must notify the FCC 
by letter.


<R05>
Sec. 22.909  Cellular markets.

    Cellular markets are standard geographic areas used by the FCC for 
administrative convenience in the licensing of cellular systems. 
Cellular markets comprise Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and 
Rural Service Areas (RSAs). All cellular markets and the counties they 
comprise are listed in Public Notice Report No. CL-92-40 ``Common 
Carrier Public Mobile Services Information, Cellular MSA/RSA Markets and 
Counties'', dated January 24, 1992, DA 92-109, 7 FCC Rcd 742 (1992).
    (a) MSAs. Metropolitan Statistical Areas are 306 areas, including 
New England County Metropolitan Areas and the Gulf of Mexico Service 
Area (water area of the Gulf of Mexico, border is the coastline), 
defined by the Office of Management and Budget, as modified by the FCC.

[[Page 178]]

    (b) RSAs. Rural Service Areas are 428 areas, other than MSAs, 
established by the FCC.


<R05>
Sec. 22.911  Cellular geographic service area.

    The Cellular Geographic Service Area (CGSA) of a cellular system is 
the geographic area considered by the FCC to be served by the cellular 
system. The CGSA is the area within which cellular systems are entitled 
to protection and within which adverse effects for the purpose of 
determining whether a petitioner has standing are recognized.
    (a) CGSA determination. The CGSA is the composite of the service 
areas of all of the cells in the system, excluding any area outside the 
cellular market boundary, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, and excluding any area within the CGSA of another cellular 
system. The service area of a cell is the area within its service area 
boundary (SAB). The distance to the SAB is calculated as a function of 
effective radiated power (ERP) and antenna center of radiation height 
above average terrain (HAAT), height above sea level (HASL) or height 
above mean sea level (HAMSL).
    (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) of this section, 
the distance from a cell transmitting antenna to its SAB along each 
cardinal radial is calculated as follows:

d=2.531 x h<SUP>0.34 xp<SUP>0.17

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    (2) For the cellular systems authorized to serve the Gulf of Mexico 
MSA, the distance from a cell transmitting antenna to its SAB along each 
cardinal radial is calculated as follows:

d=6.895 x h<SUP>0.30 xp<SUP>0.15

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    (3) The value used for h in the formula in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section must not be less than 8 meters (26 feet) HASL (or HAMSL, as 
appropriate for the support structure). The value used for h in the 
formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must not be less than 30 
meters (98 feet) HAAT, except that for unserved area applications 
proposing a cell with an ERP not exceeding 10 Watts, the value for h 
used in the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to determine the 
service area boundary for that cell may be less than 30 meters (98 feet) 
HAAT, but not less than 3 meters (10 feet) HAAT.
    (4) The value used for p in the formulas in paragraphs (a)(1) and 
(a)(2) of this section must not be less than 0.1 Watt or 27 dB less than 
(1/500 of) the maximum ERP in any direction, whichever is more.
    (5) Whenever use of the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
pursuant to the exception contained in paragraph (a)(3) of this section 
results in a calculated distance that is less than 5.4 kilometers (3.4 
miles), the radial distance to the service area boundary is deemed to be 
5.4 kilometers (3.4 miles).
    (6) The distance from a cell transmitting antenna to the SAB along 
any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is calculated by linear 
interpolation of distance as a function of angle.

    Note to paragraph (a) of Sec. 22.911: On May 13, 1994, the United 
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit instructed 
the FCC to vacate the provisions of old Sec. 22.903(a), now 
Sec. 22.911(a), insofar as they apply to cellular systems licensed to 
serve the Gulf of Mexico MSA (GMSA), pending reconsideration of an issue 
remanded to the FCC in that decision. See Petroleum Communications, Inc. 
v. Federal Communications Commission, No. 92-1670 and RVC Services, 
Inc., D/B/A Coastel Communications Company v. Federal Communications 
Commission, No. 93-1016, ____ F.2d ____, ____ (D.C. Cir. 1994). 
Accordingly, notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 22.911(a), until 
further notice, the authorized CGSAs of the cellular systems licensed to 
serve the GMSA are those which were authorized prior to January 11, 
1993.

    (b) Alternative CGSA determination. If a carrier believes that the 
method prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section produces a CGSA that 
departs significantly (<plus-minus>20% in the service area of any cell) 
from the geographical area where reliable cellular service is actually 
provided, the carrier may submit, as an

[[Page 179]]

exhibit to an application for modification of the CGSA (FCC Form 600), a 
depiction of what the carrier believes the CGSA should be. Such 
submissions must be accompanied by one or more supporting propagation 
studies using methods appropriate for the 800-900 MHz frequency range, 
including all supporting data and calculations, and/or by extensive 
field strength measurement data. For the purpose of such submissions, 
cellular service is considered to be provided in all areas, including 
``dead spots'', between the transmitter location and the locus of points 
where the predicted or measured median field strength finally drops to 
32 dB<greek-m>V/m (i.e. does not exceed 32 dB<greek-m>V/m further out). 
If, after consideration of such submissions, the FCC finds that 
adjustment to a CGSA is warranted, the FCC may grant the application.
    (1) The alternative CGSA determination must define the CGSA in terms 
of distances from cell sites to cell SABs along the eight cardinal 
radials, with other points along the SAB determined in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(6) of this section. The distances used for the cardinal 
radials must be representative of the coverage within the 45 deg. 
sectors, as depicted by the alternative CGSA determination.
    (2) If an uncalibrated predictive model is used to depict the CGSA, 
the alternative CGSA determination must identify factors (e.g. terrain 
roughness or features) that could plausibly account for the difference 
between actual coverage and that defined by the formula in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section. If actual measurements or a measurement-
calibrated predictive model are used to depict the CGSA, and this fact 
is disclosed in the alternative CGSA determination, it is not necessary 
to offer an explanation of the difference between actual coverage and 
that defined by the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the 
formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is clearly inapplicable for 
the cell(s) in question (e.g. for microcells), this should be disclosed 
in the alternative CGSA determination.
    (3) The provision for alternative CGSA determinations was made in 
recognition that the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is a 
general model that provides a reasonable approximation of coverage in 
most land areas, but may substantially under-predict or over-predict 
coverage in specific areas with unusual terrain roughness or features, 
and may be inapplicable for certain purposes, e.g. cells with a radial 
distance to the SAB less than 8 kilometers (5 miles). In such cases, 
alternative methods that utilize more specific models are appropriate. 
Accordingly, the FCC does not consider use of the formula in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section with parameters outside of the limits in 
paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4) and (a)(5) of this section or with data for 
radials other than the cardinal radials to be a valid alternative method 
for determining the CGSA of a cellular system.
    (c) CGSA extension areas. SAB extensions (areas outside of the 
cellular market boundary, but within the service area as calculated 
using the methods of paragraph (a) of this section) are part of the CGSA 
only under the following circumstances:
    (1) During the five year build-out period of the system in the 
cellular market containing the extension, the licensees of systems on 
the same channel block in adjacent cellular markets may agree that the 
portion of the service area of one system that extends into unserved 
areas in the other system's cellular market is part of the CGSA of the 
former system.
    (2) At the end of the five year build-out period of the system in 
the cellular market containing the extension, the portion of the service 
area that extends into unserved areas in another cellular market becomes 
part of the CGSA, provided that the licensee of the system so extended 
files a system information update in accordance with Sec. 22.947(c).
    (3) For original systems in MSAs, extensions of the CGSA authorized 
by the FCC are part of the CGSA to the extent authorized.
    (d) Protection afforded. Within the CGSA determined in accordance 
with this section, cellular systems are entitled to protection from co-
channel and first-adjacent channel interference and from capture of 
subscriber traffic by adjacent systems on the same channel block.

[[Page 180]]

    (1) Licensees must cooperate in resolving co-channel and first-
adjacent channel interference by changing channels used at specific 
cells or by other technical means.
    (2) Protection from capture of subscriber traffic is applied and 
limited in accordance with the following:
    (i) Subscriber traffic is captured if an SAB of one cellular system 
overlaps the CGSA of another operating cellular system. Therefore, 
cellular licensees must not begin to operate any facility that would 
cause an SAB to overlap the existing CGSA of another cellular system on 
the same channel block, without first obtaining the written consent of 
the licensee of that system. However, cellular licensees may continue to 
operate existing facilities that produce an SAB overlapping a 
subsequently-authorized portion of the CGSA of another cellular system 
on the same channel block until the licensee of that system requests 
that the SAB be removed from its CGSA. Such request may be made directly 
to the licensee of the overlapping system or to the FCC. In the event 
such request is made, the licensee of the overlapping system must reduce 
the transmitting power or antenna height (or both) at the pertinent cell 
site as necessary to remove the SAB from the CGSA of the other system, 
unless a written consent from the licensee of the other system allowing 
the SAB to remain is obtained. Cellular licensees may enter into 
contracts with the licensees of other cellular systems on the same 
channel block to allow SABs to overlap CGSAs.
    (ii) Cellular licensees are at most entitled to have a CGSA free of 
SABs from other cellular systems on the same channel block.
    (e) Unserved areas. Unserved areas are areas outside of all existing 
CGSAs (on either of the channel blocks), to which the Communications Act 
of 1934, as amended, is applicable.

<R05>
Sec. 22.912  Service area boundary extensions.

    This section contains rules governing service area boundary (SAB) 
extensions. SAB extensions are areas outside of the cellular market 
boundary, but within the service area as calculated using the methods of 
Sec. 22.911(a). Cellular systems must be designed to comply with the 
rules in this section. Applications proposing systems that would not 
comply with the rules in this section are defective. Service within SAB 
extensions is not protected from interference or capture under 
Sec. 22.911(d) unless and until the area within the SAB extension 
becomes a part of the cellular geographic service area (CGSA) in 
accordance with Sec. 22.911(c).
    (a) De minimis extensions. Except as restricted in paragraph (d) of 
this section, SABs may extend into adjacent cellular markets if such 
extensions are de minimis, are demonstrably unavoidable for technical 
reasons of sound engineering design, and do not extend into the CGSA of 
any other licensee's cellular system on the same channel block (unless 
the licensee of such other system consents to the extension) or into any 
adjacent cellular market on a channel block for which the five year 
build-out period has expired.
    (b) Contract extensions. Except as restricted in paragraph (d) of 
this section, licensees of cellular systems on the same channel block in 
adjacent cellular markets may, at any time, enter into contracts with 
applicants or other licensees to allow SAB extensions into their CGSA 
only (not into unserved areas). Except as restricted in paragraph (d) of 
this section, licensees of the first authorized cellular systems on the 
same channel block in adjacent cellular markets may agree to allow SAB 
extensions into their CGSA and/or unserved areas in their cellular 
markets during the five year build-out period of the market into which 
the SAB extends.
    (c) Same applicant/licensee. Except as restricted in paragraph (d) 
of this section, licensees of cellular systems that are also an 
applicant or licensee on the same channel block in adjacent cellular 
markets may, at any time, allow or propose SAB extensions from their 
adjacent market system into their CGSH only (not into unserved areas). 
Except as restricted in paragraph (d) of this section, licensees of the 
first authorized cellular systems that are also an applicant or licensee 
on the same

[[Page 181]]

channel block in adjacent cellular markets may allow or propose SAB 
extensions from their adjacent market system into their CGSA and/or 
unserved areas in their cellular markets during the five year build-out 
period of the market into which the SAB extends.
    (d) Unserved area systems. Phase I initial cellular applications 
must not propose SAB extensions. Phase I sole major modification 
applications and Phase II applications may propose SAB extensions, 
subject to the conditions in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 22.913  Effective radiated power limits.

    The effective radiated power (ERP) of transmitters in the Cellular 
Radiotelephone Service must not exceed the limits in this section.
    (a) Maximum ERP. The effective radiated power (ERP) of base 
transmitters and cellular repeaters must not exceed 500 Watts. The ERP 
of mobile transmitters and auxiliary test transmitters must not exceed 7 
Watts.
    (b) Height-power limit. The ERP of base transmitters must not exceed 
the amount that would result in an average distance to the service area 
boundary of 79.1 kilometers (49 miles) for cellular systems authorized 
to serve the Gulf of Mexico MSA and 40.2 kilometers (25 miles) for all 
other cellular systems. The average distance to the service area 
boundary is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of the distances 
determined using the procedures specified in Sec. 22.911 for the eight 
cardinal radial directions.
    (c) Coordination exemption. Licensees need not comply with the 
height-power limit in paragraph (b) of this section if the proposed 
operation is coordinated with the licensees of all affected cellular 
systems on the same channel block within 121 kilometers (75 miles) and 
concurrence is obtained.


<R05>
Sec. 22.915  Modulation requirements.

    Cellular systems must be capable of providing service using the 
types of modulation described in the cellular system compatibility 
specification.
    (a) Non-voice modulating signals. Modulating signals other than 
voice signals, such as data signals, may be transmitted, provided the 
resulting modulated emission exhibits spectral characteristics not 
exceeding those resulting from voice modulation.
    (b) Modulation levels. The levels of the modulating signals must be 
set to the values specified in this paragraph, and must be maintained 
within <plus-minus>10% of those values.
    (1) The instantaneous frequency deviation resulting from the main 
modulating signal must be <plus-minus>12 kHz.
    (2) The instantaneous frequency deviation resulting from the 
supervisory audio tones must be <plus-minus>2 kHz.
    (3) The instantaneous frequency deviation resulting from the 
signaling tone must be <plus-minus>8 kHz.
    (4) The instantaneous frequency deviation resulting from wideband 
data signals must be <plus-minus>8 kHz.
    (c) Deviation limitation circuitry. Cellular transmitters must be 
equipped with circuitry that automatically prevents modulation levels 
for voice transmissions from exceeding the limits specified in this 
section.
    (d) Audio filter characteristics. Except as provided in Sec. 22.917, 
radiotelephony signals applied to the modulator from the modulation 
limiter must be attenuated as a function of frequency as specified in 
this paragraph.
    (1) For mobile stations, these signals must be attenuated, relative 
to the level at 1 kHz, as follows:
    (i) In the frequency ranges of 3.0 to 5.9 kHz and 6.1 to 15.0 kHz, 
signals must be attenuated by at least 40 log (f<divide>3) dB, where f 
is the frequency of the signal in kHz.
    (ii) In the frequency range of 5.9 to 6.1 kHz, signals must be 
attenuated at least 35 dB.
    (iii) In the frequency range above 15 kHz, signals must be 
attenuated at least 28 dB.
    (2) For base stations, these signals shall be attenuated, relative 
to the level at 1 kHz, as follows:
    (i) In the frequency range of 3 to 15 kHz, signals must be 
attenuated by at least 40 log (f<divide>3) dB, where f is the frequency 
of the signal in kHz.
    (ii) In the frequency range above 15 kHz, signals must be attenuated 
by at least 28 dB.
    (3) Filtering is not required for the supervisory audio tones, 
signaling tones or wideband data signals.

<R05>
Sec. 22.917  Emission limitations for cellular.

    The rules in this section govern the spectral characteristics of 
emissions in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service.
    (a) Analog radiotelephony emissions. F3E emissions must be used only 
on the communication channels.
    (b) F3E/F3D emission mask for use with audio filter. For F3E and F3D 
emissions, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the mean 
power of emissions must be attenuated below the mean power of the 
unmodulated carrier wave (P) as follows:
    (1) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 
20 kHz but not more than 45 kHz:

at least 26 dB;

    (2) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 
45 kHz, up to the first multiple of the carrier frequency:

at least 60 dB or 43 + 10 log P dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation.

    (c) Alternative F3E/F3D emission mask. For F3E and F3D emissions, 
transmitters may comply with the emission limitations in this paragraph 
in lieu of compliance with paragraph (b) of this section and the audio 
filter requirement of Sec. 22.915.
    (1) The mean power of any emission removed from the carrier 
frequency by a displacement frequency (f<INF>d in kHz) must be 
attenuated below the mean power of the unmodulated carrier (P) as 
follows:
    (i) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 
12 kHz but not more than 20 kHz:

at least 117 log (f<INF>d<divide>12) dB;

    (ii) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more 
than 20 kHz, up to the first multiple of the carrier frequency:

at least 100 log (f<INF>d<divide>11) dB or 60 dB or 43 + 10 log P dB, 
whichever is the lesser attenuation;

    (2) For mobile stations, modulating signals other than the 
supervisory audio tone in the frequency range of 5.9 to 6.1 kHz must be 
attenuated, relative to the level at 1 kHz, at least 35 dB.
    (d) F1D emission mask. For F1D emissions, the mean power of 
emissions must be attenuated below the mean power of the unmodulated 
carrier (P) as follows:
    (1) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 
20 kHz but not more than 45 kHz:

at least 26 dB;

    (2) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 
45 kHz but not more than 90 kHz:

at least 45 dB;

    (3) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 
90 kHz, up to the first multiple of the carrier frequency:

at least 60 dB or 43+10 log P dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation.

    (e) Out of band emissions. The mean power of emissions must be 
attenuated below the mean power of the unmodulated carrier (P) on any 
frequency twice or more than twice the fundamental frequency by:

at least 43+10 log P dB.

    (f) Mobile emissions in base frequency range. The mean power of any 
emissions appearing in the base station frequency range from cellular 
mobile transmitters operated must be attenuated to a level not to exceed 
-80 dBm at the transmit antenna connector.
    (g) Interference from spurious emissions. If any emission from a 
transmitter operating in this service results in interference to users 
of another radio service, the FCC may require a greater attenuation of 
that emission than specified in this section.
    (h) Measurement procedure. The following spectrum analyzer bandwidth 
settings should be used for measurement of spurious emissions:
    (1) When operating in the radiotelephony mode or the supervisory 
audio tone mode:
    (i) For any emission not more than 45 kHz removed from the carrier 
frequency: 300 Hz;
    (ii) For any emission more than 45 kHz removed from the carrier 
frequency: 30 kHz.
    (2) When operating in the wideband data mode or the signaling tone 
mode:
    (i) For any emission not more than 60 kHz removed from the carrier 
frequency: 300 Hz;
    (ii) For any emission more than 60 kHz removed from the carrier 
frequency: 30 kHz.

[[Page 183]]


<R05>
Sec. 22.919  Electronic serial numbers.

    The Electronic Serial Number (ESN) is a 32 bit binary number that 
uniquely identifies a cellular mobile transmitter to any cellular 
system.
    (a) Each mobile transmitter in service must have a unique ESN.
    (b) The ESN host component must be permanently attached to a main 
circuit board of the mobile transmitter and the integrity of the unit's 
operating software must not be alterable. The ESN must be isolated from 
fraudulent contact and tampering. If the ESN host component does not 
contain other information, that component must not be removable, and its 
electrical connections must not be accessible. If the ESN host component 
contains other information, the ESN must be encoded using one or more of 
the following techniques:
    (1) Multiplication or division by a polynomial;
    (2) Cyclic coding;
    (3) The spreading of ESN bits over various non-sequential memory 
locations.
    (c) The ESN must be factory set and must not be alterable, 
transferable, removable or otherwise able to be manipulated. Cellular 
mobile equipment must be designed such that any attempt to remove, 
tamper with, or change the ESN chip, its logic system, or firmware 
originally programmed by the manufacturer will render the mobile 
transmitter inoperative.


<R05>
Sec. 22.923  Cellular system configuration.

    Mobile stations communicate with and through base transmitters only. 
Base transmitters communicate with mobile stations directly or through 
cellular repeaters. Auxiliary test stations may communicate with base or 
mobile stations for the purpose of testing equipment.


<R05>
Sec. 22.925  Prohibition on airborne operation of cellular telephones.

    Cellular telephones installed in or carried aboard airplanes, 
balloons or any other type of aircraft must not be operated while such 
aircraft are airborne (not touching the ground). When any aircraft 
leaves the ground, all cellular telephones on board that aircraft must 
be turned off. The following notice must be posted on or near each 
cellular telephone installed in any aircraft:
    ``The use of cellular telephones while this aircraft is airborne is 
prohibited by FCC rules, and the violation of this rule could result in 
suspension of service and/or a fine. The use of cellular telephones 
while this aircraft is on the ground is subject to FAA regulations.''


<R05>
Sec. 22.927  Responsibility for mobile stations.

    Mobile stations that are subscribers in good standing to a cellular 
system, when receiving service from that cellular system, are considered 
to be operating under the authorization of that cellular system. 
Cellular system licensees are responsible for exercising effective 
operational control over mobile stations receiving service through their 
cellular systems. Mobile stations that are subscribers in good standing 
to a cellular system, while receiving service from a different cellular 
system, are considered to be operating under the authorization of such 
different system. The licensee of such different system is responsible, 
during such temporary period, for exercising effective operational 
control over such mobile stations as if they were subscribers to it.


<R05>
Sec. 22.929  Application requirements for the Cellular Radiotelephone Service.

    In addition to information required by subparts B and D of this 
part, applications for authorization in the Cellular Radiotelephone 
Service must contain the applicable supplementary information described 
in this section. Initial applications for new cellular systems must also 
comply with Sec. 22.953.
    (a) Administrative information. The following information is 
required either by FCC Form 600, Schedule C, or as an exhibit.
    (1) The number of transmitter sites for which authorization is 
requested;
    (2) The call sign(s) of other facilities in the same area that are 
ultimately controlled by the real party in interest to the application;
    (3) If the application involves a service area boundary (SAB) 
extension (see Sec. 22.912), a statement as to whether the

[[Page 184]]

five year build-out period for the system on the relevant channel block 
in the market into which the SAB extends has elapsed, and whether the 
SAB extends into any unserved area in that market.
    (b) Technical information. The following information is required by 
FCC Form 600, Schedule C.
    (1) Location description; city; county; state; geographical 
coordinates correct to <plus-minus>1 second, the datum used (NAD 27 and 
NAD 83), site elevation above mean sea level, proximity to adjacent 
market boundaries and international borders;
    (2) Antenna manufacturer, model number and type, antenna height to 
tip above ground level, the height of the center of radiation of the 
antenna above the average terrain, the height of the antenna center of 
radiation above the average elevation of the terrain along each of the 8 
cardinal radials, antenna gain in the maximum lobe, the beamwidth of the 
maximum lobe of the antenna, a polar plot of the horizontal gain pattern 
of the antenna, the electric field polarization of the wave emitted by 
the antenna when installed as proposed;
    (3) The channel block requested, the maximum effective radiated 
power, the effective radiated power in each of the cardinal radial 
directions.
    (c) Maps. If the application proposes a change in the CGSA, it must 
include full size and reduced maps, and supporting engineering, as 
described in Sec. 22.953(a)(5)(i) through (iii).

<R05>
Sec. 22.933  Cellular system compatibility specification.

    Except as provided in Sec. 22.901(d), equipment used in the Cellular 
Radiotelephone Service must be designed in compliance with the technical 
specifications for compatibility of mobile and base stations in the 
Cellular Radiotelephone Service contained in ``Cellular System Mobile 
Station-Land Station Compatibility Specification'' (April 1981 Ed.), 
Office of Engineering and Technology Bulletin No. 53. This bulletin is 
contained in Appendix D to the Report and Order in CC Docket No. 79-318, 
and was published in the Federal Register of May 21, 1981. Copies may be 
obtained from the FCC's copying contractor. Special operational features 
that have been developed by joint industry consensus through the 
Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) and established as a TIA 
standard may be activated at the option of the cellular licensee, 
provided that the compatibility of equipment within the Cellular 
Radiotelephone Service as specified in OET Bulletin No. 53 is not 
adversely affected.


<R05>
Sec. 22.935  Procedures for comparative renewal proceedings.

    The procedures in this section apply to comparative renewal 
proceedings in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service.
    (a) If one or more applications competing with an application for 
renewal of a cellular authorization are filed, the renewal applicant 
must file with the FCC an original and four copies of its renewal 
expectancy showing. This filing must be submitted no later than 60 days 
after the date of the Public Notice listing as acceptable for filing the 
renewal application and the competing applications.
    (b) Interested parties may file petitions to deny any of the 
mutually exclusive applications. Any such petitions to deny must be 
filed no later than 30 days after the date that the renewal applicant 
submitted its renewal expectancy showing. Applicants may file replies to 
any petitions to deny applications that are filed. Any such replies must 
be filed no later than 15 days after the date that the petition(s) to 
deny was filed. No further pleadings will be accepted.
    (c) In most instances, the renewal application and any competing 
applications will be designated for a two-step procedure. An 
Administrative Law Judge (Presiding Judge) will conduct a threshold 
hearing (step one), in which both the licensee and the competing 
applicants will be parties, to determine whether the renewal applicant 
deserves a renewal expectancy. If the order designating the applications 
for hearing specifies any basic qualifying issues against the licensee, 
those issues will be tried in this threshold hearing. If the Presiding 
Judge determines that the renewal applicant is basically

[[Page 185]]

qualified and due a renewal expectancy, the competing applicants will be 
found ineligible for further consideration and their applications will 
be denied. If the Presiding Judge determines that the renewal applicant 
does not merit a renewal expectancy but is otherwise qualified, then all 
of the applications will be considered in a comparative hearing (step 
two).
    (d) Any competing applicant may request a waiver of the threshold 
hearing (step one), if such applicant demonstrates that its proposal so 
far exceeds the service already being provided that there would be no 
purpose in making a threshold determination as to whether the renewal 
applicant deserved a renewal expectancy vis-a-vis such a competing 
applicant. Any such waiver request must be filed at the time the 
requestor's application is filed. Petitions opposing such waiver 
requests may be filed. Any such petitions must be filed no later than 30 
days after the date that the renewal applicant submitted its renewal 
expectancy showing. Replies to any petitions opposing such waiver 
requests may be filed. Any such replies must be filed no later than 15 
days after the date that the petition(s) were filed. No further 
pleadings will be accepted. Any waiver request submitted pursuant to 
this paragraph will be acted upon prior to designating the applications 
for hearing. If a request to waive the threshold hearing (step one) is 
granted, the renewal expectancy issue will be designated as part of the 
comparative hearing (step two), and will remain the most important 
comparative factor in deciding the case, as provided in Sec. 22.940(a).
    (e) If the Presiding Judge issues a ruling in the threshold (step 
one) that denies the licensee a renewal expectancy, all of the 
applicants involved in the proceeding will be allowed to file direct 
cases no later than 90 days after the release date of the Presiding 
Judge's ruling. Rebuttal cases must be filed no later than 30 days after 
the date that the direct cases were filed.
    (f) The Presiding Judge shall use the expedited hearing procedures 
delineated in this paragraph in both threshold (step one) and 
comparative (step two) hearings conducted in comparative cellular 
renewal proceedings.
    (1) The Presiding Judge will schedule a first hearing session as 
soon as practicable after the date for filing rebuttal evidence. This 
first session will be an evidentiary admission session at which each 
applicant will identify and offer its previously circulated direct and 
rebuttal exhibits, and each party will have an opportunity to lodge 
objections.
    (2) After accepting the exhibits into evidence, the Presiding Judge 
will entertain motions to cross-examine and rule whether any sponsoring 
witness needs to be produced for cross-examination.
    Determination of what, if any, cross-examination is necessary is 
within the sound judicial discretion of the Presiding Judge, the 
prevailing standard being whether the person requesting cross-
examination has persuasively demonstrated that written evidence is 
ineffectual to develop proof. If cross-examination is necessary, the 
Presiding Judge will specify a date for the appearance of all witnesses. 
In addition, if the designation order points out an area where 
additional underlying data is needed, the Presiding Judge will have the 
authority to permit the limited use of discovery procedures. Finally, 
the Presiding Judge may find that certain additional testimony or cross-
examination is needed to provide a complete record for the FCC. If so, 
the Presiding Judge may schedule a further session.
    (3) After the hearing record is closed, the Presiding Judge may 
request Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law to be filed no 
later than 30 days after the final hearing session. Replies are not 
permitted except in unusual cases and then only with respect to the 
specific issues named by the Presiding Judge.
    (4) The Presiding Judge will then issue an Initial Decision, 
preferably within 60 days of receipt of the last pleadings. If mutually 
exclusive applications are before the Presiding Judge, the Presiding 
Judge will determine which applicant is best qualified. The Presiding 
Judge may also rank the applicants in order of merit if there are more 
than two.

[[Page 186]]

    (5) Parties will have 30 days in which to file exceptions to the 
Initial Decision. The Common Carrier Bureau has authority to determine, 
at the time of designation for hearing, that such exceptions will be 
taken directly to the FCC rather than to the Review Board.

Sec. 22.936  Dismissal of applications in cellular renewal proceedings.

    Any applicant that has filed an application in the Cellular 
Radiotelephone Service that is mutually exclusive with an application 
for renewal of a cellular authorization (competing application), and 
seeks to resolve the mutual exclusivity by requesting dismissal of its 
application, must obtain the approval of the FCC.
    (a) If a competing applicant seeks to dismiss its application prior 
to the Initial Decision stage of the hearing on its application, it must 
submit to the FCC a request for approval of the dismissal of its 
application, a copy of any written agreement related to the withdrawal 
or dismissal, and an affidavit setting forth:
    (1) A certification that neither the petitioner nor its principals 
has received or will receive any money or other consideration in excess 
of legitimate and prudent expenses in exchange for the withdrawal or 
dismissal of the application, except that this provision does not apply 
to dismissal or withdrawal of applications pursuant to bona fide merger 
agreements;
    (2) The exact nature and amount of any consideration received or 
promised;
    (3) An itemized accounting of the expenses for which it seeks 
reimbursement; and
    (4) The terms of any oral agreement related to the withdrawal or 
dismissal of the application.
    (b) In addition, within 5 days of the filing date of the applicant 
or petitioner's request for approval, each remaining party to any 
written or oral agreement must submit an affidavit setting forth:
    (1) A certification that neither the applicant nor its principals 
has paid or will pay money or other consideration in excess of the 
legitimate and prudent expenses of the petitioner in exchange for 
withdrawing or dismissing the application; and
    (2) The terms of any oral agreement relating to the withdrawal or 
dismissal of the application.
    (c) For the purposes of this section:
    (1) Affidavits filed pursuant to this section must be executed by 
the filing party, if an individual, a partner having personal knowledge 
of the facts, if a partnership, or an officer having personal knowledge 
of the facts, if a corporation or association.
    (2) Applications are deemed to be pending before the FCC from the 
time the application is filed with the FCC until such time as an order 
of the FCC granting, denying or dismissing the application is no longer 
subject to reconsideration by the FCC or to review by any court.
    (3) ``Legitimate and prudent expenses'' are those expenses 
reasonably incurred by a party in preparing to file, filing, prosecuting 
and/or settling its application for which reimbursement is sought.
    (4) ``Other consideration'' consists of financial concessions, 
including, but not limited to, the transfer of assets or the provision 
of tangible pecuniary benefit, as well as non-financial concessions that 
confer any type of benefit on the recipient.


<R05>
Sec. 22.937  Demonstration of financial qualifications.

    Except as provided in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, each 
applicant for a new cellular system must demonstrate that it has, at the 
time the application is filed, either a separate market-specific firm 
financial commitment or available financial resources sufficient to 
construct and operate for one year the proposed cellular system. Each 
application of reassignment of license or consent to transfer of control 
must demonstrate the financial ability of the proposed assignee or 
transferee to acquire and operate the facilities.
    (a) Estimated costs. The demonstration required by this section must 
include a realistic and prudent estimate of the costs of construction, 
operating and other initial expenses for one year.
    (b) Source of financing. The firm financial commitment must be 
obtained from a state or federally chartered

[[Page 187]]

bank or savings and loan association, another recognized financial 
institution, or the financial arm of a capital equipment supplier. The 
firm financial commitment may be contingent upon the applicant's 
obtaining an authorization.
    (c) Lender's statement. The firm financial commitment must contain a 
statement that:
    (1) The lender has examined the financial condition of the 
applicant, including audited financial statements if applicable, and has 
determined that the applicant is creditworthy;
    (2) The lender has examined the financial viability of each proposal 
for which the applicant intends to use the commitment;
    (3) The lender is committed to providing a sum certain to the 
particular applicant;
    (4) The lender's willingness to enter into the commitment is based 
solely on its relationship with the applicant; and,
    (5) The commitment is not in any way guaranteed by any entity other 
than the applicant.
    (d) Showings of financial resources. Applicants relying upon 
personal or internal financial resources must submit the following:
    (1) Audited financial statements, certified within one year of the 
date of the cellular application, that show the availability of 
sufficient net current assets to construct and operate for one year the 
proposed cellular system;
    (2) A balance sheet current within 60 days of the date of filing 
that shows the continued availability of sufficient net current assets 
to construct and operate for one year the proposed cellular system; and,
    (3) A certification by the applicant or an officer of the applicant 
organization attesting to the validity of the unaudited balance sheet.
    (e) Parent corporation financing. Applicants relying upon financing 
obtained from parent corporations must submit the showings listed in 
paragraph (d) of this section as the information pertains to the parent 
corporation.
    (f) Notice upon default. In addition to the disclosures required by 
paragraph (c) of this section, any loan or other credit arrangement 
providing for a chattel mortgage or secured interest in any proposed 
cellular system must include a provision for a minimum of ten (10) days 
prior written notification to the licensee, and to the FCC, before any 
such equipment may be repossessed under default provision of the 
agreement.
    (g) Competing applications in cellular renewal proceedings. Initial 
cellular applications that are competing against a cellular renewal 
application are subject to the rules in this paragraph instead of the 
rules in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.
    (1) Any applicant filing a competing application against a cellular 
renewal application must demonstrate, at the time it files its 
application, that it has either:
    (i) A firm financial commitment, an irrevocable letter of credit or 
performance bond in the amount of its realistic and prudent estimated 
costs of construction and any other expenses to be incurred during the 
first year of operating its proposed system (the irrevocable letter of 
credit or performance bond must be from the type of financial 
institution described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section); or,
    (ii) Available resources, as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this 
section, necessary to construct and operate its proposed cellular system 
for one year.
    (2) The firm financial commitment may be contingent on the applicant 
obtaining an authorization. The applicant must also list all of its 
realistic and prudent estimated costs of construction and any other 
expenses to be incurred during the first year of operating its proposed 
system.
    (3) The firm financial commitment required above shall be obtained 
from a state or federally chartered bank or savings and loan 
association, another recognized financial institution, or the financial 
arm of a capital equipment supplier; shall specify the terms of the loan 
or other form of credit arrangement, including the amount to be 
borrowed, the interest to be paid, the amount of the commitment fee and 
the fact that it has been paid, the terms of repayment and any 
collateral required; and shall contain a statement:

[[Page 188]]

    (i) That the lender has examined the financial conditions of the 
applicant, including audited financial statements where applicable, and 
has determined that the applicant is creditworthy;
    (ii) That the lender has examined the financial viability of the 
proposal for which the applicant intends to use the commitment;
    (iii) That the lender is committed to providing a sum certain to the 
particular applicant;
    (iv) That the lender's willingness to enter into the commitment is 
based solely on its relationship with the applicant; and,
    (v) That the commitment is not in any way guaranteed by an entity 
other than the applicant.
    (4) Applicants intended to rely on personal or internal resources 
must submit:
    (i) Audited financial statements certified within one year of the 
date of the cellular application, indicating the availability of 
sufficient net current assets to construct and operate the proposed 
cellular system for one year;
    (ii) A balance sheet current within 60 days of the date of filing 
its application that clearly shows the continued availability of 
sufficient net current assets to construct and operate the proposed 
cellular system for one year; and,
    (iii) A certification by the applicant or an officer of the 
applicant organization attesting to the validity of the unaudited 
balance sheet.
    (5) Applicant intending to rely upon financing obtained through a 
parent corporation must submit the information required by paragraph 
(g)(4) of this section, as the information pertains to the parent 
corporation.
    (6) As an alternative to relying upon a firm financial commitment, 
an irrevocable letter of credit, or a performance bond from a financial 
institution as described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, an 
applicant may state that it has placed in an escrow account sufficient 
cash to meet its construction and first-year operating expenses. Such a 
statement must specify the amount of cash, the escrow account number and 
the financial institution where the escrow account is located.
    (7) Any competing application filed against the renewal application 
of an incumbent cellular licensee that does not demonstrate, at the time 
it is initially filed, that the competing applicant has sufficient funds 
to construct and operate for one year its proposed cellular system will 
be dismissed.
    (h) Exemptions. Any licensee applying for an unserved area adjacent 
to its existing cellular system, to integrate such area into the 
existing system, is exempt from the financial demonstration requirements 
of this section. In addition, modification applications and pro forma 
assignment and transfer of control applications are exempt from the 
financial demonstration requirements of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 22.939  Site availability requirements for applications competing with cellular renewal applications.

    In addition to the other requirements set forth in this part for 
initial cellular applications, any application competing against a 
cellular renewal application must contain, when initially filed, 
appropriate documentation demonstrating that its proposed antenna 
site(s) will be available. Competing applications that do not include 
such documentation will be dismissed. If the competing applicant does 
not own a particular site, it must, at a minimum demonstrate that the 
site is available to it by providing a letter from the owner of the 
proposed antenna site expressing the owner's intent to sell or lease the 
proposed site to the applicant. If any proposed antenna site is under 
U.S. Government control, the applicant must submit written confirmation 
of the site's availability from the appropriate Government agency. 
Applicants which file competing applications against incumbent cellular 
licensees may not rely on the assumption that an incumbent licensee's 
antenna sites are available for their use.


<R05>
Sec. 22.940  Criteria for comparative cellular renewal proceedings.

    This section sets forth criteria to be used in comparative cellular 
renewal proceedings. The ultimate issue in comparative renewal 
proceedings will be to determine, in light of the evidence adduced in 
the proceeding, what disposition of the applications would

[[Page 189]]

best serve the public interest, convenience and necessity.
    (a) Renewal expectancies. The most important comparative factor to 
be considered in a comparative cellular renewal proceeding is a major 
preference, commonly referred to as a ``renewal expectancy.''
    (1) The cellular renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal 
proceeding will receive a renewal expectancy, if its past record for the 
relevant license period demonstrates that:
    (i) The renewal applicant has provided ``substantial'' service 
during its past license term. ``Substantial'' service is defined as 
service which is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of 
mediocre service which just might minimally warrant renewal; and
    (ii) The renewal applicant has substantially compiled with 
applicable FCC rules, policies and the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended.
    (2) In order to establish its right to a renewal expectancy, a 
cellular renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding 
must submit a showing explaining why it should receive a renewal 
expectancy. At a minimum, this showing must include.
    (i) A description of its current service in terms of geographic 
coverage and population served, as well as the system's ability to 
accommodate the needs of roamers;
    (ii) An explanation of its record of expansion, including a 
timetable of the construction of new cell sites to meet changes in 
demand for cellular service;
    (iii) A description of its investments in its cellular system; and
    (iv) Copies of all FCC orders finding the licensee to have violated 
the Communications Act or any FCC rule or policy; and a list of any 
pending proceedings that relate to any matter described in this 
paragraph.
    (3) In making its showing of entitlement to a renewal expectancy, a 
renewal applicant may claim credit for any system modification 
applications that were pending on the date it filed its renewal 
application. Such credit will not be allowed if the modification 
application is dismissed or denied.
    (b) Additional comparative issues. The following additional 
comparative issues will be included in comparative cellular renewal 
proceedings, if a full comparative hearing is conducted pursuant to 
Sec. 22.935(c).
    (1) To determine on a comparative basis the geographic areas and 
population that each applicant proposes to serve; to determine and 
compare the relative demand for the services proposed in said areas; and 
to determine and compare the ability of each applicant's cellular system 
to accommodate the anticipated demand for both local and roamer service;
    (2) To determine on a comparative basis each applicant's proposal 
for expanding its system capacity in a coordinated manner in order to 
meet anticipated increasing demand for both local and roamer service;
    (3) To determine on a comparative basis the nature and extent of the 
service proposed by each applicant, including each applicant's proposed 
rates, charges, maintenance, personnel, practices, classifications, 
regulations and facilities (including switching capabilities); and
    (4) To determine on a comparative basis each applicant's past 
performance in the cellular industry or another business of comparable 
type and size.
    (c) Additional showings for competing applications. With respect to 
evidence introduced pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, any 
applicant filing a competing application against a cellular renewal 
application (competing applicant) who claims a preference for offering 
any service not currently offered by the incumbent licensee must 
demonstrate that there is demand for that new service and also present a 
business plan showing that the competing applicant can operate the 
system economically. Any competing applicant who proposes to replace 
analog technology with digital technology will receive no credit for its 
proposal unless it submits a business plan showing how it will operate 
its system economically and how it will provide more comprehensive 
service than does the incumbent licensee with existing and implemented 
cellular technology.

<R05>
Sec. 22.941  System identification numbers.

    System identification numbers (SIDs) are 15 bit binary numbers 
assigned to cellular systems. SIDs are transmitted by the cellular 
systems so that cellular mobile stations can determine whether the 
system through which they are communicating is a system to which they 
subscribe, or whether they are considered by the system to be roamers.
    (a) The FCC assigns one SID to each cellular system on its initial 
authorization. Cellular systems may transmit only their assigned SID(s) 
and/or the SIDs assigned to other cellular systems. A cellular system 
may transmit the SID assigned to another cellular system only if the 
licensee of that system concurs with such use of its assigned SID.
    (b) Licensees must notify the FCC (FCC Form 489) if their cellular 
systems transmit SIDs assigned to other cellular systems. The 
notification must indicate the concurrence of the licensee(s) of such 
other systems with this use of their assigned SID(s). The notification 
must be mailed or delivered to the filing place (see Sec. 22.106) no 
later than 15 days after the system begins transmitting the SID(s).
    (c) Licensees may request that an additional (previously unassigned) 
SID be assigned to their system by filing an application for minor 
modification of station (FCC Form 600).

<R05>
Sec. 22.942  Limitations on interests in licensees for both channel blocks in an area.

    No person may have a direct or indirect ownership interest in 
licensees for both channel blocks in overlapping cellular geographic 
service areas (CGSAs), unless such interests pose no substantial threat 
to competition. A licensee, a person that owns a controlling interest in 
a licensee, or a person that actually controls a licensee for one 
channel block in a CGSA must not have any direct or indirect ownership 
interest in the licensee, a person that owns a controlling interest in a 
licensee, or a person that actually controls a licensee for the other 
channel block in an overlapping CGSA.
    (a) A direct or indirect ownership interest of 5% or less in both 
systems is automatically excluded from the general rule prohibiting 
multiple ownership interests. Interests of less than 5% are considered 
and are not excluded from the general rule prohibiting multiple 
ownership interests in cases of persons or entities that own a small 
percentage of the licensee but nonetheless actually control the 
licensee, a person that owns a controlling interest in the licensee, or 
a person that actually controls the licensee.
    (b) Divestiture of interests as a result of a transfer of control or 
assignment of authorization must occur prior to consummating the 
transfer or assignment.


<R05>
Sec. 22.943  Limitations on assignments and transfers of cellular authorizations.

    The following limitations apply to applications for consent to 
transfer of control or assignment of authorizations in the Cellular 
Radiotelephone Service.
    (a) Trafficking. Applications for consent to transfer of control or 
assignment of authorization in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service are 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 22.139, except for:
    (1) Applications reflecting the trading of an ownership interest in 
an authorized but unconstructed cellular system in one market for a 
commensurate interest in a cellular system in another market; and,
    (2) Applications for consent to transfer of control or assignment of 
a cellular authorization obtained by random selection, after 
commencement of service.
    (b) Unserved area systems. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, the FCC does not accept applications for consent 
to transfer of control or assignment of the authorization of a cellular 
system licensed to serve an unserved area until the system has provided 
service to subscribers for at least one year.
    (1) Licensees must not enter into any agreement (e.g. option 
agreement or management contract) to transfer control of the licensee of 
the system until

[[Page 191]]

the system has provided service to subscribers for one year.
    (2) The FCC may accept that grant applications for consent to 
transfer of control or for assignment of authorization if the transfer 
or assignment is pro forma and does not involve a change in ownership.
    (c) Systems authorized as result of comparative renewal proceeding. 
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2) and (c)(3) of 
this section, the FCC does not accept applications for consent to 
transfer of control or for assignment of the authorization of a cellular 
system that has been acquired by the current licensee for the first time 
as a result of a comparative renewal proceeding until the system has 
provided service to subscribers for at least three years.
    (1) The FCC may accept and grant applications for consent to 
transfer of control or for assignment of the authorization of a cellular 
system that is to be transferred as a part of a bona fide sale of an on-
going business to which the cellular operation is incidental.
    (2) The FCC may accept and grant applications for consent to 
transfer of control or for assignment of the authorization of a cellular 
system that is to be transferred as a result of the death of the 
licensee.
    (3) The FCC may accept and grant applications for consent to 
transfer of control or for assignment of authorization if the transfer 
or assignment is pro forma and does not involve a change in ownership.


<R05>
Sec. 22.944  Transfers of interests in applications.

    This section governs transfers of interest in applicants having a 
pending application for a new cellular system. For the purposes of this 
section, ``interest in an application'' means interest in the applicant.
    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the 
transfer of any interest in any application for initial authorization to 
operate a cellular system is prohibited. For the purposes of this 
section, transfer of interest means the sale, assignment, placement of 
equity or convertible debt, grant of an option or future share or 
participation in the applicant or any interest thereof.
    (b) The following types of transfers of interest in cellular 
applications are permitted:
    (1) Transfers that are necessary to raise capital, including the 
placement of debt or equity, to finance a bona fide business need of the 
applicant or an affiliated company, not related to the cellular 
application or financing of the cellular system proposed therein;
    (2) Transfers that are part of a bona fide sale of an ongoing 
business to which the cellular applications are merely adjunct or 
incidental;
    (3) Transfers required by a court-ordered decree granting a divorce 
or enforcing a spousal separation agreement;
    (4) Transfers necessitated by the death of the applicant;
    (5) Transfers involving the routine trading of shares in a publicly 
traded corporation that do not constitute a transfer of control of the 
applicant;
    (6) Transfers resulting from pro forma transfers of control of the 
applicant, not involving changes in ownership;
    (7) Transfers involving only the transfer of interest by one 
existing partner in a partnership applicant to another existing partner 
in that same partnership, or between existing shareholders in a closely-
held corporation, which does not effect a transfer of control of the 
applicant;
    (8) Transfers resulting from the alienation or exercise of stock 
warrants or stock options that existed prior to the filing of the 
application.


<R05>
Sec. 22.945  Interests in multiple applications.

    This section governs interests in applicants with mutually exclusive 
applications for a new cellular system. For the purposes of this 
section, ``interest in an application'' means interest in the applicant.
    (a) General. Except as otherwise provided in this section, parties 
must not have any interest, direct or indirect, in more than one 
application for authority to operate a new cellular system in the same 
cellular market.
    (b) Abutting CGSAs. Licensees of existing systems whose cellular 
geographic service area (CGSA) abuts a

[[Page 192]]

proposed CGSA may each file one application that is mutually exclusive 
with the applications of other such licensees, even though they share 
common owners, provided that such licensees do not thereby acquire a 
simultaneous interest in applications for both channel blocks in any 
geographical area.
    (c) Publicly traded corporate applicants. Parties must not have any 
interest, direct or indirect, in more than one mutually exclusive 
initial application for which the applicant is a publicly traded 
corporation, except that ownership interests of less than 5% are not 
considered. Ownership and other interests in applicants are attributed 
to their holder and deemed cognizable as set forth below.
    (1) Passive investors. Investment companies, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 
80a-3, insurance companies and banks holding stock through their trust 
departments in trust accounts are deemed to have a cognizable interest 
in a publicly traded cellular applicant only if they hold 10% or more of 
the stock of the applicant. This provision applies only if an applicant 
in which such parties hold an interest certifies in its application that 
no such party has exerted or attempted to exert any influence or control 
over the officers of the applicant.
    (2) Multiplier. Attribution of ownership interests in a publicly 
traded cellular applicant that are held indirectly by any party through 
one or more intervening corporations will be determined by successive 
multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in the 
vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution 
benchmark to the resulting product, except that wherever the ownership 
percentage for any link in the chain exceeds 50 percent, it is not 
included in the multiplication.


<R05>
Sec. 22.946  Service commencement and construction periods for cellular systems.

    This section specifies the service commencement and construction 
periods and related requirements for cellular systems.
    (a) Commencement of service. New cellular systems must be at least 
partially constructed and begin providing cellular service to 
subscribers within the service commencement periods specified in Table 
H-1 of this section. Service commencement periods begin on the date of 
grant of the initial authorization, and are not extended by the grant of 
subsequent authorizations for the cellular system (such as for major 
modifications).

                   Table H-1.--Commencement of Service                  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            Required to commence service
         Type of cellular system                       within           
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first system authorized on each        36 months.                   
 channel block in markets 1-90.                                         
The first system authorized on each        18 months.                   
 channel block in all other markets and                                 
 any subsequent systems authorized                                      
 pursuant to contracts in partitioned                                   
 markets.                                                               
All other systems........................  12 months.                   
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) To satisfy the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a 
cellular system must be interconnected with the public switched 
telephone network (PSTN) and must be providing service to mobile 
stations operated by its subscribers and roamers. A cellular system is 
not considered to be providing service to subscribers if mobile stations 
can not make telephone calls to landline telephones and receive 
telephone calls from landline telephones through the PSTN, or if the 
system intentionally serves only roamer stations.
    (2) The licensee must notify the FCC (FCC Form 489) no later than 15 
days after the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met.
    (b) Construction period for specific facilities. The construction 
period applicable to specific new or modified cellular facilities for 
which an authorization has been granted is one year from the date the 
authorization is granted. Failure to comply with this requirement 
results in termination of the authorization for the specific new or 
modified facility, pursuant to Sec. 22.144(b).


<R05>
Sec. 22.947  Five year build-out period.

    The licensee of the first cellular system authorized on each channel 
block in each cellular market is afforded a five year period, beginning 
on the date the initial authorization for the system

[[Page 193]]

is granted, during which it may expand the system within that market.
    (a) Exclusive right to expand within market. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, the FCC does not accept applications for 
authority to operate a new cellular system in any unserved area in a 
market on a channel block during the five year build-out period.
    (b) Partitioned markets. During the five year build-out period, the 
licensee of the first cellular system on each channel block in each 
market may enter into contracts with eligible parties, allowing such 
parties to apply (FCC Form 600) for a new cellular system on that 
channel block within the market. The FCC may grant such applications if 
they are in compliance with the rules in this part. Markets with two or 
more authorized cellular systems on the same channel block during the 
five year build-out period are referred to (with respect to the affected 
channel block) as ``partitioned markets''.
    (1) Partitioning contracts must define the CGSA of the subsequent 
cellular system in accordance with Sec. 22.911, including any expansion 
rights ceded. If not exercised, any such expansion rights terminate at 
the end of the five year build-out period.
    (2) The five year build-out period begins on the date the initial 
authorization for the first cellular system is granted, and is not 
extended or affected in any way by the initial authorization of any 
subsequent cellular systems pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
    (c) System information update. Sixty days before the end of the five 
year build-out period, the licensee of each cellular system authorized 
on each channel block in each cellular market must file, in triplicate, 
a system information update (SIU), comprising a full size map, a reduced 
map, and an exhibit showing technical data relevant to determination of 
the system's CGSA. Separate maps must be submitted for each market into 
which the CGSA extends, showing the extension area in the adjacent 
market. Maps showing extension areas must be labeled (i.e. marked with 
the market number and channel block) for the market into which the CGSA 
extends. SIUs must accurately depict the relevant cell locations and 
coverage of the system at the end of the five year build-out period. 
SIUs must be filed at the Mobile Services Division, Common Carrier 
Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554. If any 
changes to the system occur after the filing of the SIU, but before the 
end of the five year build-out period, the licensee must file, in 
triplicate, additional maps and/or data as necessary to insure that the 
cell locations and coverage of the system as of the end of the five year 
build-out period are accurately depicted.
    (1) The scale of the full-size map must be 1:500,000, regardless of 
whether any different scale is used for the reduced map. The map must 
have a legend, a distance scale and correctly labeled latitude and 
longitude lines. The map must be clear and legible. The map must 
accurately show the cell sites (transmitting antenna locations) which 
determine the CGSA, the entire CGSA, any extension of the composite 
service are boundary beyond the CGSA (see Sec. 22.911) and the relevant 
portions of the cellular market boundary. The date on which the map 
depictions are accurate must appear on the map.
    (2) The reduced map must be a proportional reduction, to 8\1/2\ x 11 
inches, of the full-size map required in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, unless it proves to be impractical to depict the entire market 
by reducing the full-size map. In such instance, an 8\1/2\ x 11 inch map 
of a different scale may be substituted, provided that the required 
features of the full-size map are clearly depicted and labeled.

Sec. 22.949  Unserved area licensing process.

    This section sets forth the process for licensing unserved areas in 
cellular markets on channel blocks for which the five year build-out 
period has expired. This process has two phases: Phase I and Phase II.
    (a) Phase I. Phase I is a one-time process that provides an 
opportunity for eligible parties to file competing applications for 
authority to operate a new cellular system in or to expand an

[[Page 194]]

existing cellular system into unserved areas (Phase I initial 
applications) as soon as these areas become available. In addition, each 
licensee whose Phase I initial application is granted is afforded one 
opportunity during the Phase I process to file an application proposing 
major modifications to the cellular system authorized by that grant (a 
Phase I major modification application), without being subject to 
competing applications.
    (1) Phase I initial applications must be filed on the 31st day after 
the expiration of the five year build-out period of the authorized 
system(s) on the channel block requested in the market containing the 
unserved area.
    (i) Each Phase I application must request authorization for one and 
only one cellular geographic service area (CGSA) in one and only one 
cellular market.
    (ii) Applicants must not file more than one Phase I initial 
application for any cellular market.
    (iii) Phase I initial applications must not propose any de minimis 
or contract service area boundary (SAB) extensions.
    (2) Only one Phase I initial application is granted on each channel 
block in each market. Consequently, whenever two or more acceptable 
Phase I initial applications are timely filed in the same market on the 
same channel block, such Phase I initial applications are mutually 
exclusive, regardless of any other considerations such as the technical 
proposals. In order to determine which of such mutually exclusive Phase 
I initial applications to grant, the Commission administers competitive 
bidding procedures in accordance with subpart Q of part 1 of this 
chapter. After such procedures, the application of the winning bidder 
may be granted and the applications excluded by that grant may be 
dismissed without prejudice.

    Note: Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 22.949(a)(2), mutually 
exclusive Phase I initial applications that were filed between March 10, 
1993 and July 25, 1993, inclusive, are to be included in a random 
selection process, following which the selected application may be 
granted and the applications excluded by that grant may be dismissed 
without prejudice.
    (3) Phase I major modification applications (applications filed 
during Phase I that propose major modifications to cellular systems 
authorized by the grant of Phase I initial applications) must be filed 
no later than 90 days after the grant of the Phase I initial 
application. Each Phase I licensee may file only one Phase I major 
modification application. The FCC will not accept any competing 
applications in response to a Phase I major modification application. 
Phase I licensees may not sell to a third party any rights to apply for 
unserved area.
    (i) Phase I major modification applications may propose de minimis 
or contract SAB extensions; provided that a contract SAB extension into 
an adjacent market may be proposed only if, at the time the Phase I 
major modification application is filed, the licensee in the adjacent 
market (on the requested channel block) has the right to enter into such 
a contract (see Sec. 22.912(c)).
    (ii) Phase I major modification application may propose a CGSA that 
is not contiguous with the authorized or proposed CGSA, provided that 
the non-contiguous CGSA meets the minimum coverage requirement of 
Sec. 22.951.
    (4) Phase I licensees may also file applications for or 
notifications of minor modifications to its system. However, such minor 
modifications may not reduce the size of the CGSA below the minimum 
coverage requirement of Sec. 22.951.
    (b) Phase II.  Phase II is an on-going filing process that allows 
eligible parties to apply for any unserved areas that may remain in a 
market after the Phase I process is complete.
    (1) If a Phase I initial application is granted for a market and 
channel block, Phase II applications (applications for authority to 
operate a cellular system in any remaining unserved area) for that 
market and channel block may be filed on or after the 121st day after 
the Phase I application was granted. If no Phase I initial applications 
are granted for a market and channel block, Phase II applications for 
that market and channel block may be filed on or after the 31st day 
after the FCC dismissed the last pending Phase I application. If no

[[Page 195]]

Phase I initial applications are received for a market and channel 
block, Phase II applications for that market and channel block may be 
filed on or after the 32nd day after the expiration of the relevant 
five-year build-out period.
    (2) There is no limit to the number of Phase II applications that 
may be granted on each channel block in each market. Consequently, Phase 
II applications are mutually exclusive only if the proposed CGSAs would 
overlap. Mutually exclusive applications are processed using the general 
procedures in Sec. 22.131.
    (3) Phase II applications may propose a CGSA covering more than one 
cellular market. Each Phase II application must request authorization 
for one and only one CGSA. Phase II applications may propose de minimis 
and contract SAB extensions.
    (c) Settlements among mutually exclusive applicants. Settlements 
among some, but not all, applicants with mutually exclusive applications 
for unserved areas (partial settlements) are prohibited. Settlements 
among all applicants with mutually exclusive applications (full 
settlements) are allowed and must be filed no later than fifteen (15) 
business days before the competitive bidding procedure is scheduled to 
take place.
    (d) Limitations on amendments. Notwithstanding the provisions of 
Sec. 22.122, Phase I applications are subject to the following 
additional limitations in regard to the filing of amendments.
    (1) The Commission will not accept amendments (of any type) to 
mutually exclusive Phase I applications prior to the conclusion of the 
competitive bidding process.
    (2) The FCC will not accept major amendments to Phase I 
applications.
    (3) Minor amendments required by Sec. 1.65 of this chapter must be 
filed no later than thirty (30) days after public notice announcing the 
results of the competitive bidding process.

Sec. 22.951  Minimum coverage requirement.

    Applications for authority to operate a new cellular system in an 
unserved area, other than those filed by the licensee of an existing 
system that abuts the unserved area, must propose a contiguous cellular 
geographical service area (CGSA) of at least 130 square kilometers (50 
square miles). Area within contract SAB extensions counts toward the 
minimum coverage requirement. However, area within de minimis SAB 
extensions does not count toward the minimum coverage requirement. 
Applications for authority to operate a new cellular system in an 
unserved area, other than those filed by the licensee of an existing 
system that abuts the unserved area, must not propose coverage of water 
areas only (or water areas and uninhabited islands or reefs only), 
except for unserved areas in the Gulf of Mexico MSA.


<R05>

Sec. 22.955  Canadian condition.

    Pursuant to an agreement between the FCC and the Department of 
Communications in Canada, authorizations for cellular systems within 72 
kilometers (45 miles) of the U.S.-Canadian border must have the 
following condition attached:

    This authorization is subject to the condition that, in the event 
that cellular systems using the same channel block as granted herein are 
authorized in adjacent territory in Canada, coordination of any of your 
transmitter installations which are within 72 kilometers (45 miles) of 
the U.S.-Canadian border shall be required to eliminate any harmful 
interference that might otherwise exist and to insure continuance of 
equal access to the channel block by both countries.


<R05>
Sec. 22.957  Mexican condition.

    Pursuant to an agreement between the United States and Mexico, FCC 
authorizations for cellular systems within 72 kilometers (45 miles) of 
the United States-Mexican border must have the following condition 
attached:

    This authorization is subject to the condition that, in the event 
cellular systems using the same frequencies granted herein are 
authorized in adjacent territory in Mexico, coordination of your 
transmitter installations which are within 72 kilometers (45 miles) of 
the United States-Mexico border shall be required to eliminate any 
harmful interference that might otherwise exist and to ensure 
continuance of equal access to the frequencies by both countries. The 
operator of this system shall not contract with customers in Mexico, and 
further, users of the system must be advised that operation of a mobile 
unit in Mexico is not permitted at this time without the express 
permission of the Mexican government. The above conditions are subject 
to modification pending further notice from the FCC.


<R05>
Sec. 22.959  Rules governing processing of applications for initial systems.

    Pending applications for authority to operate the first cellular 
system on a channel block in an MSA or RSA market continue to be 
processed under the rules governing the processing of such applications 
that were in effect when those applications were filed, unless the 
Commission determines otherwise in a particular case.

               Subpart I--Offshore Radiotelephone Service


<R05>
Sec. 22.1001  Scope.

    The rules in this subpart govern the licensing and operation of 
offshore radiotelephone stations. The licensing and operation of these 
stations and systems is also subject to rules elsewhere in this part 
that apply generally to the public mobile services. However, in case of 
conflict, the rules in this subpart govern.


<R05>
Sec. 22.1003  Eligibility.

    Offshore central station licenses may be licensed to communications 
common carriers. Offshore subscriber stations may be licensed to common 
carriers or users of the service.


<R05>
Sec. 22.1005  Priority of service.

    Facilities in the Offshore Radiotelephone Service are intended 
primarily for rendition of public message service between offshore 
subscriber and central stations. However, they may also be used to 
render private leased line communication service, provided that such 
usage does not reduce or impair the extent or quality of communication 
service which would be available, in the absence of private leased line 
service, to the general public receiving or subsequently requesting 
public message service from an offshore central station.

[[Page 198]]


<R05>
Sec. 22.1007  Channels for offshore radiotelephone systems.

    The channels listed in this section are allocated for paired 
assignment to transmitters located in the specified geographical zones 
that provide offshore radiotelephone service. All channels have a 
bandwidth of 20 kHz and are designated by their center frequencies in 
MegaHertz.
    (a) Zone A--Southern Louisiana. The geographical area in Zone A is 
bounded as follows:

    From longitude W.87 deg.45' on the East to longitude W.94 deg.00' on 
the West and from the 4.8 kilometer (3 mile) limit along the Gulf of 
Mexico shoreline on the North to the limit of the Outer Continental 
Shelf on the South.

    (8) Interstitial channels. Interstitial channels are those with 
center frequencies offset by <plus-minus>12.5 kHz from the listed center 
frequencies. The FCC may assign interstitial channels to offshore 
stations in Zone A subject to the following conditions:
    (i) Offshore stations transmitting on interstitial channels must be 
located east of W.92 deg. longitude.
    (ii) Operations on interstitial channels are considered to be 
secondary to operations on channels with the listed center frequencies.
    (iii) Offshore stations operating on interstitial channels must be 
used only for voice grade general communications or to provide for 
private line service.

    Note to paragraph (a) of Sec. 22.1007: These channels are contained 
in UHF TV Channel 17.

    (b) Zone B--Southern Louisiana--Texas. (1) The geographical area in 
Zone B is bounded as follows:

    From longitude W.87 deg.45' on the East to longitude W.95 deg.00' on 
the West and from the 4.8 kilometer (3 mile) limit along the Gulf of 
Mexico shoreline on the North to the limit of the Outer Continental 
Shelf on the South.

    (2) These channels may be assigned for use by offshore central 
(base/fixed) or subscriber stations (fixed, temporary fixed, surface 
and/or airborne mobile) as indicated, for voice-grade general 
communications and private line service:

Sec. 22.1009   Transmitter locations.

    The rules in this section establish limitations on the locations 
from which stations in the Offshore Radiotelephone Service may transmit.
    (a) All stations. Offshore stations must not transmit from locations 
outside the boundaries of the appropriate zones specified in 
Sec. 22.1007. Offshore stations must not transmit from locations within 
241 kilometers (150 miles) of any full-service television station that 
transmits on the TV channel containing the channel on which the offshore 
station transmits.
    (b) Airborne subscriber stations. Airborne subscriber stations must 
not transmit from altitudes exceeding 305 meters (1000 feet) above mean 
sea level. Airborne mobile stations in Zone A must not transmit from 
locations within 129 kilometers (80 miles) of Lake Charles, Louisiana. 
Airborne mobile stations in Zone B must not transmit from locations 
within 129 kilometers (80 miles) of Lafayette, Louisiana. Airborne 
mobile stations in Zone C must not transmit from locations within 129 
kilometers (80 miles) of Corpus Christi or locations within 129 
kilometers (80 miles) of Houston, Texas.


<R05>
Sec. 22.1011   Antenna height limitations.

    The antenna height of offshore stations must not exceed 61 meters 
(200 feet) above mean sea level. The antenna height of offshore surface 
mobile stations must not exceed 10 meters (30 feet) above the waterline.


<R05>
Sec. 22.1013   Effective radiated power limitations.

    The effective radiated power (ERP) of transmitters in the Offshore 
Radiotelephone Service must not exceed the limits in this section.

[[Page 201]]

    (a) Maximum power. The ERP of transmitters in this service must not 
exceed 1000 Watts under any circumstances.
    (b) Mobile transmitters. The ERP of mobile transmitters must not 
exceed 100 Watts. The ERP of mobile transmitters, when located within 32 
kilometers (20 miles) of the 4.8 kilometer (3 mile) limit, must not 
exceed 25 Watts. The ERP of airborne mobile stations must not exceed 1 
Watt.
    (c) Protection for TV Reception. The ERP limitations in this 
paragraph are intended to reduce the likelihood that interference to 
television reception from offshore radiotelephone operations will occur.
    (1) Co-channel protection. The ERP of offshore stations must not 
exceed the limits in Table I-1 of this section. The limits depend upon 
the height above mean sea level of the offshore transmitting antenna and 
the distance between the antenna location of the offshore transmitter 
and the antenna location of the main transmitter of the nearest full-
service television station that transmits on the TV channel containing 
the channel on which the offshore station transmits.
    (2) Adjacent channel protection. The ERP of offshore stations 
located within 128.8 kilometers (80 miles) of the main transmitter 
antenna of a full service TV station that transmits on a TV channel 
adjacent to the TV channel which contains the channel on which the 
offshore station transmits must not exceed the limits in the Table I-2 
of Sec. 22.1015. The limits depend upon the height above mean sea level 
of the offshore transmitting antenna and the distance between the 
location of the offshore transmitter and the 4.8 kilometer (3 mile) 
limit.

Sec. 23.13   Types of emission.

    Stations in the international fixed public radiocommunication 
services may be authorized to use any of the types of emission or 
combinations thereof, described in Part 2 of this chapter, as well as 
new types which may be developed: Provided, That harmful interference to 
adjacent operations is not caused thereby, And provided further, That 
the intelligence to be transmitted will use the bandwidth requested to a 
degree of efficiency compatible with the current state of the art. A 
determination of the possibilities of interference will be made as 
outlined in Sec. 23.20. In certain cases frequencies or emissions may be 
authorized on a temporary basis to determine if interference will occur. 
During normal operations, emissions shall be centered about an assigned 
frequency. Non-centered emissions may be employed for short periods of 
time as needed to avoid interfering signals or meet fluctuating traffic 
loading: Provided, That the occupied bandwidth of these emissions be 
contained within the authorized bandwidth, And provided further, That 
prior to any such use, the Commission be notified of the reference 
frequency or frequencies proposed to be used in lieu of the assigned

<R05>
Sec. 23.17   Frequency measurement.

    Each station shall provide for the measurement of all frequencies 
assigned thereto, and establish a procedure for checking them regularly. 
These measurements shall be made by means independent of the frequency 
control of the transmitter and shall be of accuracy sufficient to detect 
deviation from the assigned frequency within one-half of the allowed 
tolerance. A record shall be kept of the results and dates of all 
frequency measurements.

[38 FR 22480, Aug. 21, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 23.18   Authorization of power.

    (a) Authorized power. Power, when designated in the respective 
station license for a particular transmitter or transmitters, is peak 
envelope power for transmitters having full, unkeyed carrier, single 
sideband or independent sideband emissions, and mean power for 
transmitters having other emissions, unless specifically expressed 
otherwise. Designation of effective radiated power may appear in the 
station license in addition to designation of power for a transmitter or 
transmitters, when deemed necessary by the Commission.
    (b) Use of minimum power. In the interest of avoiding interference 
to other operations, all stations shall radiate only as much power as is 
necessary to ensure a satisfactory service.

[38 FR 22480, Aug. 21, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 23.19   Use of directional antennas.

    Insofar as is practicable, directional antennas, of type consistent 
with the current state of art, shall be used on all circuits for both 
transmitting and receiving.

[38 FR 22480, Aug. 21, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 23.20   Assignment of frequencies.

    (a) Only those frequencies which are in accordance with Sec. 2.106 
of this chapter may be authorized for use by stations in the Fixed 
Public and Fixed Public Press Services. Selection of specific 
frequencies within such bands shall be made by the applicants therefor. 
After an application has been filed with the Commission for a particular 
frequency, its availability for assignment as requested will be 
determined by a study of the probabilities of interference to and from 
existing services assigned on the same or adjacent frequencies and, if 
necessary, by coordination with other agencies utilizing frequencies in 
these ranges. The applicant will be notified of the results of such 
study and coordination. All new assignments of frequencies may be made 
subject to certain conditions as may be required to minimize the 
possibility of harmful interference to existing services.
    (b) In order to minimize possible harmful interference at the 
National Radio Astronomy Observatory site located at Green Bank, 
Pocahontas County, West Virginia, and at the Naval Radio Research 
Observatory site at Sugar Grove, Pendleton County, West Virginia, any 
applicant for a station authorization other than mobile, temporary base, 
temporary fixed, Personal Radio, Civil Air Patrol, or Amateur seeking a 
station license for a new station, a construction permit to construct a 
new station or to modify an existing station license in a manner which 
would change either the frequency, power, antenna height or directivity, 
or location of such a station within the area bounded by 39 deg.15' N. 
on the north, 78 deg.30' W. on the east, 37 deg.30' N. on the south and 
80 deg.30' W. on the west shall, at the time of filing such application 
with the Commission, simultaneously notify the Director, National Radio 
Astronomy Observatory, P. O. Box No. 2, Green Bank, West Virginia, 
24944, in writing, of the technical particulars of the proposed station. 
Such notification shall include the geographical coordinates of the 
antenna, antenna height, antenna directivity if any, proposed frequency, 
type of emission, and power. In addition, the applicant shall indicate 
in his application to the Commission the date notification was made to 
the Observatory. After receipt of such applications, the Commission will 
allow a period of twenty (20) days for comments or objections in 
response to the notifications indicated. If an objection to the proposed 
operation is received during the twenty day period from the National 
Radio Astronomy Observatory for itself or on behalf

[[Page 207]]

of the Naval Radio Research Observatory, the Commission will consider 
all aspects of the problem and take whatever action is deemed 
appropriate.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Protection for Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone, Boulder 
County, Colorado: Applicants for a station authorization to operate in 
the vicinity of Boulder County, Colorado under this part are advised to 
give due consideration, prior to filing applications, to the need to 
protect the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone from harmful 
interference. These are the research laboratories of the Department of 
Commerce, Boulder County, Colorado. To prevent degradation of the 
present ambient radio signal level at the site, the Department of 
Commerce seeks to ensure that the field strengths of any radiated 
signals (excluding reflected signals) received on this 728 hectare site 
(in the vicinity of coordinates 40 deg.07'50" N Latitude, 105 deg.14'40" 
W Longitude) resulting from new assignments (other than mobile stations) 
or from the modification or relocation of existing facilities do not 
exceed the following values:

\1\ Equivalent values of power flux density are calculated assuming free
  space characteristic impedance of 376.7=120<greek-p> ohms.            
\2\ Space stations shall conform to the power flux density limits at the
  earth's surface specified in appropriate parts of the FCC rules, but  
  in no case should exceed the above levels in any 4 kHz band for all   
  angles of arrival.                                                    

    (1) Advance consultation is recommended particularly for those 
applicants who have no reliable data which indicates whether the field 
strength or power flux density figures in the above table would be 
exceeded by their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In 
such instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining 
whether coordination is recommended:
    (i) All stations within 2.4 kilometers;
    (ii) Stations within 4.8 kilometers with 50 watts or more effective 
radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of polarization in the 
azimuthal direction of the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone;
    (iii) Stations within 16.1 kilometers with 1 kW or more ERP in the 
primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of Table 
Mountain Receiving Zone;
    (iv) Stations within 80.5 kilometers with 25 kW or more ERP in the 
primary plane or polarization in the azimuthal direction of Table 
Mountain Receiving Zone.
    (2) Applicants concerned are urged to communicate with the Radio 
Frequency Management Coordinator, Department of Commerce, Research 
Support Services, NOAA R/E5X2, Boulder Laboratories, Boulder, CO 80303; 
telephone (303) 497-6548, in advance of filing their applications with 
the Commission.
    (3) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised 
that such consultation can avoid objections from the Department of 
Commerce or proceedings to modify any authorization which may be granted 
which, in fact, delivers a signal at the site in excess of the field 
strength specified herein.
    (e) Protection for Federal Communications Commission monitoring 
stations:
    (1) Applicants in the vicinity of an FCC monitoring station for a 
radio station authorization to operate new transmitting facilities or 
changed transmitting facilities which would increase the field strength 
produced over the monitoring station over that previously authorized are 
advised to give consideration, prior to filing applications, to the 
possible need to protect the FCC stations from harmful interference. 
Geographical coordinates of the facilities which require protection are 
listed in Sec. 0.121(c) of the Commission's Rules. Applications for 
stations (except mobile stations) which will produce on any frequency a 
direct wave fundamental field strength of greater than 10 mV/m in the 
authorized bandwidth of service (-65.8 dBW/m<SUP>2 power

[[Page 208]]

flux density assuming a free space characteristic impedance of 120 ohms) 
at the referenced coordinates, may be examined to determine extent of 
possible interference. Depending on the theoretical field strength value 
and existing root-sum-square or other ambient radio field signal levels 
at the indicated coordinates, a clause protecting the monitoring station 
may be added to the station authorization.
    (2) In the event that calculated value of expected field exceeds 10 
mV/m (-65.8 dBW/m<SUP>2) at the reference coordinates, or if there is 
any question whether field strength levels might exceed the threshold 
value, advance consultation with the FCC to discuss any protection 
necessary should be considered. Prospective applicants may communicate 
with: Chief, Compliance and Information Bureau, Federal Communications 
Commission, Washington, DC 20554, Telephone (202) 632-6980.
    (3) Advance consultation is suggested particularly for those 
applicants who have no reliable data which indicates whether the field 
strength or power flux density figure indicated would be exceeded by 
their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In such 
instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining whether an 
applicant should coordinate:
    (i) All stations within 2.4 kilometers (1.5 statute miles);
    (ii) Stations within 4.8 kilometers (3 statute miles) with 50 watts 
or more average effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of 
polarization in the azimuthal direction of the Monitoring Stations.
    (iii) Stations within 16 kilometers (10 statute miles) with 1 kW or 
more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of the Monitoring Station;
    (iv) Stations within 80 kilometers (50 statute miles) with 25 kW or 
more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of the Monitoring Station;
    (4) Advance coordination for stations operating above 1000 MHz is 
recommended only where the proposed station is in the vicinity of a 
monitoring station designated as a satellite monitoring facility in 
Sec. 0.121(c) of the Commission's Rules and also meets the criteria 
outlined in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section.
    (5) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised 
that such consultation can avoid objections from the Federal 
Communications Commission or modification of any authorization which 
will cause harmful interference.

Sec. 23.37   Station identification.

    (a) General. Every radiotelegraph or radiotelephone station in the 
International Fixed Public or Fixed Public Press Service shall transmit, 
as provided below, the identifying call sign or other approved 
identification signal on each of its assigned frequencies below 30 MHz 
on which energy is being radiated.
    (b) When required. (1) The call sign assigned to each frequency 
shall be transmitted on that frequency at the beginning and end of each 
period of use of the frequency.
    (2) During regular operation on any freuency, the call sign or other 
approved identification signal shall be transmitted at least at hourly 
intervals within the period from 10 minutes before to 10 minutes after 
each hour. If identification during this period would require an 
interruption in the transmission of a radio-photo, a telephone 
conversation, an addressed program or a multiple addressed press 
message, or a break in the continuity of a ``conference'' or ``leased 
line'' type of service, the identifying signal shall be transmitted at 
the first break in, at the conclusion of, or simultaneously with, the 
particular transmission as described below.
    (c) Methods of transmission. (1) All identifying signals shall be 
transmitted in such a manner as to permit identification without special 
equipment other than communication type receivers, except as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section. When emissions are being used which are 
not capable of identification without special equipment, the identifying 
signal shall be transmitted by one of the following methods:
    (i) By interrupting the transmission and transmitting the call sign 
in a manner which can be identified without special equipment.
    (ii) By superimposing the call sign or other approved identification 
signal on the emission being transmitted without interrupting the 
transmission as provided for by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.
    (d) Emissions to be used. (1) Except as otherwise provided, the 
following emissions shall be used for identification:
    (i) Radiotelegraph stations. The identifying call sign shall be 
transmitted by International Morse code at a speed not to exceed 25 
words per minute and shall consist of the signal ``QRA de'' followed by 
the call sign. This transmission shall be made at least three times.
    (ii) Radiotelegraph stations using telephone type emissions. When 
telephone type emissions are being used in accordance with Sec. 23.11, 
identification may be made by voice and shall consist of announcing 
three times in English the call sign of the frequency being used
    (iii) Radiotelephone stations. The identifying transmission may be 
made utilizing either telegraph or telephone type emissions. When 
telegraph emission is used, the transmission shall be made in 
International Morse Code at a speed not to exceed 25 words per minute 
and shall consist of the signal ``QRA de'' followed by the call sign. 
This transmission shall be made at least three times. When telephone 
emission is used, the identification shall consist of announcing three 
times in English the call sign of the frequency being used, provided 
that all privacy or secrecy devices shall be removed from the circuit 
during such transmissions.

[[Page 212]]

    (e) Superimposed identification. Radiotelegraph or radiotelephone 
stations identifying simultaneously with transmission of traffic: call 
signs or the general identification signal described in paragraph (f) of 
this section may be superimposed on the emission being transmitted by 
any method which will make identification possible with communication 
type receivers provided that approval of any such method shall first 
have been obtained from the Federal Communications Commission. (Approval 
by the Federal Communications Commission of any means of identification 
of complex emissions by superimposing identification of regular 
transmissions will be given upon satisfactory completion of coordinated 
tests thereof by the applicant and the Commission's Field Engineering 
Bureau.) Commission approval may be withdrawn if at any subsequent time 
harmful interference to adjacent frequencies is caused by the 
superimposed identification. When superimposed identification by call 
sign is used, the identifying signal shall consist of ``QTT de (call 
sign)'' transmitted at least three times in International Morse Code at 
a speed not to exceed 25 words per minute.
    (f) General identification signal. When an approved method of 
superimposed identification is used, the identification signal shall 
consist of ``QTT de (abbreviated name of company recorded with the 
Commission) (abbreviated name of station recorded with the 
Commission).'' (It is suggested that ``abbreviated company name'' 
consist of two to five letters such as the initials of the company name 
and that ``abbreviated name of station'' consist of two or three letters 
indicating the name of the city where the licensee's message center is 
located. Both of these abbreviations shall be notified to the Commission 
before being used for identification.) This general identification 
signal shall be transmitted in International Morse Code at a speed not 
to exceed 25 words per minute and may be transmitted continuously or 
intermittently as desired provided that it shall be transmitted for at 
least five minutes total time during the period from 10 minutes before 
to 10 minutes after each hour that energy is being radiated on the 
frequency. The same signal may be superimposed on all transmissions 
being made at a particular station: Provided, however, That licensed 
call signs shall be transmitted on the frequencies to which they are 
assigned as often as is practicable and reasonable or at least at the 
beginning and end of each period of use of each frequency.
    (g) Identification by printer. Notwithstanding the other provisions 
of this section with respect to methods of transmission, when single 
channel start-stop 5 unit code printer equipment is being used, the 
identifying call sign may be transmitted by means of printer signals. 
When identification is made by printer signals, it shall consist of the 
call sign for the particular frequency being used and shall be made at 
least three times at a speed of approximately 60 words per minute.

Sec. 23.38   Experimental points of communication, limitations.

    Experimental (Research) or Experimental (Developmental) stations 
licensed to operate as point-to-point telegraph or telephone stations in 
the fixed public service may communicate only with other experimental 
stations located within the continental limits of the United States 
(except Alaska): Provided, however, That upon application the Commission 
may authorize such a station to communicate with one or more specific 
points in Alaska, Hawaii, possessions of the United States, or with a 
specific foreign point. In each such case, the Commission will determine 
the nature of the experimental transmissions which may be made to such 
point of communication.


<R05>
Sec. 23.39  Antenna structures.

    (a) FAA notification. Before the construction of new antenna 
structures or alteration in the height of existing antenna structures is 
authorized by the FCC, a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
determination of ``no hazard'' may be required. To apply for this 
determination, the FAA must be notified of the planned construction. 
Criteria used to determine whether FAA notification is required for a 
particular antenna structure are contained in part 17 of this chapter. 
Applications

[[Page 213]]

proposing construction of one or more new antenna structures or 
alteration of the overall height of one or more existing antenna 
structures, where FAA notification prior to such construction or 
alteration is not required by part 17 of this chapter, must indicate 
such and, unless the reason is obvious (e.g. structure height is less 
than 6.10 meters AGL) must contain a statement explaining why FAA 
notification is not required.
    (b) Painting and lighting. The owner of each antenna structure 
required to be painted and/or illuminated under the provisions of 
Section 303(q) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, shall 
operate and maintain the antenna structure painting and lighting in 
accordance with part 17 of this chapter. In the event of default by the 
owner, each licensee or permittee shall be individually responsible for 
conforming to the requirements pertaining to antenna structure painting 
and lighting.
    (c) Antenna Structure Registration Number. Applications proposing 
construction of one or more new antenna structures or alteration of the 
overall height of one or more existing structures, where FAA 
notification prior to such construction or alteration is required by 
part 17 of this chapter, must include the FCC Antenna Structure 
Registration Number(s) for the affected structure(s). If no such number 
has been assigned at the time the application is filed, the applicant 
must state in the application whether or not the antenna structure owner 
has notified the FAA of the proposed construction or alteration and 
applied to the FCC for an Antenna Structure Registration Number in 
accordance with part 17 of this chapter for the antenna structure in 
question.

<R05>
Sec. 24.15  License period.

    Licenses for service areas will be granted for ten year terms from 
the date of original issuance or renewal.


<R05>
Sec. 24.16  Criteria for comparative renewal proceedings.

    A renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding 
shall

[[Page 225]]

receive a preference, commonly referred to as a renewal expectancy, 
which is the most important comparative factor to be considered in the 
proceeding, if its past record for the relevant license period 
demonstrates that the renewal applicant:
    (a) Has provided ``substantial'' service during its past license 
term. ``Substantial'' service is defined as service which is sound, 
favorable, and substantially above a level of mediocre service which 
might just minimally warrant renewal; and
    (b) Has substantially complied with applicable Commission rules, 
policies and the Communications Act.


<R04>
                     Subpart C--Technical Standards


<R05>
Sec. 24.50  Scope.

    This subpart sets forth the technical requirements for use of the 
spectrum and equipment in the personal communications services.


<R05>
Sec. 24.51  Equipment authorization.

    (a) Each transmitter utilized for operation under this part and each 
transmitter marketed, as set forth in Sec. 2.803 of this chapter, must 
be of a type that has been authorized by the Commission under its type 
acceptance procedure for use under this part.
    (b) The Commission periodically publishes a list of type accepted 
equipment, entitled ``Radio Equipment List, Equipment Accepted for 
Licensing.'' Copies of this list are available for public reference at 
the Commission's offices in Washington, DC, at each of its field 
offices, and may be ordered from its copy contractor.
    (c) Any manufacturer of radio transmitting equipment to be used in 
these services may request equipment authorization following the 
procedures set forth in subpart J of part 2 of this chapter. Equipment 
authorization for an individual transmitter may be requested by an 
applicant for a station authorization by following the procedures set 
forth in part 2 of this chapter. Such equipment if approved or accepted 
will not normally be included in the Commission's Radio Equipment List 
but will be individually enumerated on the station authorization.
    (d) Applicants for type acceptance of transmitters that operate in 
these services must determine that the equipment complies with IEEE 
C95.1-1991, ``IEEE Standards for Safety Levels with Respect to Human 
Exposure to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields, 3 kHz to 300 GHz'' 
as measured using methods specified in IEEE C95.3-1991, ``Recommended 
Practice for the Measurement of Potentially Hazardous Electromagnetic 
Fields--RF and Microwave.'' The applicant for type acceptance is 
required to submit a statement affirming that the equipment complies 
with these standards as measured by an approved method and to maintain a 
record showing the basis for the statement of compliance with IEEE 
C.95.1-1991.


<R05>
Sec. 24.52  RF hazards.

    Licensees and manufacturers are subject to the radiofrequency 
radiation exposure requirements specified in Sec. 1.1307(b), Sec. 2.1091 
and Sec. 2.1093 of this chapter, as appropriate. Applications for 
equipment authorization of mobile or portable devices operating under 
this section must contain a statement confirming compliance with these 
requirements for both fundamental emissions and unwanted emissions. 
Technical information showing the basis for this statement must be 
submitted to the Commission upon request.

<R05>
Sec. 24.53  Calculation of height above average terrain (HAAT).

    (a) HAAT is determined by subtracting average terrain elevation from 
antenna height above mean sea level.
    (b) Average terrain elevation shall be calculated using elevation 
data from a 30 arc second or better Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). DEM 
data is available from United States Geological Survey (USGS). The data 
file shall be identified. If 30 arc second data is used, the elevation 
data must be processed for intermediate points using interpolation 
techniques; otherwise, the nearest point may be used. If DEM data is not 
available, elevation data from the Defense Mapping Agency's Digital 
Chart of the World (DCW) may be used.

[[Page 226]]

    (c) Radial average terrain elevation is calculated as the average of 
the elevation along a straight line path from 3 to 16 kilometers 
extending radially from the antenna site. At least 50 evenly spaced data 
points for each radial shall be used in the computation.
    (d) Average terrain elevation is the average of the eight radial 
average terrain elevations (for the eight cardinal radials).
    (e) The position location of the antenna site shall be determined to 
an accuracy of no less than <plus-minus>5 meters in both the horizontal 
(latitude and longitude) and vertical (ground elevation) dimensions with 
respect to the National Geodetic Reference System.

<R05>
Sec. 24.55  Antenna structures; air navigation safety.

    Licensees that own their antenna structures must not allow these 
antenna structures to become a hazard to air navigation. In general, 
antenna structure owners are responsible for registering antenna 
structures with the FCC if required by part 17 of this chapter, and for 
installing and maintaining any required marking and lighting. However, 
in the event of default of this responsibility by an antenna structure 
owner, each FCC permittee or licensee authorized to use an affected 
antenna structure will be held responsible by the FCC for ensuring that 
the antenna structure continues to meet the requirements of part 17 of 
this chapter. See Sec. 17.6 of this chapter.
    (a) Marking and lighting. Antenna structures must be marked, lighted 
and maintained in accordance with part 17 of this chapter and all 
applicable rules and requirements of the Federal Aviation 
Administration.
    (b) Maintenance contracts. Antenna structure owners (or licensees 
and permittees, in the event of default by an antenna structure owner) 
may enter into contracts with other entities to monitor and carry out 
necessary maintenance of antenna structures. Antenna structure owners 
(or licensees and permittees, in the event of default by an antenna 
structure owner) that make such contractual arrangements continue to be 
responsible for the maintenance of antenna structures in regard to air 
navigation safety.

<R04>
                        Subpart D--Narrowband PCS


<R05>
Sec. 24.100  Scope.

    This subpart sets out the regulations governing the licensing and 
operations of personal communications services authorized in the 901-
902, 930-931, and 940-941 MHz bands (900 MHz band).


<R05>
Sec. 24.101  Multiple ownership restrictions.

    (a) Narrowband PCS licensees shall not have an ownership interest in 
more than three of the 26 channels listed in Sec. 24.129 in any 
geographic area. For purposes of this restriction, a narrowband PCS 
licensee is:
    (1) Any institutional investor, as defined in Sec. 24.720(h), with 
an ownership interest of ten or more percent in a narrowband PCS 
license; and
    (2) Any other person or entity with an ownership interest of five or 
more percent in a narrowband PCS license.
    (b) In cases where a party applies for a license after August 16, 
1994 or has a license transferred to it after that date, and the party 
has indirect ownership, through an interest in an interving entity (or 
entities) that has ownership in the narrowband license, that indirect 
ownership shall be attributable if the percentages of ownership at each 
level, multiplied together, equal five or more percent ownership of the 
narrowband PCS license, except that if the ownership percentage for an 
interest in any link in the chain exceeds 50 percent or represents 
actual control, it shall be treated as if it were a 100 percent 
interest.

    Example: Party X has a non-controlling ownership interest of 25 
percent in Company Y, which in turn has a non-controlling ownership 
interest of 10 percent in Company Z, the narrowband PCS licensee. Party 
X's effective ownership interest in Company Z is Party X's ownership 
interest in Company Y (25 percent) times Company Y's ownership interest 
in Company Z (10 percent). Therefore, Party X's effective ownership 
interest in Company Z is 2.5 percent, and is not attributable.

    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, the following 
interests

[[Page 227]]

shall not constitute attributable ownership interests for purposes of 
paragraph (a) of this section:
    (1) A limited partnership interest held by an institutional investor 
(as defined Sec. 24.720(h)) where the limited partner is not materially 
involved, directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of the 
PCS holdings of the partnership, and the licensee so certifies. The 
criteria which would assure adequate insulation for the purposes of this 
certification require:
    (i) Prohibiting limited partners from acting as employees of the 
limited partnership if responsibilities relate to the carrier activities 
of the licensee;
    (ii) Barring the limited partners from serving as independent 
contractors;
    (iii) Restricting communication among limited partners and the 
general partner regarding day-to-day activities of the licensee;
    (iv) Empowering the general partner to veto admissions of new 
general partners;
    (v) Restricting the circumstances in which the limited partners can 
remove the general partner;
    (vi) Prohibiting the limited partners from providing services to the 
partnership relating to the PCS holdings of the licensee; and
    (vii) Stating that the limited partners may not become involved in 
the management or operation of the licensee. See 47 CFR 73.3555 Note 
2(g)(2); Memorandum of Opinion and Order in MM Docket 83-46, FCC 85-252 
(released June 24, 1985), as modified on reconsideration in the 
Memorandum of Opinion and Order in MM Docket No. 83-46, FCC 86-410 
(released November 28, 1986).
    (2) Institutional investors who held limited partnership interests 
prior to March 2, 1995 shall be granted one year from that date to amend 
their limited partnership agreements to comply with the insulation rules 
and so certify to the Commission. During this transition period, the 
licensee in which an institutional investor holds an interest shall also 
certify to the Commission that the institutional investor limited 
partner(s) are not materially involved, directly or indirectly, in the 
management or operation of the licensee.

Sec. 24.103  Construction requirements.

    (a) Nationwide narrowband PCS licensees shall construct base 
stations that provide coverage to a composite area of 750,000 square 
kilometers or serve 37.5 percent of the U.S. population within five 
years of initial license grant date; and, shall construct base stations 
that provide coverage to a composite area of 1,500,000 square kilometers 
or serve 75 percent of the U.S. population within ten years of initial 
license grant date.
    (b) Regional narrowband PCS licensees shall construct base stations 
that provide coverage to a composite area of 150,000 square kilometers 
or serve 37.5 percent of the population of the service area within five 
years of initial license grant date; and, shall construct base stations 
that provide coverage to a composite area of 300,000 square kilometers 
or serve 75 percent of the service area population within ten years of 
initial license grant date.
    (c) MTA narrowband PCS licensees shall construct base stations that 
provide coverage to a composite area of 75,000 square kilometers or 25 
percent of the geographic area, or serve 37.5 percent of the population 
of the service area within five years of initial license grant date; 
and, shall construct base stations that provide coverage to a composite 
area of 150,000 square kilometers or 50 percent of the geographic area, 
or serve 75 percent of the population of the service area within ten 
years of initial license grant date.
    (d) BTA narrowband PCS licensees shall construct at least one base 
station and begin providing service in its BTA within one year of 
initial license grant date.
    (e) In demonstrating compliance with the above construction 
requirements, licensees must base their calculations on signal field 
strengths that ensure reliable service for the technology utilized.
    (1) For the purpose of this section, the service radius of a base 
station may be calculated using the following formula:

d<INF>km = 2.53  x  h<INF>m<SUP>0.34  x  p<SUP>0.17

where d<INF>km is the radial distance in kilometers,
h<INF>m is the antenna HAAT of the base station in meters, and
p is the e.r.p. of the base station in watts.

    (2) Alternatively, licensees may use any service radius contour 
formula developed or generally used by industry, provided that such 
formula is based on the technical characteristics of their system.
    (f) Upon meeting the five and ten year benchmarks in paragraphs (a), 
(b) and (c) of this section, licensees shall

[[Page 229]]

file a map and other supporting documentation that demonstrates 
compliance with the geographic area or population coverage requirement. 
BTA licensees shall file a statement indicating commencement of service. 
The filing must be received at the Commission on or before expiration of 
the relevant period.
    (g) If the sale of a license is approved, the new licensee is held 
to the original build-out requirement.
    (h) Failure by a licensee to meet the above construction 
requirements shall result in forfeiture of the license and ineligibility 
to regain it.

    Note: Population-based construction requirements contained in this 
section shall be based on the 1990 census.

channels. Eligibility for response channels shall be based on the 
authorized service area of each existing paging licensee. This service 
area is defined as the area within a 32.2 kilometer radius of the 
licensee's base stations or, in the case of ``F,'' ``G,'' ``H,'' or 
``K'' class stations under Secs. 22.502(c) and 90.495(b)(1) of this 
chapter, as the area that is within the service area radius specified in 
Sec. 22.504(b)(2) of this chapter. Existing paging licensees are 
eligible to bid for any response channel in any BTA or MTA which 
encompasses an authorized base station or which is partly or wholly 
overlapped by a licensee's service area. These channels shall be used 
only in paired communications with existing paging channels to provide 
mobile-to-base station communications. Until two years after the date of 
initial license grant, eligible paging licensees are limited to a 
maximum of two response channels within the same geographic area. 
Licenses for paging response channels are not counted toward the

Sec. 24.203  Construction requirements.

    (a) Licensees of 30 MHz blocks must serve with a signal level 
sufficient to provide adequate service to at least one-third of the 
population in their licensed area within five years of being licensed 
and two-thirds of the population in their licensed area within 10 years 
of being licensed. Licensees may choose to define population using the 
1990 census or the 2000 census. Failure by any licensee to meet these 
requirements will result in forfeiture or non-renewal of the license and 
the licensee will be ineligible to regain it.
    (b) Licensees of 10 MHz blocks must serve with a signal level 
sufficient to provide adequate service to at least one-quarter of the 
population in their licensed area within five years of being licensed, 
or make a showing of substantial service in their licensed area within 
five years of being licensed. Population is defined as the 1990 
population census. Licensees may elect to use the 2000 population census 
to determine the five-year construction requirement. Failure by any 
licensee to meet these requirements will result in forfeiture of the 
license and the licensee will be ineligible to regain it.
    (c) Licensees must file maps and other supporting documents showing 
compliance with the respective construction requirements within the 
appropriate five- and ten-year benchmarks of the date of their initial 
licenses.

    (b) Mobile/portable stations are limited to 2 watts e.i.r.p. peak 
power and the equipment must employ means to limit the power to the 
minimum necessary for successful communications.
    (c) Peak transmit power must be measured over any interval of 
continuous transmission using instrumentation calibrated in terms of an 
rms-equivalent voltage. The measurement results shall be properly 
adjusted for any instrument limitations, such as detector response 
times, limited resolution bandwidth capability when compared to the 
emission bandwidth, sensitivity, etc., so as to obtain a true peak 
measurement for the emission in question over the full bandwidth of the 
channel.


<R05>
Sec. 24.235  Frequency stability.

    The frequency stability shall be sufficient to ensure that the 
fundamental emission stays within the authorized frequency block.


<R05>
Sec. 24.236  Field strength limits.

    The predicted or measured median field strength at any location on 
the border of the PCS service area shall not exceed 47 dBuV/m unless the 
parties agree to a higher field strength.


<R05>
Sec. 24.237  Interference protection.

    (a) All licensees are required to coordinate their frequency usage 
with the co-channel or adjacent channel incumbent fixed microwave 
licensees in the 1850-1990 MHz band. Coordination must occur before 
initiating operations from any base station. Problems that arise during 
the coordination process are to be resolved by the parties to the 
coordination. Licensees are required to coordinate with all users 
possibly affected, as determined by Appendix I to this subpart E 
(Appendix E of the Memorandum Opinion and Order, GEN Docket No. 90-314, 
FCC 94-144; TIA Telecommunications Systems Bulletin 10-F, ``Interference 
Criteria for Microwave Systems,'' May 1994, (TSB10-F)); or an 
alternative method agreed to by the parties.
    (b) The results of the coordination process need to be reported to 
the Commission only if the parties fail to agree. Because broadband PCS 
licensees are required to protect fixed microwave licensees in the 1850-
1990 MHz band, the Commission will be involved in the coordination 
process only upon complaint of interference from a fixed

[[Page 234]]

microwave licensee. In such a case, the Commission will resolve the 
issues.
    (c) In all other respects, coordination procedures are to follow the 
requirements of Sec. 101.103(d) of this chapter to the extent that these 
requirements are not inconsistent with those specified in this part.
    (d) The licensee must perform an engineering analysis to assure that 
the proposed facilities will not cause interference to existing OFS 
stations within the coordination distance specified in Table 2 of a 
magnitude greater than that specified in the criteria set forth in 
paragraph (e) and (f) of this section, unless there is prior agreement 
with the affected OFS licensee. Interference calculations shall be based 
on the sum of the power received at the terminals of each microwave 
receiver from all of the applicant's current and proposed PCS 
operations.

employed to compute the interfering power at the microwave receivers 
shall follow generally acceptable good engineering practices. The 
procedures described for computing interfering signal levels in 
(Appendix I to this subpart E Appendix E of the Memorandum Opinion and 
Order, GEN Docket No. 90-314, FCC 94-144) shall be applied. 
Alternatively, procedures for determining interfering signal levels and 
other criteria as may be developed by the Electronics Industries 
Association (EIA), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
Engineers, Inc. (IEEE), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) 
or any other recognized authority will be acceptable to the Commission.

Sec. 24.238  Emission limits.

    (a) On any frequency outside a licensee's frequency block, the power 
of any emission shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) by 
at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB.
    (b) Compliance with these provisions is based on the use of 
measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz or 
greater. However, in the 1 MHz bands immediately

[[Page 235]]

outside and adjacent to the frequency block a resolution bandwidth of at 
least one percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission 
of the transmitter may be employed. The emission bandwidth is defined as 
the width of the signal between two points, one below the carrier center 
frequency and one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which 
all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power.
    (c) When measuring the emission limits, the nominal carrier 
frequency shall be adjusted as close to the licensee's frequency block 
edges, both upper and lower, as the design permits.
    (d) The measurements of emission power can be expressed in peak or 
average values, provided they are expressed in the same parameters as 
the transmitter power.
    (e) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes 
harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require 
greater attenuation than specified in this section.

   Policies Governing Microwave Relocation From the 1850-1990 MHz Band


<R05>
Sec. 24.239   Cost-sharing requirements for Broadband PCS.

    Frequencies in the 1850-1990 MHz band listed in Sec. 101.147(c) of 
this chapter have been allocated for use by PCS. In accordance with 
procedures specified in Secs. 101.69 through 101.81 of this chapter, PCS 
entities (both licensed and unlicensed) are required to relocate the 
existing Fixed Microwave Services (FMS) licensees in these bands if 
interference to the existing FMS operations would occur. All PCS 
entities who benefit from spectrum clearance by other PCS entities must 
contribute to such relocation costs. PCS entities may satisfy this 
requirement by entering into private cost-sharing agreements or agreeing 
to terms other than those specified in Sec. 24.243. However, PCS 
entities are required to reimburse other PCS entities that incur 
relocation costs and are not parties to the alternative agreement. In 
addition, parties to a private cost-sharing agreement may seek 
reimbursement through the clearinghouse (as discussed in Sec. 24.241) 
from PCS entities that are not parties to the agreement. The cost-
sharing plan is in effect during all phases of microwave relocation 
specified in Sec. 101.69 of this chapter.

[61 FR 29691, June 12, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 24.241   Administration of the Cost-Sharing Plan.

    The Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, under delegated authority, 
will select an entity to operate as a neutral, not-for-profit 
clearinghouse. This clearinghouse will administer the cost-sharing plan 
by, inter alia, maintaining all of the cost and payment records related 
to the relocation of each link and determining the cost-sharing 
obligation of subsequent PCS entities. The cost-sharing rules will not 
take effect until an administrator is selected.

<R05>
Sec. 24.243   The Cost-Sharing Formula.

    A PCS relocator who relocates an interfering microwave link, i.e., 
one that is in all or part of its market area and in all or part of its 
frequency band, is entitled to pro rata reimbursement based on the 
following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12JN96.001

    (a) RN equals the amount of reimbursement.
    (b) C equals the actual cost of relocating the link. Actual 
relocation costs include, but are not limited to, such items as: radio 
terminal equipment (TX and/or RX--antenna, necessary feed lines, MUX/
Modems); towers and/or modifications; back-up power equipment; 
monitoring or control equipment; engineering costs (design/path survey); 
installation; systems testing; FCC filing costs; site acquisition and 
civil works; zoning costs; training; disposal of old equipment; test 
equipment (vendor required); spare equipment; project management; prior 
coordination notification under Sec. 101.103(d) of this chapter; 
required antenna upgrades for interference control; power plant upgrade 
(if required); electrical grounding systems; Heating Ventilation and Air 
Conditioning (HVAC) (if required); alternate transport equipment; and 
leased facilities. C also includes incumbent transaction expenses

[[Page 236]]

that are directly attributable to the relocation, subject to a cap of 
two percent of the ``hard'' costs involved. C may not exceed $250,000 
per link, with an additional $150,000 permitted if a new or modified 
tower is required.
    (c) N equals the number of PCS entities that would have interfered 
with the link. For the PCS relocator, N = 1. For the next PCS entity 
that would have interfered with the link, N=2, and so on.
    (d) T<INF>M equals the number of months that have elapsed between 
the month the PCS relocator obtains reimbursement rights and the month 
that the clearinghouse notifies a later-entrant of its reimbursement 
obligation. A PCS relocator obtains reimbursement rights on the date 
that it signs a relocation agreement with a microwave incumbent.

[61 FR 29692, June 12, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 24.245   Reimbursement under the Cost-Sharing Plan.

    (a) Registration of Reimbursement Rights. To obtain reimbursement, a 
PCS relocator must submit documentation of the relocation agreement to 
the clearinghouse within ten business days of the date a relocation 
agreement is signed with an incumbent. If the clearinghouse has not yet 
been selected, the PCS relocator will be responsible for submitting 
documentation of the relocation agreement within ten business days of 
the date that the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau issues a public 
notice announcing that the clearinghouse has been established and has 
begun operation.
    (b) Documentation of Expenses. Once relocation occurs, the PCS 
relocator must submit documentation itemizing the amount spent for items 
listed in Sec. 24.243(b). The PCS relocator must identify the particular 
link associated with appropriate expenses (i.e., costs may not be 
averaged over numerous links). If a PCS relocator pays a microwave 
incumbent a monetary sum to relocate its own facilities, the PCS 
relocator must estimate the costs associated with relocating the 
incumbent by itemizing the anticipated cost for items listed in 
Sec. 24.243(b). If the sum paid to the incumbent cannot be accounted 
for, the remaining amount is not eligible for reimbursement. A PCS 
relocator may submit receipts or other documentation to the 
clearinghouse for all relocation expenses incurred since April 5, 1995.
    (c) Full Reimbursement. A PCS relocator who relocates a microwave 
link that is either fully outside its market area or its licensed 
frequency band may seek full reimbursement through the clearinghouse of 
compensable costs, up to the reimbursement cap as defined in 
Sec. 24.243(b). Such reimbursement will not be subject to depreciation 
under the cost-sharing formula.

[61 FR 29692, June 12, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 24.247   Triggering a Reimbursement Obligation.

    (a) Licensed PCS. The clearinghouse will apply the following test to 
determine if a PCS entity preparing to initiate operations must pay a 
PCS relocator in accordance with the formula detailed in Sec. 24.243:
    (1) All or part of the relocated microwave link was initially co-
channel with the licensed PCS band(s) of the subsequent PCS entity;
    (2) A PCS relocator has paid the relocation costs of the microwave 
incumbent; and
    (3) The subsequent PCS entity is preparing to turn on a fixed base 
station at commercial power and the fixed base station is located within 
a rectangle (Proximity Threshold) described as follows:
    (i) The length of the rectangle shall be x where x is a line 
extending through both nodes of the microwave link to a distance of 48 
kilometers (30 miles) beyond each node. The width of the rectangle shall 
be y where y is a line perpendicular to x and extending for a distance 
of 24 kilometers (15 miles) on both sides of x. Thus, the rectangle is 
represented as follows:


[[Page 237]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MR91.041



[[Page 238]]

    (ii) If the application of the Proximity Threshold test indicates 
that a reimbursement obligation exists, the clearinghouse will calculate 
the reimbursement amount in accordance with the cost-sharing formula and 
notify the subsequent PCS entity of the total amount of its 
reimbursement obligation.
    (b) Unlicensed PCS. UTAM's reimbursement obligation is triggered 
either:
    (1) When a county is cleared of microwave links in the unlicensed 
allocation, and UTAM invokes a Zone 1 power cap as a result of third 
party relocation activities; or
    (2) A county is cleared of microwave links in the unlicensed 
allocation and UTAM reclassifies a Zone 2 county to Zone 1 status.

[61 FR 29692, June 12, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 24.249   Payment Issues.

    (a) Timing. On the day that a PCS entity files its prior 
coordination notice (PCN) in accordance with Sec. 101.103(d) of this 
chapter, it must file a copy of the PCN with the clearinghouse. The 
clearinghouse will determine if any reimbursement obligation exists and 
notify the PCS entity in writing of its repayment obligation, if any. 
When the PCS entity receives a written copy of such obligation, it must 
pay directly to the PCS relocator the amount owed within thirty days, 
with the exception of those businesses that qualify for installment 
payments. A business that qualifies for an installment payment plan must 
make its first installment payment within thirty days of notice from the 
clearinghouse. UTAM's first payment will be due thirty days after its 
reimbursement obligation is triggered as described in Sec. 24.247(b).
    (b) Eligibility for Installment Payments. PCS licensees that are 
allowed to pay for their licenses in installments under our designated 
entity rules will have identical payment options available to them with 
respect to payments under the cost-sharing plan. The specific terms of 
the installment payment mechanism, including the treatment of principal 
and interest, are the same as those applicable to the licensee's 
installment auction payments. If, for any reason, the entity eligible 
for installment payments is no longer eligible for such installment 
payments on its license, that entity is no longer eligible for 
installment payments under the cost-sharing plan. UTAM may make 
quarterly payments over a five-year period with an interest rate of 
prime plus 2.5 percent. UTAM may also negotiate separate repayment 
arrangements with other parties.

[61 FR 29693, June 12, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 24.251   Dispute Resolution Under the Cost-Sharing Plan.

    Disputes arising out of the cost-sharing plan, such as disputes over 
the amount of reimbursement required, must be brought, in the first 
instance, to the clearinghouse for resolution. To the extent that 
disputes cannot be resolved by the clearinghouse, parties are encouraged 
to use expedited ADR procedures, such as binding arbitration, mediation, 
or other ADR techniques.

[61 FR 29693, June 12, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 24.253  Termination of Cost-Sharing Obligations.

    The cost-sharing plan will sunset for all PCS entities on April 4, 
2005, which is ten years after the date that voluntary negotiations 
commenced for A and B block PCS entities. Those PCS entities that are 
paying their portion of relocation costs on an installment basis must 
continue the payments until the obligation is satisfied.

Appendix I to Subpart E--A Procedure for Calculating PCS Signal Levels at Microwave Receivers (Appendix E of the Memorandum Opinion and Order)--Table of Contents

<R05>


    The new Rules adopted in Part 24 stipulate that estimates of 
interference to fixed microwave operations from a PCS operation will be 
based on the sum of signals received at a microwave receiver from the 
PCS operation. This appendix describes a procedure for computing this 
PCS level.
    In general, the procedure involves four steps:
    1. Determine the geographical coordinates of all microwave receivers 
operating on co-channel and adjacent frequencies within the

[[Page 239]]

coordination distance of each base station and the characteristics of 
each receiver, i.e., adjacent channel susceptibility, antenna gain, 
pattern and height, and line and other losses.
    2. Determine an equivalent isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.) 
for each base station and equivalent e.i.r.p. values for the mobiles and 
portables associated with each base station. Determine the values of 
pertinent correction and weighting factors based on building heights and 
density and distribution of portables. Close-in situations, prominent 
hills, and extra tall buildings require special treatment.
    3. Based on PCS e.i.r.p. values, correction and weighting factors, 
and microwave receiving system characteristics determined above, 
calculate the total interference power at the input of each microwave 
receiver, using the Longley-Rice propagation model.
    4. Based on the interference power level computed in step 3, 
determine interference to each microwave receiver using criteria 
described in Part 24 and EIA/TIA Bulletin 10-F.
    The interference from each base station and the mobiles and 
portables associated with it is calculated as follows:

P<INF>rbi=10Log (p<INF>tbi)-L<INF>bi-UC<INF>i+G<INF>mwi-C<INF>i-BP<INF>i
P<INF>rmi=10Log 
          (n<INF>mi x p<INF>tmi)-L<INF>mi-UC<INF>i+G<INF>mwi-C<INF>i
P<INF>rpsi=10Log 
          (n<INF>psi x p<INF>tpsi)-L<INF>psi-UC<INF>i+G<INF>mwi-C<INF>i
P<INF>rpbi=10Log 
          (n<INF>pbi x p<INF>tpbi)-L<INF>pbi-UC<INF>i-(BP<INF>i-BH<INF>i)
           +G<INF>mwi-C<INF>i
P<INF>rpri=10Log 
          (n<INF>pri x p<INF>tpri)-L<INF>pri-(UC<INF>i-BH<INF>i)+G<INF>mw
          i-C<INF>i

where:
P refers to Power in dBm
p refers to power in milliwatts
P<INF>rbi=Power at MW receiver from ith base station in dBm
p<INF>tbi=e.i.r.p. transmitted from ith base station in milliwatts, 
          which equals average power per channel x number of channels x 
          antenna gain with respect to an isotropic antenna--line loss
L<INF>bi=Path loss between MW and base station site in dB
UC<INF>i=Urban correction factor in dB
G<INF>mwi=Gain of MW antenna in pertinent direction (dBi)
C<INF>i=Channel discrimination of MW system in dB
P<INF>rmi=Power at MW receiver from mobiles associated with ith base 
          station
p<INF>tmi=e.i.r.p. transmitted from mobiles associated with ith base 
          station
n<INF>mi=Number of mobiles associated with ith base station
L<INF>mi=Path loss between MW and mobile transmitters in dB
P<INF>rpsi=Power at MW receiver from outdoor portables (s for sidewalk)
p<INF>tpsi=e.i.r.p. transmitted from outdoor portables associated with 
          ith base station
n<INF>psi=Number of outdoor portables associated with ith base station
L<INF>psi=Path loss between MW and outdoor portables in dB
P<INF>rpbi=Power at MW receiver from indoor portables (b for building)
p<INF>tpbi=e.i.r.p. transmitted from indoor portables associated with 
          ith base station
n<INF>pbi=number of indoor portables associated with ith base station
L<INF>pbi=Path loss in dB between MW and base station site (using 
          average building height divided by 2 as effective antenna 
          height)
P<INF>rpri=Power at MW receiver from rooftop portables (r for rooftop)
p<INF>tpri=e.i.r.p. transmitted from rooftop portables associated with 
          ith base station
n<INF>pri=Number of rooftop portables associated with ith base station
L<INF>pri=Path loss in dB between MW and base station site (using 
          average building height as effective antenna height)
BP<INF>i=Building penetration loss at street level in dB
BH<INF>i=Height gain for portables in buildings dB=2.5 x (nf-1), where 
          nf is number of floors

    Note: where C<INF>i varies from channel-to-channel, which often is 
the case, the summation process is more complex, requiring summation at 
a channel level first.

    Finally, the total PCS interference power at a given microwave 
receiver from all the base stations in a given frequency band is found 
by summing the contributions from the individual stations. Likewise, the 
total interference power at a given microwave receiver from all mobiles 
and portables operating in a given frequency band is found by summing 
the contributions from the mobiles and portables associated with each 
cell.

[[Page 240]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR24JN94.017


    Base Stations. Interference from each base station to each microwave 
should normally be considered independently. A group of base stations 
having more or less (within <plus-minus> 50 percent) the same height 
above average terrain, the same e.i.r.p., basically the same path to a 
microwave receiving site, and subtending an angle to that receiving site 
of less than 5 degrees, may be treated as a group, using the total power 
of the group and the average antenna height of the group to calculate 
path loss, L.
    Mobile Stations. The e.i.r.p. from mobile transmitters is weighted 
according to the number of base station channels expected to be devoted 
to mobile operation at any given time. The antenna height of mobiles 
used in calculating path loss, L, is assumed to be 2 meters.
    Portable Stations. The e.i.r.p. from the portable units associated 
with each base station is weighted according to the estimated portion of 
portables associated with that cell expected to be operated inside 
buildings at any given time and the portion which could be expected to 
be operating from elevated locations, such as balconies or building 
rooftops. For example, in the case of service intended for business use 
in an urban area, one might expect that perhaps 85 percent of the 
portables in use at any given time would be operating from within 
buildings and perhaps 5 percent might be operating from rooftops or 
balconies. The remaining 10 percent would be outside at street level.
    Calculation of an equivalent e.i.r.p. for cells in suburban areas 
will involve different weighting criteria.
    Urban Correction Factor. The urban correction factor (UC) depends on 
the height and density of buildings surrounding a base station. For the 
core area of large cities, it is assumed to be 35 dB. For medium size 
cities and fringe areas of large cities (4- to 6-story buildings with 
scattered taller buildings and lower buildings and open spaces) it is 
assumed to be 25 dB; for small cities and towns, 15 dB, and for suburban 
residential areas (one- and two-story, single family houses with 
scattered multiple-story apartment buildings, shopping centers and open 
areas), 10 dB.
    The unadjusted urban correction factor, UC, should not be applied to 
base station antenna heights that are greater than 50 percent of the 
average building height for a cell.
    Building Height and Building Penetration Factors. The building 
height correction, BH, is a function of the average building height 
within the nominal coverage area of the base station. It is used in 
conjunction with the building penetration loss, BP, to adjust the 
expected interference contribution from that portion of the portables 
transmitting from within buildings. The adjustment is given by:

BP=20 dB in urban areas
BP=10 dB in suburban areas
BH=2.5 x (nf-1) dB

where nf is the average height (number of floors) of the buildings in 
the area.
    (Note that this formula implies a net gain when the average building 
height is greater than 8 floors). All buildings more than twice the 
average height should be considered individually. The contribution to BH 
from that portion of portables in the building above the average 
building height should be increased by a factor of 20Log(h) dB, where h 
is the height of the portables above the average building height in 
meters.
    Channel Discrimination Factor. A factor based on the interference 
selectivity of the microwave receiver.
    Propagation Model. The PCS to microwave path loss, L, is calculated 
using the Longley-Rice propagation model, Version 1.2.2., in the point-
to-point mode. The Longley-Rice [1] model was derived from NBS Technical 
Note 101 [2], and updated in 1982 by Hufford [3]. Version 1.2.2 
incorporated modifications described in a letter by Hufford [4] in 1985. 
Terrain elevations used as input to the model should be from the U.S. 
Geological Survey 3-second digitized terrain database.
    Special Situations. If a cell size is large compared to the distance 
between the cell and a microwave receiving site so that it subtends an 
angle greater than 5 degrees, the cell should be subdivided and 
calculations should be based on the expected distribution of mobiles and 
portables within each subdivision.
    If terrain elevations within a cell differ by more than a factor of 
two-to-one, the cell should be subdivided and microwave interference 
calculations should be based on the average terrain elevation for each 
subdivision.

[[Page 241]]

    If a co-channel PCS base station lies within the main beam of a 
microwave antenna (<plus-minus>5 degrees), there is no intervening 
terrain obstructions, and the power at the microwave receiver from that 
base station, assuming free space propagation, would be 3 dB or less 
below the interference threshold, interference will be assumed to exist 
unless the PCS licensee can demonstrate otherwise by specific path loss 
calculations based on terrain and building losses.
    If any part of a cell or cell subdivision lies within the main beam 
of a co-channel microwave antenna, there is no intervening terrain 
obstructions, and the accumulative power of 5 percent or less of the 
mobiles, assuming free space propagation would be 3 dB or less below the 
interference threshold, interference will be assumed to exist unless the 
PCS licensee can demonstrate otherwise by specific path loss 
calculations based on terrain and building losses.
    If a building within a cell or cell subdivision lies within the main 
beam of a co-channel microwave antenna, there is no intervening terrain 
obstructions, and the cumulative power of 5 percent or fewer of the 
portables, assuming free space propagation, would be 3 dB or less below 
the interference threshold, interference will be assumed to exist unless 
the PCS licensee can demonstrate otherwise by specific path loss 
calculations based on terrain and building losses.

      Subpart F--Competitive Bidding Procedures for Narrowband PCS

    Source: 59 FR 26747, May 24, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 24.301  Narrowband PCS subject to competitive bidding.

    Mutually exclusive initial applications to provide narrowband PCS 
service are subject to competitive bidding procedures. The general 
competitive bidding procedures found in 47 CFR part 1, subpart Q, will 
apply unless otherwise provided in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 24.302  Competitive bidding design for narrowband PSC licensing.

    (a) The Commission will employ the following competitive bidding 
designs when choosing from among mutually exclusive initial applications 
to provide narrowband PCS service:
    (1) Single round sealed bid auctions (either sequential or 
simultaneous);
    (2) Sequential oral auctions;
    (3) Simultaneous multiple round auctions.
    (b) The Commission may design and test alternative procedures. The 
Commission will announce by Public Notice before each auction the 
competitive bidding design to be employed in a particular auction.
    (c) The Commission may use combinatorial bidding, which would allow 
bidders to submit all or nothing bids on combinations of licenses, in 
addition to bids on individual licenses. The Commission may require that 
to be declared the high bid, a combinatorial bid must exceed the sum of 
the individual bids by a specified amount. Combinatorial bidding may be 
used with any type of auction design.
    (d) The Commission may use single combined auctions, which combine 
bidding for two or more substitutable licenses and award licenses to the 
highest bidders until the available licenses are exhausted. This 
technique may be used in conjunction with any type of auction.


<R05>
Sec. 24.303  Competitive bidding mechanisms.

    (a) Sequencing. The Commission will establish and may vary the 
sequence in which narrowband PCS licenses will be auctioned.
    (b) Grouping. In the event the Commission uses either a simultaneous 
multiple round competitive bidding design or combinatorial bidding, the

[[Page 242]]

Commission will determine which licenses will be auctioned 
simultaneously or in combination.
    (c) Reservation Price. The Commission may establish a reservation 
price, either disclosed or undisclosed, below which a license subject to 
auction will not be awarded.
    (d) Minimum Bid Increments. The Commission may, by announcement 
before or during an auction, require minimum bid increments in dollar or 
percentage terms. The Commission may also establish by Public Notice a 
suggested opening bid or a minimum opening bid on each license.
    (e) Stopping Rules. the Commission may establish stopping rules 
before or during multiple round auctions in order to terminate an 
auction within a reasonable time.
    (f) Activity Rules. The Commission may establish activity rules 
which require a minimum amount of bidding activity. In the event that 
the Commission establishes an activity rule in connection with a 
simultaneous multiple round auction, each bidder will be entitled to 
request and will be automatically granted one activity rule waiver 
during each stage of an auction, or one automatic waiver during a 
specified number of bidding rounds. The Commission may change by Public 
Notice the number and frequency of such automatic activity rule waivers 
for a specific auction.
    (g) Bidder Identification During Auctions. The Commission may 
choose, on an auction-by-auction basis, to release the identity of the 
bidders associated with bidder identification numbers. The Commission 
will announce by Public Notice before each auction whether bidder 
identities will be revealed.

[59 FR 44069, Aug. 26, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 24.304  Withdrawal, default and disqualification penalties.

    (a) When the Commission conducts a simultaneous multiple round 
auction pursuant to Sec. 24.302(a)(3), the Commission will impose 
penalties on bidders who withdraw high bids during the course of an 
auction, or who default on payments due after an auction closes or who 
are disqualified.
    (1) Bid withdrawal prior to close of auction. A bidder who withdraws 
a high bid during the course of an auction will be subject to a penalty 
equal to the difference between the amount bid and the amount of the 
winning bid the next time the license is offered by the Commission. No 
withdrawal penalty would be assessed if the subsequent winning bid 
exceeds the withdrawn bid. This penalty amount will be deducted from any 
upfront payments or down payments that the withdrawing bidder has 
deposited with the Commission.
    (2) Default or disqualification after close of auction. If a high 
bidder defaults or is disqualified after the close of such an auction, 
the defaulting bidder will be subject to the penalty in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section plus an additional penalty equal to three (3) percent of 
the subsequent winning bid. If the subsequent winning bid exceeds the 
defaulting bidder's bid amount, the 3 percent penalty will be calculated 
based on the defaulting bidder's bid amount. These amounts will be 
deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the defaulting 
or disqualified bidder has deposited with the Commission.
    (b) When the Commission conducts single round sealed bid auctions or 
sequential oral auctions, the Commission may modify the penalties to be 
paid in the event of bid withdrawal, default or disqualification; 
provided, however, that such penalties shall not exceed the penalties 
specified above.
    (c) In the case of single round bidding for narrowband PCS licenses:
    (1) If a bid is withdrawn before the Commission releases the initial 
public notice announcing the winning bidder(s), no bid withdrawal 
penalty will be assessed.
    (2) If a bid is withdrawn after the Commission releases the initial 
public notice announcing the winning bidder(s), the bid withdrawal 
penalty will be equal to the difference between the high bid amount and 
the amount of the next highest valid bid. A bid will be considered valid 
for this purpose if the bidder has not already been designated the 
winning bidder on more licenses than it is permitted to be awarded. 
Losing bidders will only be subject to this bid withdrawal penalty for a 
period of 30 days after the Commission

[[Page 243]]

releases the initial public notice announcing the winning bidders.
    (d) In the case of oral sequential bidding for narrowband PCS 
licenses:
    (1) If a bid is withdrawn before the Commission has declared the 
bidding to be closed for the license bid on, no bid withdrawal penalty 
will be assessed.
    (2) If a bid is withdrawn after the Commission has declared the 
bidding to be closed for the license bid on, the bid withdrawal penalty 
of Sec. 1.2104(g) and paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section will 
apply.

narrowband PCS license(s), and any non-controlling investor who 
purchases an interest in a narrowband PCS license held by a business 
owned by members of minority groups and/or women with the first year 
after license issuance, may, upon the sale of such investment or 
interest, request from the Commission a tax certificate. Any narrowband

that the Commission issue the licensee a tax certificate.
    (c) Short-Form Application Certification; Long-Form Application 
Disclosure. (1) All applicants for licenses under the designated entity 
provisions set forth in this section shall certify on their short-form 
applications (Form 175) that they are eligible for those preferences

minority groups and women, consortium of small businesses, control 
group, gross revenues, members of minority groups, passive equity,

payments, bidding credits or tax certificates to obtain a narrowband PCS 
license will be subject to the following unjust enrichment provisions:
    (1) If a small business paying for a narrowband PCS license in 
installment payments seeks to transfer a license to a non-small business 
entity during the term of the license, the remaining principal balance 
must be repaid as a condition of the license transfer.
    (2) If a licensee that utilizes installment financing under this 
section

[[Page 245]]

seeks to make any change in ownership structure that would result in the 
licensee losing eligibility for installment payments, the licensees 
shall first seek Commission approval and must make full payment of the 
remaining unpaid principal and any unpaid interest accrued through the 
date of the change as a condition of approval. Increases in gross 
revenues that result from equity investments that are not attributable 
to the licensee under Sec. 24.320(b)(2)(iv), revenues from operations,

    Note to paragraph (b): Ownership interests shall be calculated on a 
fully diluted basis; all agreements such as warrants, stock options and

interests before they actually do so.

    (c) Business Owned by Members of Minority Groups and/or Women. A 
business owned by members of minority groups and/or women is an entity:
    (1) That has a control group composed 100 percent of members of

calculated on a fully diluted basis; all agreements such as warrants,

the rights thereunder already have been fully exercised, except that 
such agreements may not be used to appear to terminate or divest 
ownership interests before they actually do so.
    (d) Gross Revenues. Gross revenues shall mean all income received by 
an entity, whether earned or passive, before any deductions are made for 
costs of doing business (e.g., cost of goods sold), as evidenced by 
audited quarterly financial statements for the relevant period.
    (e) Personal Net Worth. Personal net worth shall mean the market

more than fifteen percent of the voting equity;
    (2) For partnerships, joint ventures and other non-corporate

not afford the power to exercise control of the entity.
    (h) Control Group. A control group is an entity, or a group of 
individuals or entities, that possess de jure control and de facto 
control of an applicant or licensee, and as to which the applicant's or 
licensee's charters, articles of incorporation, bylaws, agreements and

    (1) That the entity and/or its members own unconditionally at least 
50.1 percent of the total voting interests of a corporation;

percent of the value of each share of stock in its possession and a 
percentage of the retained earnings of the concern that is equivalent to 
the amount of equity held in the corporation; and
    (4) That the entity and/or its members have the right to receive 
dividends, profits and regular and liquidating distributions from the 
business in proportion to its interest in the total equity of the 
applicant or licensee.

    Note to paragraph (h): Voting control does not always assure de 
facto control, such as, for example, when the voting stock of the 
control group is widely dispersed (see, e.g., Sec. 24.720(e)(2)(iii)).

    (i) Affiliate. Determinations regarding whether an individual or 
entity will be considered an affiliate of:
    (1) An applicant or
    (2) A person holding an attributable interest in an applicant under

securities are owned by the applicant or an officer, director, 
stockholder or key management personnel of the applicant. This list must 
include a description of each subsidiary's principal business and a 
description of each subsidiary's relationship to the applicant.
    (2) A list of its affiliates, if any. Affiliates means any business 
which holds a five per cent or more interest in the applicant, or any 
business in which a five per cent or more interest is held by another 
company which holds a five per cent interest in the applicant (e.g. 
Company A owns 5% of Company B and 5% of Company C; Companies B and C 
are affiliates).
    (3) A list of the names, addresses, citizenship and principal 
business of any person holding five per cent or more of each class of 
stock, warrants, options or debt securities together with the amount and 
percentage held, and the name, address, citizenship and principal place 
of business of any person on whose account, if other than the holder, 
such interest is held. If any of these persons are related by blood or 
marriage, include such relationship in the statement.
    (4) In the case of partnerships, the name and address of each 
partner, each partner's citizenship and the share or interest 
participation in the partnership. This information must be provided for 
all partners, regardless of their respective ownership interests in

[[Page 250]]

the partnership. A signed and dated copy of the partnership agreement 
must be included in the application. This information must be included 
in Exhibit V of the application.
    (b) Each application for a radio station authorization in the 
narrowband PCS must:
    (1) Submit the information required by the Commission's rules, 
requests, and application forms;
    (2) Be maintained by the applicant substantially accurate and 
complete in all significant respects in accordance with the provisions 
of Sec. 1.65 of this chapter; and
    (3) Show compliance with and make all special showings that may be 
applicable.
    (c) Where documents, exhibits, or other lengthy showings already on 
file with the Commission contain information which is required by an 
application form, the application may specifically refer to such 
information, if:
    (1) The information previously filed is over one A4 (21 cm x 29.7 
cm) or 8.5 x 11 inch (21.6 cm x 27.9 cm) page in length, and all 
information referenced therein is current and accurate in all 
significant respects under Sec. 1.65 of this chapter; and
    (2) The reference states specifically where the previously filed 
information can actually be found, including mention of:
    (i) the station call sign or application file number whenever the 
reference is to station files or previously filed applications;
    (ii) The title of the proceeding, the docket number, and any legal 
citations, whenever the reference is to a docketed proceeding. However, 
questions on an application form which call for specific technical data, 
or which can be answered by a ``yes'' or ``no'' or other short answer 
shall be answered as appropriate and shall not be cross-referenced to a 
previous filing.
    (d) In addition to the general application requirements of subpart F 
and Secs. 1.2105, 24.413 and 24.415 of this part, applicants shall 
submit any additional documents, exhibits, or signed written statements 
of fact:
    (1) As may be required by these rules; and
    (2) As the Commission, at any time after the filing of an 
application and during the term of any authorization, may require from 
any applicant, permittee, or licensee to enable it to determine whether 
a radio authorization should be granted, denied, or revoked.
    (e) Except when the Commission has declared explicitly to the 
contrary, an informational requirement does not in itself imply the 
processing treatment of decisional weight to be accorded the response.
    (f) All applicants (except applicants filing FCC Form 175) are 
required to indicate at the time their application is filed whether or 
not a Commission grant of the application may have a significant 
environmental impact as defined by 47 CFR 1.1307. If answered 
affirmatively, the requisite environmental assessment as prescribed in 
Sec. 1.1311 of this chapter must be filed with the application and 
Commission environmental review must be completed prior to construction. 
See Sec. 1.1312 of this chapter. All narrowband PCS licensees are 
subject to a continuing obligation to determine whether subsequent 
construction may have a significant environmental impact prior to 
undertaking such construction and to otherwise comply with Secs. 1.1301 
through 1.1319 of this chapter. See 47 CFR 1.1312.

<R05>
Sec. 24.415  Technical content of applications; maintenance of list of station locations.

    (a) All applications required by this part shall contain all 
technical information required by the application forms or associated 
public notice(s). Applications other than initial applications for a 
narrowband PCS license must also comply with all technical requirements 
of the rules governing the narrowband PCS (see subparts C and D as 
appropriate). The following paragraphs describe a number of general 
technical requirements.
    (b) Each application (except applications for initial licenses filed 
on Form 175) for a radio station authorization for narrowband PCS must 
comply with

[[Page 251]]

the provisions of Secs. 24.129 through 24.135.
    (c)--(i) [Reserved]
    (j) The location of the transmitting antenna shall be considered to 
be the station location. Narrowband PCS licensees must maintain a 
current list of all station locations, which must describe the 
transmitting antenna site by its geographical coordinates and also by 
conventional reference to street number, landmark, or the equivalent. 
All such coordinates shall be specified in terms of degrees, minutes, 
and seconds to the nearest second of latitude and longitude.

<R05>
Sec. 24.419  Waiver of rules.

    (a) Request for waivers. (1) Waivers of these rules may be granted 
upon application or by the Commission on its own motion. Requests for 
waivers shall contain a statement of reasons sufficient to justify a 
waiver. Waivers will not be granted except upon an affirmative showing:
    (i) That the underlying purpose of the rule will not be served, or 
would be frustrated, by the application in a particular case, and that 
grant of the waiver is otherwise in the public interest; or
    (ii) That the unique facts and circumstances of a particular case 
render application of the rule inequitable, unduly burdensome or 
otherwise contrary to the public interest. Applicants must also show the 
lack of a reasonable alternative.
    (2) If the information necessary to support a waiver request is 
already on file, the applicant may cross-reference to the specific 
filing where it may be found.
    (b) Denial of waiver, alternate showing required. If a waiver is not 
granted, the application will be dismissed as defective unless the 
applicant has also provided an alternative proposal which complies with 
the Commission's rules (including any required showings).


<R05>
Sec. 24.420  Defective applications.

    (a) Unless the Commission shall otherwise permit, an application 
will be unacceptable for filing and will be returned to the applicant 
with a brief statement as to the omissions or discrepancies if:
    (1) The application is defective with respect to completeness of 
answers to questions, informational showings, execution, or other 
matters of a formal character; or
    (2) The application does not comply with the Commission's rules, 
regulations, specific requirements for additional information or other 
requirements. See also 47 CFR 1.2105.
    (b) Some examples of common deficiencies which result in defective 
applications under paragraph (a) of this section are:
    (1) The application is not filled out completely and signed;
    (2)-(4) [Reserved]
    (5) The application (other than an application filed on FCC Form 
175) does not include an environmental assessment as required for an 
action that may have a significant impact upon the environment, as 
defined in Sec. 1.1307 of this chapter.
    (6) [Reserved]
    (7) The application is filed prior to the Public Notice issued under 
Sec. 24.305 announcing the application filing date for the relevant 
auction or after the cutoff date prescribed in that public notice;
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) If an applicant is requested by the Commission to file any 
documents or any supplementary or explanatory information not 
specifically required in the prescribed application form, a failure to 
comply with such request within a specified time period will be deemed 
to render the application defective and will subject it to dismissal.


<R05>
Sec. 24.421  Inconsistent or conflicting applications.

    While an application is pending and undecided, no subsequent 
inconsistent or conflicting application may be filed by the same 
applicant, his successor or assignee, or on behalf or for the benefit of 
the same applicant, his successor or assignee.

<R05>
Sec. 24.422  Amendment of application for Narrowband Personal Communications Service filed on FCC Form 175.

    (a) The Commission will provide bidders a limited opportunity to 
cure defects in FCC Form 175 specified herein except for failure to sign 
the application and to make certifications. These are defects which may 
not be cured. See also Section 1.2105 of this chapter.
    (b) In the Narrowband PCS, applicants will be permitted to amend 
their Form 175 applications to make minor amendments to correct minor 
errors or defects such as typographical errors. Applicants will also be 
permitted to amend FCC Form 175, to make ownership changes or changes in 
the identification of parties to bidding consortia, provided such 
changes do not result in a change in control of the applicant and do not 
involve another applicant (or parties in interest to an applicant) who 
has applied for any of the same licenses as the applicant. Amendments 
which change control of the applicant will be considered major 
amendments. An FCC Form 175 which is amended by a major amendment will 
be considered to be newly filed and cannot be resubmitted after 
applicable filing deadlines. See also Sec. 1.2105 of this chapter.

[59 FR 44072, Aug. 26, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 24.423  Amendment of applications for Narrowband Personal Communications Service (other than applications filed on FCC Form 175).

    This section applies to all applications for Narrowband Personal 
Communications Service other than applications filed on FCC Form 175.
    (a) Amendments as of right. A pending application may be amended as 
a matter of right if the application has not been designated for 
hearing.
    (1) Amendments shall comply with Sec. 24.429, as applicable; and
    (2) Amendments which resolve interference conflicts or amendments 
under Sec. 24.429 may be filed at any time.
    (b) The Commission or the presiding officer may grant requests to 
amend an application designated for hearing only if a written petition 
demonstrating good cause is submitted and properly served upon the 
parties of record.
    (c) Major amendments, minor amendments. The Commission will classify 
all amendments as minor except in the cases listed below. An amendment 
shall be deemed to be a major amendment subject to Sec. 24.427 under any 
of the following circumstances:
    (1) Change in technical proposal. If the amendment results in a 
substantial change in the engineering proposal such as (but not 
necessarily limited to) a change in, or an addition of, a radio 
frequency; or
    (2) Amendment to proposed service area. If the amendment extends the 
reliable service area of the proposed facilities outside its MTA, BTA, 
or other applicable market area as defined in Sec. 24.102; or
    (3) A substantial change in ownership or control.
    (d) If a petition to deny (or other formal objection) has been 
filed, any amendment, requests for waiver, (or other written 
communications) shall be served on the petitioner, unless waiver of this 
requirement is granted pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. See 
also 47 CFR 1.2108.
    (e) The Commission may waive the service requirements of paragraph 
(d) of this section and prescribe such alternative procedures as may be 
appropriate under the circumstances to protect petitioners' interests 
and to avoid undue delay in a proceeding, if an applicant submits a 
request for waiver which demonstrates that the service requirement is 
unreasonably burdensome.
    (f) Any amendment to an application shall be signed and shall be 
submitted in the same manner, and with the same number of copies, as was 
the original application. Amendments may be made in letter form if they 
comply in all other respects with the requirements of this chapter.
    (g) An application will be considered to be a newly filed 
application if it is amended by a major amendment (as defined in this 
section), except in the following circumstances:
    (1)-(2) [Reserved]
    (3) The amendment reflects only a change in ownership or control 
found by the Commission to be in the public interest;
    (4) [Reserved]

[[Page 253]]

    (5) The amendment corrects typographical transcription, or similar 
clerical errors which are clearly demonstrated to be mistakes by 
reference to other parts of the application, and whose discovery does 
not create new or increased frequency conflicts.
    (6) The amendment does not create new or increased frequency 
conflicts, and is demonstrably necessitated by events which the 
applicant could not have reasonably foreseen at the time of filing, such 
as, for example:
    (i) The loss of a transmitter or receiver site by condemnation, 
natural causes, or loss of lease or option; or
    (ii) Obstruction of a proposed transmission path caused by the 
erection of a new building or other structure.
Sec. 24.424  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 24.425  Application for temporary authorizations.

    (a) In circumstances requiring immediate or temporary use of 
facilities, request may be made for special temporary authority to 
install and/or operate new or modified equipment. Any such request may 
be submitted as an informal application in the manner set forth in 
Sec. 24.405 and must contain full particulars as to the proposed 
operation including all facts sufficient to justify the temporary 
authority sought and the public interest therein. No such request will 
be considered unless the request is received by the Commission at least 
10 days prior to the date of proposed construction or operation or, 
where an extension is sought, expiration date of the existing temporary 
authorization. A request received within less than 10 days may be 
accepted upon due showing of sufficient reasons for the delay in 
submitting such request.
    (b) Special temporary authorizations may be granted without regard 
to the 30-day public notice requirements of Sec. 24.427(b) when:
    (1) The authorization is for a period not to exceed 30 days and no 
application for regular operation is contemplated to be filed;
    (2) The authorization is for a period not to exceed 60 days pending 
the filing of an application for such regular operation;
    (3) The authorization is to permit interim operation to facilitate 
completion of authorized construction or to provide substantially the 
same service as previously authorized; or
    (4) The authorization is made upon a finding that there are 
extraordinary circumstances requiring operation in the public interest 
and that delay in the institution of such service would seriously 
prejudice the public interest.
    (c) Temporary authorizations of operation not to exceed 180 days may 
be granted under the standards of section 309(f) of the Communications 
Act where extraordinary circumstances so require. Extensions of the 
temporary authorization for a period of 180 days each may also be 
granted, but the renewal applicant bears a heavy burden to show that 
extraordinary circumstances warrant such an extension.
    (d) In cases of emergency found by the Commission, involving danger 
to life or property or due to damage of equipment, or during a national 
emergency proclaimed by the President or declared by the Congress or 
during the continuance of any war in which the United States is engaged 
and when such action is necessary for the national defense or safety or 
otherwise in furtherance of the war effort, or in cases of emergency 
where the Commission finds that it would not be feasible to secure 
renewal applications from existing licensees or otherwise to follow 
normal licensing procedure, the Commission will grant radio station 
authorizations and station licenses, or modifications or renewals 
thereof, during the emergency found by the Commission or during the 
continuance of any such national emergency or war, as special temporary 
licenses, only for the period of emergency or war requiring such action, 
without the filing of formal applications.

<R05>
Sec. 24.426  Receipt of application; applications in the narrowband Personal Communications Services filed on FCC Form 175 and other applications in the 
          narrowband PCS Service.

    (a) All applications for the initial provision of narrowband PCS 
service

[[Page 254]]

must be submitted on FCC Forms 175 and 175-S. Mutually exclusive initial 
applications in the narrowband Personal Communications Services are 
subject to competitive bidding. FCC Form 600 (``Application for New or 
Modified Common Carrier Radio Station Under Part 22'') must be submitted 
by each winning bidder for each narrowband PCS license applied for on 
FCC Form 175. In the event that mutual exclusivity does not exist 
between applicants filing FCC Form 175, the applicant will also file FCC 
Form 401. The aforementioned Forms 175, 175-S, and 401 are subject to 
the provisions of 47 CFR part 1, subpart Q (``Competitive Bidding 
Proceedings'') and subpart F of this part. Blanket licenses are granted 
for each market frequency block. Applications for individual sites are 
not needed and will not be accepted. See Sec. 24.11.
    (b) Applications received for filing are given a file number. The 
assignment of a file number to an application is merely for 
administrative convenience and does not indicate the acceptance of the 
application for filing and processing. Such assignment of a file number 
will not preclude the subsequent return or dismissal of the application 
if it is found to be not in accordance with the Commission's rules.
    (c) Acceptance of an application for filing merely means that it has 
been the subject of a preliminary review as to completeness. Such 
acceptance will not preclude the subsequent return or dismissal of the 
application if it is found to be defective or not in accordance with the 
Commission's rules. (See Sec. 24.413 for additional information 
concerning filing of applications.)

[59 FR 26749, May 24, 1994, as amended at 59 FR 59957, Nov. 21, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 24.427  Public notice period.

    (a) At regular intervals, the Commission will issue a public notice 
listing:
    (1) The acceptance for filing of all applications and major 
amendments thereto;
    (2) Significant Commission actions concerning applications listed as 
acceptable for filing;
    (3) Information which the Commission in its discretion believes of 
public significance. Such notices are solely for the purpose of 
informing the public and do not create any rights in an applicant or any 
other person;
    (4) Special environmental considerations as required by part 1 of 
this chapter.
    (b) The Commission will not grant any application until expiration 
of a period of thirty (30) days following the issuance date of a public 
notice listing the application, or any major amendments thereto, as 
acceptable for filing. Provided, that the Commission will not grant an 
application filed on Form 600 filed either by a winning bidder or by an 
applicant whose Form 175 application is not mutually exclusive with 
other applicants, until the expiration of a period of forty (40) days 
following the issuance of a public notice listing the application, or 
any major amendments thereto, as acceptable for filing. See also 47 CFR 
1.2108.
    (c) As an exception to paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) and (b) of this 
section, the public notice provisions are not applicable to 
applications:
    (1) For authorization of a minor technical change in the facilities 
of an authorized station where such a change would not be classified as 
a major amendment (as defined by Sec. 24.423) were such a change to be 
submitted as an amendment to a pending application;
    (2) For issuance of a license subsequent to a radio station 
authorization or, pending application for a grant of such license, any 
special or temporary authorization to permit interim operation to 
facilitate completion of authorized construction or to provide 
substantially the same service as would be authorized by such license;
    (3) For extension of time to complete construction of authorized 
facilities, see Sec. 24.103;
    (4) For temporary authorization pursuant to Sec. 24.425(b);
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) For an authorization under any of the proviso clauses of section 
308(a) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 308(a));
    (7) For consent to an involuntary assignment or transfer of control 
of a radio authorization; or
    (8) For consent to a voluntary assignment or transfer of control of 
a radio

[[Page 255]]

authorization, where the assignment or transfer does not involve a 
substantial change in ownership or control.

<R05>
Sec. 24.428  Dismissal and return of applications.

    (a) Except as provided under Sec. 24.429, any application may be 
dismissed without prejudice as a matter of right if the applicant 
requests its dismissal prior to designation for hearing or, in the case 
of applications filed on Forms 175 and 175-S, prior to auction. An 
applicant's request for the return of his application after it has been 
accepted for filing will be considered to be a request for dismissal 
without prejudice. Applicants requesting dismissal of their applications 
are also subject to 47 CFR 1.2104. Requests for dismissal shall comply 
with the provisions of Sec. 24.429 as appropriate.
    (b) A request to dismiss an application without prejudice will be 
considered after designation for hearing only if:
    (1) A written petition is submitted to the Commission and is 
properlyserved upon all parties of record, and
    (2) The petition complies with the provisions of Sec. 24.429 
(whenever applicable) and demonstrates good cause.
    (c) The Commission will dismiss an application for failure to 
prosecute or for failure to respond substantially within a specified 
time period to official correspondence or requests for additional 
information. Dismissal shall be without prejudice if made prior to 
designation for hearing or prior to auction, but dismissal may be made 
with prejudice for unsatisfactory compliance with Sec. 24.429 or after 
designation for hearing or after the applicant is notified that it is 
the winning bidder under the auction process.


<R05>
Sec. 24.429  Ownership changes and agreements to amend or to dismiss applications or pleadings.

    (a) Applicability. Subject to the provisions of 47 CFR 1.2105 
(Bidding Application and Certification Procedures; Prohibition of 
Collusion), this section applies to applicants and all other parties 
interested in pending applications who wish to resolve contested matters 
among themselves with a formal or an informal agreement or 
understanding. This section applies only when the agreement or 
understanding will result in:
    (1) A major change in the ownership of an applicant to which 
Secs. 24.423(c) and 24.423(g) apply or which would cause the applicant 
to lose its status as a designated entity under Sec. 24.309, or
    (2) The individual or mutual withdrawal, amendment or dismissal of 
any pending application, amendment, petitioner or other pleading.
    (b) If the amendment would, if granted, cause the applicant to lose 
its status as a designated entity under Sec. 24.309, the applicant must 
comply with the obligations imposed by Sec. 24.309 (Designated Entities) 
and Sec. 1.2111 (Assignment of transfer of control; unjust enrichment) 
before the amendment will be granted.
    (c) The provisions of 47 CFR 22.927 will apply in the event of the 
individual or mutual withdrawal, amendment or dismissal of any pending 
application, amendment, petitioner or other pleading.

[59 FR 26749, May 24, 1994; 59 FR 37164, July 21, 1994, as amended at 59 
FR 44072, Aug. 26, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 24.430   Opposition to applications.

    (a) Petitions to deny (including petitions for other forms of 
relief) and responsive pleadings for Commission consideration must 
comply with Sec. 1.2108 of this chapter and must:
    (1) Identify the application or applications (including applicant's 
name, station location, Commission file numbers and radio service 
involved) with which it is concerned;
    (2) Be filed in accordance with the pleading limitations, filing 
periods, and other applicable provisions of Secs. 1.41 through 1.52 of 
this chapter except where otherwise provided in Sec. 1.2108 of this 
chapter;
    (3) Contain specific allegations of fact which, except for facts of 
which official notice may be taken, shall be supported by affidavit of a 
person or persons with personal knowledge thereof, and which shall be 
sufficient to demonstrate that the petitioner (or respondent) is a party 
in interest and

[[Page 256]]

that a grant of, or other Commission action regarding, the application 
would be prima facie inconsistent with the public interest;
    (4) Be filed within thirty (30) days after the date of public notice 
announcing the acceptance for filing of any such application or major 
amendment thereto (unless the Commission otherwise extends the filing 
deadline); and
    (5) Contain a certificate of service showing that it has been mailed 
to the applicant no later than the date of filing thereof with the 
Commission.
    (b) A petition to deny a major amendment to a previously filed 
application may only raise matters directly related to the amendment 
which could not have been raised in connection with the underlying, 
previously filed application. This does not apply to petitioners who 
gain standing because of the major amendment.
    (c) Parties who file frivolous petitions to deny may be subject to 
sanctions including monetary forfeitures, license revocation, if they 
are FCC licensees, and may be prohibited from participating in future 
auctions.

<R05>
Sec. 24.431  Mutually exclusive applications.

    (a) The Commission will consider applications to be mutually 
exclusive if their conflicts are such that the grant of one application 
would effectively preclude by reason of harmful electrical interference, 
or other practical reason, the grant of one or more of the other 
applications. The Commission will presume ``harmful electrical 
interference'' to mean interference which would result in a material 
impairment to service rendered to the public despite full cooperation in 
good faith by all applicants or parties to achieve reasonable technical 
adjustments which would avoid electrical conflict.
    (b) Mutually exclusive applications filed on Form 175 for the 
initial provision of narrowband PCS service are subject to competitive 
bidding in accordance with the procedures in subpart F of this part and 
in 47 CFR part 1, subpart Q.
    (c) An application will be entitled to comparative consideration 
with one or more conflicting applications only if the Commission 
determines that such comparative consideration will serve the public 
interest.


<R05>
Sec. 24.432  Consideration of applications.

    (a) Applications for an instrument of authorization will be granted 
if, upon examination of the application and upon consideration of such 
other matters as it may officially notice, the Commission finds that the 
grant will serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity. See 
also Sec. 1.2108.
    (b) The grant shall be without a formal hearing if, upon 
consideration of the application, any pleadings or objections filed, or 
other matters which may be officially noticed, the Commission finds 
that:
    (1) The application is acceptable for filing, and is in accordance 
with the Commission's rules, regulations, and other requirements;
    (2) The application is not subject to a post-auction hearing or to 
comparative consideration pursuant to Sec. 24.431 with another 
application(s);
    (3) A grant of the application would not cause harmful electrical 
interference to an authorized station;
    (4) There are no substantial and material questions of fact 
presented; and
    (5) The applicant is qualified under current FCC regulations and 
policies.
    (c) If the Commission should grant without a formal hearing an 
application for an instrument of authorization which is subject to a 
petition to deny filed in accordance with Sec. 24.430, the Commission 
will deny the petition by the issuance of a Memorandum Opinion and Order 
which will concisely report the reasons for the denial and dispose of 
all substantial issues raised by the petition.
    (d) Whenever the Commission, without a formal hearing, grants any 
application in part, or subject to any terms or conditions other than

Sec. 24.439  Transfer of control or assignment of station authorization.

    (a) Approval required. Authorizations shall be transferred or 
assigned to another party, voluntarily (for example, by contract) or 
involuntarily (for example, by death, bankruptcy, or legal disability), 
directly or indirectly or by transfer of control of any corporation 
holding such authorization, only upon application and approval by the 
Commission. A transfer of control or assignment of station authorization 
in the narrowband Personal Communications Service is also subject to 
Sec. 24.309 (Designated Entities) and Sec. 1.2111 (Assignment or 
transfer of control: unjust enrichment).
    (1) A change from less than 50% ownership to 50% or more ownership 
shall always be considered a transfer of control.
    (2) In other situations a controlling interest shall be determined 
on a case-by-case basis considering the distribution of ownership, and 
the relationships of the owners, including family relationships.
    (b) Form required--(1) Assignment.
    (i) FCC Form 490 shall be filed to assign a license or permit.
    (ii) In the case of involuntary assignment, FCC Form 490 shall be 
filed within 30 days of the event causing the assignment.
    (2) Transfer of control. (i) FCC Form 490 shall be submitted in 
order to transfer control of a corporation holding a license or permit.
    (ii) In the case of involuntary transfer of control, FCC Form 490 
shall be filed within 30 days of the event causing the transfer.
    (3) Form 430. Whenever an application must be filed under paragraph 
(a) (1) or (2) of this section, the assignee or transferee shall file 
FCC Form 430 (``Common Carrier Radio License Qualification Report'') 
unless an accurate report is on file with the Commission.
    (4) Notification of completion. The Commission shall be notified by 
letter of the date of completion of the assignment or transfer of 
control.
    (5) If the transfer of control of a license is approved, the new 
licensee is held to the original build-out requirement of Sec. 24.103.
    (c) In acting upon applications for transfer of control or 
assignment, the Commission will not consider whether the public 
interest, convenience, and necessity might be served by the transfer or 
assignment of the authorization to a person other than the proposed 
transferee or assignee.

Sec. 24.443  Extension of time to complete construction.

    (a) If construction is not completed within the time period set 
forth in

[[Page 258]]

Sec. 24.103, the authorization will automatically expire. Before the 
period for construction expires an application for an extension of time 
to complete construction (FCC Form 489) may be filed. See paragraph (b) 
of this section. Within 30 days after the authorization expires an 
application for reinstatement may be filed on FCC Form 489.
    (b) An application for extension of time to complete construction 
may be made on FCC Form 489. Extension of time requests must be filed 
prior to the expiration of the construction period. Extensions will be 
granted only if the licensee shows that the failure to complete 
construction is due to causes beyond his control. An application for 
modification of an authorization (under construction) does not extend 
the initial construction period. If additional time to construct is 
required, an FCC Form 489 must be submitted.


<R05>
Sec. 24.444  Termination of authorization.

    (a)(1) All authorizations shall terminate on the date specified on 
the authorization or on the date specified by these rules, unless a 
timely application for renewal has been filed.
    (2) If no application for renewal has been made before the 
authorization's expiration date, a late application for renewal will 
only be considered if it is filed within 30 days of the expiration date 
and shows that the failure to file a timely application was due to 
causes beyond the applicant's control. During this 30 day period 
reinstatement applications must be filed on FCC Form 489. Service to 
subscribers need not be suspended while a late filed renewal application 
is pending, but such service shall be without prejudice to Commission 
action on the renewal application and any related sanctions. See also 
Sec. 24.16 (Criteria for Comparative Renewal Proceedings).
    (b) Special Temporary Authority. A special temporary authorization 
shall automatically terminate upon failure to comply with the conditions 
in the authorization.

       Subpart H--Competitive Bidding Procedures for Broadband PCS

    Source:  59 FR 37604, July 22, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 24.701  Broadband PCS subject to competitive bidding.

    Mutually exclusive initial applications to provide broadband PCS 
service are subject to competitive bidding procedures. The general 
competitive bidding procedures found in 47 CFR Part 1, Subpart Q will 
apply unless otherwise provided in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 24.702  Competitive bidding design for Broadband PCS licensing.

    (a) The Commission will employ the following competitive bidding 
designs when choosing from among mutually exclusive initial applications 
to provide broadband PCS service:
    (1) Simultaneous multiple round auctions.
    (2) Sequential auctions.
    (b) The Commission may design and test alternative procedures. The 
Commission will announce by Public Notice before each auction the 
competitive bidding design to be employed in a particular auction.
    (c) The Commission may use combinatorial bidding, which would allow 
bidders to submit all or nothing bids on combinations of licenses, in 
addition to bids on individual licenses. The Commission may require that 
to be declared the high bid, a combinatorial bid must exceed the sum of 
the individual bids by a specified amount or percentage. Combinatorial 
bidding may be used with any type of auction design.
    (d) The Commission may use single combined auctions, which combine 
bidding for two or more substitutable licenses and award licenses to the 
highest bidders until the available licenses are exhausted. This 
technique may be used in conjunction with any type of auction.


<R05>
Sec. 24.703  Competitive bidding mechanisms.

    (a) Sequencing. The Commission will establish and may vary the 
sequence in which broadband PCS licenses will be auctioned.
    (b) Grouping. In the event the Commission uses either a simultaneous 
multiple round competitive bidding design or combinatorial bidding, the

[[Page 259]]

Commission will determine which licenses will be auctioned 
simultaneously or in combination.
    (c) Reservation Price. The Commission may establish a reservation 
price, either disclosed or undisclosed, below which a license subject to 
auction will not be awarded.
    (d) Minimum Bid Increments. The Commission will, by announcement 
before or during an auction, require minimum bid increments in dollar or 
percentage terms.
    (e) Stopping Rules. The Commission will establish stopping rules 
before or during multiple round auctions in order to terminate an 
auction within a reasonable time.
    (f) Activity Rules. The Commission will establish activity rules 
which require a minimum amount of bidding activity. In the event that 
the Commission establishes an activity rule in connection with a 
simultaneous multiple-round auction, bidders will be entitled to request 
and be granted waivers of such rule. The Commission will specify the 
number of waivers permitted in an auction, the frequency with which they 
may be exercised, and the method of operation of waivers by Public 
Notice prior to each auction.
    (g) Suggested Minimum Bid. The Commission may establish suggested 
minimum bids on each license. Bids below the suggested minimum bid would 
count as activity under the activity rule only if no bids at or above 
the suggested minimum bid are received.
    (h) Bidder Identification During Auctions. The Commission may 
choose, on an auction-by-auction basis, to release the identity of the 
bidders associated with bidder identification numbers. The Commission 
will announce by Public Notice before each auction whether bidder 
identities will be revealed.

<R05>
Sec. 24.704  Withdrawal, default and disqualification penalties.

    (a) When the Commission conducts a simultaneous multiple round 
auction pursuant to Sec. 24.702(a)(1), the Commission will impose 
penalties on bidders who withdraw high bids during the course of an 
auction, who default on payments due after an auction closes, or who are 
disqualified.
    (1) Bid withdrawal prior to close of auction. A bidder who withdraws 
a high bid during the course of an auction will be subject to a penalty 
equal to the difference between the amount bid and the amount of the 
winning bid the next time the license is offered by the Commission. No 
withdrawal penalty would be assessed if the subsequent winning bid 
exceeds the withdrawn bid. This penalty amount will be deducted from any 
upfront payments or down payments that the withdrawing bidder was 
deposited with the Commission.
    (2) Default or disqualification after close of auction. If a high 
bidder defaults or is disqualified after the close of such an auction, 
the defaulting bidder will be subject to the penalty in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section plus an additional penalty equal to three (3) percent of 
the subsequent winning bid. If the subsequent winning bid exceeds the 
defaulting bidder's bid amount, the 3 percent penalty will be calculated 
based on the defaulting bidder's bid amount. These amounts will be 
deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the defaulting 
or disqualified bidder has deposited with the Commission.
    (3) Erroneous Bids. If at any point during an auction an erroneous 
bid is withdrawn in the same round in which it was submitted, the bid 
withdrawal payment will be the greater of
    (i) The minimum bid increment for that license and round; and
    (ii) The standard bid withdrawal payment, as defined in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, calculated as if the bidder had made the minimum 
accepted bid. If an erroneous bid is withdrawn in the round immediately 
following the round in which it was submitted, and the auction is in 
Stage I or Stage II, the withdrawal payment will be the greater of
    (A) Two times the minimum bid increment during the round in which 
the erroneous bid was submitted, and
    (B) The standard withdrawal payment, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section, calculated as if the bidder had made a bid one bid 
increment above the minimum accepted bid. If an erroneous bid is 
withdrawn two or more rounds following the round in

[[Page 260]]

which it was submitted, the bidder will not be eligible for any 
reduction in the bid withdrawal payment as defined in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section. During Stage III of an auction, if an erroneous bid is 
not withdrawn during the round in which it was submitted, the bidder 
will not be eligible for any reduction in the bid withdrawal payment as 
defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (b) When the Commission conducts sequential oral auctions pursuant 
to Sec. 24.702(a)(2), the Commission may modify the penalties set forth 
in subsection (a) above to be paid in the event of bid withdrawal, 
default or disqualification; provided, however, that such penalties 
shall not exceed the penalties specified above.
    (1) If a bid is withdrawn before the Commission has declared the 
bidding to be closed for the license bid on, no bid withdrawal penalty 
will be assessed.
    (2) If a bid is withdrawn after the Commission has declared the 
bidding to be closed for the license bid on, the penalty specified in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section will apply.

PCS licenses must submit applications on FCC Forms 175 and 175-S 
pursuant to the provisions of Secs. 1.2105 of the Chapter and 24.813. 
The Commission will issue a Public Notice announcing the availability of 
broadband PCS licenses and, in the event that mutually exclusive 
applications are filed, the date of the auction for those licenses. This 
Public Notice also will specify the date on or before which applicants 
intending to participate in a broadband PCS auction must file their

contain information necessary for completion of the application as well 
as other important information such as the materials which must 
accompany the Forms, any filing fee that must accompany the application 
or any upfront payment that will need to be submitted, and the location 
where the application must be filed.


<R05>
Sec. 24.706  Submission of upfront payments and down payments.

    (a) Where the Commission uses simultaneous multiple round auctions 
or oral sequential auctions, bidders will be required to submit an 
upfront payment in accordance with Sec. 1.2106 of this chapter, 
paragraph (c) of this section, and Secs. 24.711(a)(1) and 24.716(a)(1).
    (b) Winning bidders in an auction must submit a down payment to the 
Commission in accordance with Sec. 1.2107(b) of this chapter and 
Secs. 24.711(a)(2) and 24.716(a)(2).
    (c) Each eligible bidder for licenses on frequency Blocks D and E 
subject to auction shall pay an upfront payment of $0.06 per MHz per pop 
for the maximum number of licenses (in terms of MHz-pops) on which it 
intends to bid pursuant to Sec. 1.2106 of this chapter and procedures 
specified by Public Notice.

Sec. 24.707  Long-form applications.

    Each winning bidder will be required to submit a long-form

Form 600 shall be submitted pursuant to the procedures set forth in 
Subpart I of this Part and Sec. 1.2107 (c) and (d) of this Chapter and 
any associated Public Notices. Only auction winners (and applicants 
seeking partitioned licenses pursuant to agreements with auction winners 
under Sec. 24.714) will be eligible to file applications on FCC Form 600 
for initial broadband PCS licenses in the event of mutual exclusivity 
between applicants filing Form 175. Winning bidders need not complete 
Schedule B to Form 600.

<R05>
Sec. 24.708  License grant, denial, default, and disqualification.

    (a) Except with respect to entities eligible for installment 
payments (see Sec. 24.711), each winning bidder will be required to pay 
the balance of its winning bid in a lump sum payment within five (5) 
business days following the award of the license. Grant of the license 
will be conditioned upon full and

[[Page 261]]

timely payment of the winning bid amount.
    (b) A bidder who withdraws its bid subsequent to the close of 
bidding, defaults on a payment due or is disqualified will be subject to 
the penalties specified in Sec. 1.2109 of this Chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 24.709  Eligibility for licenses for frequency Blocks C and F.

    (a) General Rule.
    (1) No application is acceptable for filing and no license shall be 
granted for frequency block C or frequency block F, unless the 
applicant, together with its affiliates and persons or entities that 
hold interests in the applicant and their affiliates, have gross 
revenues of less than $125 million in each of the last two years and 
total assets of less than $500 million at the time the applicant's 
short-form application (Form 175) is filed.

licensee), and its affiliates, and (except as provided in paragraph (b) 
of this section) of persons or entities that hold interests in the

the applicant and considered on a cumulative basis and aggregated for 
purposes of determining whether the applicant (or licensee) is eligible 
for a license for frequency block C or frequency block F under this 
section.
    (3) Any licensee awarded a license pursuant to this section (or 
pursuant to Sec. 24.839(d)(2)) shall maintain its eligibility until at 
least five years from the date of initial license grant, except that a

increased total assets due to nonattributable equity investments (i.e., 
from sources whose gross revenues and total assets are not considered 
under paragraph (b) of this section), debt financing, revenue from

    (ii) At the election of an applicant (or licensee) whose control 
group's sole member is a preexisting entity, the 25 percent minimum 
equity requirements set forth in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section 
shall apply, except that only 10 percent of the applicant's (or

[[Page 263]]

may be owned by qualifying investors, either unconditionally or in the 
form of stock options not subject to the restrictions of paragraph 
(b)(6)(i)(A) of this section, or by any of the following entities which 
may not comply with Sec. 24.720(n)(1):
    (1) Institutional investors, either unconditionally or in the form

    (4) Qualifying investors, as specified in 24.720(n)(4).
    (D) Following termination of the three-year period specified in 
paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, qualifying investors must continue 
to own at least 20 percent of the applicant's (or licensee's) total 
equity unconditionally or in the form of stock options subject to the 
restrictions in paragraph (b)(6)(i)(A) of this section. The restrictions 
specified in paragraph (b)(6)(i)(C)(1) through (4) of this section no 
longer apply to the remaining equity after termination of such three-
year period.
    (ii) At the election of an applicant (or licensee) whose control 
group's sole member is a preexisting entity, the 50.1 percent minimum 
equity requirements set forth in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section 
shall apply, except that only 20 percent of the applicant's (or 
licensee's) total equity must be held by qualifying investors, and that 
the remaining 30.1 percent of the applicant's (or licensee's) total 
equity may be held by qualifying investors, or noncontrolling existing 
investors in such control group member or individuals that are members 
of the applicant's (or licensee's) management. These restrictions on the 
identity of the holder(s) of the remaining 30.1 percent of the 
licensee's total equity no longer apply after termination of the three-
year period specified in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.
    (7) Calculation of Certain Interests. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (b)(5) and (b)(6) of this section, ownership interests shall 
be calculated on a fully diluted basis; all agreements such as warrants, 
stock options and convertible debentures will generally be treated as if 
the rights thereunder already have been fully exercised, except that 
such agreements may not be used to appear to terminate or divest 
ownership interests before they actually do so, in order to comply with 
the nonattributable equity requirements in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and 
(b)(4)(i) of this section.
    (8) Aggregation of Affiliate Interests. Persons or entities that 
hold interest in an applicant (or licensee) that are affiliates of each 
other or have an identify of interests identified in Sec. 24.720(1)(3) 
will be treated as though they were one person or entity and their 
ownership interests aggregated for purposes of determining an 
applicant's (or licensee's) compliance with the nonattributable equity 
requirements in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (b)(4)(i) of this section.

    Example 1 for paragraph (b)(8). ABC Corp. is owned by individuals, 
A, B, and C, each having an equal one-third voting interest in ABC Corp. 
A and B together, with two-thirds of the stock have the power to control 
ABC Corp. and have an identity of interest. If A & B invest in DE Corp., 
a broadband PCS applicant for block C, A and B's separate interests in 
DE Corp. must be aggregated because A and B are to be treated as one 
person.
    Example 2 for paragraph (b)(8). ABC Corp. has subsidiary BC Corp., 
of which it holds a controlling 51 percent of the stock. If ABC Corp. 
and BC Corp., both invest in DE Corp., their separate interests in DE

Sec. 24.709 (b)(3)(i) and (b)(4)(i), where such interests are not held 
directly in the applicant, the total equity held by a person or entity 
shall be determined by successive multiplication of the ownership 
percentages for each link in the vertical ownership chain.
    (k) Control Group. A control group is an entity, or a group of 
individuals or entities, that possesses de jure control and de facto 
control of an applicant or licensee, and as to which the applicant's or 
licensee's charters, bylaws, agreements and any other relevant

[[Page 271]]

documents (and amendments thereto) provide:
    (1) That the entity and/or its members own unconditionally at least 
50.1 percent of the total voting interests of a corporation;
    (2) That the entity and/or its members receive at least 50.1 percent 
of the annual distribution or any dividends paid on the voting stock of 
a corporation;
    (3) That, in the event of dissolution or liquidation of a 
corporation, the entity and/or or its members are entitled to receive 
100 percent of the value of each share of stock in its possession and a 
percentage of the retained earnings of the concern that is equivalent to 
the amount of equity held in the corporation; and
    (4) That, for other types of businesses, the entity and/or its 
members have the right to receive dividends, profits and regular and 
liquidating distributions from the business in proportion to the amount 
of equity held in the business.

    Note to paragraph (k): Voting control does not always assure de 
facto control, such as for example, when the voting stock of the control 
group is widely dispersed (see e.g., Sec. 24.720(1)(2)(iii).

    (l) Affiliate.
    (1) Basis for Affiliation. An individual or entity is an affiliate 
of an applicant or of a person holding an attributable interest in an 
applicant (both referred to herein as ``the applicant'') if such 
individual or entity:
    (i) Directly or indirectly controls or has the power to control the 
applicant, or
    (ii) Is directly or indirectly controlled by the applicant, or
    (iii) Is directly or indirectly controlled by a third party or 
parties that also controls or has the power to control the applicant, or
    (iv) Has an ``identity of interest'' with the applicant.
    (2) Nature of control in determining affiliation.
    (i) Every business concern is considered to have one or more parties 
who directly or indirectly control or have the power to control it. 
Control may be affirmative or negative and it is immaterial whether it 
is exercised so long as the power to control exists.

    Example for paragraph (l)(2)(i). An applicant owning 50 percent of 
the voting stock of another concern would have negative power to control 
such concern since such party can block any action of the other 
stockholders. Also, the bylaws of a corporation may permit a stockholder 
with less than 50 percent of the voting to block any actions taken by 
the other stockholders in the other entity. Affiliation exists when the 
applicant has the power to control a concern while at the same time 
another person, or persons, are in control of the concern at the will of 
the party or parties with the power of control.

    (ii) Control can arise through stock ownership; occupancy of 
director, officer or key employee positions; contractual or other 
business relations; or combinations of these and other factors. A key 
employee is an employee who, because of his/her position in the concern, 
has a critical influence in or substantive control over the operations 
or management of the concern.
    (iii) Control can arise through management positions where a 
concern's voting stock is so widely distributed that no effective 
control can be established.

    Example for paragraph (l)(2)(iii). In a corporation where the 
officers and directors own various size blocks of stock totaling 40 
percent of the corporation's voting stock, but no officer or director 
has a block sufficient to give him or her control or the power to 
control and the remaining 60 percent is widely distributed with no 
individual stockholder having a stock interest greater than 10 percent, 
management has the power to control. If persons with such management 
control of the other entity are persons with attributable interests in 
the applicant, the other entity will be deemed an affiliate of the 
applicant.

    (3) Identity of interest between and among persons. Affiliation can 
arise between or among two or more persons with an identity of interest, 
such as members of the same family or persons with common investments. 
In determining if the applicant controls or is controlled by a concern, 
persons with an identity of interest will be treated as though they were 
one person.

    Example 1. Two shareholders in Corporation Y each have attributable 
interests in the same PCS application. While neither shareholder has 
enough shares to individually control Corporation Y, together they have 
the power to control Corporation Y.

[[Page 272]]

The two shareholders with these common investments (or identity of 
interest) are treated as though they are one person and Corporation Y 
would be deemed an affiliate of the applicant.
    Example 2. One shareholder in Corporation Y, shareholder A, has an 
attributable interest in a PCS application. Another shareholder in 
Corporation Y, shareholder B, has a nonattributable interest in the same 
PCS application. While neither shareholder has enough shares to 
individually control Corporation Y, together they have the power to 
control Corporation Y. Through the common investment of shareholders A 
and B in the PCS application, Corporation Y would still be deemed an 
affiliate of the applicant.

    (i) Spousal Affiliation. Both spouses are deemed to own or control 
or have the power to control interests owned or controlled by either of 
them, unless they are subject to a legal separation recognized by a 
court of competent jurisdiction in the United States.
    (ii) Kinship Affiliation. Immediate family members will be presumed 
to own or control or have the power to control interests owned or 
controlled by other immediate family members. In this context 
``immediate family member'' means father, mother, husband, wife, son, 
daughter, brother, sister, father- or mother-in-law, son- or daughter-
in-law, brother- or sister-in-law, step-father, or -mother, step-
brother, or -sister, step-son, or -daughter, half brother or sister. 
This presumption may be rebutted by showing that
    (A) The family members are estranged,
    (B) The family ties are remote, or
    (C) The family members are not closely involved with each other in 
business matters.

    Example for paragraph (l)(3)(ii). A owns a controlling interest in 
Corporation X. A's sister-in-law, B, has an attributable interest in a 
PCS application. Because A and B have a presumptive kinship affiliation, 
A's interest in Corporation X is attributable to B, and thus to the 
applicant, unless B rebuts the presumption with the necessary showing.

    (4) Affiliation through stock ownership.
    (i) An applicant is presumed to control or have the power to control 
a concern if he or she owns or controls or has the power to control 50 
percent or more of its voting stock.
    (ii) An applicant is presumed to control or have the power to 
control a concern even though he or she owns, controls or has the power 
to control less than 50 percent of the concern's voting stock, if the 
block of stock he or she owns, controls or has the power to control is 
large as compared with any other outstanding block of stock.
    (iii) If two or more persons each owns, controls or has the power to 
control less than 50 percent of the voting stock of a concern, such 
minority holdings are equal or approximately equal in size, and the 
aggregate of these minority holdings is large as compared with any other 
stock holding, the presumption arises that each one of these persons 
individually controls or has the power to control the concern; however, 
such presumption may be rebutted by a showing that such control or power 
to control, in fact, does not exist.
    (5) Affiliation arising under stock options, convertible debentures, 
and agreements to merge. Stock options, convertible debentures, and 
agreements to merge (including agreements in principle) are generally 
considered to have a present effect on the power to control the concern. 
Therefore, in making a size determination, such options, debentures, and 
agreements will generally be treated as though the rights held 
thereunder had been exercised. However, neither an affiliate nor an 
applicant can use such options and debentures to appear to terminate its 
control over another concern before it actually does so.

    Example 1 for paragraph (l)(5). If company B holds an option to 
purchase a controlling interest in company A, who holds an attributable 
interest in a PCS application, the situation is treated as though 
company B had exercised its rights and had become owner of a controlling 
interest in company A. The gross revenues of company B must be taken 
into account in determining the size of the applicant.
    Example 2 for paragraph (l)(5). If a large company, BigCo, holds 70% 
(70 of 100 outstanding shares) of the voting stock of company A, who 
holds an attributable interest in a PCS application, and gives a third 
party, SmallCo, an option to purchase 50 of the 70 shares owned by 
BigCo, BigCo will be deemed to be an affiliate of company A, and thus 
the applicant, until SmallCo actually exercises its options to purchase 
such shares. In order to prevent BigCo from circumventing the intent of 
the rule which requires such options

[[Page 273]]

to be considered on a fully diluted basis, the option is not considered 
to have present effect in this case.
    Example 3 for paragraph (l)(5). If company A has entered into an 
agreement to merge with company B in the future, the situation is 
treated as though the merger has taken place.

    (6) Affiliation under voting trusts.
    (i) Stock interests held in trust shall be deemed controlled by any 
person who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, to any person 
who has the sole power to sell such stock, and to any person who has the 
right to revoke the trust at will or to replace the trustee at will.
    (ii) If a trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business 
relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary, the stock interests held 
in trust will be deemed controlled by the grantor or beneficiary, as 
appropriate.
    (iii) If the primary purpose of a voting trust, or similar 
agreement, is to separate voting power from beneficial ownership of 
voting stock for the purpose of shifting control of or the power to 
control a concern in order that such concern or another concern may meet 
the Commission's size standards, such voting trust shall not be 
considered valid for this purpose regardless of whether it is or is not 
recognized within the appropriate jurisdiction.
    (7) Affiliation through common management. Affiliation generally 
arises where officers, directors, or key employees serve as the majority 
or otherwise as the controlling element of the board of directors and/or 
the management of another entity.
    (8) Affiliation through common facilities. Affiliation generally 
arises where one concern shares office space and/or employees and/or 
other facilities with another concern, particularly where such concerns 
are in the same or related industry or field of operations, or where 
such concerns were formerly affiliated, and through these sharing 
arrangements one concern has control, or potential control, of the other 
concern.
    (9) Affiliation through contractual relationships. Affiliation 
generally arises where one concern is dependent upon another concern for 
contracts and business to such a degree that one concern has control, or 
potential control, of the other concern.
    (10) Affiliation under joint venture arrangements.
    (i) A joint venture for size determination purposes is an 
association of concerns and/or individuals, with interests in any degree 
or proportion, formed by contract, express or implied, to engage in and 
carry out a single, specific business venture for joint profit for which 
purpose they combine their efforts, property, money, skill and 
knowledge, but not on a continuing or permanent basis for conducting 
business generally. The determination whether an entity is a joint 
venture is based upon the facts of the business operation, regardless of 
how the business operation may be designated by the parties involved. An 
agreement to share profits/losses proportionate to each party's 
contribution to the business operation is a significant factor in 
determining whether the business operation is a joint venture.
    (ii) The parties to a joint venture are considered to be affiliated 
with each other
    (11) For purposes of Secs. 24.709(a)(2) and paragraphs (b)(2) and 
(d) of this section, Indian tribes or Alaska Regional or Village 
Corporations organized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement 
Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), or entities owned and controlled by such 
tribes or corporations, are not considered affiliates of an applicant 
(or licensee) that is owned and controlled by such tribes, corporations 
or entities, and that otherwise complies with the requirements of 
Sec. 24.709 (b)(3) and (b)(5) or Sec. 24.709 (b)(4) and (b)(6), except 
that gross revenues derived from gaming activities conducted by 
affiliated entities pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 
U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) will be counted in determining such applicant's (or 
licensee's) compliance with the financial requirements of Sec. 24.709(a) 
and paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, unless such applicant 
establishes that it will not receive a substantial unfair competitive 
advantage because significant legal constraints restrict the applicant's 
ability to access such gross revenues.
    (m) Publicly Traded Corporation with Widely Dispersed Voting Power. 
A publicly traded corporation with widely dispersed voting power is a 
business entity

[[Page 274]]

organized under the laws of the United States:
    (1) Whose shares, debt, or other ownership interests are traded on 
an organized securities exchange within the United States;
    (2) In which no person
    (i) Owns more than 15 percent of the equity; or
    (ii) Possesses, directly or indirectly, through the ownership of 
voting securities, by contract or otherwise, the power to control the 
election of more than 15 percent of the members of the board of 
directors or other governing body of such publicly traded corporation; 
and
    (3) Over which no person other than the management and members of 
the board of directors or other governing body of such publicly traded 
corporation, in their capacities as such, has de facto control.
    (4) The term person shall be defined as in section 13(d) of the 
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (15 U.S.C. 78(m)), and 
shall also include investors that are commonly controlled under the 
indicia of control set forth in the definition of affiliate in 
paragraphs (1)(2) through (1) of this section.
    (n) Qualifying Investor; Qualifying Minority and/or Woman Investor.
    (1) A qualifying investor is a person who is (or holds an interest 
in) a member of the applicant's (or licensee's) control group and whose 
gross revenues and total assets, when aggregated with those of all other 
attributable investors and affiliates, do not exceed the gross revenues 
and total assets limits specified in Sec. 24.709(a), or, in the case of 
an applicant (or licensee) that is a small business, do not exceed the 
gross revenues limit specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) A qualifying minority and/or woman investor is a person who is a 
qualifying investor under paragraph (n)(1), who is (or holds an interest 
in) a member of the applicant's (or licensee's) control group and who is 
a member of a minority group or a woman and a United States citizen.
    (3) For purposes of assessing compliance with the minimum equity 
requirements of Sec. 24.709(b) (5) and (6), where such equity interests 
are not held directly in the applicant, interests held by qualifying 
investors or qualifying minority and/or woman investors shall be 
determined by successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for 
each link in the vertical ownership chain.
    (4) For purposes of Sec. 24.709 (b)(5)(i)(C) and (b)(6)(i)(C), a 
qualifying investor is a person who is (or holds an interest in) a 
member of the applicant's (or licensee's) control group and whose gross 
revenues and total assets do not exceed the gross revenues and total 
assets limits specified in Sec. 24.709(a).
    (o) Preexisting entity; Existing investor. A preexisting entity is 
an entity that was operating and earning revenues for at least two years 
prior to December 31, 1994. An existing investor is a person or entity 
that was an owner of record of a preexisting entity's equity as of 
November 10, 1994, and any person or entity acquiring de minimus equity 
holdings in a preexisting entity after that date.

    Note: In applying the term existing investor to de minimus interests 
in preexisting entities obtained or increased after November 10, 1994, 
the Commission will scrutinize any significant restructuring of the 
preexisting entity that occurs after that date and will presume that any 
change of equity that is five percent or less of the preexisting 
entity's total equity is de minimis. The burden is on the applicant (or 
licensee) to demonstrate that changes that exceed five percent are not 
significant.

licenses, five percent or more of whose stock, warrants, options or debt 
securities are owned by the applicant or an officer, director, 
attributable stockholder or key management personnel of the applicant. 
This list must include a description of each such business' principal 
business and a description of each such business' relationship to the 
applicant.
    (2) A list of any party which holds a five percent or more interest 
(or a ten percent or more interest for institutional investors as 
defined in Sec. 24.720(h)) in the applicant, or any entity holding or 
applying for CMRS or PMRS licenses in which a five percent or more 
interest (or a ten percent or more interest for institutional investors 
as defined in Sec. 24.720(h)) is held by another party which holds a 
five percent or more interest (or a ten percent or more interest for 
institutional investors as defined in Sec. 24.720(h)) in the applicant 
(e.g. If Company A owns 5% of Company B (the applicant) and 5% of 
Company C, a company holding or applying for CMRS or PMRS licenses, then 
Companies A and C must be listed on Company B's applications.)
    (3) A list of the names, addresses, citizenship and principal 
business of any person holding five percent or more of each class of 
stock, warrants, options or debt securities together with the amount and 
percentage held, and the name, address, citizenship and principal place 
of business of any person on whose account, if other than the holder, 
such interest is held. If any of these persons are related by blood or 
marriage, include such relationship in the statement.
    (4) In the case of partnerships, the name and address of each 
partner, each partner's citizenship and the share or interest 
participation in the partnership. This information must be provided for 
all partners, regardless of their respective ownership interest in the 
partnership.
    (b) Each application for a broadband PCS license must:
    (1) Submit the information required by the Commission's Rules, 
requests and application forms;
    (2) Be maintained by the applicant substantially accurate and 
complete in all significant respects in accordance

[[Page 278]]

with the provisions of Sec. 1.65 of this chapter.
    (3) Show compliance with and make all special showings that may be 
applicable;
    (c) Where documents, exhibits, or other lengthy showings already on 
file with the Commission contain information which is required by an 
application form, the application may specifically refer to such 
information, if:
    (1) The information previously filed is over one A4 (21 cm x 29.7 
cm) or 8.5 x 11 inch (21.6 cm x 27.9 cm) page in length, and all 
information referenced therein is current and accurate in all 
significant respects under Sec. 1.65 of this chapter; and
    (2) The reference states specifically where the previously filed 
information can actually be found, including mention of:
    (i) The station call sign or application file number whenever the 
reference is to station files or previously filed applications; and
    (ii) The title of the proceeding, the docket number, and any legal 
citations, whenever the reference is to a docketed proceeding.

However, question on an application form which call for specific 
technical data, or which can be answered by a ``yes'' or ``no'' or other 
short answer shall be answered as appropriate and shall not be cross-
referenced to a previous filing.
    (d) In addition to the general application requirements of Subpart F 
and Secs. 1.2105 of this Chapter, 24.813 and 24.815, applicants shall 
submit any additional documents, exhibits, or signed written statements 
of fact:
    (1) As may be required by these rules; and
    (2) As the Commission, at any time after the filing of an 
application and during the term of any authorization, may require from 
any applicant, permittee or licensee to enable it to determine whether a 
radio authorization should be granted, denied or revoked.
    (e) Except when the Commission has declared explicitly to the 
contrary, an informational requirement does not in itself imply the 
processing treatment of decisional weight to be accorded the response.
    (f) All applicants (except applicants filing FCC Form 175) are 
required to indicate at the time their application is filed whether or 
not a Commission grant of the application may have a significant 
environmental impact as defined by Sec. 1.1307 of this Chapter. If 
answered affirmatively, the requisite environmental assessment as 
prescribed in Sec. 1.1311 of this Chapter must be filed with the 
application and Commission environmental review must be completed prior 
to construction. See Sec. 1.1312 of this chapter. All broadband PCS 
licensees are subject to continuing obligation to determine whether 
subsequent construction may have a significant environmental impact 
prior to undertaking such construction and to otherwise comply with 
Sec. 1.1301 through 1.1319 of this Chapter. See Sec. 1.1312 of this 
Chapter.

Sec. 24.815  Technical content of applications; maintenance of list of station locations.

    (a) All applications required by this part shall contain all 
technical information required by the application forms or associated 
Public Notice(s). Applications other than initial applications for a 
broadband PCS license must also comply with all technical requirements 
of the rules governing the broadband PC (see Subparts C and E of this 
Part as appropriate). The following paragraphs describe a number of 
general technical requirements.
    (b) Each application (except applications for initial licenses filed 
on Form 175) for a license for broadband PCS must comply with the 
provisions of Secs. 24.229-24.238 of the Commission's Rules.
    (c)-(i) [Reserved]
    (j) The location of the transmitting antenna shall be considered to 
be the station location. Broadband PCS licensees must maintain a current 
list of all station locations, which must describe the transmitting

number, landmark, or the equivalent. All such coordinates shall be 
specified in terms of degrees, minutes, and seconds to the nearest 
second of latitude and longitude.
Secs. 24.816--24.818  [Reserved]


<R05>
24.819  Waiver of rules.

    (a) Requests for waiver.
    (1) A waiver of these rules may be granted upon application or by 
the Commission on its own motion. Requests for waivers shall contain a 
statement of reason sufficient to justify a waiver. Waivers will not be 
granted except upon an affirmative showing:
    (i) That the underlying purpose of the rule will not be served, or 
would be frustrated, by its application in a particular case, and that 
grant of the waiver is otherwise in the public interest; or
    (ii) That the unique facts and circumstances of a particular case 
render application of the rule inequitable, unduly burdensome or 
otherwise contrary to the public interest. Applicants must also show the 
lack of a reasonable alternative.
    (2) If the information necessary to support a waiver request is 
already on file, the applicant may cross-reference to the specific 
filing where it may be found.
    (b) Denial of waiver, alternate showing required. If a waiver is not 
granted, the application will be dismissed as defective unless the 
applicant has also provided an alternative proposal which complies with 
the Commission's rules (including any required showings).


<R05>
Sec. 24.820  Defective applications.

    (a) Unless the Commission shall otherwise permit, an application 
will be unacceptable for filing and will be returned to the applicant 
with a brief statement as to the omissions or discrepancies if:
    (1) The application is defective with respect to completeness of 
answers to questions, informational showings, execution or other matters 
of a formal character; or
    (2) The application does not comply with the Commission's rules, 
regulations, specific requirements for additional information or other 
requirements. See also Sec. 1.2105 of this Chapter.
    (b) Some examples of common deficiencies which result in defective 
applications under paragraph (a) of this section are:
    (1) The application is not filled out completely and signed;
    (2)-(4) [Reserved]
    (5) The application (other an application filed on FCC Form 175) 
does not include an environmental assessment as required for an action 
that may have a significant impact upon the environment, as defined in 
Sec. 1.1307 of this chapter.
    (6) [Reserved]
    (7) The application is filed prior to the Public Notice issued under 
Sec. 24.705, announcing the application filing date for the relevant 
auction or after the cutoff date prescribed in that Public Notice.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) If an applicant is requested by the Commission to file any 
documents or any supplementary or explanatory information not 
specifically required in the prescribed application form, a failure to 
comply with such request within a specified time period will be deemed 
to render the application defective and will subject it to dismissal.


<R05>
Sec. 24.821  Inconsistent or conflicting applications.

    While an application is pending and undecided, no subsequent 
inconsistent or conflicting application may be filed by the same 
applicant, its successor or assignee, or on behalf or for the benefit of 
the same applicant, its successor or assignee.


<R05>
Sec. 24.822  Amendment of application to participate in auction for licenses in the broadband Personal Communications Services filed on FCC Form 175.

    (a) The Commission will provide bidders a limited opportunity to 
cure defects in FCC Form 175 specified herein except for failure to sign 
the application and to make certifications, defects which may not be 
cured. See also Sec. 1.2105 of this Chapter.
    (b) In broadband PCS, applicants will be permitted to amend their 
Form 175

[[Page 280]]

applications to make minor amendments to correct minor errors or defects 
such as typographical errors. Applicants will also be permitted to amend 
FCC Form 175 to make changes to the information required by 
Sec. 24.813(a) (such as ownership changes or changes in the 
identification of parties to bidding consortia), provided such changes 
do not result in a change in control of the applicant and do not involve 
another applicant (or parties in interest to an applicant) who has 
applied for licenses in any of the same geographic license areas as the 
applicant. Amendments which change control of the applicant will be 
considered major amendments. An FCC Form 175 which is amended by a major 
amendment will be considered to be newly filed and cannot be resubmitted 
after applicable filing deadlines. See also Sec. 1.2105 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 24.823  Amendment of applications for licenses in the broadband Personal Communications Services (other than applications filed on FCC Form 175).

    (a) Amendments as of right. A pending application may be amended as 
a matter of right if the application has not been designated for 
hearing.
    (1) Amendments shall comply with Sec. 24.829, as applicable; and
    (2) Amendments which resolve interference conflicts or amendments 
under Sec. 24.829 may be filed at any time.
    (b) The Commission or the presiding officer may grant requests to 
amend an application designated for hearing only if a written petition 
demonstrating good cause is submitted and properly served upon the 
parties of record.
    (c) Major amendments, minor amendments. The Commission will classify 
all amendments as minor except in the cases listed below. An amendment 
shall be deemed to be a major amendment subject to Sec. 24.827 if it 
proposes a substantial change in ownership or control.
    (d) If a petition to deny (or other formal objection) has been 
filed, any amendment, request for waiver or other written communication 
shall be served on the petitioner, unless waiver of this requirement is 
granted pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. See also Sec. 1.2108 
of this Chapter.
    (e) The Commission may waive the service requirements of paragraph 
(d) of this section and prescribe such alternative procedures as may be 
appropriate under the circumstances to protect petitioners' interests 
and to avoid undue delay in a proceeding, if an applicant submits a 
request for waiver which demonstrates that the service requirement is 
unreasonably burdensome.
    (f) Any amendment to an application shall be signed and shall be 
submitted in the same manner, and with the same number of copies, as was 
the original application. Amendments may be made in letter form if they 
comply in all other respects with the requirements of this chapter.
    (g) An application will be considered to be a newly-filed 
application if it is amended by a major amendment (as defined in this 
section), except in the following circumstances:
    (1)-(2) [Reserved]
    (3) The amendment reflects only a change in ownership or control 
found by the Commission to be in the public interest;
    (4) [Reserved]
    (5) The amendment corrects typographical transcription or similar 
clerical errors which are clearly demonstrated to be mistakes by 
reference to other parts of the application, and whose discovery does 
not create new or increased frequency conflicts.
Sec. 24.824  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 24.825  Application for temporary authorizations.

    (a) In circumstances requiring immediate or temporary use of 
facilities, request may be made for special temporary authority to 
install and/or operate new or modified equipment. Any such request may 
be submitted as an informal application in the manner set forth in 
Sec. 24.805 and must contain full particulars as to the proposed 
operation including all facts sufficient to justify the temporary 
authority sought and the public interest therein. No such request will 
be considered unless

[[Page 281]]

the request is received by the Commission at least 10 days prior to the 
date of proposed construction or operation or, where an extension is 
sought, at least 10 days prior to the expiration date of the existing 
temporary authorization. The Commission may accept a late-filed request 
upon due showing of sufficient reasons for the delay in submitting such 
request.
    (b) Special temporary authorizations may be granted without regard 
to the 30-day public notice requirements of Sec. 24.827(b) when:
    (1) The authorization is for a period not to exceed 30 days and no 
application for regular operation is contemplated to be filed;
    (2) The authorization is for a period not to exceed 60 days pending 
the filing of an application for such regular operation;
    (3) The authorization is to permit interim operation to facilitate 
completion of authorized construction or to provide substantially the 
same service as previously authorized; or
    (4) The authorization is made upon a finding that there are 
extraordinary circumstances requiring operation in the public interest 
and that delay in the institution of such service would seriously 
prejudice the public interest.
    (c) Temporary authorizations of operation not to exceed 180 days may 
be granted under the standards of Section 309(f) of the Communications 
Act where extraordinary circumstances so require. Extensions of the 
temporary authorization for a period of 180 days each may also be 
granted, but the applicant bears a heavy burden to show that 
extraordinary circumstances warrant such an extension.
    (d) In cases of emergency found by the Commission, involving danger 
to life or property or due to damage of equipment, or during a national 
emergency proclaimed by the president or declared by the Congress or 
during the continuance of any war in which the United States is engaged 
and when such action is necessary for the national defense or safety or 
otherwise in furtherance of the war effort, or in cases of emergency 
where the Commission finds that it would not be feasible to secure 
renewal applications from existing licensees or otherwise to follow 
normal licensing procedure, the Commission will grant radio station 
authorizations and station licenses, or modifications or renewals 
thereof, during the emergency found by the Commission or during the 
continuance of any such national emergency or war, as special temporary 
licenses, only for the period of emergency or war requiring such action, 
without the filing of formal applications.


<R05>
Sec. 24.826  Receipt of application; Applications in the broadband Personal Communications Services filed on FCC Form 175 and other applications in the 
          broadband Personal Communications Services.

    (a) All applications for the initial provision of broadband PCS must 
be submitted on FCC Forms 175 and 175-S. Mutually exclusive initial 
applications in the broadband Personal Communications Services are 
subject to competitive bidding. FCC Form 600 (``Application for New or 
Modified Common Carrier Radio Station Under Part 22'') must be submitted 
by each winning bidder for each broadband PCS license for which 
application was made on FCC Form 175. In the event that mutual 
exclusivity does not exist between applicants for a broadband PCS 
license that have filed FCC Form 175, the sole applicant will be 
required to file FCC Form 401. The aforementioned Forms 175, 175-S, and 
401 are subject to the provisions of 47 CFR Part 1, Subpart Q 
(``Competitive Bidding Proceedings'') and Subpart H of this Part. 
Blanket licenses are granted for each market frequency block. 
Applications for individual sites are not needed and will not be 
accepted. See Sec. 24.11.
    (b) Applications received for filing are given a file number. The 
assignment of a file number to an application is merely for 
administrative convenience and does not indicate the acceptance of the 
application for filing and processing. Such assignment of a file number 
will not preclude the subsequent return or dismissal of the application 
if it is found to be not in accordance with the Commission's Rules.
    (c) Acceptance of an application for filing merely means that it has 
been the subject of a preliminary review as to completeness. Such 
acceptance will not preclude the subsequent return or

[[Page 282]]

dismissal of the application if it is found to be defective or not in 
accordance with the Commission's rules. (See Sec. 24.813 for additional 
information concerning the filing of applications.)

[59 FR 37610, July 22, 1994, as amended at 59 FR 59957, Nov. 21, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 24.827  Public notice period.

    (a) At regular intervals, the Commission will issue a public notice 
listing:
    (1) The acceptance for filing of all applications and major 
amendments thereto;
    (2) Significant Commission actions concerning applications listed as 
acceptable for filing;
    (3) Information which the Commission in its discretion believes of 
public significance. Such notices are intended solely for the purpose of 
informing the public and do not create any rights in an applicant or any 
other person.
    (4) Special environmental considerations as required by Part 1 of 
this chapter.
    (b) The Commission will not grant any application until expiration 
of a period of thirty (30) days following the issuance date of a public 
notice listing the application, or any major amendments thereto, as 
acceptable for filing; provided, however, that the Commission will not 
grant an application filed on Form 600 filed either by a winning bidder 
or by an applicant whom Form 175 application is not mutually exclusive 
with other applicants, until the expiration of a period of forty (40) 
days following the issuance of a public notice listing the application, 
or any major amendments thereto, as acceptable filing. See also 
Sec. 1.2108 of this Chapter.
    (c) As an exception to paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) and (b) of this 
section, the public notice provisions are not applicable to 
applications:
    (1) For authorization of a minor technical change in the facilities 
of an authorized station where such a change would not be classified as 
a major amendment (as defined by Sec. 24.823) were such a change to be 
submitted as an amendment to a pending application;
    (2) For issuance of a license subsequent to a radio station 
authorization or, pending application for a grant of such license, any 
special or temporary authorization to permit interim operation to 
facilitate completion of authorized construction or to provide 
substantially the same service as would be authorized by such license;
    (3) For extension of time to complete construction of authorized 
facilities (see Sec. 24.203;
    (4) For temporary authorization pursuant to Sec. 24.825(b);
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) For an authorization under any of the proviso clauses of Section 
308(a) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 308(a));
    (7) For consent to an involuntary assignment or transfer of control 
of a radio authorization; or
    (8) For consent to a voluntary assignment or transfer of control of 
a radio authorization, where the assignment or transfer does not involve 
a substantial change in ownership or control.

<R05>
Sec. 24.828  Dismissal and return of applications.

    (a) Except as provided under Sec. 24.829, any application may be 
dismissed without prejudice as a matter of right if the applicant 
requests its dismissal prior to designation for hearing or, in the case 
of applications filed on Forms 175 and 175-S, prior to auction. An 
applicant's request for the return of his application after it has been 
accepted for filing will be considered to be a request for dismissal 
without prejudice. Applicants requesting dismissal of their applications 
may be subject to penalties contained in Sec. 1.2104 of this Chapter. 
Requests for dismissal shall comply with the provisions of Sec. 24.829 
as appropriate.
    (b) A request to dismiss an application without prejudice will be 
considered after designation for hearing only if:
    (1) A written petition is submitted to the Commission and is 
properly served upon all parties of record, and
    (2) The petition complies with the provisions of Sec. 24.829 
(whenever applicable) and demonstrates good cause.
    (c) The Commission will dismiss an application for failure to 
prosecute or for failure to respond substantially

[[Page 283]]

within a specified time period to official correspondence or requests 
for additional information. Dismissal shall be without prejudice if made 
prior to designation for hearing or prior to auction, but dismissal may 
be made with prejudice for unsatisfactory compliance with Sec. 24.829 or 
after designation for hearing or after the applicant is notified that it 
is the winning bidder under the auction process.


<R05>
Sec. 24.829  Ownership changes and agreements to amend or to dismiss applications or pleadings.

    (a) Applicability. Subject to the provisions of Sec. 1.2105 of this 
Chapter (Bidding Application and Certification Procedures; Prohibition 
of Collusion), this section applies to applicants and all other parties 
interested in pending applications who wish to resolve contested matters 
among themselves with a formal or an informal agreement or 
understanding. This section applies only when the agreement or 
understanding will result in:
    (1) A major change in the ownership of an applicant to which 
Secs. 24.823(c) and 24.823(g) apply or which would cause the applicant 
to lose its status as a designated entity under Sec. 24.709, or
    (2) The individual or mutual withdrawal, amendment or dismissal of 
any pending application amendment, petition or other pleading.
    (b) The provisions of Sec. 22.927 of the Commission's Rules will 
apply in the event of the filing of petitions to deny or other pleadings 
or informal objections filed against broadband PCS applications. The 
provisions of Sec. 22.928 of the Commission's Rules will apply in the 
event of dismissal of broadband PCS applications. The provisions of 
Sec. 22.929 of the Commission's Rules will apply in the event of threats 
to file petitions to deny or other pleadings or informal objections 
against broadband PCS applications.

<R05>
Sec. 24.830  Opposition to applications.

    (a) Petitions to deny (including petitions for other forms of 
relief) and responsive pleadings for Commission consideration must 
comply with Sec. 1.2108 of this Chapter and must:
    (1) Identify the application or applications (including applicant's 
name, station location, Commission file numbers and radio service 
involved) with which it is concerned;
    (2) Be filed in accordance with the pleading limitations, filing 
periods, and other applicable provisions of Secs. 1.41 through 1.52 of 
this Chapter except where otherwise provided in Sec. 1.2108 of this 
Chapter;
    (3) Contain specific allegations of fact which, except for facts of 
which official notice may be taken, shall be supported by affidavit of a 
person or persons with personal knowledge thereof, and which shall be 
sufficient to demonstrate that the petitioner (or respondent) is a party 
in interest and that a grant of, or other Commission action regarding, 
the application would be prima facie inconsistent with the public 
interest;
    (4) Be filed within thirty (30) days after the date of public notice 
announcing the acceptance for filing of any such application or major 
amendment thereto (unless the Commission otherwise extends the filing 
deadline); and
    (5) Contain a certificate of service showing that it has been mailed 
to the applicant no later than the date of filing thereof with the 
Commission.
    (b) A petition to deny a major amendment to a previously-filed 
application may only raise matters directly related to the amendment 
which could not have been raised in connection with the underlying 
previously-filed application. This subsection does not apply, however, 
to petitioners who gain standing because of the major amendment.


<R05>
Sec. 24.831  Mutually exclusive applications.

    (a) The Commission will consider applications for broadband PCS 
licenses to be mutually exclusive if they relate to the same 
geographical boundaries (MTA or BTA) and are timely filed for the same 
frequency block.
    (b) Mutually exclusive applications filed on Form 175 for the 
initial provision of broadband PCS are subject to competitive bidding in 
accordance with the procedures in Subpart H of this part and in Part 1, 
Subpart Q of this Chapter.

[[Page 284]]

    (c) An application will be entitled to comparative consideration 
with one or more conflicting applications only if the Commission 
determines that such comparative consideration will serve the public 
interest.
    (d)-(j) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 24.832  Consideration of applications.

    (a) Applications for an instrument of authorization will be granted 
if, upon examination of the application and upon consideration of such 
other matters as it may officially notice, the Commission finds that the 
grant will serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. See 
also Sec. 1.2108 of this Chapter.
    (b) The grant shall be without a formal hearing if, upon 
consideration of the application, any pleadings or objections filed, or 
other matters which may be officially noticed, the Commission finds 
that:
    (1) The application is acceptable for filing and is in accordance 
with the Commission's rules, regulations and other requirements;
    (2) The application is not subject to a post-auction hearing or to 
comparative consideration pursuant to Sec. 24.831 with another 
application(s);
    (3) A grant of the application would not cause harmful electrical 
interference to an authorized station;
    (4) There are no substantial and material questions of fact 
presented; and
    (5) The applicant is qualified under current FCC regulations and 
policies.
    (c) If the Commission should grant without a formal hearing an 
application for an instrument of authorization which is subject to a 
petition to deny filed in accordance with Sec. 24.830, the Commission 
will deny the petition by the issuance of a Memorandum Opinion and Order 
which will concisely state the reasons for the denial and dispose of all 
substantial issues raised by the petition.
    (d) Whenever the Commission, without a formal hearing, grants any 
application in part, or subject to any terms or conditions other than 
those normally applied to applications of the same type, it shall inform 
the applicant of the reasons therefor, and the grant shall be considered 
final unless the Commission revises its action (either by granting the 
application as originally requested, or by designating the application 
for a formal evidentiary hearing) in response to a petition for 
reconsideration which:
    (1) Is filed by the applicant within thirty (30) days from the date 
of the letter or order giving the reasons for the partial or conditioned 
grant;
    (2) Rejects the grant as made and explains the reasons why the 
application should be granted as originally requested; and
    (3) Returns the instrument of authorization.
    (e) The Commission will designate an application for a formal 
hearing, specifying with particularity the matters and things in issue, 
if upon consideration of the application, any pleadings or objections 
filed or other matters which may be officially noticed, the Commission 
determines that:
    (1) A substantial and material question of fact is presented (see 
also Sec. 1.2108 of this Chapter);
    (2) The Commission is unable for any reason to make the findings 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section and the application is 
acceptable for filing, complete and in accordance with the Commission's 
rules, regulations and other requirements; or
    (3) The application is entitled to comparative consideration (under 
Sec. 24.831) with another application (or applications).
    (f) The Commission may grant, deny or take other action with respect 
to an application designated for a formal hearing pursuant to paragraph 
(e) of this section or Part 1 of this Chapter.
    (g) [Reserved]
    (h) Reconsideration or review of any final action taken by the

    Any parties sharing a common non-controlling ownership interest who 
aggregate more PCS spectrum among them than a single entity is entitled 
to hold (See Secs. 20.6(e), 24.710, 24.204, 24.229(c) of this chapter) 
will be permitted to divest sufficient properties within 90 days of the 
license grant to come into compliance with the spectrum aggregation 
limits as follows:

[[Page 285]]

    (a) The broadband PCS applicant shall submit a signed statement with 
its long-form application stating that sufficient properties will be 
divested within 90 days of the license grant. If the licensee is 
otherwise qualified, the Commission will grant the applications subject 
to a condition that the licensee come into compliance with the PCS 
spectrum aggregation limits within 90 days of grant.
    (b) Within 90 days of license grant, the licensee must certify that 
the applicant and all parties to the application have come into 
compliance with the PCS spectrum aggregation limits. If the licensee 
fails to submit the certification within 90 days, the Commission will 
immediately cancel all broadband PCS licenses won by the applicant, 
impose the default penalty and, based on the facts presented, take any 
other action it may deem appropriate. Divestiture may be to an interim 
trustee if a buyer has not been secured in the required time frame, as 
long as the applicant has no interest in or control of the trustee, and 
the trustee may dispose of the property as it sees fit. In no event may 
the trustee retain the property for longer than six months from grant of 
license.

application for renewal has been filed.
    (2) If no application for renewal has been made before the 
authorization's expiration date, a late application for renewal will be 
considered only if it is filed within thirty (30) days of the expiration 
date and shows that the failure to file a timely application was due to 
causes beyond the applicant's control. During this 30-day period, a 
reinstatement application must be filed on FCC Form 489. Service to 
subscribers need not be suspended while a late-filed renewal application 
is pending, but such service shall be without prejudice to Commission 
action on the renewal application and any related sanctions. See also

<R05>
Sec. 25.103   Definitions.

    (a) Communications common carrier. The term ``communications common 
carrier'' as used in this part means any person (individual, 
partnership, association, joint-stock company, trust, corporation, or 
other entity) engaged as a common carrier for hire, in interstate or 
foreign communication by wire or radio or in interstate or foreign radio 
transmission of energy, including such carriers as are described in 
subsection 2(b) (2) and (3) of the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended, and, in addition, for purposes of Subpart H of this part, 
includes any individual, partnership, association, joint-stock company, 
trust, corporation, or other entity which owns or controls, directly or 
indirectly, or is under direct or indirect common control with, any such 
carrier.
    (b) Authorized carrier. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section, the term ``authorized carrier'' means a communications 
common carrier which is authorized by the Federal Communications 
Commission under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, to provide 
services by means of communications satellites.
    (2) For the purposes of Subpart H of this part, the term 
``authorized carrier'' means a communications common carrier which is 
specifically authorized or which is a member of a class of carriers 
authorized by the Commission to own shares of stock in the corporation.
    (c) Communications satellite corporation. (1) The terms 
``communications satellite corporation'' or ``corporation'' as used in 
this part mean the corporation created pursuant to the provisions of 
Title III of the Communications Satellite Act of 1962.
    (2) The corporation shall be deemed to be a common carrier within 
the meaning of section 3(h) of the Communications Satellite Act of 1962.
    (d) Communication-satellite earth station complex. The term 
communication-

[[Page 289]]

satellite earth station complex includes transmitters, receivers, and 
communications antennas at the earth station site together with the 
interconnecting terrestrial facilities (cables, lines, or microwave 
facilities) and modulating and demodulating equipment necessary for 
processing of traffic received from the terrestrial distribution 
system(s) prior to transmission via satellite and of traffic received 
from the satellite prior to transfer of channels of communication to 
terrestrial distribution system(s).
    (e) Communication-satellite earth station complex functions. The 
communication-satellite earth station complex interconnects with 
terminal equipment of common carriers or authorized entities at the 
interface; accepts traffic from such entities at the interface, 
processes for transmission via satellite and performs the transmission 
function; receives traffic from a satellite or satellites, processes it 
in a form necessary to deliver channels of communication to terrestrial 
common carriers or such other authorized entities and delivers the 
processed traffic to such entities at the interface.
    (f) Interface. The point of interconnection between two distinct but 
adjacent communications systems having different functions. The 
interface in the communication-satellite service is that point where 
communications terminal equipment of the terrestrial common carriers or 
other authorized entities interconnects with the terminal equipment of 
the communication-satellite earth station complex. The interface in the 
communication-satellite service shall be located at the earth station 
site, or if this is impracticable, as close thereto as possible.

<R05>
Sec. 25.104  Preemption of local zoning of earth stations.

    (a) Any state or local zoning, land-use, building, or similar 
regulation that materially limits transmission or reception by satellite 
earth station antennas, or imposes more than minimal costs on users of 
such antennas, is preempted unless the promulgating authority can 
demonstrate that such regulation is reasonable, except that nonfederal 
regulation of radio frequency emissions is not preempted by this 
section. For purposes of this paragraph (a), reasonable means that the 
local regulation:
    (1) Has a clearly defined health, safety, or aesthetic objective 
that is stated in the text of the regulation itself; and
    (2) Furthers the stated health, safety or aesthetic objective 
without unnecessarily burdening the federal interests in ensuring access 
to satellite services and in promoting fair and effective competition 
among competing communications service providers.
    (b)(1) Any state or local zoning, land-use, building, or similar 
regulation that affects the installation, maintenance, or use of a 
satellite earth station antenna that is two meters or less in diameter 
and is located or proposed to be located in any area where commercial or 
industrial uses are generally permitted by non-federal land-use 
regulation shall be presumed unreasonable and is therefore preempted 
subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. No civil, criminal, 
administrative, or other legal action of any kind shall be taken to 
enforce any regulation covered by this presumption unless the 
promulgating authority has obtained a waiver from the Commission 
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, or a final declaration from 
the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction that the presumption 
has been rebutted pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (2) Any presumption arising from paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
may be rebutted upon a showing that the regulation in question:

    (i) Is necessary to accomplish a clearly defined health or safety 
objective that is stated in the text of the regulation itself;
    (ii) Is no more burdensome to satellite users than is necessary to 
achieve the health or safety objective; and
    (iii) Is specifically applicable on its face to antennas of the 
class described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

    (c) Any person aggrieved by the application or potential application 
of a state or local zoning or other regulation in violation of paragraph 
(a) of this section may, after exhausting all nonfederal administrative 
remedies,

[[Page 290]]

file a petition with the Commission requesting a declaration that the 
state or local regulation in question is preempted by this section. 
Nonfederal administrative remedies, which do not include judicial 
appeals of administrative determinations, shall be deemed exhausted 
when:

    (1) The petitioner's application for a permit or other authorization 
required by the state or local authority has been denied and any 
administrative appeal and variance procedure has been exhausted;
    (2) The petitioner's application for a permit or other authorization 
required by the state or local authority has been on file for ninety 
days without final action;
    (3) The petitioner has received a permit or other authorization 
required by the state or local authority that is conditioned upon the 
petitioner's expenditure of a sum of money, including costs required to 
screen, pole-mount, or otherwise specially install the antenna, greater 
than the aggregate purchase or total lease cost of the equipment as 
normally installed; or
    (4) A state or local authority has notified the petitioner of 
impending civil or criminal action in a court of law and there are no 
more nonfederal administrative steps to be taken.

    (d) Procedures regarding filing of petitions requesting declaratory 
rulings and other related pleadings will be set forth in subsequent 
Public Notices. All allegations of fact contained in petitions and 
related pleadings must be supported by affidavit of a person or persons 
with personal knowledge thereof.
    (e) Any state or local authority that wishes to maintain and enforce 
zoning or other regulations inconsistent with this section may apply to 
the Commission for a full or partial waiver of this section. Such 
waivers may be granted by the Commission in its sole discretion, upon a 
showing by the applicant that local concerns of a highly specialized or 
unusual nature create a necessity for regulation inconsistent with this 
section. No application for waiver shall be considered unless it 
specifically sets forth the particular regulation for which waiver is 
sought. Waivers granted in accordance with this section shall not apply 
to later-enacted or amended regulations by the local authority unless 
the Commission expressly orders otherwise.
    (f) a satellite earth station antenna that is designed to receive 
direct broadcast satellite service, including direct-to-home satellite 
services, that is one meter or less in diameter or is located in Alaska 
is covered by the regulations in Sec. 1.4000 of this chapter.

    Effective Date Note:  At 61 FR 46562, Sept. 4, 1996, Sec. 25.104 was 
amended by revising paragraph (b)(1) and adding paragraph (f). These 
paragraphs contain information collection and recordkeeping requirements 
and will not become effective until approval has been given by the 
Office of Management and Budget.


<R05>
Sec. 25.104  Preemption of local zoning of earth stations.

    State and local zoning or other regulations that differentiate 
between satellite receive-only antennas and other types of antenna 
facilities are preempted unless such regulations:
    (a) Have a reasonable and clearly defined health, safety or 
aesthetic objective; and
    (b) Do not operate to impose unreasonable limitations on, or 
prevent, reception of satellite delivered signals by receive-only 
antennas or to impose costs on the users of such antennas that are 
excessive in light of the purchase and installation cost of the 
equipment.

Regulation of satellite transmitting antennas is preempted in the same 
manner except that state and local health and safety regulation is not 
preempted.

Sec. 25.111  Additional information.

    (a) The Commission may request from any party at any time additional 
information concerning any application, or any other submission or 
pleading regarding an application, filed under this part.
    (b) Applicants, permittees and licensees of radio stations governed 
by this part shall provide the Commission with all information it 
requires for the Advance Publication, coordination and notification of 
frequency assignments pursuant to the international Radio Regulations 
and consultations required by Article XIV of the INTELSAT Agreement and 
Article 8 of the INMARSAT Convention. This information includes, but is 
not limited to, that specified in appendices 3 and 4 of the Radio 
Regulations (Geneva 1979). No protection from interference caused by 
radio stations authorized by other Administrations is guaranteed unless 
coordination procedures are timely completed or, with respect to 
individual administrations, by successfully completing coordination 
agreements. Any radio station authorization for which coordination has 
not been completed may be subject to additional terms and conditions as 
required to effect coordination of the frequency assignments with other 
Administrations.


<R05>
Sec. 25.112  Defective applications.

    (a) An application will be unacceptable for filing and will be 
returned to the applicant with a brief statement identifying the 
omissions or discrepancies if:
    (1) The application is defective with respect to completeness of 
answers to questions, informational showings, internal inconsistencies, 
execution, or other matters of a formal character; or
    (2) The application does not substantially comply with the 
Commission's rules, regulations, specific requests for additional 
information, or other requirements.
    (b) Applications considered defective under paragraph (a) of this 
section may be accepted for filing if:
    (1) The application is accompanied by a request which sets forth the 
reasons in support of a waiver of (or an exception to), in whole or in 
part, any specific rule, regulation, or requirement with which the 
application is in conflict;

[[Page 292]]

    (2) The Commission, upon its own motion, waives (or allows an 
exception to), in whole or in part, any rule, regulation or requirement.
    (c) If an applicant is requested by the Commission to file any 
additional information or any supplementary or explanatory information 
not specifically required in the prescribed application form or these 
rules, a failure to comply with the request within a specified time 
period will be deemed to render the application defective and will 
subject it to dismissal.


<R05>
Sec. 25.113  Construction permits.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section or in 
Sec. 25.131, construction permits must be obtained for all fixed or 
temporary fixed earth stations and for all space station facilities 
governed by this Part. Simultaneous application for a construction 
permit and station license may be made for all earth station and space 
station facilities governed by this Part.
    (b) Construction permits are not required for satellite earth 
stations that operate with INTELSAT or INMARSAT space stations, or for 
earth stations that operate with U.S.-licensed space stations. 
Construction of such stations may commence prior to grant of a license 
at the applicant's own risk. Applicants must comply with the provisions 
of Sec. 1.1312 of this chapter relating to environmental processing 
prior to commencing construction. A simultaneous application for a 
construction permit and station license may be made for all earth 
station and space station facilities governed by this part.
    (c) FAA notification. Before the construction of new antenna 
structures or alteration in the height of existing antenna structures is 
authorized by the FCC, a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
determination of ``no hazard'' may be required. To apply for this 
determination, the FAA must be notified of the planned construction. 
Criteria used to determine whether FAA notification is required for a 
particular antenna structure are contained in part 17 of this chapter. 
Applications proposing construction of one or more new antenna 
structures or alteration of the overall height of one or more existing 
antenna structures, where FAA notification prior to such construction or 
alteration is not required by part 17 of this chapter, must indicate 
such and, unless the reason is obvious (e.g. structure height is less 
than 6.10 meters AGL) must contain a statement explaining why FAA 
notification is not required.
    (d) In addition to the construction permit required by paragraph (a) 
of this section, a launch authorization must be applied for and granted 
before a space station may be launched and operated in orbit. Request 
for launch and operation authorization and station license may be 
included in the application for space station construction permit. A 
launch authorization and station license may also be requested at any 
time for a space station constructed as an on-ground spare satellite. 
However, an application for authority to launch and operate an on-ground 
spare satellite will be considered to be a newly filed application for 
cut-off purposes, except where the space station to be launched is 
determined to be an emergency replacement for a previously authorized 
space station which has been lost as a result of a launch failure or a 
catastrophic in-orbit failure.
    (e) Antenna Structure Registration Number. Applications proposing 
construction of one or more new antenna structures or alteration of the 
overall height of one or more existing structures, where FAA 
notification prior to such construction or alteration is required by 
part 17 of this chapter, must include the FCC Antenna Structure 
Registration Number(s) for the affected structure(s). If no such number 
has been assigned at the time the application is filed, the applicant 
must state in the application whether or not the antenna structure owner 
has notified the FAA of the proposed construction or alteration and 
applied to the FCC for an Antenna Structure Registration Number in 
accordance with part 17 of this chapter for the antenna structure in 
question.
    (f) In addition to the construction permit required by paragraph (a) 
of this section, a launch authorization must be applied for and granted 
before a space station may be launched and

[[Page 293]]

operated in orbit. Request for launch authorization and station license 
may be included in the application for space station construction 
permit. A launch authorization and station license may also be requested 
at any time for a space station constructed as an on-ground spare 
satellite. However, an application for authority to launch and operate 
an on-ground spare domestic satellite will be considered to be a newly 
filed application for cut-off purposes, except where the space station 
to be launched is determined to be an emergency replacement for a 
previously authorized space station which has been lost as a result of a 
launch failure or a catastrophic in-orbit failure.

Sec. 25.116  Amendments to applications.

    (a) Unless otherwise specified, any pending application may be 
amended until designated for hearing, a public notice is issued stating 
that a substantive disposition of the application is to be considered at 
a forthcoming Commission meeting, or a final order

[[Page 296]]

disposing of the matter is adopted by the Commission.
    (b) Major amendments submitted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section are subject to the public notice requirements of Sec. 25.151. An 
amendment will be deemed to be a major amendment under the following 
circumstances:
    (1) If the amendment increases the potential for interference, or 
changes the proposed frequencies or orbital locations to be used.
    (2) If the amendment would convert the proposal into an action that 
may have a significant environmental effect under Sec. 1.1307 of this 
chapter.
    (3) If the amendment specifies a substantial change in beneficial 
ownership or control (de jure or de facto) of an applicant such that the 
change would require, in the case of an authorized station, the filing 
of a prior assignment or transfer of control application under section 
310(d) of the Communications Act, provided however, that the change 
would not be considered major where it merely amends an application to 
reflect a change in ownership or control of the station that had been 
previously approved by the Commission.
    (4) If the amendment, or the cumulative effect of the amendment, is 
determined by the Commission otherwise to be substantial pursuant to 
section 309 of the Communications Act.
    (c) Any application will be considered to be a newly filed 
application if it is amended by a major amendment (as defined by 
paragraph (b) of this section) after a ``cut-off'' date applicable to 
the application, except under the following circumstances:
    (1) The amendment resolves frequency conflicts with authorized 
stations or other pending applications but does not create new or 
increased frequency conflicts;
    (2) The amendment reflects only a change in ownership or control 
found by the Commission to be in the public interest and, for which a 
requested exemption from a ``cut-off'' date is granted;
    (3) The amendment corrects typographical, transcription, or similar 
clerical errors which are clearly demonstrated to be mistakes by 
reference to other parts of the application, and whose discovery does 
not create new or increased frequency conflicts; or
    (4) The amendment does not create new or increased frequency 
conflicts, and is demonstrably necessitated by events which the 
applicant could not have reasonably foreseen at the time of filing.
    (d) Any amendment to an application shall be signed and submitted in 
the same manner, and with the same number of copies, as was the original 
application.


<R05>
Sec. 25.117   Modification of station license.

    (a) Except as provided, no modification of a radio station governed 
by this part which affects the parameters or terms and conditions of the 
station authorization shall be made except upon application to and grant 
of such application by the Commission. No license modification will be 
required if the licensee seeks to access another U.S.-licensed fixed 
satellite provided:
    (1) Consultations pursuant to Article XIV(d) of the INTELSAT 
Agreement have been completed for the satellites, services and countries 
involved; and
    (2) The operators of the U.S.-licensed systems have received 
specific authorization to provide the services to the proposed 
locations.
    (b) Applications for modification of an earth station license to 
add, change or replace transmitters or antenna facilities conforming to 
Sec. 25.209 will be considered to be minor modifications if the 
particulars of operations remain unchanged and frequency coordination is 
not required, provided however, that the maximum power and power density 
delivered into any antenna at the earth station site shall not exceed 
the values calculated by subtracting the maximum antenna gain specified 
in the license from the maximum authorized e.i.r.p. and e.i.r.p. density 
values.
    (c) Applications for modification of earth station authorizations 
shall be submitted on FCC Form 493 except as set forth in paragraph (e) 
of this section.
    (d) Applications for modifications of space station authorizations 
shall be filed in accordance with Sec. 25.114, but only those items of 
information listed in Sec. 25.114(c) that change need to be

[[Page 297]]

submitted provided the applicant certifies that the remaining 
information has not changed.
    (e) Any application for modification of authorization to extend a 
required date of completion (e.g., begin construction, complete 
construction, launch, bring into operation) shall be filed on FCC Form 
701 (Application for Additional Time to Construct). The application must 
include a verified statement from the applicant:
    (1) That states the additional time is required due to unforeseeable 
circumstances beyond the applicant's control, describes these 
circumstances with specificity, and justifies the precise extension 
period requested; or
    (2) That states there are unique and overriding public interest 
concerns that justify an extension, identifies these interests and 
justifies a precise extension period.

Sec. 25.118   Assignment or transfer of control of station authorization.

    (a) No station license, nor any rights thereunder, shall be 
transferred, assigned, or disposed of in any manner, voluntarily or 
involuntarily, directly or indirectly, or by transfer of control of any 
corporation or any other entity holding such license, to any person 
except upon application to the Commission and upon finding by the 
Commission that the pubic interest, convenience and necessity will be 
served thereby.
    (b) For purposes of this section, transfers of control requiring 
Commission approval shall include any and all transactions that:
    (1) Change the party controlling the affairs of the licensee, or
    (2) Affect any change in a controlling interest in the ownership of 
the licensee, including changes in legal or equitable ownership.
    (c) Assignment of license. FCC Form 702 (Application for Consent to 
Assignment of Radio Station Construction Permit or License for Stations 
in Services Other than Broadcast) shall be submitted to assign 
voluntarily (as by, for example, contract or other agreement) or 
involuntarily (as by, for example, death, bankruptcy, or legal 
disability) the station authorization. In the case of involuntary 
assignment (or transfer of control), the applications should be filed 
within 10 days of the event causing the assignment (or transfer of 
control). FCC Form 702 shall also be used for non-substantial (pro 
forma) assignments. In addition, FCC Form 430 shall be submitted by the 
proposed assignee of a transmitting station unless the assignee has a 
current and substantially accurate report on file with the Commission.
    (d) Transfer of control of corporation holding a license. FCC Form 
704 (Application for Consent to Transfer of Control) shall be submitted 
in order to transfer voluntarily or involuntarily (de jure or de facto) 
control of a corporation holding any licenses. FCC Form 704 shall also 
be used for non-substantial (pro forma) transfers of control. In 
addition, FCC Form 430 shall be submitted by the proposed transferee of 
a transmitting station unless the transferee has a current and 
substantially accurate report on file with the Commission.
    (e) Whenever a group of station licenses in the same radio service 
for the same class of facility licensed to the same entity is to be 
assigned or transferred to a single assignee or transferee, a single 
application may be filed to cover the entire group, if the application 
identifies in an exhibit each station by call sign, station location and 
expiration date of license.
    (f) Assignments and transfers of control shall be completed within 
60 days from the date of authorization. The Commission shall be notified 
by letter of the date of consummation and the file numbers of the 
applications involved in the transaction.

Sec. 25.119   Application for special temporary authorization.

    (a) In circumstances requiring immediate or temporary use of 
facilities, request may be made for special temporary authority to 
install and/or operate new or modified equipment. The request must 
contain the full particulars of the proposed operation including all 
facts sufficient to justify the temporary authority sought and the 
public

[[Page 298]]

interest therein. No request for temporary authority will be considered 
unless it is received by the Commission at least 3 working days prior to 
the date of proposed construction or operation or, where an extension is 
sought, the expiration date of the existing temporary authorization. A 
request received within less than 3 working days may be accepted only 
upon due showing of extraordinary reasons for the delay in submitting 
the request which could not have been earlier foreseen by the applicant. 
A copy of the request for special temporary authority also shall be 
forwarded to the Commission's Laurel, Maryland Field Office.
    (b) The Commission may grant a temporary authorization for a period 
not to exceed 180 days, with additional periods not exceeding 180 days, 
upon a finding that there are extraordinary circumstances requiring 
temporary operations in the public interest and that delay in the 
institution of these temporary operations would seriously prejudice the 
public interest. Convenience to the applicant, such as marketing 
considerations of meeting scheduled customer in-service dates, will not 
be deemed sufficient for this purpose.
    (c) Each application proposing construction of one or more earth 
station antennas or alteration of the overall height of one or more 
existing earth station antenna structures, where FAA notification prior 
to such construction or alteration is required by part 17 of this 
chapter, must include the FCC Antenna Structure Registration Number(s) 
for the affected satellite earth station antenna(s). If no such number 
has been assigned at the time the application(s) is filed, the applicant 
must state in the application whether the satellite earth station 
antenna owner has notified the FAA of the proposed construction or 
alteration and applied to the FCC for an Antenna Structure Registration 
Number in accordance with part 17 of this chapter. Applications 
proposing construction of one or more earth station antennas or 
alteration of the overall height of one or more existing earth station 
antennas, where FAA notification prior to such construction or 
alteration is not required by part 17 of this chapter, must indicate 
such and, unless the satellite earth station antenna is 6.10 meters or 
less above ground level (AGL), must contain a statement explaining why 
FAA notification is not required.

Sec. 25.120  License term and renewals.

    (a) License term. Licenses for facilities governed by this Part will 
be issued for a period of 10 years, except developmental licenses which 
will be issued for period of 1 year.
    (b) The Commission reserves the right to grant or renew station 
licenses for less than 10 years if, in its judgment, the public 
interest, convenience and necessity will be served by such action.
    (c) For earth stations, the license term will be specified in the 
instrument of authorization.
    (d) Space stations.
    (1) For geostationary satellite orbit satellites, the license term 
will begin at 3 a.m. EST on the date the licensee certifies to the 
Commission that the satellite has been successfully placed into orbit 
and that the operations of the satellite fully conform to the terms and 
conditions of the space station radio authorization.
    (2) For non-geostationary satellite orbit satellites, the license 
term will begin at 3 a.m. EST on the date that the licensee certifies to 
the Commission that its initial space station has been successfully 
placed into orbit and that the operations of that satellite fully 
conform to the terms and conditions of the space station system 
authorization. All space stations launched and brought into service 
during the ten-year license term shall operate pursuant to the system

Sec. 25.132  Verification of earth station antenna performance standards.

    (a) All applications for transmitting earth stations in the C and 
Ku-bands must be accompanied by a certificate pursuant to Sec. 2.902 of 
the chapter from the manufacturer of each antenna that the results of a 
series of radiation pattern tests performed on representative equipment 
in representative configurations by the manufacturer which demonstrates 
that the equipment complies with the performance standards set forth in 
Sec. 25.209. The licensee must be prepared to demonstrate the 
measurements to the Commission on request in the course of an 
investigation of a harmful interference incident.
    (b)(1) In order to demonstrate compliance with Sec. 25.209 (a) and 
(b), the following measurements on a production antenna performed on 
calibrated antenna range, as a minimum, shall be made at the bottom, 
middle and top of each allocated frequency band and submitted to the 
Commission:
    (i) Co-polarized patterns for each of two orthogonal senses of 
polarizations in two orthogonal cuts of the antenna.
    (A) In the azimuth plane, plus and minus 7 degrees and plus and 
minus 180 degrees.
    (B) In the elevation plane, zero to forty-five degrees.
    (ii) Cross-polarization patterns in the E- and H-planes, plus and 
minus 9 degrees.
    (iii) Main beam gain.
    (2) The FCC envelope specified in Sec. 25.209 shall be superimposed 
on each pattern. The minimum tests specified above are recognized as 
representative of the performance of the antenna in most planes although 
some increase in sidelobe levels should be expected in the spar planes 
and orthogonal spar planes.
    (c) The tests specified in paragraph (b) of this section are 
normally performed at the manufacturer's facility; but for those 
antennas that are very large and only assembled on-site, on-site 
measurements may be used for product qualification data. If on-site data 
is to be used for qualification, the test frequencies and number of 
patterns should follow, where possible, the recommendations in paragraph 
(b) of this section, and the test data is to be

[[Page 301]]

submitted in the same manner as described in paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (d) For each new or modified transmitting antenna over 3 meters in 
diameter, the following on-site verification measurements must be 
completed at one frequency on an available transponder in each frequency 
band of interest and submitted to the Commission.
    (1) Co-polarized patterns in the elevation plane, plus and minus 7 
degrees, in the transmit band.
    (2) Co-polarized patterns in the azimuth and elevation planes, plus 
and minus 7 degrees, in the receive band.
    (3) System cross-polarization discrimination on-axis. The FCC 
envelope specified in Sec. 25.209 shall be superimposed on each pattern. 
The transmit patterns are to be measured with the aid of a co-operating 
earth station in coordination with the satellite system control center 
under the provisions of Sec. 25.272.Sec. 
    (e) Certification that the tests required by paragraph (c) of this 
section have been satisfactorily performed shall be provided to the 
Commission in notification that construction of the facilities has been 
completed as required by Sec. 25.133.
    (f) Antennas less than 3 meters in diameter and antennas on simple 
(manual) drive mounts that are operated at a fixed site are exempt from 
the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section provided that 
a detailed technical showing is made that confirms proper installation, 
pointing procedures, and polarization alignment and manufacturing 
quality control. These showing must also include a plan for periodic 
testing and field installation procedures and precautions.
    (g) Records of the results of the tests required by this section 
must be maintained at the antenna site or the earth station operator's 
control center and be available for inspection.

<R05>
Sec. 25.142  Licensing provisions for the non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service.

    (a) Space station application requirements. (1) Each application for 
a space station system authorization in the non-voice, non-geostationary 
mobile-satellite service shall describe in detail the proposed non-
voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite system, setting forth all 
pertinent technical and operational aspects of the system, and the 
technical, legal, and financial qualifications of the applicant. In 
particular, each application shall include the information specified in 
Sec. 25.114, except that in lieu of the information concerning orbital 
locations requested in Sec. 25.114(c)(6), the applicant shall specify 
the number of space stations and applicable information relating to the 
altitude(s), argument(s) of perigee, service arc(s), right ascension of 
ascending node(s), eccentricity, and inclination of the space stations 
(all referenced to the same time) that will comprise its system. 
Applicants must also file information demonstrating compliance with all 
requirements of this section, and showing, based on existing system 
information publicly available at the Commission at the time of filing, 
that they will not cause unacceptable interference to any non-voice, 
non-geostationary mobile-satellite service system authorized to 
construct or operate.
    (2) Applicants for a non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite 
must identify the power flux density produced at the Earth's surface by 
each space station of their system in the frequency bands 137-138 MHz 
and 400.15-401 MHz, to allow determination of whether coordination with 
terrestrial services is required under international footnotes 599A and 
647B of Sec. 2.106 of the Commission's Rules. In addition, applicants 
must identify the measures they would employ to protect the radio 
astronomy service in the 150.05-153 MHz and 406.1-410 MHz bands from 
harmful interference from unwanted emissions.
    (3) Emission limitations. (i) Applicants in the non-voice, non-
geostationary mobile-satellite service shall show that their space 
stations will not exceed the emission limitations of Sec. 25.202(f) (1), 
(2) and (3), as calculated for a fixed point on the Earth's surface in 
the plane of the space station's orbit, considering the worst-case 
frequency tolerance of all frequency determining components, and maximum 
positive and negative Doppler shift of both the uplink and downlink 
signals, taking into account the system design.
    (ii) Applicants in the non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite 
service shall show that no signal received by their satellites from 
sources outside of their system shall be retransmitted with a power flux 
density level, in the worst 4 kHz, higher than the level described by 
the applicants in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (4) Financial qualifications. Each applicant for space station 
system authorization in the non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-
satellite service must demonstrate, on the basis of the documentation 
contained in its application, that it is financially qualified to 
proceed expeditiously with the construction, launch and operation for 
one year of the first two space stations of its proposed system 
immediately upon grant of the requested authorization. Failure to make 
such a showing will result in the dismissal of the application. This 
showing shall include all information described in Sec. 25.140 (c), (d) 
and (e).
    (5) Replacement of space stations within the system license term. 
The licensee need not file separate applications to construct, launch 
and operate technically identical replacement satellites within the term 
of the system authorization. However, the licensee shall certify to the 
Commission, at least thirty days prior to launch of such replacement(s) 
that:

[[Page 307]]

    (i) The licensee intends to launch a space station that is 
technically identical to those authorized in its system license, and
    (ii) Launch of this space station will not cause the licensee to 
exceed the total number of operating space stations authorized by the 
Commission.
    (b) Operating conditions. In order to ensure compatible operations 
with authorized users in the frequency bands to be utilized for 
operations in the non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service, 
non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service systems must 
operate in accordance with the conditions specified in this section.
    (1) Service limitation. Voice services may not be provided.
    (2) Coordination requirements with Federal government users.
    (i) The frequency bands allocated for use by the non-voice, non-
geostationary mobile-satellite service are also authorized for use by 
agencies of the Federal government. The Federal use of frequencies in 
the non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service frequency 
bands is under the regulatory jurisdiction of the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).
    (ii) The Commission will use its existing procedures for liaison 
with NTIA to reach agreement with respect to achieving compatible 
operations between Federal government users under the jurisdiction of 
NTIA and non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service systems 
(including user transceivers subject to blanket licensing under 
Sec. 25.115(d)) through the frequency assignment and coordination 
practices established by NTIA and the Interdepartment Radio Advisory 
Committee (IRAC). In order to facilitate such frequency assignment and 
coordination, applicants shall provide the Commission with sufficient 
information to evaluate electromagnetic compatibility with the Federal 
government use of the spectrum, and any additional information requested 
by the Commission. As part of the coordination process, applicants shall 
show that they will not cause unacceptable interference to authorized 
Federal government users, based upon existing system information 
provided by the Government. The frequency assignment and coordination of 
the satellite system with Federal government users shall be completed 
prior to grant of construction authorization.
    (iii) The Commission shall also coordinate with NTIA/IRAC with 
regard to the frequencies to be shared by those earth stations of non-
voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service systems that are not 
subject to blanket licensing under Sec. 25.115(d), and authorized 
Federal government stations in the fixed and mobile services, through 
the exchange of appropriate systems information.
    (3) Coordination among non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite 
service systems. Applicants for authority to establish non-voice, non-
geostationary mobile-satellite service systems are encouraged to 
coordinate their proposed frequency usage with existing permittees and 
licensees in the non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service 
whose facilities could be affected by the new proposal in terms of 
frequency interference or restricted system capacity. All affected 
applicants, permittees, and licensees shall, at the direction of the 
Commission, cooperate fully and make every reasonable effort to resolve 
technical problems and conflicts that may inhibit effective and 
efficient use of the radio spectrum; however, the permittee or licensee 
being coordinated with is not obligated to suggest changes or re-
engineer an applicant's proposal in cases involving conflicts.
    (4) Safety and distress communications. Stations operating in the 
non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service that are used to 
comply with any statutory or regulatory equipment carriage requirements 
may also be subject to the provisions of sections 321(b) and 359 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Licensees are advised that these 
provisions give priority to radio communications or signals relating to 
ships in distress and prohibit a charge for the transmission of maritime 
distress calls and related traffic.
    (c) Reporting requirements. All operators of non-voice, non-
geostationary mobile-satellite service systems shall, on June 30 of each 
year, file a report

[[Page 308]]

with the Common Carrier Bureau and the Commission's Laurel, Maryland 
field office containing the following information:
    (1) A listing of any non-scheduled space station outages for more 
than thirty minutes and the cause(s) of such outages;
    (2) A detailed description of the utilization made of the in-orbit 
satellite system. That description should identify the percentage of 
time that the system is actually used for domestic transmission, the 
amount of capacity (if any) sold but not in service, and the amount of 
unused system capacity; and
    (3) Identification of any space stations not available for service 
or otherwise not performing to specifications, the cause(s) of these 
difficulties, and the date any space station was taken out of service or 
the malfunction identified.

coordinate with the appropriate search and rescue organizations 
responsible for the licensees service area.
    (g) Considerations involving transfer or assignment applications.
    (1) ``Trafficking'' in bare licenses issued pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section is prohibited, except with respect to licenses 
obtained through a competitive bidding procedure.
    (2) The Commission will review a proposed transaction to determine 
if the circumstances indicate trafficking in licenses whenever 
applications (except those involving pro forma assignment or transfer of 
control) for consent to assignment of a license, or for transfer of 
control of a licensee, involve facilities licensed pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section. At its discretion, the Commission may require the 
submission of an affirmative, factual showing (supported by affidavits 
of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof) to demonstrate 
that no trafficking has occurred.
    (3) If a proposed transfer of radio facilities is incidental to a 
sale of other facilities or merger of interests, any showing requested 
under paragraph (g)(2) of this section shall include an additional 
exhibit which:

[[Page 310]]

    (i) Discloses complete details as to the sale of facilities or 
merger of interests;
    (ii) Segregates clearly by an itemized accounting, the amount of 
consideration involved in the sale of facilities or merger of interest; 
and
    (iii) Demonstrates that the amount of consideration assignable to 
the facilities or business interests involved represents their fair 
market value at the time of the transaction.
    (h) Prohibition of certain agreements. No license shall be granted 
to any applicant for a space station in the mobile satellite service 
operating at 1610-1626.5/2483.5-2500 MHz if that applicant, or any 
persons or companies controlling or controlled by the applicant, shall 
acquire or enjoy any right, for the purpose of handling traffic to or 
from the United States, its territories or possession, to construct or 
operate space segment or earth stations, or to interchange traffic, 
which is denied to any other United States company by reason of any 
concession, contract, understanding, or working arrangement to which the 
Licensee or any persons or companies controlling or controlled by the 
Licensee are parties.

would effectively preclude by reason of harmful electrical interference, 
or other practical reason, the grant of one or more other applications.
    (b) An application will be entitled to comparative consideration 
with one or more conflicting applications only if:
    (1) The application is mutually exclusive with another application; 
and
    (2) The application is received by the Commission in a condition 
acceptable for filing
    (i) By the ``cut-off'' date specified in a public notice; or
    (ii) If no ``cut-off'' date is specified, within 30 days after the 
date of the public notice listing the first of the conflicting 
applications as acceptable for filing.


<R05>
Sec. 25.156  Consideration of applications.

    (a) Applications for a radio station authorization, or for 
modification or renewal of an authorization, will be granted if, upon 
examination of the application, any pleadings or objections filed, and 
upon consideration of such other matters as it may officially notice,

------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ This band is shared coequally with terrestrial radiocommunication   
  services.                                                             
\2\ Use of this band by the fixed-satellite service is limited to       
  international systems, i.e. other than domestic systems. These bands  
  are also shared on a co-equal basis with terrestrial                  
  radiocommunication services.                                          
\3\ The band 14.0-14.3 GHz is shared coequally with the radionavigation 
  service, and the band 14.4-14.5 GHz is shared with Government         
  terrestrial radiocommunication services in accordance with the        
  provisions of footnote US234 in the Table of Frequency Allocations.   

    (2) The following frequencies are available for use by the 
Radiodetermination Satellite Service:

Until January 1, 1997, the allocations in the 149.9-150.05 MHz and 
399.9-400.05 MHz bands may be used on a secondary basis only. Since the 
399.9-400.05 MHz band is not allocated internationally to the mobile-
satellite service, all operations outside the United States will be on a 
non-interference basis only.
    (4) The following frequencies are available for use by the 1.6/2.4 
GHz Mobile-Satellite Service:

1610-1626.5 MHz: User-to-Satellite Link

assigned on a case-by-case basis to space systems under this part in 
conformance with Sec. 2.106 of this chapter and the Commission's rules 
and policies.
    (c) Orbital locations assigned to space stations licensed under this 
part by the commission are subject to change by summary order of the 
Commission on 30 days notice. An authorization to construct and/or to 
launch a space station becomes null and void if the construction is not 
begun or is not completed, or if the space station is not launched and 
positioned at its assigned orbital location and operations commenced in 
accordance with the station authorization, by the respective date(s) 
specified in the authorization. Frequencies and orbital location 
assignments are subject to the policies set forth in the Report and 
Order, FCC 83-184, adopted April 27, 1983 in CC Docket No. 81-704 and 
the Report and Order, adopted July 25, 1985 in CC

the assigned frequency by more than 100 percent up to and including 250 
percent of the authorized bandwidth: 35 dB;
    (3) In any 4 kHz band, the center frequency of which is removed from 
the assigned frequency by more than 250 percent of the authorized 
bandwidth: An amount equal to 43 dB plus 10 times the logarithm (to the 
base 10) of the transmitter power in watts;
    (4) In any event, when an emission outside of the authorized 
bandwidth causes harmful interference, the Commission may, at its 
discretion, require greater attenuation than specified in paragraphs (f) 
(1), (2) and (3) of this section.
    (g) Telemetry, tracking and telecommand functions for U.S. domestic 
satellites shall be conducted at either or both edges of the allocated 
band(s). Frequencies, polarization and coding shall be selected to 
minimize interference into other satellite networks and within their own 
satellite system.

    (e) Protection for Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone, Boulder 
County, Colorado.
    (1) Applicants for a station authorization to operate in the 
vicinity of Boulder County, Colorado under this part are advised to give 
due consideration, prior to filing applications, to the need to protect 
the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone from harmful interference. These 
are the research laboratories of the Department of Commerce, Boulder 
County, Colorado. To prevent degradation of the present ambient radio 
signal level at the site, the Department of Commerce seeks to ensure 
that the field strengths of any radiated signals (excluding reflected 
signals) received on this 1800 acre site (in the vicinity of coordinates 
40 deg. 07' 50''N Latitude, 105 deg. 14' 40''W Longitude) resulting from 
new assignments (other than mobile stations) or from the modification or 
relocation of existing facilities do not exceed the following values:

\1\ Equivalent values of power flux density are calculated assuming free
  space characteristic impedance of 376.7=120<greek-p> ohms.            
\2\ Space stations shall conform to the power flux density limits at the
  earth's surface specified in appropriate parts of the FCC rules, but  
  in no case should exceed the above levels in any 4 kHz band for all   
  angles of arrival.                                                    

    (2) Advance consultation is recommended particularly for those 
applicants who have no reliable data which indicates whether the field 
strength or power flux density figures in the above table would be 
exceeded by their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In 
such instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining 
whether coordination is recommended:
    (i) All stations within 2.5 kilometers;
    (ii) Stations within 5 kilometers with 50 watts or more average 
effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of polarization in 
the azimuthal direction of the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone;
    (iii) Stations within 15 kilometers with 1 kW or more average ERP in 
the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of Table 
Mountain Receiving Zone;
    (iv) Stations within 80 kilometers with 25 kW or more average ERP in 
the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of Table 
Mountain Receiving Zone.
    (3) Applicants concerned are urged to communicate with the Radio 
Frequency Management Coordinator, Department of Commerce, Research 
Support Services, NOAA R/E5X2, Boulder Laboratories, Boulder, CO 80303; 
telephone (303) 497-6548, in advance of filing their applications with 
the Commission.
    (4) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised 
that such consultation can avoid objections from the Department of 
Commerce or proceedings to modify any authorization which may be granted 
which, in fact, delivers a signal at the site in excess of the field 
strength specified herein.
    (f) Notification to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory: In 
order to minimize possible harmful interference at the National Radio 
Astronomy Observatory site located at Green Bank, Pocahontas County, W. 
Va., and at the Naval Radio Research Observatory site at Sugar Grove,

possible need to protect the FCC stations from harmful interference. 
Geographical coordinates of the facilities which require protection are 
listed in Sec. 0.121(c) of the Commission's Rules. Applications for 
stations (except mobile stations) which will produce on any frequency a 
direct wave fundamental field strength of greater than 10 mV/m in the 
authorized bandwidth of service (-65.8 dBW/m<SUP>2 power flux density 
assuming a free space characteristic impedance of 120 ohms) at the 
referenced coordinates, may be examined to determine extent of possible 
interference. Depending on the theoretical field strength value and 
existing root-sum-square or other ambient radio field signal levels at 
the indicated coordinates, a clause protecting the monitoring station 
may be added to the station authorization.
    (2) In the event that calculated value of expected field exceeds 10 
mV/m (-65.8 dBW/m<SUP>2) at the reference coordinates, or if there is 
any question whether field strength levels might exceed the threshold 
value, advance consultation with the FCC to discuss any protection 
necessary should be considered. Prospective applicants may communicate 
with: Chief, Compliance and Information Bureau, Federal Communications 
Commission, Washington, DC 20554, Telephone (202) 632-6980.
    (3) Advance consultation is suggested particularly for those 
applicants who have no reliable data which indicates whether the field 
strength or power flux density figure indicated would be exceeded by 
their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In such 
instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining whether an 
applicant should coordinate:
    (i) All stations within 2.5 kilometers;
    (ii) Stations within 5 kilometers with 50 watts or more average 
effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of polarization in 
the azimuthal direction of the Monitoring Station;
    (iii) Stations within 15 kilometers with 1 kW or more average ERP in 
the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the 
Monitoring Station;
    (iv) Stations within 80 kilometers with 25 kW or more average ERP in 
the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the 
Monitoring Station.
    (4) Advance coordination for stations operating above 1000 MHz is 
recommended only where the proposed station is in the vicinity of a 
monitoring station designated as a satellite monitoring facility in 
Sec. 0.121(c) of the Commission's Rules and also meets the

[[Page 320]]

criteria outlined in paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section.
    (5) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised 
that such consultation can avoid objections from the Federal 
Communications Commission or modification of any authorization which 
will cause harmful interference.
    (h) Sites and frequencies for GSO and NGSO earth stations, operating 
in a frequency band where both have a co-primary allocation, shall be 
selected to avoid earth station antenna mainlobe-to-satellite antenna 
mainlobe coupling, between NGSO systems and between NGSO and GSO 
systems, in order to minimize the possibility of harmful interference 
between these services. Prior to filing an earth station application, in 
bands with co-primary allocations to NGSO and GSO earth stations, the 
applicant shall coordinate the proposed site and frequency usage with 
existing earth station licensees and with current earth station 
authorization applicants.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Applicants for non-geostationary 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile-Satellite 
Service/ Radiodetermination satellite service feeder links in the bands 
17.7-20.2 GHz and 27.5-30.0 GHz shall indicate the frequencies and 
spacecraft antenna gain contours towards each feeder-link earth station 
location and will coordinate with licensees of other fixed-satellite 
service and terrestrial-service systems sharing the band to determine 
geographic protection areas around each non-geostationary mobile-
satellite service/radiodetermination satellite service feeder-link earth 
station.
    (k) An applicant for an earth station that will operate with a 
geostationary satellite or non-geostationary satellite in a shared 
frequency band in which the non-geostationary system is (or is proposed 
to be) licensed for feeder links, shall demonstrate in its applications 
that its proposed earth station will not cause unacceptable interference 
to any other satellite network that is authorized to operate in the same 
frequency band, or certify that the operations of its earth station 
shall conform to established coordination agreements between the 
operator(s) of the space station(s) with which the earth station is to 
communicate and the operator(s) of any other space station licensed to 
use the band.

+40+3 <greek-th dBW in any 4 KHz band for 
<greek-th<0 deg.<ls-thn-eq>05 deg.

where <greek-th is the angle of elevation of the horizon viewed from the 
center of radiation of the antenna of the earth station and measured in 
degrees as positive above the horizontal plane and negative below it.
    (b) In bands shared coequally with terrestrial radio-communication 
services, the equivalent isotropically radiated power transmitted in any 
direction towards the horizon by an earth station operating in frequency 
bands above 15 GHz shall not exceed the following limits except as 
provided for in paragraph (c) of this section:

+64 dBW in any 1 MHz band for <greek-th<0 deg.
+64+3 <greek-th dBW in any 1 MHz band for 0 deg.<<greek-th<5 deg.

where <greek-th is as defined in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) For angles of elevation of the horizon greater than 5 deg. there 
shall be no restriction as to the equivalent isotropically radiated 
power transmitted by an earth station towards the horizon.
    (d) Notwithstanding the e.i.r.p. and e.i.r.p. density limits 
specified in the station authorization, each earth station transmission 
shall be conducted at the lowest power level that will provide

[[Page 321]]

the required signal quality as indicated in the application and further 
amended by coordination agreements.
    (e) For operations at frequencies above 10 GHz, earth station 
operators may exceed the uplink e.i.r.p. and e.i.r.p. density limits 
specified in the station authorization under the conditions of uplink 
fading due to precipitation by an amount not to exceed 1 dB above the 
actual amount of monitored excess attenuation over clear sky propagation 
conditions. The e.i.r.p. levels shall be returned to normal as soon as 
the attenuating weather pattern subsides. The maximum power level for 
power control purposes shall be coordinated between and among adjacent 
satellite operators.

Sec. 25.205  Minimum angle of antenna elevation.

    Earth station antennas shall not normally be authorized for 
transmission at angles less than 5 deg. measured from the horizontal 
plane to the direction of maximum radiation. However, upon a showing 
that the transmission path will be seaward and away from land masses or 
upon special showing of need for lower angles by the applicant, the 
Commission will consider authorizing transmissions at angles between 
3 deg. and 5 deg. in the pertinent directions. In certain instances, it 
may be necessary to specify minimum angles greater than 5 deg. because 
of interference considerations.

horizontal plane; and
-142 dB(W/m<SUP>2) in any 4 kHz band for angles of arrival between 25 
and 90 degrees above the horizontal plane

These limits relate to the power flux density which would be obtained 
under assumed free-space propagation conditions.
    (b) In the bands 10.95-11.2 and 11.45-11.7 GHz, the power flux 
density at the Earth's surface produced by emissions from a space

Sec. 25.209  Antenna performance standards.

    (a) The gain of any antenna to be employed in transmission from an 
earth station in the fixed-satellite service shall lie below the 
envelope defined below:
    (1) In the plane of the geostationary satellite orbit as it appears 
at the particular earth station location:


29-25 log<INF>10 (Theta) dBi              1 deg. </= Theta </=7 deg.         
+8 dBi                               7 deg. < Theta </=9.2 deg.         
32-25 log<INF>10 (Theta) dBi              9.2 deg. < Theta </=48 deg.        
-10 dBi                              48 deg. < Theta </=180 deg.        
                                                                        


where Theta is the angle in degrees from the axis of the main lobe, and 
dBi refers to dB relative to an isotropic radiator. For the purposes of 
this section, the peak gain of an individual sidelobe may not exceed the 
envelope defined above for Theta between 1.0 and 7.0 degrees. For Theta 
greater than 7.0 degrees, the envelope may be exceeded by no more than 
10% of the sidelobes, provided no individual sidelobe exceeds the gain 
envelope given above by more than 3 dB.
    (2) In all other directions, or in the plane of the horizon 
including any out-of-plane potential terrestrial interference paths:
    Outside the main beam, the gain of the antenna shall lie below the 
envelope defined by:


32-25 log<INF>10 (Theta) dBi              1 deg. </= Theta </=48 deg.        
-10 dBi                              48 deg. < Theta </=180 deg.        
                                                                        
                                                                        


where Theta and dBi are defined above. For the purposes of this section, 
the envelope may be exceeded by no more than 10% of the sidelobes 
provided no individual sidelobe exceeds the gain envelope given above by 
more than 6 dB. The region of the main reflector spillover energy is to 
be interpreted as a single lobe and shall not exceed the envelope by 
more than 6 dB.
    (b) The off-axis cross-polarization gain of any antenna to be 
employed in transmission from an earth station to a space station in the 
domestic fixed-satellite service shall be defined by:


19-25 log10 (Theta) dBi              1.8 deg. < Theta </= 7 deg.        
-2 dBi                               7  deg.<Theta </= 9.2 deg.         
                                                                        


    (c) Earth station antennas licensed for reception of radio 
transmissions from a space station in the fixed-satellite service are 
protected from radio interference caused by other space stations only to 
the degree to which harmful interference would not be expected to be 
caused to an earth station employing an antenna conforming to the 
referenced patterns defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, 
and protected from radio interference caused by terrestrial radio 
transmitters identified by the frequency coordination process only to 
the degree to which harmful interference would not be expected to be 
caused to an earth station conforming to the reference pattern defined 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (d) The patterns specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
shall apply to all new earth station antennas initially authorized after 
February 15, 1985 and shall apply to all earth station antennas after 
March 11, 1994.
    (e) The operations of any earth station with an antenna not 
conforming to the standards of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
shall impose no limitations upon the operation, location or design of 
any terrestrial station, any other earth station, or any space station 
beyond those limitations that would be expected to be imposed by an 
earth station employing an antenna conforming to the reference patterns 
defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (f) An earth station with an antenna not conforming to the standards 
of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will be routinely authorized 
after February 15, 1985 upon a finding by the Commission that 
unacceptable levels of interference will not be caused under conditions 
of uniform 2 deg. orbital

[[Page 323]]

spacings. An earth station antenna initially authorized on or before 
Feburary 15, 1985 will be authorized by the Commission to continue to 
operate as long as such operations are found not to cause any 
unacceptable levels of adjacent satellite interference. In either case, 
the Commission will impose appropriate terms and conditions in its 
authorization of such facilities and operations.
    (g) The antenna performance standards of small antennas operating in 
the 12/14 GHz band with diameters as small as 1.2 meters starts at 
1.25 deg. instead of 1 deg. as stipulated in paragraph (a) of this 
section.

Sec. 25.210  Technical requirements for space stations in the Fixed-Satellite Service.

    (a) All space stations in the Fixed-Satellite Service used for 
domestic service in the 4/6 GHz frequency band shall:
    (1) Use orthogonal linear polarization with one of the planes 
defined by the equatorial plane;
    (2) Be designed so that the polarization sense of uplink 
transmissions is opposite to that of downlink transmissions on the same 
transponder; and
    (3) Shall be capable of switching polarization sense upon ground 
command.
    (b) All space stations in the Fixed-Satellite Service shall have a 
minimum capability to change transponder saturation flux densities by 
ground command in 4 dB steps over a range of 12 dB.
    (c) All space stations in the Fixed-Satellite Service shall be 
designed to derive the maximum capacity feasible from the assigned 
orbital location. In particular, space stations in the Fixed-Satellite 
Service are required to employ state-of-the-art full frequency re-use 
using both horizontal and vertical polarization.
    (d) For fixed-satellite space stations providing domestic service, 
full frequency re-use is defined as re-use of the frequency bands by 
polarization discrimination in both the uplink and downlink directions 
using state-of-the-art equipment and techniques.
    (e) For fixed-satellite space stations providing international 
service, full frequency re-use is defined as follows:
    (1) Satellites must employ polarization discrimination so that, 
through the use of dual polarization, they shall be able to reuse both 
the uplink and downlink frequency band assignments.
    (2) Satellites must be configured so that all assigned frequencies 
(in both polarizations) could be reused in beams serving widely separate 
areas.
    (f)  [Reserved]
    (g) Space station antennas in the Fixed-Satellite Service must be 
designed to provide a cross-polarization isolation such that the ratio 
of the on axis co-polar gain to the cross-polar gain of the antenna in 
the assigned frequency band shall be at least 30 dB within its primary 
coverage area.
    (h) Space stations to be operated in the geostationary satellite 
orbit must be:
    (1) Designed with the capability of being maintained in orbit within 
0.05 deg. of their assigned orbital longitude,
    (2) Maintained in orbit at their assigned orbital longitude within 
the longitudinal tolerance specified by the Commission, and
    (3) The Commission may authorize operations at assigned orbital 
longitudes offset by 0.05 deg. or multiples thereof from the nominal 
orbital location specified in the station authorizations.
    (i) Antenna measurements of both co-polarized and cross-polarized 
performance must be made on all antennas employed by space stations both 
within the primary coverage area to facilitate coordination with other 
Commission space station licensees and outside the primary coverage area 
to facilitate international frequency coordination with other 
Administrations. The results of such measurements shall be submitted to 
the Commission within thirty days after preliminary in-orbit testing is 
completed.
    (j) All operators of space stations shall file a semi-annual report 
with the International Bureau and the Commission's Laurel, Maryland 
field office containing the following information:
    (1) Status of satellite construction and anticipated launch dates, 
including

[[Page 324]]

any major problems or delays encountered;
    (2) A listing of any non-scheduled transponder outages for more than 
thirty minutes and the cause(s) of such outages;
    (3) A detailed description of the utilization made or anticipated to 
be made of each transponder on each of the in-orbit satellites. That 
description should identify the total capacity or the percentage of time 
each transponder is actually used for transmission, the amount of 
capacity (if any) sold but not in service and the amount of unused 
capacity in the transponder. If the transponder is reserved as a spare, 
the operating transponder being protected should be identified. If the 
transponder is used for preemptible or occasional services, the nature 
of these services and amount of time preemptible or occasional services 
that are provided over the transponder should also be identified; and
    (4) Identification of any transponders not available for service or 
otherwise not performing to specifications, the cause of these 
difficulties, and the date any transponder was taken out of service or 
the malfunction identified.

Sec. 25.211  Video Transmissions in the Domestic Fixed--Satellite Service.

    (a) Downlink analog video transmissions in the band 3700-4200 MHz 
shall be transmitted only on a center frequency of 3700+20N MHz, where 
N=1 to 24. The corresponding uplink frequency shall be 2225 MHz higher.
    (b) All 4/6 GHz analog video transmissions shall contain an energy 
dispersal signal at all times with a minimum peak-to-peak bandwidth set 
at whatever value is necessary to meet the power flux density limits 
specified in Sec. 25.208(a) and successfully coordinated internationally 
and accepted by adjacent U.S. satellite operators based on the use of 
state of the art space and earth station facilities. Further, all 
transmissions operating in frequency bands described in Sec. 25.208(b) 
and (c) shall also contain an energy dispersal signal at all times with 
a minimum peak-to-peak bandwidth set at whatever value is necessary to 
meet the power flux density limits specified in Sec. 25.208(b) and (c) 
and successfully coordinated internationally and accepted by adjacent 
U.S. satellite operators based on the use of state of the art space and 
earth station facilities. The transmission of an unmodulated carrier at 
a power level sufficient to saturate a transponder is prohibited, except 
by the space station licensee to determine transponder performance 
characteristics. All 12/14 GHz video transmissions for TV/FM shall 
identify the particular carrier frequencies for necessary coordination 
with adjacent U.S. satellite systems and affected satellite systems of 
other administrations.
    (c) All initial analog video transmissions shall be preceded by a 
video test transmission at an uplink e.i.r.p. at least 10 dB below the 
normal operating level. The earth station operator shall not increase 
power until receiving notification from the satellite network control 
center that the frequency and polarization alignment are satisfactory 
pursuant to the procedures specified in Sec. 25.272. The stationary 
earth station operator that has successfully transmitted an initial 
video test signal to a satellite pursuant to this paragraph is not 
required to make subsequent video test transmissions if subsequent 
transmissions are conducted using exactly the same parameters as the 
initial transmission.

    (iii) Out-of-band emissions of a mobile earth station licensed to 
operate within the 1610.0-1626.5 MHz band shall be attenuated so that 
the power flux density it produces in the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz band at any 
radio astronomy site listed in paragraph (a)(1) (i) or (ii) of this 
section shall not exceed the emissions of a mobile earth station 
operating within the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz band at the edge of the 
protection zone applicable for that site. As an alternative, a mobile 
earth station shall not operate during radio astronomy observations 
within the 1613.8-1615.8 MHz band within 100 km of the radio astronomy 
sites listed in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, and within 30 km of 
the sites listed in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, there being no 
restriction on a mobile earth station operating within the 1615.8-1626.5 
MHz band.
    (iv) For airborne mobile earth stations operating in the 1610.0-
1626.5 MHz band, the separation distance shall be the larger of the 
distances specified in paragraph (a)(1) (i), (ii) or (iii) of this 
section, as applicable, or the distance, d, as given by the formula:

  d (km) = 4.1 square root of (h)

where h is the altitude of the aircraft in meters above ground level.
    (v) Smaller geographic protection zones may be used in lieu of the 
areas specified in paragraphs (a)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this 
section if agreed to by the Mobile-Satellite Service licensee and the 
Electromagnetic Spectrum Management Unit (ESMU), National Science 
Foundation, Washington, D.C. upon a showing by the Mobile-Satellite 
Service licensee that the operation of a mobile earth station will not 
cause harmful interference to a radio astronomy observatory during 
periods of observation.
    (vi) The ESMU shall notify Mobile-Satellite Service space station 
licensees authorized to operate mobile earth terminals in the 1610.0-
1626.5 MHz band of periods of radio astronomy observations. The mobile-
satellite systems shall be capable of terminating operations within the 
frequency bands and protection zones specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) 
through (iv) of this section, as applicable, after the first position 
fix of the mobile earth terminal either prior to transmission or, based 
upon its location within the protection zone at the time of initial 
transmission of the mobile earth terminal. Once the mobile-satellite 
system determines that a mobile earth terminal is located within an RAS 
protection zone, the mobile-satellite system shall immediately initiate 
procedures to relocate the mobile earth terminal operations to a non-RAS 
frequency.

[[Page 326]]

    (vii) A beacon-actuated protection zone may be used in lieu of fixed 
protection zones in the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz band if a coordination 
agreement is reached between a mobile-satellite system licensee and the 
ESMU on the specifics of beacon operations.
    (viii) Additional radio astronomy sites, not located within 100 
miles of the 100 most populous urbanized areas as defined by the United 
States Census Bureau at the time, may be afforded similar protection one 
year after notice to the mobile-satellite system licensees by issuance 
of a public notice by the Commission.
    (2) Mobile-Satellite Service space stations transmitting in the 
1613.8-1626.5 MHz band shall take whatever steps necessary to avoid 
causing harmful interference to the radio astronomy facilities listed in 
paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section during periods of 
observation.
    (3) Mobile-Satellite Service space stations operating in the 2483.5-
2500 MHz frequency band shall limit spurious emission levels in the 
4990-5000 MHz band so as not to exceed -241 dB (W/m<SUP>2/Hz) at the 
surface of the Earth.
    (4) The Radioastronomy Service shall avoid scheduling radio 
astronomy observations during peak MSS/RDSS traffic periods to the 
greatest extent practicable.
    (b) Protection of the radionavigation-satellite service. Mobile 
earth stations operating in the 1610-1626.5 MHz band shall limit out-of-
band emissions in the 1574.397-1576.443 MHz band so as not to exceed an 
e.i.r.p. density level of -70 dB (W/MHz) averaged over any 20 ms period. 
The e.i.r.p. of any discrete spurious emission (i.e., bandwidth less 
than 600 Hz) in the 1574.397-1576.443 MHz band shall not exceed -80 dBW.

Sec. 25.251   Special requirements for coordination.

    (a) The administrative aspects of the coordination process are set 
forth in Secs. 21.100(d) and 21.706 (c) and (d) of this chapter in the 
case of coordination of terrestrial stations with earth stations, and in 
Sec. 25.203 in the case of coordination of earth stations with 
terrestrial stations. The technical aspects of the coordination process 
are set forth in Secs. 25.252 through 25.256.
    (b) The technical aspects of coordination are based on appendix 28 
of the international radio regulations and certain recommendations and 
reports of the CCIR. Applicants and operators will find it helpful to be 
aware of the latest revision of these documents, in particular reports 
244, 382, and 448.
    (c) Although two types of interference paths have to be considered, 
i.e., from an earth station transmitter into terrestrial receivers, and 
from a terrestrial transmitter into earth station receivers, the use of 
different frequency bands for transmission and reception by the 
communication-satellite service limit the consideration to only one type 
of interference path in each frequency band, namely:
    (1) In those shared frequency bands limited to transmission by an 
earth station, only the possibility of interference from earth station 
transmitters into terrestrial receivers needs to be considered;

[[Page 327]]

    (2) In those shared frequency bands limited to reception by an earth 
station, only the possibility of interference from terrestrial 
transmitters into the earth station receivers needs to be considered.
    (d) For the purposes of effecting coordination between terrestrial 
and earth station in frequency bands shared with equal rights by these 
services, the following assumptions should be made, absent specific 
information:
    (1) That the earth station antenna may be directed towards any point 
on that portion of the geostationary arc visible at the earth station 
location at which the corresponding elevation angle exceeds or is equal 
to the limits specified in Sec. 25.205;
    (2) That any terrestrial station and any earth station within 100 
kilometers of each other must be coordinated whether or not a lesser 
coordination distance results from any calculation;
    (3) That the terrestrial antenna meets an antenna pattern based on 
the maximum antenna gain from table 1 of Sec. 25.252 and the sidelobe 
suppression standard B set forth in Sec. 21.108(c) of this chapter;
    (4) That for coordination, the earth station antenna sidelobe gain 
level is defined by the following formula:

32-25 log<INF>10 <greek-th> dBi
-10 dBi
1 deg.<ls-thn-eq><greek-th><ls-thn-eq>48 deg.
48 deg.<<greek-th><ls-thn-eq>180 deg.

where <greek-th> is the off-axis angle to the direction of the 
terrestrial station in question. If the actual antenna gain performance 
is better than that defined by this formula, the actual gain may be used 
to effect coordination.

    (5) That both systems occupy all frequencies allocated to the 
particular service in the band to which they are assigned.
    (e) The assumption of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, that the 
terrestrial station antenna only meets the sidelobe suppression standard 
B of Sec. 21.108(c) of this chapter is to be made only for computational 
convenience and simplicity, and to insure that all terrestrial stations 
that could likely cause or receive interference are taken into account. 
If interference will likely result to or from a terrestrial station 
actually employing an antenna meeting only standard B, but would be 
eliminated if an antenna meeting standard A were to be employed, then 
the provisions of Secs. 21.108(c) and 21.109(c) of this chapter apply.
    (f) In lieu of the assumptions of paragraph (d)(1) and/or paragraph 
(d)(5) of this section, an applicant for an earth station authorization 
may effect coordination for a limited portion of the geostationary arc 
visible at the earth station location and/or a limited portion of the 
frequency band: Provided, however, That the operation of the earth 
station shall be limited to that portion of the geostationary arc and/or 
that portion of the frequency band for which coordination has been 
effected.
    (g) The authorization of a developmental earth station under 
Sec. 25.390 and the authorization of a transportable earth station for 
operation at a given location for a limited period of time shall be so 
conditioned that the operations of such an earth station shall not place 
any limitations upon the operations, location, or design of any 
terrestrial station. For this reason, the interference analyses 
performed in the coordination of these earth stations may be undertaken 
for specific frequency assignments and therefore may take advantage of 
any offset in frequency calculated in accordance with applicable CCIR 
Reports and Recommendations (for example Report 388-1).

Sec. 25.252   Maximum permissible interference power.

    (a) The maximum permissible interference power P<INF>max(p) in dBW 
in the reference bandwidth of the potentially interfered-with station, 
not to be exceeded for all but a short term percentage of the time, p, 
from each source of interference, is given by the general formula

             P<INF>max(p)=10 log<INF>10(kT<INF>rB)+J+M(p)-W

where:

                      M(p)=M(p<INF>o/n)=M<INF>o(p)

with:

k=Boltzmann's constant (1.38<t-bullet>10<SUP>-23 joules per  deg.K),
T<INF>r=Thermal noise temperature of the receiving system (degrees 
Kelvin),

[[Page 328]]

B=Reference bandwidth (in Hz) (bandwidth over which the interference 
power can be averaged),
J=Ratio (in dB) of the maximum permissible long-term interfering power 
to the long-term thermal noise power in the receiving system (where 
long-term refers to 20 percent of the time),\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The factor J (in dB) is defined as the ratio of total 
permissible long-term (20 percent of the time) interference power in the 
system, to the long-term thermal noise power in a single receiver. For 
example, in a 50-hop terrestrial hypothetical reference circuit, the 
total allowable additive interference power is 1,000 pWOp (C.C.I.R. 
Recommendation 357-1) and the mean thermal noise power in a single hop 
may be assumed to be 25 pWOp. Therefore, since in a FDM/FM system the 
ratio of the interference noise power to the thermal noise power in a 
4kHz band is the same before and after demodulation. J=16 dB. In a 
fixed-service satellite system, the total allowable interference power 
is also 1,000 pWOp (C.C.I.R. Recommendation 356-2), but the thermal 
noise contribution of the down path is not likely to exceed 7,000 pWOp, 
hence J<gr-thn-eq>8.5 dB. In digital systems it may be necessary to 
protect each communication path individually, and in that case, long-
term interference power may be of the same order of magnitude as long-
term thermal noise, hence J=0 dB.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

n=Number of expected entries of interference, assumed to be 
uncorrelated,
p=Percentage of the time during which the interference from one source 
may exceed the allowable maximum value,
p<INF>o=Percentage of the time during which the interference from all 
sources may exceed the allowable maximum value; since the entries of 
interference are not likely to occur simultaneously:

                               p<INF>o=np,

M(p)=Ratio (in dB) between the maximum permissible interference power 
during p percent of the time for one entry of interference, and during 
20 percent of the time for all entries of interference, respectively,
M<INF>o(p<INF>o)=Ratio (in dB) between the maximum permissible 
interference power during p<INF>o percent and 20 percent of the time 
respectively, for all entries of interference,\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ M<INF>o(p<INF>o) (in dB) is the ``interference margin'' between 
the long-term (20 percent) and the short term (p<INF>o percent) 
allowable interference powers. For analogue radio-relay and fixed-
satellite systems in bands between 1 and 15 GHz, this is the ratio (in 
dB) between 50,000 and 1,000 pWOp (17 dB). In the case of digital 
systems, M<INF>o(p<INF>o) may tentatively be set equal to the fading 
margin for a percentage of the time (1-p<INF>o) percent, which depends, 
inter alia, on the local rain climate.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

W=Equivalence factor (in dB) relating the effect of interference to that 
of thermal noise of equal power in the reference bandwidth.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The factor W (in dB) is the ratio of RF thermal noise power to 
RF interference power, in the reference bandwith, producting the same 
interference effect after demodulation (e.g. in FDM/FM system it would 
be expressed for equal voice channel performance; in a digital system it 
would be expressed for equal bit error probabilities). For FM signals, 
it is defined as follows:
    W=10 log<INF>10 [(Interfering power in the receiving system after 
demodulation/Thermal noise power in receiving system after demodulation) 
 x  (Thermal noise power at the receiver input in the reference 
bandwidth/Interfering power at radio frequency in the reference 
bandwidth)]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the wanted signal uses FM modulation with rms modulation indices 
which are greater than unity, W is approximately 4 dB, regardless of the 
characteristics of the interfering signal. For low index terrestrial 
FDM/FM systems a very small reference bandwidth (4 kHz) should be 
assumed in order to avoid the necessity of dealing with a large range of 
characteristics of both wanted and unwanted signals upon which, for 
greater reference bandwidths, the value of W would depend. With this 
assumption, W=0 dB as shown in table 1, of this section. When the wanted 
signal is digital, W is usually equal to or less than 0 dB, regardless 
of the characteristics of the interfering signal.
    (b) For purposes of performing interference analyses, the maximum 
permissible interference power P<INF>max(20%) in dBW in the reference 
bandwidth of the potentially interfered-with station, not to be exceeded 
for all but 20 percent of the time from each source of interference, is 
given by the general formula and with the remaining parameters defined 
in paragraph (a) of this section.

   P<INF>max(20 percent)=10 log<INF>10(n<INF>20) (kT<INF>rB) +J-W -10

where

n<INF>20=number of assumed simultaneous interference entries of equal 
          power level,

    (c) The values of the parameters contained in the appropriate column 
of table 1 of this section which enter into the formulas of paragraphs 
(a) and (b)

[[Page 329]]

of this section shall be used to compute the maximum permissible 
interference power level in all cases, unless the applicant demonstrates 
to the Commission that a different set of values for these parameters is 
more appropriate for his particular case. Where a symbol appears in 
table 1 of this section, the actual value of the parameter represented 
by the symbol is to be used.

Sec. 25.253   Determination of coordination distance for near great circle propagation mechanisms.

    (a) The requirement that the interference power at the input to the 
receiver of the potentially interfered-with station be less than the 
maximum permissible interference power level P<INF>max(p) for all but p 
percent of the time (as determined in Sec. 25.252), is equivalent to the 
requirement that a minimum permissible basic transmission loss between 
the two stations be exceeded for all but p percent of the time. For 
uniformity and convenience, this minimum permissible basic transmission 
loss is determined for each azimuth for p=0.01 percent of the time, at a 
frequency of 4 GHz. This value is termed the normalized basic 
transmission loss L<INF>o (0.01), and can be calculated from the 
formula:

[[Page 330]]

L<INF>o(0.01)=P<INF>t+G<INF>i+G<INF>r-P<INF>max(p)-F(p)-20 log<INF>10(f/
                               4)-L<INF>w

where:

P<INF>t=maximum available transmitting power (in dBW) in the reference 
bandwidth B, at the input to the antenna of the potentially interfering 
station. The representative value contained in the appropriate column of 
table 1 of Sec. 25.252 should be used;
G<INF>t=gain (in dB relative to an isotropic radiator) of the 
transmitting antenna of the potentially interfering station;
G<INF>r=gain (in dB relative to an isotropic radiator) of the receiving 
antenna of the potentially interfered-with station;
P<INF>max(p)=maximum permissible interference power (in dBW) in the 
reference bandwidth B of the potentially interfered-with station not to 
be exceeded for all but p percent of the time as determined from 
Sec. 25.252;
F(p)=correction factor (in dB) to relate the effective percentage of the 
time p to 0.01 percent of the time, for great circle propagation 
mechanisms, as determined from figure 1 of this section;
f=frequency (in GHz);
L<INF>w=receiving system transmission line loss (in dB); none to be 
assumed in calculation of coordination distance;

  Correction Factor F(p) for Percentages of the Time p Other Than 0.01%
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MR91.042

                       FCC Sec. 25.253, Figure 1.

The following considerations apply to the selection of values for the 
parameters in this formula:
    (1) The maximum gain of terrestrial antenna, either G<INF>t or 
G<INF>r, is to be used in the formula above. The representative value 
contained in the appropriate column of table 1 of Sec. 25.252 should be 
used.
    (2) For an earth station communicating with geostationary 
satellites, the gain of the earth station antenna, either G<INF>r or 
G<INF>t, is generally taken as the gain in the direction toward the 
physical horizon at the azimuth under consideration, except that in 
certain cases, as described in paragraph (f) of this section, where the 
elevation angle of the earth station antenna is below 12 deg., the main 
beam gain is used instead of the horizon gain. In the case of an earth 
station communicating with nongeostationary satellites, an equivalent 
time invariant gain should be used. This time invariant gain is taken as 
the greater of the maximum horizon gain minus 10 dB and the horizon gain 
not exceeded for more than 10 percent of the time.
    (3) In those frequency bands where the potential for interference is 
from an earth station transmitter into a terrestrial receiver, a 
sensitivity factor S in dBW may be defined in terms of the terrestrial 
antenna gain G<INF>m in dBi and the maximum permissible interference 
power P<INF>max (p) in dBW at the terrestrial receiver by

                     S=G<INF>m-P<INF>max(p)-L<INF>w

With this definition, the formula for the normalized basic transmission 
loss may be rewritten as

         L<INF>o(0.01)=P<INF>t+G<INF>t+S-F(p)-20 log<INF>10(f/4)

in terms of the parameters defined above. In this way, auxiliary 
contours, generated for sensitivity factor values of 5, 10, 15, 20 dB, 
etc. below the value corresponding to the main contour, may be 
convenient in performing preliminary interference analyses.
    (4) In those frequency bands where the potential for interference is 
from a terrestrial transmitter into an earth station receiver, an 
equivalent isotropically radiated power E in dBW may be defined in terms 
of the terrestrial transmitter power P<INF>m in dBW and

[[Page 331]]

the terrestrial antenna gain G<INF>m in dBi by

                            E=P<INF>m+G<INF>m

With this definition, the formula for the normalized basic transmission 
loss may be rewritten as

  L<INF>o(0.01)=E+G<INF>r-P<INF>max(p)-F(p)-20 log<INF>10 (f/4)-L<INF>w

in terms of the parameters defined above. In this way, auxiliary 
contours, generated for equivalent isotropically radiated powers of 5, 
10, 15, 20 dB, etc., below the value corresponding to the main contour, 
may be convenient in performing preliminary interference analyses.
    (b) The gain of the earth station antenna in the direction of the 
physical horizon around the earth station may be computed by the 
following method with the aid of figure 2 in the case of an earth 
station communicating with geostationary satellites. An example of this 
method is illustrated in figure 3 in the particular case of an earth 
station location at 45 deg. north latitude for an azimuth of 210 deg.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MR91.031

    (1) Figure 2 shows the permissible location arcs of geostationary 
satellites in a rectangular azimuth-elevation plot (<greek-a>, 
<greek-e<INF>3), each arc corresponding to a particular earth station 
latitude, <greek-l>. For the latitude of the given earth station, that 
portion of the geostationary arc visible at the earth station for which 
coordination is to be effected is marked off between the appropriate 
limits. The example of figure 3 shows that portion of the arc of the 
geostationary orbit visible from an earth station at a latitude of 
45 deg. N. for the case of satellites located between 10 deg. E. and 
45 deg. W. of the earth station.

[[Page 332]]

    (2) The horizon profile <greek-th (<greek-a>) as a function of the 
azimuth <greek-a> is then plotted along the bottom of figure 2 as 
illustrated in the example of figure 3.

[[Page 333]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MR91.044


    (3) At each azimuth interval (e.g. for each 5 deg. of azimuth), the 
minimum angular distance <greek-ph>(<greek-a><INF>o) (between the 
physical horizon at azimuth <greek-a><INF>o and the plotted portion of 
the geostationary arc) is determined graphically, as illustrated in 
figure 3, using the elevation scale at the far left of the figure.
    (4) The earth station gain toward the horizon at azimuth 
<greek-a><INF>o may now be determined by evaluating either the actual 
earth station antenna pattern, if known, or the reference antenna 
pattern, if known, or the reference antenna pattern of Sec. 25.209 at 
the minimum angular distance <greek-ph>(<greek-a><INF>o).
    (c) The dependence of basic transmission loss on climate is 
reflected in the definition of three radio-climatic zones:

Zone A: Land;
Zone B: Sea at latitudes greater than 23.5 deg. N. and 23.5 deg. S.;
Zone C: Sea, at latitudes between 23.5 deg. N. and 23.5 deg. S., 
inclusive.

In addition, zones B and C are taken to extend inland, either to the 
distance at which the height of the terrain is 100 m above sea level, or 
50 km inland, whichever is less.
    (d) The coordination distance due to near great circle propagation 
mechanisms in a particular direction is calculated from the normalized 
basic transmission loss L<INF>o (0.01) computed from the formula of 
paragraph (a) of this section in the following manner:
    (1) Using the normalized basic transmission loss L<INF>o (0.01), a 
unit elevation correction H<INF>o (in dB) is obtained for the frequency 
under consideration from figure 4 for the appropriate radio-climatic 
zone. Linear interpolation between the curves of figure 4 is used for 
frequencies not shown.

    (2) This unit elevation correction H<INF>o together with the 
elevation angle of the physical horizon in the direction of azimuth 
under consideration is then used with figure 5 for the appropriate 
radio-climatic zone to obtain the total horizon correction H (in dB). If 
the horizon elevation is less than 0.2 deg., the value of 0 dB is used 
for H.

    (3) The required coordination loss L<INF>c (in dB) is then 
calculated by subtracting the total horizon correction H from the 
normalized basic transmission loss L<INF>o (0.01)

                         L<INF>c=L<INF>o(0.01)-H

    (4) The coordination distance for the radio-climatic zone in which 
the earth station is located can now be determined from figure 6 for the 
appropriate radio-climatic zone together with the required coordination 
loss L<INF>c and the frequency f.

    (5) For those azimuths for which the earth station antenna elevation 
angle is less than 12 deg., the coordination distance calculated in this 
manner may have to be adjusted in accordance with the procedure set 
forth in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (e) When the coordination distance, calculated for the radio-
climatic zone in which the earth station is located, extends into 
another radio-climatic zone, the effective multizone coordination 
distance is the sum of the distances x<INF>A, x<INF>B, and x<INF>C 
traversed by the radio path in zones A, B, and C, respectively, which 
are determined from the relationship

         (x<INF>A/D<INF>A)+(x<INF>B/D<INF>B)+(x<INF>C/D<INF>C)=1

where D<INF>A, D<INF>B, and D<INF>C are the coordination distances in 
zones A, B, and C, respectively, calculated under the assumption that 
the radio path lies entirely in zones A, B, and C, respectively. The use 
of this relationship is illustrated by the following examples.
    (1) Assume that the earth station is located in zone A and that a 
coordination distance D<INF>A=345 km has been calculated assuming that 
the radio path lies only in zone A. However, in the particular direction 
being considered, the radio path crosses over into zone B at a distance 
of 290 km from the earth station. Assume further, that if the station 
were located in zone B, a coordination distance of D<INF>B=530 km

[[Page 340]]

would be required. Setting x<INF>C=0, the relationship above can be 
solved for the unknown distance x<INF>B in zone B:

                  x<INF>B=D<INF>B [1-(x<INF>A/D<INF>A)]

By substituting the known values x<INF>A=290 km, D<INF>A=345 km and 
D<INF>B=530 km, the required distance in zone B is found to be 
x<INF>B=85 km. The effective coordination distance d<INF>c is then found 
to be

                 d<INF>c=x<INF>A+x<INF>B=290+85=375 km.

    (2) Taking this same example one step further, assume that the radio 
path reenters zone A at a distance of 340 km from the earth station. In 
this case, the distance initially traversed by the radio path in zone A 
is know to be x<INF>A'=290 km, and distance in zone B is 
x<INF>B=340-x<INF>A'=50 km. Therefore, it is necessary to solve for the 
remaining distance x<INF>A'' in zone A by

            x<INF>A''=D<INF>A[1-(x<INF>B/D<INF>B)]-x<INF>A'.

Substituting the values for D<INF>A, x<INF>B, D<INF>B, and x<INF>A', 
x<INF>A'' is found to be

                   x<INF>A''=345[1-(50/530)]-290=21 km

so that the total lengths of the two segments of the radio path lying in 
zone A is

                x<INF>A=x<INF>A'+x<INF>A''=290+21=311 km

and the effective coordination distance is

                 d<INF>c=x<INF>A+x<INF>B=311+50=361 km.

    (f) The coordination distance calculated in paragraphs (d) and (e) 
of this section may be too small for those azimuths at which the 
elevation of the antenna of an earth station communicating with a 
geostationary satellite is below 12 deg.. In these cases the following 
procedure is to be used to determine whether the regular coordination 
distance contour for each of these azimuths should be increased:
    (1) A coordination distance d' is calculated for such an azimuth in 
the same manner as for the regular coordination distance d<INF>o from 
paragraph (d) of this section, except that:
    (i) The main beam gain of the earth station antenna is used instead 
of the horizon gain,
    (ii) The earth station antenna elevation angle for this azimuth is 
used instead of the horizon elevation angle,
    (iii) The zone A curves of figures 4, 5, and 6 are used irrespective 
of the actual radio-climatic zone.
    (2) If the coordination distance d' calculated in this manner is 
greater than the regular coordination distance d<INF>o, the effective 
coordination distance d<INF>c for this azimuth is then taken as

       d<INF>c=d<INF>o+[(d'-d<INF>o)(12-S)/7]km 5 deg. 4S412 deg.

where <greek-S> is the earth station antenna elevation angle.

Sec. 25.254   Computation of coordination distance contours for propagation modes associated with precipitation scatter.

    (a) For a given pointing azimuth and elevation angle of an earth 
station antenna, a rain scatter coordination distance contour, 
calculated in accordance with the procedure set forth below takes the 
form of a circle of radius d<INF>cr, the rain scatter coordination 
distance, centered at a point offset from the earth station location by 
a distance D<INF>r in the direction of azimuth of the main beam of the 
earth station antenna. This offset distance D<INF>r is a function of 
both the rain scatter distance d<INF>cr and the earth station antenna 
elevation angle. In the case of an earth station designed for operation 
with communication-satellites located at any point along a specified 
portion of the geostationary arc, this functional dependence entails the 
generation of rain scatter coordination distance contours for each 
azimuth direction in which the earth station antenna may point. The 
effective rain scatter coordination distance contour is then taken as 
the envelope defined by all these individual contours. It may be 
convenient to eliminate the need to consider multiple contours by taking 
an effective rain scatter coordination distance contour as a circle 
centered at the earth station location with a radius equal to the sum of 
the rain scatter distance d<INF>cr and the maximum offset distance 
D<INF>r at the minimum elevation angle. Such a procedure is 
conservative, since the resulting contour will always be larger than 
necessary, but for earth stations having minimum elevation angles above 
20 deg., the increase in area inside the contour will be small.

[[Page 341]]

    (b) For the purposes of computing rain scatter coordination distance 
contours and to establish maximum scattering heights, below which main-
beam intersections will not generally be permitted, the 48 contiguous 
United States have been divided into five rain climates. These rain 
climates are listed in table 1 of this paragraph. The five climates are 
distinguished by the statistical distribution of their instantaneous 
rainfall rates throughout the year. These defining distributions, taken 
from the CCIR literature, are shown graphically in figure 1 of this 
paragraph. In the absence of specific information on the rainfall 
statistics at a proposed station location, the map shown in figure 2 of 
this paragraph may be used. This map shows boundaries approximating the 
actual rain climates. (This map also takes into account the effect of 
scatter from hail by moving the boundary of rain climate 2 farther west 
in Colorado and several nearby States than would be dictated considering 
rain only.) In the case of Alaska, Hawaii and in the off-shore U.S. 
possessions and territories, applicants should select the most 
appropriate rain climate based on rainfall statistics, pending the 
adoption of rules setting forth maps and/or other information for these 
areas.

    (c) To determine the rain scatter coordination distance d<INF>cr, it 
is first necessary to calculate the normalized rain scatter coordination 
loss L<INF>r (0.01) from the formula

     L<INF>r(0.01)=P<INF>t+D<INF>G-P<INF>max(p)-F<INF>r(p,f)-L<INF>w

where:

P<INF>t=power (in dBW) available at the antenna input of the interfering 
earth station from table 1 of Sec. 25.252;
D<INF>G=difference (in dB) between the maximum gain of the terrestrial 
station antenna in the frequency band under consideration and the value 
of 45 dBi. This value may be determined from the appropriate column of 
table 1 of Sec. 25.252;
P<INF>max(p)=maximum permissible interference power (in dBW) to the 
interfered-with station not to be exceeded for all but the short-term 
percentage of the time p from Sec. 25.252;
F<INF>r(p,f)=correction factor (in dB) to relate the effective short-
term percentage of the time p to 0.01 percent of the time, for 
precipitation scatter propagation mechanisms, as determined from figure 
3 of this section;
f=frequency (in GHz);
L<INF>w=receiving system transmission line loss (in dB); assumed to be 
zero in calculation of rain scatter contour.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MR91.056

This normalized rain scatter coordination loss L<INF>r (0.01) is then 
used with the appropriate figure 4 and the frequency f to determine the 
rain scatter coordination distance d<INF>cr.

Sec. 25.255   Guidelines for performing interference analyses for near great circle propagation mechanisms.

    (a) Once a great circle coordination distance contour has been 
computed a proposed earth station in accordance with Sec. 25.253, it is 
necessary to determine the likelihood of harmful interference between 
the proposed earth station and each existing or proposed terrestrial 
station located within that contour sharing the same frequency band(s). 
Before performing the detailed interference analyses described in 
paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, the earth station applicant 
may perform a preliminary interference analysis that will usually 
eliminate a significant number of terrestrial stations from further 
consideration. (This same type of preliminary analysis may also be 
employed by terrestrial station applicants effecting coordination with 
existing or proposed earth stations.) This preliminary interference 
analysis takes the form of a refinement of the coordination distance 
calculation of Sec. 25.253 using the antenna gain of each terrestrial 
station in the direction of the earth station, determined in accordance 
with paragraph (d)(3) of this section, instead of the maximum 
terrestrial antenna gain.
    (b) A detailed interference analysis must be performed for each 
possible interference path which cannot be eliminated from further 
consideration in regard to harmful interference by means of a 
preliminary analysis of the type described in paragraph (a) of this 
section. In order that a uniform procedure be employed by all applicants 
to assess the likelihood of interference between specific terrestrial 
stations and specific earth stations, a detailed interference analysis 
for near great-circle propagation mechanisms shall be performed by 
calculating the interference margin, P<INF>mar(p) in dB that is 
available for all but p percent of the time at the input to the receiver 
of the potentially interfered-with station from the formula

                 P<INF>mar(p)=P<INF>max(p)-P<INF>rec(p)

where:

P<INF>max(p)=maximum permissible interference power (in dBW) in the 
reference bandwidth at the receiver input of the potentially interfered-
with station not to be exceeded for all but p percent of the time, as 
calculated in Sec. 25.252;
P<INF>rec(p)=interference power (in dBW) in the reference bandwidth at 
the receiver input of the potentially interfered-with station not 
exceeded for all but p percent of the time, for near great circle 
propagation mechanisms, as calculated in paragraph (c) of this section.

Because of the different tropospheric propagation modes that may occur, 
it is necessary to calculate an interference margin P<INF>mar(p) for 
both: A short-term percentage of the time, for example, p=0.01 percent; 
and a long-term percentage of the time, specifically p=20 percent. If 
the interference margins calculated for both the short-

[[Page 349]]

term and the long-term percentages of the time are greater than zero, it 
may then be assumed that harmful interference will not be caused to the 
potentially interfered-with station by the potentially interfering 
station. Values of P<INF>max(p), for both the short-term and the long-
term percentages of the time, are to be determined in accordance with 
the formulas of Sec. 25.252 and the appropriate values from table 1 of 
Sec. 25.252, unless it is demonstrated to the Commission that another 
choice of values is more appropriate for the stations for which 
coordination is being effected.
    (c) The interference power P<INF>rec(p) in dBW in the reference 
bandwidth at the receiver input of the potentially interfered-with 
station not exceeded for all but p percent of the time is calculated 
from

            P<INF>rec(p)=P<INF>t+G<INF>t+G<INF>r-L<INF>w-L(p)

where:

P<INF>t=maximum available transmitting power (in dBW) in the reference 
bandwidth at the input to the transmitting antenna of the potentially 
interfering station,
G<INF>t=gain (in dB with respect to isotropic) of the transmitting 
antenna, of the potentially interfering station in the pertinent 
direction,
G<INF>r=gain (in dB with respect to isotropic) of the receiving antenna 
of the potentially interfered-with station in the pertinent direction,
L(p)=basic transmission loss (in dB) present between the two stations 
for all but p percent of the time,
L<INF>w=receiving system transmission line loss (in dB)

    (d) The following considerations apply to the selection of values 
assigned to the parameters of the formula of paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (1) The transmitting power P<INF>t!of the potentially interfering 
station is to be taken from the appropriate column of table 1 of 
Sec. 25.252, except that in cases where the actual power available at 
the antenna input of the potentially interfering station is known, this 
actual power should be used, subject to adjustment for any change in 
power expected in the foreseeable future for effective spectrum 
utilization and system performance. The values of the transmitting power 
P<INF>t for terrestrial stations set forth in table 1 of Sec. 25.252 are 
expressed in terms of total power and may be subject to adjustment to 
relate this total power to power in the reference bandwidth.
    (2) The gain of an earth station antenna, either G<INF>t or G<INF>r, 
is to be taken as the gain of the earth station antenna toward the 
horizon in the direction of the potentially interfered-with or 
interfering terrestrial station. For earth stations communicating with 
geostationary satellites, this gain is calculated by the procedure of 
Sec. 25.253(b).
    (3) The gain of a terrestrial station antenna, either G<INF>t or 
G<INF>r, is to be taken as the gain of the terrestrial antenna evaluated 
at an off-axis discrimination angle equal to the acute angle between the 
direction to the potentially interfering or interfered-with earth 
station and the direction to the adjacent terrestrial station in the 
radio relay system. Initially, it should be assumed that the sidelobe 
pattern of the terrestrial antenna meets only standard B of 
Sec. 21.108(c) of this chapter. If the results of this calculation 
indicates the likelihood of interference, the pattern of standard A 
should then be used. If such an antenna would eliminate the likelihood 
of interference, then the provisions of Sec. 21.109(c) of this chapter 
apply.
    (4) If the actual receiving system line loss, L<INF>w, of the 
potentially interfered-with station is known, it may be used in 
calculating the interference power. If unknown, zero dB must be assumed.
    (5) The calculation of the basic transmission loss L(p) available 
for all but p percent of the time, is to be done in accordance with the 
methods of NBS Technote 101, 1966 (Revised) judiciously applied and 
interpreted, taking into account the appropriate terrain characteristics 
and the appropriate tropospheric propagation mechanisms. Extrapolation 
of the methods and values given in Technote 101 to percentages of time 
less than 0.01 percent should be made cautiously.
    (e) Appendix 28 of the international radio regulations and certain 
reports and recommendations of the CCIR may provide additional 
information and serve as useful references. In particular, applicants 
and operators should be aware of the latest revisions of reports 244, 
382, and 448.

Sec. 25.256  Guidelines for performing interference analyses for precipitation scatter modes.

    (a) Once rain scatter coordination distance contours have been 
determined, it is necessary to determine the likelihood of impermissible 
levels of interference between the proposed earth station and each 
existing or proposed terrestrial station located within the rain scatter 
coordination distance.
    (b) It may be presumed that any interference caused by precipitation 
scatter propagation mechanisms will be acceptable and that the 
interference paths may be eliminated from interference if the 
interference margin Pmar (p) defined in Sec. 25.255(b) is greater than 
zero when the received interference power Prec (p) is computed on the 
basis of the available transmission loss between the earth station and 
terrestrial station due to scattering from precipitation.

personnel necessary to perform expeditiously the technical servicing and 
maintenance of the remote stations.
    (d) The licensee shall insure that the licensed facilities are 
properly secured against unauthorized access or use whenever an operator 
is not present at the transmitter.


<R05>
Sec. 25.272  General inter-system coordination procedures.

    (a) Each space station licensee in the Fixed-Satellite Service shall 
establish a satellite network control center which will have the 
responsibility to monitor space-to-Earth transmissions in its system. 
This would indirectly monitor uplink earth station transmissions in its 
system and to coordinate transmissions in its satellite system with 
those of other systems to prevent harmful interference incidents or, in 
the event of a harmful interference incident, to identify the source of 
the interference and correct the problem promptly.
    (b) Each space station licensee shall maintain on file with the 
Commission and with its Laurel, Maryland field office a current listing 
of the names, titles, addresses and telephone numbers of the points of 
contact for resolution of interference problems. Contact personnel 
should include those responsible for resolution of short term, immediate 
interference problems at the system control center, and those 
responsible for long term engineering and technical design issues.
    (c) The transmitting earth station licensee shall provide the 
operator(s) of the satellites, on which the licensee is authorized to 
transmit, contact telephone numbers for the control center of the earth 
station and emergency telephone numbers for key personnel; a current 
file of these contacts shall be maintained at each satellite system 
control center.

[[Page 352]]

    (d) An earth station licensee shall ensure that each of its 
authorized earth stations complies with the following:
    (1) The earth station licensee shall ensure that there is 
continuously available means of communications between the satellite 
network control center and the earth station operator or its remote 
control point as designated by the licensee.
    (2) The earth station operator shall notify the satellite network 
control center and receive permission from the control center before 
transmitting to the satellite or changing the basic characteristics of a 
transmission.
    (3) The earth station operator shall keep the space station licensee 
informed of all actual and planned usage.
    (4) Upon approval of the satellite network control center, the earth 
station operator may radiate an RF carrier into the designated 
transponder. Should improper illumination of the transponder or undue 
adjacent transponder interference be observed by the satellite network 
control center, the earth station operator shall immediately take 
whatever measures are needed to eliminate the problem.
    (5) The space station licensee may delegate the responsibility and 
duties of the satellite network control center to a technically 
qualified user or group of users, but the space station licensee shall 
remain ultimately responsible for the performance of those duties.


<R05>
Sec. 25.273   Duties regarding space communications transmissions.

    (a) No person shall:
    (1) Transmit to a satellite unless the specific transmission is 
first authorized by the satellite network control center;
    (2) Conduct transmissions over a transponder unless the operator is 
authorized by the satellite licensee or the satellite licensee's 
successor in interest to transmit at that time; or
    (3) Transmit in any manner that causes unacceptable interference to 
the authorized transmission of another licensee.
    (b) Satellite operators shall provide upon request by the Commission 
and by earth station licensees authorized to transmit on their 
satellites relevant information needed to avoid unacceptable 
interference to other users, including the polarization angles for 
proper illumination of a given transponder.
    (c) Space station licensees are responsible for maintaining complete 
and accurate technical details of current and planned transmissions over 
their satellites, and shall require that authorized users of 
transponders on their satellites, whether by tariff or contract, provide 
any necessary technical information in this regard including that 
required by Sec. 25.272. Based on this information, space station 
licensees shall exchange among themselves general technical information 
concerning current and planned transmission parameters as needed to 
identify and promptly resolve any potential cases of unacceptable 
interference between their satellite systems.
    (d) Space stations authorized after May 10, 1993 which do not 
satisfy the requirements of Sec. 25.210 may be required to accept 
greater constraints in resolving interference problems than complying 
ones. The extent of these constraints shall be determined on a case-by-
case basis.


<R05>
Sec. 25.274   Procedures to be followed in the event of harmful interference.

    (a) The earth station operator whose transmission is suffering 
harmful interference shall first check the earth station equipment to 
ensure that the equipment is functioning properly.
    (b) The earth station operator shall then check all other earth 
stations in the licensee's network that could be causing the harmful 
interference to ensure that none of the licensee's earth stations are 
the source of the interference and to verify that the source of 
interference is not from a local terrestrial source.
    (c) After the earth station operator has determined that the source 
of the interference is not another earth station operating in the same 
network or from a terrestrial source, the earth station operator shall 
contact the satellite system control center and advise the satellite 
operator of the problem. The control center operator shall observe the 
interference incident and make reasonable efforts to determine the 
source of the problem. A record

[[Page 353]]

shall be maintained by the control center operator and the earth station 
operator of all harmful interference incidents and their resolution. 
These records shall be made available to an FCC representative on 
request.
    (d) Where the suspected source of the interference incident is the 
operation of an earth station licensed to operate on one or more of the 
satellites in the satellite operator's system, the control center 
operator shall advise the offending earth station of the harmful 
interference incident and assist in the resolution of the problem where 
reasonably possible.
    (e) The earth station licensee whose operations are suspected of 
causing harmful interference to the operations of another earth station 
shall take reasonable measures to determine whether its operations are 
the source of the harmful interference problem. Where the operations of 
the suspect earth station are the source of the interference, the 
licensee of that earth station shall take all measures necessary to 
eliminate the interference.
    (f) At any point, the system control center operator may contact the 
Commission's Laurel, Maryland office to assist in resolving the matter. 
This office specializes in the resolution of satellite interference 
problems. All licensees are required to cooperate fully with the 
Commission in any investigation of interference problems.
    (g) Where the earth station suspected of causing interference to the 
operations of another earth station cannot be identified or is 
identified as an earth station operating on a satellite system other 
than the one on which the earth station suffering undue interference is 
operating, it is the responsibility of a representative of the earth 
station suffering harmful interference to contact the control center of 
other satellite systems.


<R05>
Sec. 25.275  Particulars of operation.

    (a) Radio station authorizations issued under this part will 
normally specify only the frequency bands authorized for transmission 
and/or reception of the station.
    (b) When authorized frequency bands are specified in the station 
authorization, the licensee is authorized to transmit any number of r.f. 
carriers on any discrete frequencies within an authorized frequency band 
in accordance with the other terms and conditions of the authorization 
and the requirements of this part. Specific r.f. carrier frequencies 
within the authorized frequency band shall be selected by the licensee 
to avoid unacceptable levels of interference being caused to other 
earth, space or terrestrial stations. Any coordination agreements, both 
domestic and international, concerning specific frequency usage 
constraints, including non-use of any particular frequencies within the 
frequency bands listed in the station authorization, are considered to 
be conditions of the station authorization.
    (c) A license for a transmitting earth station will normally specify 
only the r.f. carriers having the highest e.i.r.p. density, the

systems must operate in accordance with the conditions specified in this 
section.
    (1) Coordination requirements with federal government users. (i) In 
frequency bands allocated for use by the inter-satellite service that 
are also authorized for use by agencies of the federal government, the 
federal use of frequencies in the inter-satellite service frequency 
bands is under the regulatory jurisdiction of the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).
    (ii) The Commission will use its existing procedures to reach 
agreement with NTIA to achieve compatible operations between federal 
government users under the jurisdiction of NTIA and inter-satellite 
service systems

[[Page 355]]

through frequency assignment and coordination practice established by 
NTIA and the Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC). In order 
to facilitate such frequency assignment and coordination, applicants 
shall provide the Commission with sufficient information to evaluate 
electromagnetic compatibility with the federal government users of the 
spectrum, and any additional information requested by the Commission. As 
part of the coordination process, applicants shall show that they will 
not cause interference to authorized federal government users, based 
upon existing system information provided by the government. The 
frequency assignment and coordination of the satellite system shall be 
completed prior to grant of construction authorization.
    (2) Coordination among inter-satellite service systems. Applicants 
for authority to establish inter-satellite service are encouraged to 
coordinate their proposed frequency usage with existing permittees and 
licensees in the inter-satellite service whose facilities could be 
affected by the new proposal in terms of frequency interference or 
restricted system capacity. All affected applicants, permittees, and 
licensees, shall at the direction of the Commission, cooperate fully and 
make every reasonable effort to resolve technical problems and conflicts 
that may inhibit effective and efficient use of the radio spectrum; 
however, the permittee or licensee being coordinated with is not 
obligated to suggest changes or re-engineer an applicant's proposal in 
cases involving conflicts.

                   Subpart E--Developmental Operations


<R05>
Sec. 25.300   Developmental operation.

    (a) Scope of service: Communication-Satellite developmental stations 
will be permitted to conduct the following types of operations:
    (1) The development of new techniques which give promise of 
improvement in the space radiocommunication service;
    (2) The development and testing of equipment intended for use in the 
space radiocommunication service;
    (3) Path loss tests necessary to the location of newly proposed 
earth stations in the space radiocommunication service.
    (b) Eligibility: An authorization for developmental operation of a 
station in the space radiocommunication service may be issued only to 
qualified parties who make a showing that they may be reasonably 
expected to contribute to the development of the space 
radiocommunication service.
    (c) Forms to be used: A separate application for construction permit 
shall be submitted on FCC Form 493 for each earth station. No form is 
used for space stations. See Sec. 25.114 for information to be supplied 
in space station applications.
    (d) Showing required: Each application for developmental operation 
shall be accompanied by a showing that:
    (1) The applicant has an organized plan leading to a specific 
objective in the development of the space radiocommunication service.
    (2) A point has been reached in the program where transmission by 
radio will be essential to the further progress thereof.
    (3) The public interest, convenience, or necessity will be served by 
the proposed operation.
    (4) In the event that the applicant seeks authority to construct and 
operate a space station, capable of being placed in earth orbit and 
communicating with earth stations, the Commission may require a 
statement which discloses that arrangements have been made between the 
applicant and an entity authorized to operate an earth station for 
transmission of communications signals to or reception of communications 
signals from such earth station.
    (5) In the event that the applicant seeks authority to construct and 
operate an earth station capable of operating with a space station, the 
Commission may require a statement which discloses that arrangements

authority to engage in developmental operation shall be accompanied by a 
statement signed by the applicant in which it is agreed that any 
authorization issued pursuant thereto will be accepted with the express 
understanding of the applicant that it is subject to change in any of 
its terms or to cancellation in its entirety at any time, upon 
reasonable notice but without hearing, if, in the opinion of the 
Commission, circumstances should so require.
    (f) Frequencies available for assignment: Stations engaged in 
developmental operations may be authorized to use frequencies allocated 
to the space radiocommunication service. When development earth stations 
propose to operate in bands shared with terrestrial stations, the 
applicant for a developmental earth station authorization shall comply 
with the coordination requirements of Sec. 25.203. Applications 
proposing the operation or performance testing of communication-
satellite space stations on the ground must include a showing that 
harmful interference will not be caused to the operation of licensed 
terrestrial stations. Requests for frequencies other than those 
allocated to the space radiocommunication service must be supported by a

programs are not covered by the provisions of this chapter, the 
Commission may specify supplemental or additional requirements or 
conditions in each case, as deemed necessary in the public interest, 
convenience or necessity. The Commission may from time to time require a 
station engaged in developmental work to conduct such special tests as 
it finds are reasonable or desirable in connection with the authorized 
developmental program.
    (k) Term of authorization: Licenses for developmental operation 
shall be issued for a term of 1 year, renewable

[[Page 357]]

upon request, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (o) of this 
section.
    (l) Report of operation: A report on the result of the developmental 
program shall be filed within 60 days of the expiration of the 
authorization. A licensee may request that its reports and associated 
material not be made public and the Commission will determine whether, 
in the light of applicable provisions of law and the requirements of the 
public interest, such request will be granted. The report shall include 
comprehensive and detailed information on the following:
    (1) The final objective.
    (2) Analysis of the results of operation obtained to date.
    (3) Number of hours of operation on each frequency.
    (4) Copies of any published reports.
    (m) Renewal of license: If the developmental program cannot be 
concluded during the license term an application for renewal of license 
should be submitted on FCC Form 405 within 90 days but not later than 30 
days prior to the end of the license term. The report of operation as 
provided in paragraph (n) of this section and in addition, a statement 
in which the need for continuation of the program is clearly explained, 
should be attached. In any case in which the licensee has in accordance 
with the provisions of the chapter, made timely and sufficient 
application for renewal of license, no license with reference to any 
activity of continuing nature shall expire until the disposition of such 
application shall have been finally determined.

<R04>
                  Subpart B--Applications and Licenses


<R05>
Sec. 26.11  Initial authorization.

    (a) An applicant must file an application for an initial 
authorization in each market and frequency block desired.
    (b) Blanket licenses are granted for each market and frequency 
block. Applications for individual sites are not required and will not 
be accepted.


<R05>
Sec. 26.12  Eligibility.

    Any entity, other than those precluded by section 310 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. Sec. 310, is eligible 
to hold a license under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 26.13  License period.

    Licenses for service areas will be granted for ten year terms from 
the date of original issuance or renewal.


<R05>
Sec. 26.14  Criteria for comparative renewal proceedings.

    A renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding 
shall receive a preference, commonly referred to as a renewal 
expectancy, which is the most important comparative factor to be 
considered in the proceeding, if its past record for the relevant 
license period demonstrates that the renewal applicant:
    (a) Has provided ``substantial'' service during its past license 
term. ``Substantial'' service is defined as service which is sound, 
favorable, and substantially above a level of mediocre service which 
might just minimally warrant renewal; and
    (b) Has substantially complied with applicable Commission rules, 
policies and the Communications Act.


<R04>
                     Subpart C--Technical Standards


<R05>
Sec. 26.51  Equipment authorization.

    (a) Each transmitter utilized for operation under this part and each 
transmitter marketed, as set forth in Sec. 2.803 of this chapter, must 
be of a type that has been authorized by the Commission under its type 
acceptance procedure.
    (b) The Commission periodically publishes a list of type accepted 
equipment, entitled ``Radio Equipment List, Equipment Accepted for 
Licensing.'' Copies of this list are available for public reference at 
the Commission's offices in Washington, D.C., at each of its field 
offices, and may be ordered from its copy contractor.
    (c) Any manufacturer of radio transmitting equipment to be used in 
these services may request equipment authorization following the 
procedures set forth in Subpart J of part 2 of this chapter. Equipment 
authorization for an individual transmitter may be requested by an 
applicant for a station authorization by following the procedures set 
forth in part 2 of this chapter. Such equipment if approved or accepted 
will not normally be included in the Commission's Radio Equipment List 
but will be individually enumerated on the station authorization.
    (d) Applicants for type acceptance of transmitters that operate in 
these services must determine that the equipment complies with IEEE 
C95.1-1991, (ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1991), ``IEEE Standards for Safety Levels 
with Respect to Human Exposure to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic 
Fields, 3 kHz to 300 GHz'' as measured using methods specified in IEEE 
C95.3-1991, (ANSI/

[[Page 364]]

IEEE C95.3-1991), ``Recommended Practice for the Measurement of 
Potentially Hazardous Electromagnetic Fields--RF and Microwave.'' The 
applicant for type acceptance is required to submit a statement 
affirming that the equipment complies with these standards as measured 
by an approved method and to maintain a record showing the basis for the 
statement of compliance with IEEE C.95.1-1991. (See Sec. 26.52 for 
availability of IEEE standards.)


<R05>
Sec. 26.52  RF hazards.

    (a) Licensees and manufacturers are required to ensure that their 
facilities and equipment comply with IEEE C95.1-1991. Measurement 
methods are specified in IEEE C95.3-1991. Copies of these standards are 
available from IEEE Standards Board, 445 Hoes Lane, P.O. Box 1331, 
Piscataway, NJ 08855-1331. Telephone: 1-800-678-4333. The limits for 
both ``controlled'' and ``uncontrolled'' environments, as defined by 
IEEE C95.1-1991, will apply to all GWCS base and mobile stations, as 
appropriate. The application for equipment authorization must contain a 
statement confirming compliance with IEEE C95.1-1991. Technical 
information showing the basis for this statement must be submitted to 
the Commission upon request.
    (b) GWCS hand-held devices whose maximum radiated power is 100 
milliwatts or less are not required to be evaluated for compliance with 
ANSI/IEEE SAR (specific absorption rate) requirements, as long as 2.5 cm 
separation distance is maintained between the radiating structure and 
the body of the user. (The ANSI/IEEE standard uses the term ``radiated 
power,'' meaning input power to the antenna.)
    (c) For further information on the Commission's environmental rules 
see Secs. 1.1301 through 1.1319 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 26.53  Emission limits.

    (a) The power of any emission at the edges of the 4660-4685 MHz band 
shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) by at least 43 + 10 
log<INF>10(P) or 80 decibels, whichever is less.
    (b) Compliance with these provisions is based on the use of 
measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz or 
greater. However, in the 1 MHz bands immediately outside and adjacent to 
the frequency block a resolution bandwidth of at least one percent of 
the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the transmitter 
may be employed. The emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the 
signal between two points, one below the carrier center frequency and 
one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which all emission 
are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power.
    (c) When measuring the emission limits, the nominal carrier 
frequency shall be adjusted as close to the license's frequency block 
edges, both upper and lower, as the design permits.
    (d) The measurements of emission power can be expressed in peak or 
average values, provided that they are expressed in the same parameters 
as the transmission power.
    (e) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes 
harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require 
greater attenuation than specified in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 26.54  Frequency stability.

    The frequency stability shall be sufficient to ensure that the 
fundamental emission stays within the authorized frequency block.


<R05>
Sec. 26.55  Field strength limits.

    The predicted or measured median field strength at any location on 
the border of the GWCS service area shall not exceed 55 dBu unless 
licensees operating in adjacent areas agree to higher field strength 
along their mutual borders.


<R04>
                        Subpart D--Miscellaneous


<R05>
Sec. 26.101  Multiple ownership restrictions.

    (a) GWCS licensees shall not have an ownership interest in more than 
three of the five, 5 megahertz wide channels available in any geographic 
area. For purposes of this restriction, a GWCS licensee is:
    (1) Any institutional investor, as defined in Sec. 26.4, with an 
ownership interest of ten or more percent in a GWCS license; and

[[Page 365]]

    (2) Any other person or entity with an ownership interest of five or 
more percent in a GWCS license.
    (b) In cases where a party had indirect ownership, through an 
interest in an intervening entity (or entities) that has ownership in 
the GWCS license, that indirect ownership shall be attributable if the 
percentages of ownership at each level, multiplied together, equal five 
or more percent ownership of the GWCS license, except that if the 
ownership percentage for an interest in any link in the chain exceeds 50 
percent or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were 
a 100 percent interest.

    Example. Party X has a non-controlling ownership interest of 25 
percent in Company Y, which in turn has a non-controlling ownership 
interest of 10 percent in Company Z, the GWCS licensee. Party X's 
effective ownership interest in Company Z is Party X's ownership 
interest in Company Y (25 percent) times Company Y's ownership interest 
in Company Z (10 percent). Therefore, Party X's effective ownership 
interest in Company Z is 2.5 percent, and is not attributable.

    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, the following 
interests shall not constitute attributable ownership interests for 
purposes of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (1) A limited partnership interest held by an institutional investor 
(as defined Sec. 26.4) where the limited partner is not materially 
involved, directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of the 
GWCS holdings of the partnership, and the licensee so certifies. The 
criteria which would assure adequate insulation for the purposes of this 
certification require:
    (i) Prohibiting limited partners from acting as employees of the 
limited partnership if responsibilities relate to the carrier activities 
of the licensee;
    (ii) Barring the limited partners from serving as independent 
contractors;
    (iii) Restricting communication among limited partners and the 
general partner regarding day-to-day activities of the licensee;
    (iv) Empowering the general partner to veto admissions of new 
general partners;
    (v) Restricting the circumstances in which the limited partners can 
remove the general partner;
    (vi) Prohibiting the limited partners from providing services to the 
partnership relating to the GWCS holdings of the licensee; and
    (vii) Stating that the limited partners may not become involved in 
the management or operation of the licensee.


<R05>
Sec. 26.102  Service areas.

    GWCS service areas are based on Economic Areas developed by the 
Bureau of Economic Analysis, Department of Commerce, referred to as 
``EAs'' and three additional EA-like service areas: Guam and the 
Northern Mariana Islands (combined as one service area), Puerto Rico and 
the United States Virgin Islands (combined as one service area), and 
American Samoa.
    (a) Economic Areas. Codes from 001 to 172 are assigned to the EAs in 
approximate geographic order, beginning with 001 in northern Maine, 
continuing south to Florida, then north to the Great Lakes, and 
continuing in a serpentine pattern to the West Coast. Except for the 
Western Oklahoma EA (126), the Northern Michigan EA (058), and the 17 
EAs that mainly correspond to consolidated metropolitan statistical 
areas (CMSAs), each EA is named for the metropolitan area or city that 
is the node of its largest component economic area (CEA) and that is 
usually, but not always, the largest metropolitan area or city in the 
EA. Each CEA consists of a single economic node and the surrounding 
counties that are economically related to the node. The following list 
provides EA codes and names.

    Mutually exclusive initial applications to provide GWCS service are 
subject to competitive bidding procedures. The general competitive 
bidding procedures found in 47 CFR Part 1, Subpart Q, will apply unless 
otherwise provided in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 26.202  Competitive bidding design for GWCS licensing.

    (a) The Commission will employ the following competitive bidding 
designs when choosing from among mutually exclusive initial applications 
to provide GWCS service:
    (1) Simultaneous multiple round actions
    (2) Sequential oral auctions
    (b) The Commission may design and test alternative procedures. The 
Commission will announce by Public Notice before each auction the 
competitive bidding design to be employed in a particular auction.
    (c) The Commission may use single combined auctions, which combine 
bidding for two or more substitutable licenses and award licenses to the 
highest bidders until the available licenses are exhausted. This 
technique may be used in conjunction with any type of auction.


<R05>
Sec. 26.203  Competitive bidding mechanisms.

    (a) Sequencing. The Commission will establish and may vary the 
sequence in which GWCS licenses will be auctioned.
    (b) Reservation price. The Commission may establish a reservation 
price, either disclosed or undisclosed, below which a license subject to 
auction will not be awarded.
    (c) Minimum bid increments. The Commission may, by announcement 
before or during an auction, require minimum bid increments in dollar or 
percentage terms. The Commission may also establish by Public Notice a 
suggested opening bid or a minimum opening bid on each license.
    (d) Stopping rules. The Commission may establish stopping rules 
before or during multiple round auctions in order to terminate an 
auction within a reasonable time.
    (e) Activity rules. The Commission may establish activity rules 
which require a minimum amount of bidding activity. In the event that 
the Commission establishes an activity rule in connection with a 
simultaneous multiple round auction, each bidder will be entitled to 
request and will be automatically granted one activity rule waiver 
during each stage of an auction, or one automatic waiver during a 
specified number of bidding rounds. The Commission may change by Public 
Notice the number and frequency of such automatic activity rule waivers 
for a specific auction.
    (f) Bidder identification during auctions. The Commission may 
choose, on an auction-by-auction basis, to release the identity of the 
bidders associated with bidder identification numbers. The Commission 
will announce by Public Notice before each auction whether bidder 
identities will be revealed.
    (g) Nationwide bidders. Bidders seeking to aggregate EA-based GWCS 
licenses into nationwide licenses are required to declare the number of 
nationwide aggregations for which they will bid and to be active in 
every round of bidding on sufficient licenses to create the number of 
declared aggregations.


<R05>
Sec. 26.204  Withdrawal, default and disqualification penalties.

    (a) When the Commission conducts a simultaneous multiple round 
auction pursuant to Sec. 26.202(a)(1), the Commission will impose 
penalties on bidders who withdraw high bids during the course of an 
auction, or who default on payments due after an auction closes or who 
are disqualified.
    (1) Bid withdrawal prior to close of auction. A bidder who withdraws 
a high bid during the course of an auction will be subject to a penalty 
equal to the difference between the amount bid and the amount of the 
winning bid the next time the license is offered by

[[Page 369]]

the Commission. No withdrawal penalty would be assessed if the 
subsequent winning bid exceeds the withdrawn bid. This penalty amount 
will be deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the 
withdrawing bidder has deposited with the Commission. The withdrawal 
penalty for a nationwide bidder for each aggregation is limited to 5 
percent of the aggregate withdrawn bids. The withdrawal penalty for a 
nationwide bidder is calculated between the sum of the withdrawn bids 
and the sum of the subsequent high bids on the withdrawn licenses.
    (2) Default or disqualification after close of auction. If a high 
bidder defaults or is disqualified after the close of such an auction, 
the defaulting bidder will be subject to the penalty in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section plus an additional penalty equal to three (3) percent of 
the subsequent winning bid. If the subsequent winning bid. If the 
subsequent winning bid exceeds the defaulting bidder's bid amount, the 3 
percent penalty will be calculated based on the defaulting bidder's bid 
amount. These amounts will be deducted from any upfront payments or down 
payments that the defaulting or disqualified bidder has deposited with 
the Commission.
    (b) When the Commission conducts sequential oral auctions, the 
Commission may modify the penalties to be paid in the event of bid 
withdrawal, default disqualification; provided, however, that such 
penalties shall not exceed the penalties specified above.
    (c) In the case of single round bidding for GWCS licenses:
    (1) If a bid is withdrawn before the Commission releases the initial 
Public Notice announcing the winning bidder(s), no bid withdrawal 
penalty will be assessed.
    (2) If a bid is withdrawn after the Commission releases the initial 
Public Notice announcing the winning bidder(s), the bid withdrawal 
penalty will be equal to the difference between the high bid amount and 
the amount of the next highest valid bid. A bid will be considered valid 
for this purpose if the bidder has not already been designated the 
winning bidder on more licenses than it is permitted to be awarded. 
Losing bidders will only be subject to this bid withdrawal penalty for a 
period of 30 days after the Commission releases the initial Public 
Notice announcing the winning bidders.
    (d) In the case of oral sequential bidding for GWCS licenses:
    (1) If a bid is withdrawn before the Commission has declared the 
bidding to be closed for the license bid on, no bid withdrawal penalty 
will be assessed.
    (2) If a bid is withdrawn after the Commission has declared the 
bidding to be closed for the license bid on, the bid withdrawal penalty 
of Sec. 1.2104(g) of this chapter and paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of 
this section will apply.

notified that they are the winning bidder. Applications on FCC Form XXX 
shall be submitted pursuant to the procedures set forth in subpart G of 
this part and Sec. 1.2107 (c) and (d) of this chapter and any associated 
Public Notices. Only auction winners will be eligible to file 
applications on FCC Form XXX for initial GWCS licenses in the event of 
mutual exclusivity between applicants filing Form 175. Winning bidders 
need not complete Schedule B to Form XXX.


<R05>
Sec. 26.208  License grant, denial, default, and disqualification.

    (a) Unless eligible for installment payments and/or a bidding 
credit, each winning bidder is required to pay the balance of its 
winning bid in a lump sum payment within five (5) business days 
following the award of the license. Grant of the license will be 
conditioned upon full and timely payment of the winning bid amount.
    (b) A bidder who withdraws its bid, defaults on a payment or is 
disqualified will be subject to the penalties specified in Sec. 1.2109 
of this Chapter.
    (c) An eligible small business may elect to pay its winning bid, 
less up-front payments, over the terms of the license. Interest charges 
are fixed at the time of licensing at the rate equal to U.S. Treasury 
obligation plus 2.5 percent. Installment payments are due quarterly on 
the anniversary of the day the license was granted, except that 
interest-only installment payments are permitted during the first two 
years of the license.


<R05>
Sec. 26.209  Eligibility for partitioned licenses.

    (a) Notwithstanding Sec. 26.102, an applicant that is a rural 
telephone company, as defined in Sec. 26.4, may be granted a GWCS 
license that is geographically partitioned from a separately licensed 
EA, so long as the EA applicant or licensee has voluntarily agreed (in 
writing) to partition a portion of the license to the rural telephone 
company.
    (b) If partitioned licenses are being applied for in conjunction 
with a license(s) to be awarded through competitive biding procedures--
    (1) The applicable procedures for filing short-form applications and 
for submitting upfront payments and down payments contained in this part 
and Part 1 of this chapter shall be followed by the applicant, who must 
disclose as part of its short-form application all parties to 
agreement(s) with or among rural telephone companies to partition the 
license pursuant to this section, if won at auction (see 
Sec. 1.2105(a)(2)(viii));
    (2) Each rural telephone company that is a party to an agreement to 
partition the license shall file a long-form application for its 
respective, mutually agreed-upon geographic area together with the 
application for the remainder of the EA filed by the auction winner.
    (c) If the partitioned license is being applied for as a partial 
assignment of the EA license following grant of the initial license, 
request for authorization for partial assignment of a license shall be 
made pursuant to Sec. 26.324.
    (d) Each application for a partitioned area (long-form initial 
application or partial assignment application) shall contain a 
partitioning plan that must propose to establish a partitioned area to 
be licensed that meets the following criteria:
    (1) Conforms to established geopolitical boundaries (such as county 
lines);
    (2) Includes the wireline service area of the rural telephone 
company applicant; and
    (3) Is reasonably related to the rural telephone company's wireline 
service area.

    Note to paragraph (d)(3): A partitioned service area will be 
presumed to be reasonably related to the rural telephone company's 
wireline service area if the partitioned service area contains no more 
than twice the population overlap between the rural telephone company's 
wireline service area and the partitioned area.

    (e) Each licensee in each partitioned area will be responsible for 
meeting the

[[Page 371]]

construction requirements in its area (see Sec. 26.104).


<R05>
Sec. 26.210  Provisions for small businesses.

    (a) Bidding credits. A winning bidder that qualifies as a small 
business or a consortium of small businesses may use a bidding credit of 
ten percent to lower the cost of its winning bid.
    (b) Installment payments. A winning bidder that qualifies as a small 
business may pay its winning bid amount (less upfront payments) in 
installments over the ten year term of the license, with interest 
charges to be fixed at the time of licensing at a rate equal to the rate 
for ten year U.S. Treasury obligations plus 2.5 percent. Installment 
payments are due quarterly on the anniversary of the day the license is 
granted. Failure to make timely installment payments may result in 
revocation of the license. Small businesses are permitted to make 
interest-only installment payments during the first two years of the 
license.
    (c) Down payments. A winning bidder that qualifies as a small 
business is permitted to make a down payment equal to 5 percent of the 
winning bid due five days after the auction closes with the remaining 5 
percent down payment dues five days after Public Notice that the license 
is ready for grant.
    (d) Unjust enrichment. If a licensee that utilizes a bidding credit 
under this section seeks to assign or transfer control of its license to 
an entity not meeting the eligibility standards for bidding credits or 
seeks to make any other change in ownership that would result in the 
licensee no longer qualifying for bidding credits under this section, 
the licensee must seek Commission approval and reimburse the government 
for the amount of the bidding credit, plus interest at the rate imposed 
for installment financing at the time the license was awarded as a 
condition of the approval of such assignment, transfer or other 
ownership change. The amount of the payment would be reduced over time 
so that a transfer in the first two years of the license would result in 
a payment of 100 percent of the value of the bidding credit; in year 
three of the license term the payment would be 75 percent; in year four 
the payment would be 50 percent and in year five the payment would be 25 
percent, after which there would be no payment. Transfer of control or 
assignment of station license is also subject to provisions of 
Sec. 1.2111 of this chapter.

runway longer than 1 km within 6.1 km of the antenna structure.
    (2) 2 m above the airport elevation for each 100 m from the nearest 
runway shorter than 1 km within 3.1 km of the antenna structure.
    (3) 4 m above the airport elevation for each 100 m from the nearest 
landing pad within 1.5 km of the antenna structure.
    (c) A GWCS station antenna structure no higher than 6.1 m (10 feet) 
above ground level at its site or no higher than 6.1 m above any natural 
object or existing manmade structure, other than an antenna structure, 
is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section.
    (d) Further details as to whether an aeronautical study and/or 
obstruction marking and lighting may be required, and specifications for 
obstruction marking and lighting are contained in Part 17 of this 
chapter, Construction, Marking and Lighting of Antenna Structures. To 
request approval to place an antenna structure higher than the limits 
specified in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, the licensee 
must notify the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on FAA Form 7460-1 
and the FCC on FCC Form 854.


<R05>
Sec. 26.310  Waiver of rules.

    (a) Request for waivers. (1) Waivers of these rules may be granted 
upon application or by the Commission on its own motion. Requests for 
waivers shall contain a statement of reasons sufficient to justify a 
waiver. Waivers will not be granted except upon an affirmative showing:
    (i) That the underlying purpose of the rule will not be served, or 
would be frustrated, by its application in a particular case, and that 
grant of the waiver is otherwise in the public interest; or
    (ii) That the unique facts and circumstances of a particular case 
render application of the rule inequitable, unduly burdensome or 
otherwise contrary to the public interest. Applicants must also show the 
lack of a reasonable alternative.

[[Page 376]]

    (2) If the information necessary to support a waiver request is 
already on file, the applicant may cross-reference to the specific 
filing where it may be found.
    (b) Denial of waiver, alternate showing required. If a waiver is not 
granted, the application will be dismissed as defective unless the 
applicant has also provided an alternative proposal which complies with 
the Commission's rules (including any required showings).


<R05>
Sec. 26.311  Defective applications.

    (a) Unless the Commission shall otherwise permit, an application 
will be unacceptable for filing and will be returned to the applicant 
with a brief statement as to the omissions or discrepancies if:
    (1) The application is defective with respect to completeness of 
answers to questions, informational showings, executive, or other 
matters of a formal character; or
    (2) The application does not comply with the Commission's rules, 
regulations, specific requirements for additional information or other 
requirements. See also Sec. 1.2105 of this chapter.
    (b) Some examples of common deficiencies which result in defective 
applications under paragraph (a) of this section are:
    (1) The application is not filled out completely and signed;
    (2) The application (other an application filed on FCC Form 175) 
does not include an environmental assessment as required for an action 
that may have a significant impact upon the environment, as defined in 
Sec. 1.1307 of this chapter.
    (3) The application is filed prior to the Public Notice issued under 
Sec. 26.317 announcing the application filing date for the relevant 
auction or after the cutoff date prescribed in that Public Notice;
    (c) If an applicant is requested by the Commission to file any 
documents or any supplementary or explanatory information not 
specifically required in the prescribed application form, a failure to 
comply with such request within a specified time period will be deemed 
to render the application defective and will subject it to dismissal.


<R05>
Sec. 26.312  Inconsistent or conflicting applications.

    While an application is pending and undecided, no subsequent 
inconsistent or conflicting application may be filed by the same 
applicant, his successor or assignee, or on behalf or for the benefit of 
the same applicant, his successor or assignee.


<R05>
Sec. 26.313  Amendment of application for General Wireless Communications Service filed on FCC Form 175.

    (a) The Commission will provide bidders a limited opportunity to 
cure defects in FCC Form 175 specified herein except for failure to sign 
the application and to make certifications. These are defects which may 
not be cured. See also Sec. 1.2105 of this chapter.
    (b) For GWCS, applicants will be permitted to amend their Form 175 
applications to make minor amendments to correct minor errors or defects 
such as typographical errors. Applicants will also be permitted to amend 
FCC Form 175, to make ownership changes or changes in the identification 
of parties to bidding consortia, provided such changes do not result in 
a change in control of the applicant and do not involve another 
applicant (or parties in interest to an applicant) who has applied for 
any of the same licenses as the applicant. Amendments which change 
control of the applicant will be considered major amendments. An FCC 
Form 175 which is amended by a major amendment will be considered to be 
newly filed and cannot be resubmitted after applicable filing deadlines. 
See also Sec. 1.2105 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 26.314  Amendment of applications for General Wireless Communications Service (other than applications filed on FCC Form 175).

    This section applies to all applications for General Wireless 
Communications Service other than applications filed on FCC Form 175.
    (a) Amendments as of right. A pending application may be amended as 
a matter or right if the application has not been designated for 
hearing.
    (1) Amendments shall comply with Sec. 26.319, as applicable; and

[[Page 377]]

    (2) Amendments which resolve interference conflicts or amendments 
under Sec. 26.319 may be filed at any time.
    (b) The Commission or the presiding officer may grant requests to 
amend an application designated for hearing only if a written petition 
demonstrating good cause is submitted and properly served upon the 
parties of record.
    (c) Major amendments, minor amendments. The Commission will classify 
all amendments as minor except in the cases listed below. An amendment 
shall be deemed to be a major amendment subject to Sec. 26.317 under any 
of the following circumstances:
    (1) Change in technical proposal. If the amendment results in a 
substantial change in the engineering proposal such as (but not 
necessarily limited to) a change in, or an addition of, a radio 
frequency; or
    (2) Amendment to proposed service area. If the amendment extends the 
reliable service area of the proposed facilities outside its EA or other 
applicable market area as defined in Sec. 26.102; or
    (3) A substantial change in ownership or control.
    (d) If a petition to deny (or other formal objection) has been 
filed, any amendment, requests for waiver, (or other written 
communications) shall be served on the petitioner, unless waiver of this 
requirement is granted pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. See 
also Sec. 1.2108 of this chapter.
    (e) The Commission may waive the service requirements of paragraph 
(d) of this section and prescribe such alternative procedures as may be 
appropriate under the circumstances to protect petitioners' interests 
and to avoid undue delay in a proceeding, if an applicant submits a 
request for waiver which demonstrates that the service requirement is 
unreasonably burdensome.
    (f) Any amendment to an application shall be signed and shall be 
submitted in the same manner, and with the same number of copies, as was 
the original application. Amendments may be made in letter form if they 
comply in all other respects with the requirements of this chapter.
    (g) An application will be considered to be a newly filed 
application if it is amended by a major amendment (as defined in this 
section), except in the following circumstances:
    (1) The amendment reflects only a change in ownership or control 
found by the Commission to be in the public interest;
    (2) The amendment corrects typographical transcription, or similar 
clerical errors which are clearly demonstrated to be mistakes by 
reference to other parts of the application, and whose discovery does 
not create new or increased frequency conflicts;
    (3) The amendment does not create new or increased frequency 
conflicts, and is demonstrably necessitated by events which the 
applicant could not have reasonably foreseen at the time of filing, such 
as, for example:
    (i) The loss of a transmitter or receiver site by condemnation, 
natural causes, or loss of lease or option; or
    (ii) Obstruction of a proposed transmission path caused by the 
erection of a new building or other structure.


<R05>
Sec. 26.315  Application for temporary authorizations.

    (a) In circumstances requiring immediate or temporary use of 
facilities, request may be made for special temporary authority to 
install and/or operate new or modified equipment. Any such request may 
be submitted as an informal application in the manner set forth in 
Sec. 26.303 and must contain full particulars as to the proposed 
operation including all facts sufficient to justify the temporary 
authority sought and the public interest therein. No such request will 
be considered unless the request is received by the Commission at least 
10 days prior to the date of proposed construction or operation or, 
where an extension is sought, expiration date of the existing temporary 
authorization. A request received within less than 10 days may be 
accepted upon due showing of sufficient reasons for the delay in 
submitting such request.
    (b) Special temporary authorizations may be granted without regard 
to the 30-day public notice requirements of Sec. 26.317 when:
    (1) The authorization is for a period not to exceed 30 days and no 
application for regular operation is contemplated to be filed;

[[Page 378]]

    (2) The authorization is for a period not to exceed 60 days pending 
the filing of an application for such regular operation;
    (3) The authorization is to permit interim operation to facilitate 
completion of authorized construction or to provide substantially the 
same service as previously authorized; or
    (4) The authorization is made upon a finding that there are 
extraordinary circumstances requiring operation in the public interest 
and that delay in the institution of such service would seriously 
prejudice the public interest.
    (c) Temporary authorizations of operation not exceed 180 days may be 
granted under the standards of section 309(f) of the Communications Act 
where extraordinary circumstances so require. Extensions of the 
temporary authorization for a period of 180 days each may also be 
granted, but the renewal applicant bears a heavy burden to show that 
extraordinary circumstances warrant such an extension.
    (d) In cases of emergency found by the Commission, involving danger 
to life or property or due to damage of equipment, or during a national 
emergency proclaimed by the president or declared by the Congress or 
during the continuance of any war in which the United States is engaged 
and when such action is necessary for the national defense or safety or 
otherwise in furtherance of the war effort, or in cases of emergency 
where the Commission finds that it would not feasible to secure renewal 
applications from existing licensees or otherwise to follow normal 
licensing procedure, the Commission will grant radio station 
authorizations and station licenses, or modifications or renewals 
thereof, during the emergency found by the Commission or during the 
continuance of any such national emergency or war, as special temporary 
licenses, only for the period of emergency or war requiring such action, 
without the filing of formal applications.


<R05>
Sec. 26.316  Recept of application; applications in the General Wireless Communications Service filed on FCC Form 175 and other applications in the GWCS 
          Service.

    (a) All applications for the initial provision of GWCS service must 
be submitted on FCC Forms 175 and 175-S. Mutually exclusive initial 
applications in the General Wireless Communications Services are subject 
to competitive bidding. FCC Form XXX (``Application for New or Modified 
General Wireless Communications Service Radio Station Under Part 26'') 
must be submitted by each winning bidder for each GWCS license applied 
for on FCC Form 175. In the event that mutual exclusivity does not exist 
between applicants filing FCC Form 175, the applicant will also file FCC 
Form 401. The aforementioned Forms 175, 175-S, and XXX are subject to 
the provisions of Part 1, Subpart Q of this chapter (``Competitive 
Bidding Proceedings'') and subpart E of this part. Blanket licenses are 
granted for each market frequency block. Applications for individual 
sites are not needed and will not be accepted. See Sec. 26.11.
    (b) Applications received for filing are given a file number. The 
assignment of a file number to an application is merely for 
administrative convenience and does not indicate the acceptance of the 
application for filing and processing. Such assignment of a file number 
will not preclude the subsequent return or dismissal of the application 
if it is found to be not in accordance with the Commission's rules.
    (c) Acceptance of an application for filing merely means that it has 
been the subject of a preliminary review as to completeness. Such 
acceptance will not preclude the subsequent return or dismissal of the 
application if it is found to be defective or not in accordance with the 
Commission's rules.


<R05>
Sec. 26.317  Public notice period.

    (a) At regular intervals, the Commission will issue a public notice 
listing:
    (1) The acceptance for filing of all applications and major 
amendments thereto:
    (2) Significant Commission actions concerning applications listed as 
acceptable for filing;
    (3) Information which the Commission in its discretion believes of 
public significance. Such notices are solely for the purpose of 
informing the public and do not create any rights in an applicant or any 
other person.

[[Page 379]]

    (4) Special environmental considerations as required by part 1 of 
this chapter.
    (b) The Commission will not grant any application until expiration 
of a period of thirty (30) days following the issuance date of a public 
notice listing the application, or any major amendments thereto, as 
acceptable for filing. Provided, that the Commission will not grant an 
application filed on Form XXX filed either by a winning bidder or by an 
applicant whose Form 175 application is not mutually exclusive with 
other applicants, until the expiration of a period of forty (40) days 
following the issuance of a public notice listing the application, or 
any major amendments thereto, as acceptable for filing. See also 
Sec. 1.2108 of this chapter.
    (c) As an exception to paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) of this section, 
the public notice provisions are not applicable to applications:
    (1) For authorization of a minor technical change in the facilities 
of an authorized station where such a change would not be classified as 
a major amendment (as defined by Sec. 26.314) were such a change to be 
submitted as an amendment to a pending application;
    (2) For issuance of a license subsequent to a radio station 
authorization or, pending application for a grant of such license, any 
special or temporary authorization to permit interim operation to 
facilitate completion of authorized construction or to provide 
substantially the same service as would be authorized by such license;
    (3) For extension of time to complete construction of authorized 
facilities, see Sec. 26.104;
    (4) For temporary authorization pursuant to Sec. 25.315;
    (5) For an authorization under any of the proviso clauses of section 
308(a) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 308(a));
    (6) For consent to an involuntary assignment or transfer of control 
of a radio authorization; or
    (7) For consent to a voluntary assignment or transfer of control of 
a radio authorization, where the assignment or transfer does not involve 
a substantial change in ownership or control.


<R05>
Sec. 26.318  Dismissal and return of applications.

    (a) Any application may be dismissed without prejudice as a matter 
of right if the applicant requests its dismissal prior to designation 
for hearing or, in the case of applications filed on Forms 175 and 175-
S, prior to auction. An applicant's request for the return of his 
application after it has been accepted for filing will be considered to 
be a request for dismissal without prejudice. Applicants requesting 
dismissal of their applications are also subject to Sec. 1.2104 of this 
chapter.
    (b) A request to dismiss an application without prejudice will be 
considered after designation for hearing only if:
    (1) A written petition is submitted to the Commission and is 
properly served upon all parties of record, and
    (2) The petition complies with the provisions of this Section and 
demonstrates good cause.
    (c) The Commission will dismiss an application for failure to 
prosecute or for failure to respond substantially within a specified 
time period to official correspondence or requests for additional 
information. Dismissal shall be without prejudice if made prior to 
designation for hearing or prior to auction, but dismissal may be made 
with prejudice for unsatisfactory compliance or after designation for 
hearing or after the applicant is notified that it is the winning bidder 
under the auction process.


<R05>
Sec. 26.319  Ownership changes and agreements to amend or to dismiss applications or pleadings.

    (a) Applicability. Subject to the provisions of Sec. 1.2105 of this 
chapter (Bidding Application and Certification Procedures; Prohibition 
of Collusion), this section applies to applicants and all other parties 
interested in pending applications who wish to resolve contested matters 
among themselves with a formal or an informal agreement or 
understanding. This section applies only when the agreement or 
understanding will result in:
    (1) A major change in the ownership of an applicant to which 
Sec. 26.323 and 26.324 would apply, or

[[Page 380]]

    (2) The individual or mutual withdrawal, amendment or dismissal of 
any pending application, amendment, petitioner or other pleading.
    (b) Parties that have filed an application in the GWCS that is 
mutually exclusive with one or more other applications, and then enter 
into an agreement to resolve the mutual exclusivity by withdrawing or 
requesting dismissal of the application or an amendment thereto, must 
obtain the approval of the FCC. Parties that have filed a petition to 
deny, informal objection or other pleading against a pending 
application, and then seek to withdraw or request dismissal of the 
petition, either unilaterally or in exchange for a financial 
consideration, must obtain the approval of the FCC.
    (1) The party withdrawing or requesting dismissal of its 
application, petition to deny, informal objection or other pleading must 
submit to the FCC a request for approval of the withdrawal or dismissal, 
a copy of any written agreement related to the withdrawal or dismissal, 
and an affidavit setting forth:
    (i) A certification that neither the party nor its principals has 
received or will receive any money or other consideration in excess of 
the legitimate and prudent expenses incurred in prosecuting the 
application, petition to deny, informal objection or other pleading in 
exchange for the withdrawal or dismissal of the application, petition to 
deny, informal objection or other pleading, except that this provision 
does not apply to dismissal or withdrawal of applications pursuant to 
bona fide merger agreements;
    (ii) The exact nature and amount of any consideration received or 
promised;
    (iii) An itemized accounting of the expenses for which it seeks 
reimbursement; and
    (iv) The terms of any oral agreement related to the withdrawal or 
dismissal of the application, petition to deny, informal objection or 
other pleading.
    (2) In addition, within 5 days of the filing date of the applicant's 
or petitioner's request for approval, each remaining party to any 
written or oral agreement must submit an affidavit setting forth:
    (i) A certification that neither the applicant nor its principals 
has paid or will pay money or other consideration in excess of the 
legitimate and prudent expenses of the petitioner in exchange for 
withdrawing or dismissing the application, petition to deny, informal 
objection or other pleading; and
    (ii) The terms of any oral agreement relating to the withdrawal or 
dismissal of the application, petition to deny, informal objection or 
other pleading.
    (3) For the purposes of this section:
    (i) Affidavits filed pursuant to this section must be executed by 
the filing party, if an individual, a partner having personal knowledge 
of the facts, if a partnership, or an officer having personal knowledge 
of the facts, if a corporation or association.
    (ii) Applications, petitions to deny, informal objections and other 
pleadings are deemed to be pending before the FCC from the time the 
application or petition to deny is filed with the FCC until such time as 
an order of the FCC granting, denying or dismissing the application, 
petition to deny, informal objection or other pleading is no longer 
subject to reconsideration by the FCC or to review by any court.
    (iii) ``Legitimate and prudent expenses'' are those expenses 
reasonably incurred by a party in preparing to file, filing, prosecuting 
and/or settling its application, petition to deny, informal objection or 
other pleading for which reimbursement is sought.
    (iv) ``Other consideration'' consists of financial concessions, 
including, but not limited to, the transfer of assets or the provision 
of tangible pecuniary benefit, as well as non-financial concessions that 
confer any type of benefit on the recipient.
    (v) Reimbursement by an applicant of the legitimate and prudent 
expenses of a potential petitioner or objector, incurred reasonably and 
directly in preparing to file a petition to deny, will not be considered 
to be payment for refraining from filing a petition to deny or an 
informal objection. Payments made directly to a potential petitioner or 
objector, or a person related to a potential petitioner or objector, to 
implement non-financial promises are prohibited unless specifically 
approved by the FCC.

[[Page 381]]


<R05>
Sec. 26.320  Opposition to applications.

    (a) Petitions to deny (including petitions for other forms or 
relief) and responsive pleadings for Commission consideration must 
comply with Sec. 1.2108 of this chapter and must:
    (1) Identify the application or applications (including applicant's 
name, station location, Commission file numbers and radio service 
involved) with which it is concerned;
    (2) Be filed in accordance with the pleading limitations, filing 
periods, and other applicable provisions Secs. 1.41 through 1.52 of this 
chapter except where otherwise provided in Sec. 1.2108 of this chapter;
    (3) Contain specific allegations of fact which, except for facts of 
which official notice may be taken, shall be supported by affidavit of a 
person or persons with personal knowledge thereof, and which shall be 
sufficient to demonstrate that the petitioner (or respondent) is a party 
in interest and that a grant of, or other Commission action regarding, 
the application would be prima facie inconsistent with the public 
interest;
    (4) Be filed within thirty (30) days after the date of public notice 
announcing the acceptance for filing of any such application or major 
amendment thereto (unless the Commission otherwise extends the filing 
deadline); and
    (5) Contain a certificate of service showing that it has been mailed 
to the applicant no later than the date of filing thereof with the 
Commission.
    (b) A petition to deny a major amendment to a previously filed 
application may only raise matters directly related to the amendment 
which could not have been raised in connection with the underlying, 
previously filed application. This does not apply to petitioners who 
gain standing because of the major amendment.
    (c) parties who file frivolous petitions to deny may be subject to 
sanctions including monetary forfeitures, license revocation, if they 
are FCC licensees, and may be prohibited from participating in future 
auctions.


<R05>
Sec. 26.321  Mutually exclusive applications.

    (a) The Commission will consider applications to be mutually 
exclusive if their conflicts are such that the grant of one application 
would effectively preclude by reason of harmful electrical interference, 
or other practical reason, the grant of one or more of the other 
applications. The Commission will presume ``harmful electrical 
interference'' to mean interference which would result in a material 
impairment to service rendered to the public despite full cooperation in 
good faith by all applicants or parties to achieve reasonable technical 
adjustments which would avoid electrical conflict.
    (b) Mutually exclusive applications filed on Form 175 for the 
initial provision of GWCS service are subject to competitive bidding in 
accordance with the procedures in Subpart F of this part and in Part 1, 
Subpart Q of this chapter.
    (c) An application will be entitled to comparative consideration 
with one or more conflicting applications only if the Commission 
determines that such comparative consideration will serve the public 
interest.


<R05>
Sec. 26.322  Consideration of applications.

    (a) Applications for an instrument of authorization will be granted 
if, upon examination of the application and upon consideration of such 
other matters as it may officially notice, the Commission finds that the 
grant will serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity. See 
also Sec. 1.2108 of this chapter.
    (b) The grant shall be without a formal hearing if, upon 
consideration of the application, any pleadings or objections filed, or 
other matters which may be officially noticed, the Commission finds 
that:
    (1) The application is acceptable for filing, and is in accordance 
with the Commission's rules, regulations, and other requirements;
    (2) The application is not subject to a post-auction hearing or to 
comparative consideration pursuant to Sec. 26.321 with another 
application(s);
    (3) A grant of the application would not cause harmful electrical 
interference to an authorized station;
    (4) There are no substantial and material questions of fact 
presented; and
    (5) The applicant is qualified under current FCC regulations and 
policies.

[[Page 382]]

    (c) If the Commission should grant without a formal hearing an 
application for an instrument of authorization which is subject to a 
petition to deny filed in accordance with Sec. 26.320, the Commission 
will deny the petition by the issuance of a Memorandum Opinion and Order 
which will concisely report the reasons for the denial and dispose of 
all substantial issues raised by the petition.
    (d) Whenever the Commission, without a formal hearing, grants any 
application in part, or subject to any terms or conditions other than 
those normally applied to applications of the same type, it shall inform 
the applicant of the reasons therefor, and the grant shall be considered 
final unless the Commission should revise its action (either by granting 
the application as originally requested, or by designating the 
application for a formal evidentiary hearing) in response to a petition 
for reconsideration which:
    (1) Is filed by the applicant within thirty (30) days from the date 
of the letter or order giving the reasons for the partial or conditioned 
grant;
    (2) Rejects the grant as made and explains the reasons why the 
application should be granted as originally requested; and,
    (3) Returns the instrument of authorization.
    (e) The Commission will designate an application for a formal 
hearing, specifying with particularly the matters and things in issue, 
if, upon consideration of the application, any pleadings or objections 
filed, or other matters which be officially noticed, the Commission 
determines that:
    (1) A substantial and material question of fact is presented (see 
also Sec. 1.2108 of this chapter);
    (2) The Commission is unable for any reason to make the findings 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section and the application is 
acceptable for filing, complete, and in accordance with the Commission's 
rules, regulations, and other requirements; or
    (3) The application is entitled to comparative consideration (under 
Sec. 26.321) with another application (or applications).
    (f) The Commission may grant, deny or take other action with respect 
to an application designated for a formal hearing pursuant to paragraph 
(e) of this section or Part 1 of this chapter.
    (g) Reconsideration or review of any final action taken by the 
Commission will be in accordance with Part 1, Subpart A of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 26.323  Post-action divestitures.

    Any parties sharing a common non-controlling ownership interests who 
aggregate more GWCS spectrum among them than a single entity is entitled 
to hold will be permitted to divest sufficient properties within 90 days 
of the license grant to come into compliance with the spectrum 
aggregation limits as follows:
    (a) The GWCS applicant shall submit a signed statement with its 
long-form application stating that sufficient properties will be 
divested within 90 days of the license grant. If the licensee is 
otherwise qualified, the Commission will grant the applications subject 
to a condition that the licensee come into compliance with the GWCS 
spectrum aggregation limits within 90 days of grant.
    (b) Within 90 days of license grant, the licensee must certify that 
the applicant and all parties to the application have come into 
compliance with the GWCS spectrum aggregation limits. If the licensee 
fails to submit the certification within 90 days, the Commission will 
immediately cancel all broadband GWCS licenses won by the applicant, 
impose the default payment and, based on the facts presented, take any 
other action it deems appropriate. Divestiture may be an interim trustee 
if a buyer has not been secured in the required time frame, as long as 
the applicant has no interest in or control of the trustee, and the 
trustee may dispose of the property as it sees fit. In no event may the 
trustee retain the property for longer than six months from grant of 
license.


<R05>
Sec. 26.324  Transfer of control or assignment of station authorization.

    (a) Authorizations shall be transferred or assigned to another 
party, voluntarily (for example, by contract) or involuntarily (for 
example, by death, bankruptcy, or legal disability), directly or 
indirectly or by transfer of

[[Page 383]]

control of any corporation holding such authorization, only upon 
application and approval by the Commission. A transfer of control or 
assignment of station authorization in the General Wireless 
Communications Service is also subject to Sec. 1.2111 of this chapter 
(Assignment or transfer of control: unjust enrichment).
    (1) A change from less than 50% ownership to 50% or more ownership 
shall always be considered a transfer of control.
    (2) In other situations a controlling interest shall be determined 
on a case-by-case basis considering the distribution of ownership, and 
the relationships of the owners, including family relationships.
    (b) Form required:
    (1) Assignment.
    (i) FCC Form 490 shall be filed to assign a license or permit.
    (ii) In the case of involuntary assignment, FCC Form 490 shall be 
filed within 30 days of the event causing the assignment.
    (2) Transfer of control.
    (i) FCC Form 490 shall be submitted in order to transfer control of 
a corporation holding a license or permit.
    (ii) In the case of involuntary transfer of control, FCC Form 490 
shall be filed within 30 days of the event causing the transfer.
    (3) Form 430. Whenever an application must be filed under paragraphs 
(a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, the assignee or transferee shall file 
FCC Form 430 (``Common Carrier Radio License Qualification Report'') 
unless an accurate report is on file with the Commission.
    (4) Notification of completion. The Commission shall be notified by 
letter of the date of completion of the assignment or transfer of 
control.
    (5) If the transfer of control of a license is approved, the new 
licensee is held to the original build-out requirement of Sec. 26.104.
    (c) In acting upon applications for transfer of control or 
assignment, the Commission will not consider whether the public 
interest, convenience, and necessity might be served by the transfer or 
assignment of the authorization to a person other than the proposed 
transferee or assignee.
    (d) Applicants seeking to transfer their licenses within three years 
after the initial license grant date are required to file, together with 
their transfer application, the associated contracts for sale, option 
agreements, management agreements, and all other documents disclosing 
the total consideration to be received in return for the transfer of the 
license.


<R05>
Sec. 26.325  Extension of time to complete construction.

    (a) If construction is not completed within the time period set 
forth in Sec. 26.104, the authorization will automatically expire. 
Before the period for construction expires an application for an 
extension of time to complete construction (FCC Form 489) may be filed. 
See paragraph (b) of this section. Within 30 days after the 
authorization expires an application for reinstatement may be filed on 
FCC Form 489.
    (b) An application for extension of time to complete construction 
may be made on FCC Form 489. Extension of time requests must be filed 
prior to the expiration of the construction period. Extensions will be 
granted only if the licensee shows that the failure to complete 
construction is due to causes beyond his control. An application for 
modification of an authorization (under construction) does not extend 
the initial construction period. If additional time to construct is 
required, an FCC Form 489 must be submitted.


<R05>
Sec. 26.326  Termination of authorization.

    (a) (1) All authorizations shall terminate on the date specified on 
the authorization or on the date specified by these rules, unless a 
timely application for renewal has been filed.
    (2) If no application for renewal has been made before the 
authorization's expiration date, a late application for renewal will 
only be considered if it is filed within 30 days of the expiration date 
and shows that the failure to file a timely application was due to 
causes beyond the applicant's control. During this 30 day period 
reinstatement applications must be filed on FCC Form 489. Service to 
subscribers need not be suspended while a late filed renewal application 
is pending, but such service

[[Page 384]]

shall be without prejudice to Commission action on the renewal 
application and any related sanctions. See also Sec. 26.14 (Criteria for 
Comparative Renewal Proceedings).
    (b) Special Temporary Authority. A special temporary authorization 
shall automatically terminate upon failure to comply with the conditions 
in the authorization.

<R04>
                           Subpart A--Preface


<R05>
Sec. 32.1  Background.

    The revised Uniform System of Accounts (USOA) is a historical 
financial accounting system which reports the results of operational and 
financial events in a manner which enables both management and 
regulators to assess these results within a specified accounting period. 
The USOA also provides the financial community and others with financial 
performance results. In order for an accounting system to fulfill these 
purposes, it must exhibit consistency and stability in financial 
reporting (including the results published for regulatory purposes). 
Accordingly, the USOA has been designed to reflect stable, recurring 
financial data based to the extent regulatory considerations permit upon 
the consistency of the well established body of accounting theories and 
principles commonly referred to as generally accepted accounting 
principles.


<R05>
Sec. 32.2  Basis of the accounts.

    (a) The financial accounts of a company are used to record, in 
monetary terms, the basic transactions which occur. Certain natural 
groupings of these transactions are called (in different contexts) 
transaction cycles, business processes, functions or activities. The 
concept, however, is the same in each case; i.e., the natural groupings 
represent what happens within the company on a consistent and continuing 
basis. This repetitive nature of the natural groupings, over long 
periods of time, lends an element of stability to the financial account 
structure.
    (b) Within the telecommunications industry companies, certain 
recurring functions (natural groupings) do take place in the course of 
providing products and services to customers. These accounts reflect, to 
the extent feasible, those functions. For example, the primary bases of 
the accounts containing the investment in telecommunications plant are 
the functions performed by the assets. In addition, because of the 
anticipated effects of future innovations, the telecommunications plant 
accounts are intended to permit technological distinctions. Similarly, 
the primary bases of plant operations, customer operations and corporate 
operations expense accounts are the functions performed by individuals. 
The revenue accounts, on the other hand, reflect a market perspective of 
natural groupings based primarily upon the products and services 
purchased by customers.
    (c) In the course of developing the bases for this account 
structure, several other alternatives were explored. It was, for 
example, determined that, because of the variety and continual changing 
of various cost allocation mechanisms, the financial accounts of a 
company should not reflect an a priori allocation of revenues, 
investments or expenses to products or services, jurisdictions or 
organizational structures. (Note also Sec. 32.14 (c) and (d) of Subpart 
B.) It was also determined that costs (in the case of assets) should not 
be recorded based solely upon physical attributes such as location, 
description or size.
    (d) Care has been taken in this account structure to avoid confusing 
a function with an organizational responsibility, particularly as it 
relates to the expense accounts. Whereas in the past, specific 
organizations may

[[Page 388]]

have performed specific functions, the future environment with its 
increasing mechanization and other changes will result in entirely new 
or restructured organizations. Thus, any relationships drawn between 
organizations and accounts would become increasingly meaningless with 
the passage of time.
    (e) These accounts, then, are intended to reflect a functional and 
technological view of the telecommunications industry. This view will 
provide a stable and consistent foundation for the recording of 
financial data.
    (f) The financial data contained in the accounts, together with the 
detailed information contained in the underlying financial and other 
subsidiary records required by this Commission, will provide the 
information necessary to support separations, cost of service and 
management reporting requirements. The basic account structure has been 
designed to remain stable as reporting requirements change.


<R05>
Sec. 32.3  Authority.

    This Uniform System of Accounts has been prepared under the 
following authority: Section 4 of the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended, 47 U.S.C. section 154 (1984); sections 219, 220 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. sections 219, 220, 
(1984).


<R05>
Sec. 32.4  Communications Act.

    Attention is directed to the following extract from section 220 of 
the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. 220 (1984):

    (e) Any person who shall willfully make any false entry in the 
accounts of any book of accounts or in any record or memoranda kept by 
any such carrier, or who shall willfully destroy, mutilate, alter, or by 
any other means or device falsify any such account, record, or 
memoranda, or who shall willfully neglect or fail to make full, true, 
and correct entries in such accounts, records, or memoranda of all facts 
and transactions appertaining to the business of the carrier, shall be 
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be subject, upon conviction, 
to a fine of not less than $1,000 nor more than $5,000 or imprisonment 
for a term of not less than one year nor more than three years, or both 
such fine and imprisonment: Provided, that the Commission may in its 
discretion issue orders specifying such operating, accounting or 
financial papers, records, books, blanks, or documents which may, after 
a reasonable time, be destroyed, and prescribing the length of time such 
books, papers, or documents shall be preserved.

For regulations governing the periods for which records are to be 
retained, see Part 42, Preservation of Records of Communications Common 
Carriers, of this chapter which relates to preservation of records.

    (a) For accounting purposes, companies are divided into classes as 
follows:
    (1) Class A. Companies having annual revenues from regulated 
telecommunications operations that are equal to or above the indexed 
revenue threshold.
    (2) Class B. Companies having annual revenues from regulated 
telecommunications operations that are less than the indexed revenue 
threshold.
    (b) Class A companies shall keep all the accounts of this system of 
accounts which are applicable to their affairs and are designated as 
Class A accounts. These companies shall also keep Basic Property Records 
in compliance with the requirements of Sec. 32.2000 (e) and (f) of 
Subpart C.
    (c) Class B companies shall keep all accounts of this system of 
accounts which are applicable to their affairs and are designated as 
Class B accounts. These companies shall also keep Continuing Property 
Records in compliance with the requirements of Secs. 32.2000(e)(7)(A) 
and 32.2000(f) of Subpart C.
    (d) Class B companies that desire more detailed accounting may adopt 
the accounts prescribed for Class A companies upon the submission of a 
written notification to the Commission.
    (e) The initial classification of a company shall be determined by 
its lowest annual operating revenues for the five immediately preceding 
years. Subsequent changes in classification shall be made when the 
annual operating revenues show a greater or lesser classification for 
five consecutive years. Companies becoming subject to the jurisdiction 
of the Commission and not having revenue data for the five

[[Page 389]]

immediately preceding years shall estimate the amount of their annual 
revenues and adopt the scheme of accounts appropriate for the amount of 
such estimated revenues.

<R05>
Sec. 32.12  Records.

    (a) The company's financial records shall be kept in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles to the extent permitted by this 
system of accounts.
    (b) The company's financial records shall be kept with sufficient 
particularity to show fully the facts pertaining to all entries in these 
accounts. The detail records shall be filed in such manner as to be 
readily accessible for examination by representatives of this 
Commission.
    (c) The Commission shall require a company to maintain financial and 
other subsidiary records in such a manner that specific information, of 
a type not warranting disclosure as an account or subaccount, will be 
readily available. When this occurs, or where the full information is 
not otherwise recorded in the general books, the subsidiary records 
shall be maintained in sufficient detail to facilitate the reporting of 
the required specific information. The subsidiary records, in which the 
full details are shown, shall be sufficiently referenced to permit ready 
identification and examination by representatives of this Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 32.13  Accounts--General.

    (a) As a general rule, all accounts kept by reporting companies 
shall conform in numbers and titles to those prescribed herein. However, 
reporting companies may use different numbers for internal purposes when 
separate accounts (or subaccounts) maintained are consistent with the 
title and content of accounts and subaccounts prescribed in this system.
    (1) For Class A reporting companies, accounts which are clearly 
summaries of other accounts or subaccounts are to be used for reporting 
purposes and are not otherwise required to be maintained.
    (2) A company may subdivide any of the accounts prescribed. The 
titles of all such subaccounts shall refer by number or title to the 
controlling account.
    (3) A company may establish temporary or experimental accounts 
provided that within 30 days of the opening of such accounts the company 
notifies the Commission of the nature and purpose thereof.
    (b) Exercise of the preceding options shall be allowed only if the 
integrity of the prescribed accounts is not impaired.
    (c) As of the date a company becomes subject to the system of 
accounts, the company is authorized to make any such subdivisions, 
reclassifications or consolidations of existing balances as are 
necessary to meet the requirements of this system of accounts.
    (d) Nothing contained in this Part shall prohibit or excuse any 
company, receiver, or operating trustee of any carrier from subdividing 
the accounts hereby prescribed for the purpose of:
    (1) Complying with the requirements of the state commission(s) 
having jurisdiction; or
    (2) Securing the information required in the prescribed reports to 
such commission(s).
    (e) Where the use of subsidiary records is considered necessary in 
order to secure the information required in reports to any state 
commission, the company shall incorporate the following controls into 
their accounting system with respect to such subsidiary records:
    (1) Subsidiary records shall be reconciled to the company's general 
ledger or books of original entry, as appropriate.
    (2) The company shall adequately document the accounting procedures 
related to subsidiary records.
    (3) The subsidiary records shall be maintained at an adequate level 
of detail to satisfy state regulators.


<R05>
Sec. 32.14  Regulated accounts.

    (a) In the context of this part, the regulated accounts shall be 
interpreted to include the investments, revenues and expenses associated 
with those telecommunications products and services to which the tariff 
filing requirements contained in Title II of the Communications Act of 
1934, as amended,

[[Page 390]]

are applied, except as may be otherwise provided by the Commission. 
Regulated telecommunications products and services are thereby fully 
subject to the accounting requirements as specified in Title II of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and as detailed in Subparts A 
through F of this Part of the Commission's Rules and Regulations.
    (b) In addition to those amounts considered to be regulated by the 
provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, those telecommunications 
products and services to which the tariff filing requirements of the 
several state jurisdictions are applied shall be accounted for as 
regulated, except where such treatment is proscribed or otherwise 
excluded from the requirements pertaining to regulated 
telecommunications products and services by this Commission.
    (c) In the application of detailed accounting requirements contained 
in this part, when a regulated activity involves the common or joint use 
of assets and resources in the provision of regulated and nonregulated 
products and services, companies shall account for these activities 
within the accounts prescribed in this system for telephone company 
operations. Assets and expenses shall be subdivided in subsidiary 
records among amounts solely assignable to nonregulated activities, 
amounts solely assignable to regulated activities, and amounts related 
to assets used and expenses incurred jointly or in common, which will be 
allocated between regulated and nonregulated activities. Companies shall 
submit reports identifying regulated and nonregulated amounts in the 
manner and at the times prescribed by this Commission. Nonregulated 
revenue items not qualifying for incidental treatment, as provided in 
Sec. 32.4999(l), shall be recorded in Account 5280, Nonregulated 
operating revenue.
    (d) Other income items which are incidental to the provision of 
regulated products and services shall be accounted for as regulated 
activities.
    (e) All costs and revenues related to the offering of regulated 
products and services which result from arrangements for joint 
participation or apportionment between two or more telephone companies 
(e.g., joint operating agreements, settlement agreements, cost-pooling 
agreements) shall be recorded within the detailed accounts. Under joint 
operating agreements, the creditor will initially charge the entire 
expenses to the appropriate primary accounts. The proportion of such 
expenses borne by the debtor shall be credited by the creditor and 
charged by the debtor to the account initially charge. Any allowances 
for return on property used will be accounted for as provided in Account 
5240, Rent Revenue.
    (f) All items of nonregulated revenue, investment and expense that 
are not properly includible in the detailed, regulated accounts 
prescribed in Subparts A through F of this part, as determined by 
paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section shall be accounted for and 
included in reports to this Commission as specified in Sec. 32.23 of 
this subpart.

Sec. 32.15  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 32.16  Changes in accounting standards.

    (a) The company's records and accounts shall be adjusted to apply 
new accounting standards prescribed by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board or successor authoritative accounting standard-setting 
groups, in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting 
principles. Commission approval of a change in accounting standard will 
automatically take effect 90 days after the company informs this 
Commission of its intention to follow the new standard, unless the 
Commission notifies the company to the contrary. Concurrent with 
informing this Commission of its intent to adopt an accounting standards 
change, the company shall also file a revenue requirement study for the 
current year and a projection for three years into the future analyzing 
the effects of the accounting standards change. Furthermore, any change 
subsequently adopted shall be disclosed in annual reports to this 
Commission.
    (b) The changes in accounting standards which this Commission 
approves will not necessarily be binding on the

[[Page 391]]

ratemaking practices of the various state commissions.


<R05>
Sec. 32.17  Interpretation of accounts.

    To the end that uniform accounting shall be maintained within the 
prescribed system, questions involving matters of significant which are 
not clearly provided for shall be submitted to the Chief, Common Carrier 
Bureau, for explanation, interpretation, or resolution. Questions and 
answers thereto with respect to this system of accounts will be 
maintained by the Common Carrier Bureau.


<R05>
Sec. 32.18  Waivers.

    A waiver from any provision of this system of accounts shall be made 
by the Federal Communications Commission upon its own initiative or upon 
the submission of written request therefor from any telecommunications 
company, or group of telecommunications companies, provided that such a 
waiver is in the public interest and each request for waiver expressly 
demonstrates that: existing peculiarities or unusual circumstances 
warrant a departure from a prescribed procedure or technique; a 
specifically defined alternative procedure or technique will result in a 
substantially equivalent or more accurate portrayal of operating results 
or financial condition, consistent with the principles embodied in the 
provisions of this system of accounts; and the application of such 
alternative procedure will maintain or improve uniformity in substantive 
results as among telecommunications companies.


<R05>
Sec. 32.19  Address for reports and correspondence.

    Reports, statements, and correspondence submitted to the Federal 
Communications Commission in accordance with or relating to instructions 
and requirements contained herein shall be addressed to the Common 
Carrier Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554.


<R05>
Sec. 32.20  Numbering convention.

    (a) The number ``32'' (appearing to the left of the first decimal 
point) indicates the part number.
    (b) The numbers immediately following to the right of the decimal 
point indicate, respectively, the section or account. All Part 32 
Account numbers contain 4 digits to-the-right-of the decimal point.
    (c) Cross references to accounts are made by citing the account 
numbers to the right of the decimal point; e.g., Account 2232 rather 
than the corresponding complete Part 32 reference number 32.2232.


<R05>
Sec. 32.21  Sequence of accounts.

    The order in which the accounts are presented in this system of 
accounts is not to be considered as necessarily indicative of the order 
in which they will be scheduled at all times in reports to this 
Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 32.22  Comprehensive interperiod tax allocation.

    (a) Companies shall apply interperiod tax allocation (tax 
normalization) to all book/tax temporary differences which would be 
considered material for published financial report purposes. 
Furthermore, companies shall also apply interperiod tax allocation if 
any item or group of similar items when aggregated would yield debit or 
credit entries which exceed or would exceed 5 percent of the gross 
deferred income tax expense debits or credits during any calendar year 
over the life of the temporary difference. The tax effects of book/tax 
temporary differences shall be normalized and the deferrals shall be 
included in the following accounts:

4100, Net Current Deferred Operating Income Taxes;
4110, Net Current Deferred Nonoperating Income Taxes;
4340, Net Noncurrent Deferred Operating Income Taxes;
4350, Net Noncurrent Deferred Nonoperating Income Taxes.

    In lieu of the accounting prescribed herein, any company shall treat 
the increase or reduction in current income taxes payable resulting from 
the use of flow through accounting in prior years as an increase or 
reduction in current tax expense.
    (b) Supporting documentation shall be maintained so as to separately 
identify the amount of deferred taxes which arise from the use of an 
accelerated method of depreciation.

[[Page 392]]

    (c) Subsidiary records shall be used to reduce the deferred tax 
assets contained in the accounts specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section when it is likely that some portion or all of the deferred tax 
asset will not be realized. The amount recorded in the subsidiary record 
should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that 
is likely to be realized.
    (d) The records supporting the activity in the deferred income tax 
accounts shall be maintained in sufficient detail to identify the nature 
of the specific temporary differences giving rise to both the debits and 
credits to the individual accounts.
    (e) Any company that uses accelerated depreciation (or recognizes 
taxable income or losses upon the retirement of property) for income tax 
purposes shall normalize the tax differentials occasioned thereby as 
indicated in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.
    (1) With respect to the retirement of property the book/tax 
difference between (i) the recognition of proceeds as income and the 
accrual for salvage value and (ii) the book and tax capital recovery, 
shall be normalized.
    (2) Records shall be maintained so as to show the deferred tax 
amounts by vintage year separately for each class or subclass of 
eligible depreciable telephone plant for which an accelerated method of 
depreciation has been used for income tax purposes. When property is 
transferred to nonregulated activities, the associated deferred income 
taxes and unamortized investment tax credits shall also be identified 
and transferred to the appropriate nonregulated accounts.
    (f) The tax differentials to be normalized as specified in this 
section shall also encompass the additional effect of state and local 
income tax changes on Federal income taxes produced by the provision for 
deferred state and local income taxes for book/tax temporary differences 
related to such income taxes.
    (g) Companies that receive the tax benefits from the filing of a 
consolidated income tax return by the parent company, (pursuant to 
closing agreements with the Internal Revenue Service, effective January 
1, 1966) representing the deferred income taxes from the elimination of 
intercompany profits for income tax purposes on sales of regulated 
equipment, may credit such deferred taxes directly to the plant account 
which contains such intercompany profit rather than crediting such 
deferred taxes to the applicable accounts in paragraph (a) of this 
section. If the deferred income taxes are recorded as a reduction of the 
appropriate plant accounts, such reduction shall be treated as reducing 
the original cost of the plant and accounted for as such.

<R05>
Sec. 32.23  Nonregulated activities.

    (a) This section describes the accounting treatment of activities 
classified for accounting purposes as ``nonregulated.'' Preemptively 
deregulated activities and activities (other than incidental activities) 
never subject to regulation will be classified for accounting purposes 
as ``nonregulated.'' Activities that qualify for incidental treatment 
under the policies of this Commission will be classified for accounting 
purposes as regulated activities. Activities that have been deregulated 
by a state will be classified for accounting purposes as regulated 
activities. Activities that have been deregulated at the interstate 
level, but not preemptively deregulated, will be classified for 
accounting purposes as regulated activities until such time as this 
Commission decides otherwise. The treatment of nonregulated activities 
shall differ depending on the extent of the common or joint use of 
assets and resources in the provision of both regulated and nonregulated 
products and services.
    (b) When a nonregulated activity does not involve the joint or 
common use of assets and resources in the provision of both regulated 
and nonregulated products and services, carriers shall account for these 
activities on a separate set of books consistent with instructions set 
forth in Secs. 32.1406 and 32.7990. Transfers of assets, and sales of 
products and services between the regulated activity and a nonregulated 
activity for which a separate set of books is maintained, shall be 
accounted for in

[[Page 393]]

accordance with the rules presented in Sec. 32.27, Transactions with 
Affiliates. In the separate set of books, carriers may establish 
whatever detail they deem appropriate beyond what is necessary to 
provide this Commission with the information required in Secs. 32.1406 
and 32.7990.
    (c) When a nonregulated activity does involve the common or joint 
use of assets and resources in the provision of regulated and 
nonregulated products and services, carriers shall account for these 
activities within accounts prescribed in this system for telephone 
company operations. Assets and expenses shall be subdivided in 
subsidiary records among amounts solely assignable to nonregulated 
activities, amounts solely assignable to regulated activities, and 
amounts related to assets and expenses incurred jointly or in common, 
which will be allocated between regulated and nonregulated activities. 
Carriers shall submit reports identifying regulated and nonregulated 
amounts in the manner and at the times prescribed by this Commission. 
Nonregulated revenue items not provided for elsewhere in this system of 
accounts and not qualifying for incidental treatment as provided in 
Sec. 32.4999(1), shall be recorded in separate subsidiary record 
categories of Account 5280, Nonregulated operating revenue. Amounts 
assigned or allocated to regulated products or services shall be subject 
to part 36 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 32.24  Compensated absences.

    (a) Companies shall record a liability and charge the appropriate 
expense accounts for compensated absences (vacations, sick leave, etc.) 
in the year in which these benefits are earned by employees.
    (b) With respect to the liability that exists for compensated 
absences which is not yet recorded on the books as of the effective date 
of this part, the liability shall be recorded in Account 4120, Other 
Accrued Liabilities, with a corresponding entry to Account 1439, 
Deferred Charges. This deferred charge shall be amortized on a straight 
line basis over a period of ten years.
    (c) Records shall be maintained so as to show that no more than ten 
percent of the deferred charge is being amortized each year.


<R05>
Sec. 32.25  Unusual items and contingent liabilities.

    Extraordinary items, prior period adjustments and contingent 
liabilities shall be submitted to this Commission for review before 
being recorded in the company's books of account. The materiality of 
corrections of errors in prior periods shall be measured in relation to 
the summary account level used for reporting purposes for Class A 
carriers, or in relation to total operating revenues or total operating 
expenses for Class B carriers. For Class A carriers, no correction in 
excess of one percent of the aggregate summary account dollars or one 
million dollars, whichever is higher, may be recorded in current 
operating accounts without prior approval. For Class B carriers, no 
correction which exceeds one percent of total operating revenues or one 
percent of total operating expenses, depending on the nature of the 
item, may be recorded in current operating accounts without prior 
approval.

[52 FR 43917, Nov. 17, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 32.26  Materiality.

    Companies shall follow this system of accounts in recording all 
financial and statistical data irrespective of an individual item's 
materiality under GAAP, unless a waiver has been granted under the 
provisions of Sec. 32.18 of this subpart to do otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 32.27  Transactions with affiliates.

    (a) Unless otherwise approved by the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, 
transactions with affiliates involving asset transfers into or out of 
the regulated accounts shall be recorded by the carrier in its regulated 
accounts as provided in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.
    (b) Charges for assets purchased by or transferred to the regulated 
telephone activity of a carrier from affiliates shall be recorded in the 
operating accounts of the regulated activity at the invoice price if 
that price is determined by a prevailing price held out to the general 
public in the normal course

[[Page 394]]

of business. If a prevailing price for the assets received by the 
regulated activity is not available, the charges recorded by the 
regulated activity for such assets shall be the lower of their cost to 
the originating activity and the affiliated group less all applicable 
valuation reserves, or their fair market value.
    (c) Assets sold or transferred from the regulated accounts to 
affiliates shall be recorded as operating revenues, incidental revenues 
or asset retirements according to the nature of the transaction 
involved. If such sales are reflected in tariffs on file with a 
regulatory commission or in a prevailing price held out to the general 
public, the associated revenues shall be recorded at the prices 
contained therein in the appropriate revenue accounts. If no tariff or 
prevailing price is applicable, the proceeds from such sales shall be 
determined at the higher of cost less all applicable valuation reserves, 
or estimated fair market value of the asset.
    (d) Services provided to an affiliate pursuant to a tariff, 
including a tariff filed with a state commission, shall be recorded in 
the appropriate revenue accounts at the tariffed rate. Services provided 
by an affiliate to the regulated activity, when the same services are 
also provided by the affiliate to unaffiliated persons or entities, 
shall be recorded at the market rate. When a carrier provides 
substantially all of a service to or receives substantially all of a 
service from an affiliate which are not also provided to unaffiliated 
persons or entities, the services shall be recorded at cost which shall 
be determined in a manner that complies with the standards and 
procedures for the apportionment of joint and common costs between the 
regulated and nonregulated operations of the carrier entity.
    (e) Income taxes shall be allocated among the regulated activities 
of the carrier, its nonregulated divisions, and members of an affiliated 
group. Under circumstances in which income taxes are determined on a 
consolidated basis by the carrier and other members of the affiliated 
group, the income tax expense to be recorded by the carrier shall be the 
same as would result if determined for the carrier separately for all 
time periods, except that the tax effect of carry-back and carry-forward 
operating losses, investment tax credits, or other tax credits generated 
by operations of the carrier shall be recorded by the carrier during the 
period in which applied in settlement of the taxes otherwise 
attributable to any member, or combination of members, of the affiliated 
group.
    (f) Companies that employ average schedules in lieu of actual costs 
are exempt from the provisions of this section. For other organizations, 
the principles set forth in this section shall apply equally to 
corporations, proprietorships, partnerships and other forms of business 
organizations.

be credited to the accounts charged with the cost of such construction. 
(Note also Account 7110, Income from Custom Work.)

reconstruction or during interruptions due to storms or other 
casualties, equipment used for

[[Page 402]]

the training of operators, equipment used to provide intercepting

Furniture; 2123, Office Equipment; and 2124, General Purpose Computers, 
costing $500 or less or having a life less than one year shall be 
charged to the applicable Plant Specific Operations Expense accounts. If 
the aggregate investment in the items is relatively large at the time of 
acquisition, such amounts shall be maintained in an applicable material 
and supplies account until items are used.
    (b) Telecommunications plant acquired. (1) Property, plant and 
equipment acquired from an entity, whether or not affiliated with the

consideration other than money exchanged) for the property (together 
with preliminary expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition)

furnish the Commission with the particulars of such estimates.

credited to Account 3100, Accumulated Depreciation, or Account 3200,

Improvements, 3500, Accumulated Amortization--Intangibles, and 3600, 
Accumulated Amortization--Other, and debited to Account 1439.
    (iv) Any amount remaining in Account 1439, applicable to the plant 
acquired, shall, upon completion of the entries provided in paragraphs 
(b)(2) (i), (ii) and (iii) of this section, be debited or credited, as 
applicable, to Account 2007, Goodwill, or to Account 2005, 
Telecommunications Plant Adjustment, as appropriate.
    (3) A memorandum record shall be kept showing the amount of 
contributions in aid of construction applicable to the property acquired 
as shown by the accounts of the previous owner.
    (4) Companies shall submit to the Commission for consideration and 
approval copies of journal entries recording acquisition of 
telecommunications plant covered by this instruction when the 
consideration paid is $1,000,000 or greater (Class A companies) and 
$250,000 or greater (Class B companies). The text of such entries shall 
give a complete description of the property acquired and the basis upon 
which the amounts of the entries have been determined.
    (c) Cost of construction. (1) Telecommunications plant represents an 
economic resource which will be used to provide future services, the 
cost of which will be allocated in a rational and systematic manner to 
the future periods in which it provides benefits. In accounting for 
construction costs, the utility shall charge to the telecommunications 
plant accounts, where applicable, all direct and indirect costs.
    (2) Direct and indirect costs shall include, but not be limited to:
    (i) ``Labor'' includes the wages and expenses of employees directly 
engaged in or in direct charge of construction work. It includes 
expenses directly related to an employee's wages, such as

[[Page 403]]

worker's compensation insurance, payroll taxes, benefits and other 
similar items of expense.
    (ii) ``Engineering'' includes the portion of the wages and expenses 
of engineers, draftsmen, inspectors, and their direct supervision 
applicable to construction work. It includes expenses directly related 
to an employee's wages, such as worker's compensation insurance, payroll 
taxes, benefits and other similar items of expense.
    (iii) ``Material and supplies'' includes the purchase price of 
material used at the point of free delivery plus the costs of 
inspection, loading and transportation, and an equitable portion of 
provisioning expense. In determining the cost of material used, proper 
allowance shall be made for unused material, for material recovered from 
temporary structures used in performing the work involved, and for 
discounts allowed and realized in the purchase of material. This item 
does not include construction material that is stolen or rendered 
unusable due to vandalism. Such material should be charged to the 
applicable plant specific operations expense accounts.
    (iv) ``Transportation'' includes the cost of transporting employees, 
material and supplies, tools and other work equipment to and from the 
physical construction location. It includes amounts paid therefor to 
other companies or individuals and the cost of using the company's own 
motor vehicles or other transportation equipment.
    (v) ``Contract work'' includes amounts paid for work performed under 
contract or other agreement by other companies, firms or individuals; 
engineering and supervision applicable to such work; cost incident to 
the award of contracts; and the inspection of such work. The cost of 
construction work performed by affiliated companies and other details 
relating thereto shall be available from the work in progress and 
supporting records.
    (vi) ``Protection'' includes the cost of protecting the company's 
property from fire or other casualties and the cost of preventing 
damages to others or the property of others.
    (vii) ``Privileges, Permits, and Rights of way'' includes such costs 
incurred in obtaining these privileges, permits, or rights of way in 
connection with construction work, such as for use of private property, 
streets or highways. The cost of such privileges and permits shall be 
included in the cost of the work for which the privileges or permits are 
obtained, except for costs includable in Account 2111, Land, and Account 
2690, Intangibles.
    (viii) ``Taxes'' includes taxes properly includable in construction 
costs before the facilities are completed for service, which taxes are 
assessed separately from taxes on operating property or under conditions 
that permit separate identification of the amount chargeable to 
construction.
    (ix) ``Special machine service'' includes the cost of labor 
expended, materials and supplies consumed and other expenses incurred in 
the maintenance, operation and use of special and other labor saving 
machines (other than transportation equipment (such as trenching 
equipment, cable plows and pole setting trucks. Also included are 
expenditures for rental, maintenance and operation of such machines 
owned by others. When a construction job requires the purchase of 
special machines, the cost thereof, less the appraised or salvage value 
at the time of release from the job, shall be included in the cost of 
construction.
    (x) Allowance for funds used during construction (``AFUDC'') 
provides for the cost of financing the construction of 
telecommunications plant. AFUDC shall be charged to Account 2003, 
Telecommunications Plant Under Construction, and credited to Account 
7340. The rate for calculating AFUDC shall be determined as follows: If 
financing plans associate a specific new borrowing with an asset, the 
rate on that borrowing may be used for the asset; if no specific new 
borrowing is associated with an asset or if the average accumulated 
expenditures for the asset exceed the amounts of specific new borrowing 
associated with it, the capitalization rate to be applied to such excess 
shall be weighted average of the rates applicable to other borrowing of 
the enterprise. The amount of interest cost capitalized in an accounting 
period shall not exceed the total amount of interest

[[Page 404]]

cost incurred by the company in that period.
    (xi) ``Insurance'' includes premiums paid specifically for 
protection against loss and damage in connection with the construction 
of telecommunications plant due to fire or other casualty, injury to or 
death of employees or others, damages to property of others, 
defalcations of employees and agents and the non-performance of 
contractual obligations of others.
    (xii) ``Construction services'' include the cost of telephone, 
electricity, power, construction quarters, office space and equipment 
directly related to the construction project.
    (xiii) ``Indirect construction costs'' shall include indirect costs 
such as general engineering, supervision and support. Such costs, in 
addition to direct supervision, shall include indirect plant operations 
and engineering supervision up to, but not including, supervision by 
executive officers whose pay and expenses are chargeable to Account 
6711, Executive. The records supporting the entries for indirect 
construction costs shall be kept so as to show the nature of the 
expenditures, the individual jobs and accounts charged, and the bases of 
the distribution. The amounts charged to each plant account for indirect 
costs shall be readily determinable. The instructions contained herein 
shall not be interpreted as permitting the addition to plant of amounts 
to cover indirect costs based on arbitrary allocations.
    (xiv) The cost of construction shall not include any amounts 
classifiable as Corporate Operations Expense.
    (d) Telecommunications plant retired. (1) Telecommunications plant 
accounts shall at all times disclose the original cost of all property 
in service. When any item of property subject to plant retirement 
accounting is worn out, lost, sold, destroyed, abandoned, surrendered 
upon lapse of title, becomes permanently unserviceable, is withdrawn or 
for any other reason is retired from service, the plant accounts 
applicable to that item shall be credited with the original cost of the 
plant retired whether replaced or not (except as provided for minor 
items in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section). Normally, these 
retirement credits with respect to such plant as entire buildings, 
entire central offices, all plant abandoned and any large sections of 
plant withdrawn from service, shall be entered in the accounts for the 
month in which use of the property ceased. For any other plant withdrawn 
from service, the retirement credits shall be entered no later than the 
next succeeding month. Literal compliance with the provision for timing 
of entries with respect to property amounting to less than $50,000 
retired under any one project is not required if an unreasonable amount 
of recordkeeping and estimating of quantities, original costs and 
salvage is necessary. The retirement entry shall refer to the continuing 
property record, or records supplemental thereto, from which the cost 
was obtained (note also paragraph (d)(3) of this section). Every company 
shall establish procedures which will ensure compliance with these 
requirements.
    (2) To avoid undue refinement, depreciable telecommunications plant 
shall be accounted for as follows:
    (i) Retirement units: This group includes major items of property, a 
representative list of which shall be prescribed by this Commission. In 
lieu of the retirement units prescribed with respect to a particular 
account, a company may, after obtaining specific approval by this 
Commission, establish and maintain its own list of retirement units for 
a portion or all of the plant in any such account. For items included on 
the retirement units list, the original cost of any such items retired 
shall be credited to the plant account and charged to Account 3100, 
Accumulated Depreciation, whether or not replaced. The original cost of 
retirement units installed in place of property retired shall be charged 
to the applicable telecommunications plant account.
    (ii) Minor items: This group includes any part or element of plant 
which is not designated as a retirement unit. The original cost of a 
minor item of property when included in the specific or average cost for 
a retirement unit or units requires no separate credit to the 
telecommunications plant account when such a minor item is retired. The 
cost of replacement shall be charged to the account applicable for the 
cost of

[[Page 405]]

repairs of the property. However, if the replacement effects a 
substantial betterment (the primary aim of which is to make the property 
affected more useful, of greater durability, of greater capacity or more 
economical in operation), the excess cost of such a replacement, over 
the estimated cost at the then current prices of replacement without 
betterment of the minor items being retired, shall be charged to the 
applicable telecommunications plant account.
    (3) The cost of property to be retired shall be the amount at which 
property is included in the telecommunications plant accounts. However, 
when it is impracticable to determine the cost of each item due to the 
relatively large number or small cost of such items, the average cost of 
all the items covered by an appropriate subdivision of the account shall 
be used in determining the cost to be assigned to such items when 
retired. The method used in determining average cost must give due 
regard to the quantity, vintage, size and kind of items, the area in 
which they were installed and their classification in other respects. 
Average cost may be applied in retirement of such items as poles, wire, 
cable, cable terminals, conduit and booths. Any company may use average 
cost of property installed in a year or band of years as approved by the 
Commission. It should be understood, however, that the use of average 
costs shall not relieve the company of the requirement for maintaining 
its continuing property records to show, where practicable, dates of 
installation and removal for purposes of mortality studies. (See 
Sec. 32.2000(f) of this subpart, Standard Practices for Establishing and 
Maintaining Continuing Property Records.)
    (4) The accounting for the retirement of property, plant and 
equipment shall be as provided above except:
    (i) Amounts included in Account 2005, Telecommunications Plant 
Adjustment; Account 2680, Amortizable Tangible Assets; Account 2681, 
Capital Leases; Account 2682, Leasehold Improvements; Account 2690, 
Intangibles; and any amounts associated with amortizable leaseholds, 
easements, and similar rights in land included in Account 2111, Land, 
shall be debited, as appropriate, to Account 3400, 3410, 3420, 3500, or 
3600, and credited to the applicable accounts.
    (ii) Amounts in Account 2111, Land, and amounts for works of art 
recorded in Account 2122, Furniture, shall be treated at disposition as 
a gain or loss and shall be credited or debited to Account 7150, Gains 
and Losses from Disposition of Land and Artwork, as applicable. If land 
or artwork is retained by the company and held for sale, the cost shall 
be charged to Account 2006, Nonoperating Plant.
    (5) When the telecommunications plant is sold together with traffic 
associated therewith, the original cost of the property shall be 
credited to the applicable plant accounts and the estimated amounts 
carried with respect thereto in the accumulated depreciation and 
amortization accounts shall be charged to such accumulated accounts. The 
difference, if any, between the net amount of such debit and credit 
items and the consideration received (less commissions and other 
expenses of making the sale) for the property shall be included in 
Account 7350, Gains and Losses from Disposition of Certain Property. The 
accounting for depreciable telecommunications plant sold without the 
traffic associated therewith shall be in accordance with the accounting 
provided in Sec. 32.3100(c) of this subpart.
    (e) Basic property records. (1) The basic property records are that 
portion of the total property accounting system which preserves the 
following detailed information:
    (i) The identity, vintage, location and original cost of units of 
property;
    (ii) Original and ongoing transactional data (plant account 
activity) in terms of such units; and
    (iii) Any other specific financial and cost accounting information 
not properly warranting separate disclosure as an account or subaccount 
but which is needed to support regulatory, cost, tax, management and 
other specific accounting information needs and requirements.
    (2) The basic property records must be: (i) Subject to internal 
accounting controls, (ii) auditable, (iii) equal in the aggregate to the 
total investment

[[Page 406]]

reflected in the financial property control accounts as well as the 
total of the cost allocations supporting the determination of cost-of-
service at any particular point in time, and (iv) maintained throughout 
the life of the property.
    (3) The basic property records shall consist of (i) continuing 
property records and (ii) records supplemental thereto which together 
reveal clearly, by accounting area, the detailed and systematically 
summarized information necessary to meet fully the requirements of 
paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.
    (4) Companies shall establish and maintain basic property records 
for each class of property recorded in the several plant accounts which 
comprise the balance sheet Account 2001, Telecommunications Plant In 
Service, Account 2002, Property Held for Future Telecommunications Use, 
and Account 2006, Nonoperating Plant.
    (5) The company shall notify the Commission of a plan for the basic 
property record as follows:
    (i) Not later than June 30 of the year following that in which it 
becomes subject to this system of accounts, the company shall file with 
the Commission two (2) copies of a complete plan of the method to be 
used in the compilation of a basic property record with respect to each 
class of property. The plan shall include a list of proposed accounting 
areas accompanied by description of the boundaries of each area as 
defined in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 32.2000(f)(1) (i) 
and (ii) of this subpart. The plan shall also include a list of property 
record units proposed for use under each regulated plant account. These 
property record units shall be selected such that the requirements of 
Sec. 32.2000(f)(2) (i), (ii) and (iii) of this subpart can be satisfied.
    (ii) The company shall submit to the Commission one copy of any 
major proposed changes in its basic property record plan at least 30 
days before the effective date of the proposed changes.
    (6) The company shall prepare and maintain the basic property record 
as follows:
    (i) Not later than June 30 of the year following that in which the 
company becomes subject to this system of accounts, begin the 
preparation of a basic property record.
    (ii) Complete within two years of the prescribed beginning date, 
basic property records for all property as of the end of the preceding 
calendar year.
    (iii) Promptly process in the basic property records all property 
changes affecting periods subsequent to initial establishment of the 
basic property record.
    (7) The basic property record components (see paragraph (c) of this 
section) shall be arranged in conformity with the regulated plant 
accounts prescribed in this section of accounts as follows:
    (i) The continuing property records shall be compiled on the basis 
of original cost (or other book cost consistent with this system of 
accounts). The continuing property records shall be maintained as 
prescribed in Sec. 32.2000(f)(2)(iii) of this subpart in such manner as 
will meet the following basic objectives:
    (A) Provide for the verification of property record units by 
physical examination.
    (B) Provide for accurate accounting for retirements.
    (C) Provide data for use in connection with depreciation studies.
    (ii) The records supplemental to the continuing property records 
shall disclose such service designations, usage measurement criteria, 
apportionment factors, or other data as may be prescribed by the 
Commission in this Part or other Parts of its Rules and Regulations. 
Such data are subject to the same general controls and standards for 
auditability and support as are all other elements of the basic property 
records.
    (f) Standard practices for establishing and maintaining continuing 
property records--(1) Accounting area. (i) The continuing property 
record, as related to each primary plant account, shall be established 
and maintained by subaccounts for each accounting area. An accounting 
area is the smallest territory of the company for which accounting 
records of investment are maintained for all plant accounts within the 
area. Areas already established for administrative, accounting, 
valuation, or other purposes may be adopted for this purpose when 
appropriate. In no case shall the boundaries of accounting

[[Page 407]]

areas cross either State lines or boundaries prescribed by the 
Commission.
    (ii) In determining the limit of each area, consideration shall be 
given to the quantities of property, construction conditions, operating 
districts, county and township lines, taxing district boundaries, city 
limits, and other political or geographical limits, in order that the 
area adopted may have maximum adaptability, within the confines of 
practicability, for both the company's purpose and those of Federal, 
State, and municipal authorities.
    (2) Property record units. (i) In each of the established accounting 
areas, the ``property record units'' which are to be maintained in the 
continuing property record shall be set forth separately, classified by 
size and type with the amount of original cost (or other appropriate 
book cost) associated with such units. When a list of property record 
units has been accepted by the Commission, they shall become the units 
referred to in this statement of standard practices. Such units shall 
apply to only the regulated portion of this system of accounts.
    (ii) When it is found necessary to revise this list because of the 
addition of units used in providing new types of service, or new units 
resulting from improvements in technology, or because of the grouping or 
elimination of units which no longer merit separate recognition as 
property record units, one copy of such changes shall be submitted to 
the Commission. Upon appropriate showing by the company, the Commission 
may specifically exempt the company from these filing requirements.
    (iii) The continuing property record shall reveal the description, 
location, date of placement, the essential details of construction, and 
the original cost (note also Sec. 32.2000(f)(3) of this subpart) of the 
property record units. The continuing property record and other 
underlying records of construction costs shall be so maintained that, 
upon retirement of one or more retirement units or of minor items 
without replacement when not included in the costs of retirement units, 
the actual cost or a reasonably accurate estimate of the cost of the 
plant retired can be determined.
    (3) Methods of determining original cost of property record units. 
The original cost of the property record units shall be determined by 
analyses of the construction costs incurred as shown by completion 
reports and other data, accumulated in the respective construction work 
orders or authorizations. Costs shall be allocated to and associated 
with the property record units to facilitate accounting for retirements. 
The original cost of property record units shall be determined by unit 
identification or averaging as described in paragraphs (f)(3) (i) and 
(ii) of this section.
    (i) Unit identification. Cost shall be identified and maintained by 
specific location for property record units contained within certain 
regulated plant accounts or account groupings such as Land, Buildings, 
Central Office Assets, Motor Vehicles, Garage Work Equipment, and 
Furniture. In addition, units involved in any unusual or special type of 
construction shall be recorded by their specific location costs (note 
also Sec. 32.2000(f)(3)(ii)(B) of this subpart.
    (ii) Averaging. (A) Average costs may be developed for plant 
consisting of a large number of similar units such as terminal 
equipment, poles, wire, cable, cable terminals, conduit, furniture, and 
work equipment. Units of similar size and type within each specified 
accounting area and regulated plant account may be grouped. Each such 
average cost shall be set forth in the continuing property record of the 
units with which it is associated.
    (B) The averaging of costs permitted under the provisions of the 
foregoing paragraph is restricted to plant installed in a particular 
vintage or band of years incurred within an accounting area. This 
paragraph does not permit the inclusion of the cost of units involved in 
any unusual or special type of construction. The units involved in such 
unusual or special type of construction shall be recorded at cost by 
location.
    (4) Estimates. In cases where the actual original cost of property 
cannot be ascertained, such as pricing an inventory for the initial 
entry of a continuing property record or the pricing of an acquisition 
for which a continuing

[[Page 408]]

property record has not been maintained, the original cost may be 
estimated. Any estimated original cost shall be consistent with the 
accounting practices in effect at the time the property was constructed.
    (5) Identification of property record units. There shall be shown in 
the continuing property record or in record supplements thereof, a 
complete description of the property records units in such detail as to 
identify such units. The description shall include the identification of 
the work order under which constructed, the year of installation (unless 
not determinable per Sec. 32.2000(f)(4) of this subpart, specific 
location of the property within each accounting area in such manner that 
it can be readily spot-checked for proof of physical existence, the 
accounting company's number or designation, and any other description 
used in connection with the determination of the original cost. 
Descriptions of units of similar size and type shall follow prescribed 
groupings.
    (6) Reinstalled units. When units to which average costs are not 
applied, i.e., specific and fixed location units, are removed or retired 
and subsequently reinstalled, the date when the unit was first charged 
to the appropriate plant account shall, when required for adequate 
service life studies and reasonably accurate retirement accounting, be 
shown in addition to the date of reinstallation.
    (7) Age and service life of property. The continuing property record 
shall disclose the age of existing property and the supporting records 
shall disclose the service life of property retired. Exceptions from 
this requirement for any property record unit shall be submitted to the 
Commission for approval.
    (8) Reference to sources of information. There shall be shown by 
appropriate reference the source of all entries. All drawings, 
computations, and other detailed records which support quantities and 
costs or estimated costs shall be retained as a part of or in support of 
the continuing property record.
    (9) Jointly owned property. (i) With respect to jointly owned 
property, there shall be shown in the continuing property record or 
records supplemental thereto:
    (A) The identity of all joint owners.
    (B) The percentage owned by the accounting company.
    (ii) When regulated plant is constructed under arrangements for 
joint ownership, the amount received by the constructing company from 
the other joint owner or owners shall be credited as a reduction of the 
gross cost of the plant in place.
    (iii) When a sale of a part interest in regulated plant is made, the 
fractional interest sold shall be treated as a retirement and the amount 
received shall be treated as salvage. The continuing property record or 
records supplemental thereto shall be so maintained as to identify 
separately retirements of this nature from physical retirements of 
jointly owned plant.
    (iv) If jointly owned regulated property is substantial in relation 
to the total of the same kind of regulated property owned wholly by the 
company, such jointly owned regulated property shall be appropriately 
segregated in the continuing property record.
    (g) Depreciation accounting--(1) Computation of depreciation rates. 
(i) Unless otherwise provided by the Commission, either through prior 
approval or upon prescription by the Commission, depreciation percentage 
rates shall be computed in conformity with a group plan of accounting 
for depreciation and shall be such that the loss in service value of the 
property, except for losses excluded under the definition of 
depreciation, may be distributed under the straight-line method during 
the service life of the property.
    (ii) In the event any composite percentage rate becomes no longer 
applicable, revised composite percentage rates shall be computed in 
accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section.
    (iii) The company shall keep such records of property and property 
retirements as will allow the determination of the service life of 
property which has been retired, or facilitate the determination of 
service life indications by mortality, turnover, or other appropriate 
methods. Such records will also allow the determination of the 
percentage of salvage value and cost of removal for property retired 
from each class of depreciable plant.

[[Page 409]]

    (2) Depreciation charges. (i) A separate annual percentage rate for 
each depreciation category of telecommunications plant shall be used in 
computing depreciation charges.
    (ii) Companies, upon receiving prior approval from this Commission, 
or, upon prescription by this Commission, shall apply such depreciation 
rate, except where provisions of paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section 
apply, as will ratably distribute on a straight line basis the 
difference between the net book cost of a class or subclass of plant and 
its estimated net salvage during the known or estimated remaining 
service life of the plant.
    (iii) Charges for currently accruing depreciation shall be made 
monthly to the appropriate depreciation accounts, and corresponding 
credits shall be made to the appropriate depreciation reserve accounts. 
Current monthly charges shall normally be computed by the application of 
one-twelfth of the annual depreciation rate to the monthly average 
balance of the associated category of plant. The average monthly balance 
shall be computed using the balance as of the first and last days of the 
current month.
    (iv) In certain circumstances and upon prior approval of this 
Commission, monthly charges may be determined in total or in part 
through the use of other methods whereby selected plant balances or 
portions thereof are ratably distributed over periods prescribed by this 
Commission. Such circumstances could include but not be limited to 
factors such as the existence of reserve deficiencies or surpluses, 
types of plant that will be completely retired in the near future, and 
changes in the accounting for plant. Where alternative methods have been 
used in accordance with this subparagraph, such amounts shall be applied 
separately or in combination with rates determined in accordance with 
paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (3) Acquired depreciable plant. When acquired depreciable plant 
carried in Account 1439, Deferred Charges, is distributed to the 
appropriate plant accounts, adjusting entries shall be made covering the 
depreciation charges applicable to such plant for the period during 
which it was carried in Account 1439.
    (4) Plant Retired for Nonrecurring Factors not Recognized in 
Depreciation Rates.
    (i) A retirement will be considered as nonrecurring (extraordinary) 
only if the following criteria are met:
    (A) The impending retirement was not adequately considered in 
setting past depreciation rates.
    (B) The charging of the retirement against the reserve will unduly 
deplete that reserve.
    (C) The retirement is unusual such that similar retirements are not 
likely to recur in the future.
    (5) Upon direction or approval from this Commission, the company 
shall credit Account 3100, Accumulated Depreciation, and charge Account 
1438, Deferred Maintenance and Retirements, with the unprovided-for loss 
in service value. Such amounts shall be distributed from Account 1438 to 
Account 6561, Depreciation Expense--Telecommunications Plant in Service, 
or Account 6562, Depreciation Expense--Property Held for Future 
Telecommunications Use, over such period as this Commission may direct 
or approve.
    (h) Amortization accounting. (1) Unless otherwise provided by this 
Commission, either through approval, or upon prescription by this 
Commission, amortization shall be computed on the straight-line method, 
i.e., equal annual amounts shall be applied. The cost of each type asset 
shall be amortized on the basis the estimated life of that asset and 
shall not be written off in the accounting period in which the asset is 
acquired. A reasonable estimate of the useful life may be based on the 
upper or lower limits even though a fixed existence is not determinable. 
However, the period of amortization shall not exceed forty years.
    (2) In the event any estimated useful life becomes no longer 
applicable, a revised estimated useful life shall be determined in 
accordance with paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
    (3) Amortization charges shall be made monthly to the appropriate 
amortization expense accounts and corresponding credits shall be made to 
the

[[Page 410]]

appropriate amortization reserve accounts. Monthly charges shall be 
computed by the application of one-twelfth to the annual amortization 
amount.
    (4) The company shall keep such records as will allow the 
determination of the useful life of the asset.
    (i) Accounting for software. The original cost of initial operating 
system software for computers shall be classified to the same account as 
the associated hardware whether acquired separately or in conjunction 
with the associated hardware.
    (j) Plant Accounts to be Maintained by Class A and Class B telephone 
companies as indicated:

<R04>
              Subpart D--Instructions For Revenue Accounts


<R05>
Sec. 32.4999  General.

    (a) Purpose of revenue accounts. The revenue accounts are intended 
to include the actual cash inflows (or equivalents) that have or will 
occur as a result of the company's ongoing major or central operations 
during the period. They will include the revenues which arise from 
furnishing regulated telecommunications services to others, from 
directory advertising, rentals of telecommunications assets and from 
providing other services which are directly associated with the 
provision of regulated telecommunications services.
    (b) Deductions from revenue. Corrections of overcharges, authorized 
refunds of overcollections previously credited to revenue, authorized 
refunds and adjustments on account of failure in service, and other 
corrections shall be charged to the revenue account previously credited 
with the amounts involved.
    (c) Commissions. Commissions paid to others or employees in place of 
compensation or salaries for services rendered, such as public telephone 
commissions, shall be charged to Account 6623, Customer Services, and 
not to the revenue accounts. Other commissions shall be charged to the 
appropriate expense accounts.
    (d) Revenue recognition. Credits shall be made to the appropriate 
revenue accounts when such revenue is actually earned. When the billing 
cycle encompasses more than one accounting period, adjustments are 
necessary to properly recognize the revenue applicable to the current 
accounting period under report. Revenues recorded under the terms of 
two-tier contracts or other variable payment plans should be deferred, 
if necessary, and recognized ratably with expenses over the terms of the 
related contract. Any amounts deferred shall be credited to Account 
4360, Other Deferred Credits.
    (e) Contractual arrangements. Charges and credits resulting from 
activities associated with the provisions of regulated 
telecommunications services shall be recorded in a manner consistent 
with the nature of the underlying contractual arrangements. The charges 
and credits resulting from expense sharing or apportionment arrangements 
associated with the provision of regulated telecommunications services 
shall be recorded in the detailed regulated accounts. Charges and 
credits resulting from revenue settlement agreements or other revenue 
pooling arrangements associated with the provision of regulated 
telecommunications services shall be included in the appropriate revenue 
accounts. Those charges and credits resulting from contractual revenue 
pooling and/or sharing agreements shall be recorded in each prescribed 
revenue account and prescribed subsidiary record categories thereof to 
the extent that each is separately identifiable in the settlement 
process. It is not intended that settlement amounts be allocated or 
generally spread to the individual revenue accounts where they are not 
separately identifiable in the settlement process. When the settlement 
amounts are not identifiable by a revenue account they shall be recorded

considered as a revenue group for the purposes of the construction of 
the system.
    (3) Summary accounts within revenue groups shall be used to describe 
aggregations of two or more accounts having a certain commonality. 
Summary accounts are assigned numbers so that they may be used by Class

as specifically directed, so that they may be used as accounts by Class 
B telephone companies.
    (4) Accounts shall be maintained as prescribed in this Section

public network services as well as from customer premises facilities 
services. Local revenues include associated charges such as one-time

call waiting.
    (i) Network Access revenues. (1) Network Access revenues (Accounts

shall also include operating revenue derived from activities performed 
incident to the company's tariffed telecommunications operations which, 
though non-tariffed, are included in the regulatory process.
    (l) Nonregulated revenues. The nonregulated revenue account shall be 
used for nonregulated operating revenues when a nonregulated activity 
involves the common or joint use of assets or resources in the provision 
of regulated and nonregulated products or services and when such 
activity is accounted for, as required in Sec. 32.23(c) of this subpart, 
within the accounts prescribed in this system for telephone company 
operations. Revenues from nontariffed activities offered incidental to 
tariffed services may be accounted for as regulated revenues, provided 
the activities are outgrowths of regulated operations and the revenues 
do not exceed, in the aggregate, one percent of total revenues for three 
consecutive years. Such activities must be listed in the Commission-
approved Cost Allocation Manual for any company required to file a Cost 
Allocation Manual.
    (m) Uncollectible revenues. Uncollectible revenues shall include

              Subpart E--Instructions for Expense Accounts


<R05>
Sec. 32.5999  General.

    (a) Structure of the expense accounts. (1) The expense section of 
the system of accounts shall be organized by expense group summary 
account, and subsidiary record category (if required).
    (2) The expense section of this system of accounts shall be 
comprised of four major expense groups--Plant Specific Operations, Plant 
Nonspecific Operations, Customer Operations and Corporate Operations. 
Expenses to be recorded in Plant Specific and Plant Nonspecific 
Operations Expense Groups generally reflect cost associated with the 
various kinds of equipment identified in the plant asset accounts. 
Expenses to be recorded in the Customer Operations and Corporate 
Operations

[[Page 438]]

accounts reflect the costs of, or are associated with, functions 
performed by people, irrespective of the organization in which any 
particular function is performed.
    (3) Summary accounts within expense groups shall be used to describe 
aggregations of two or more accounts having a certain commonality. 
Summary accounts are assigned numbers so that they may be used by Class 
A telephone companies to aggregate accounts for reporting purposes; and 
as specifically directed, so that they may be used as accounts by Class 
B telephone companies.
    (4) Accounts shall be maintained as prescribed in this section 
subject to the conditions described in Sec. 32.13 in Subpart B. 
Subsidiary record categories may be required below the account level by 
this system of accounts or by Commission order.
    (b) Plant Specific Operations Expense. (1) The Plant Specific 
Operations Expense Accounts, 6110 through 6441, are used to record costs 
related to specific kinds of telecommunications plant.
    (2) The Plant Specific Operations Expense accounts predominantly 
mirror the telecommunications plant in service detail accounts and are 
numbered consistently with them; the first digit of the expense account 
being six (6) and the remaining digits being the same as the last three 
numbers of the related plant account. In classifying Plant Specific 
Operations expenses, the text of the corresponding plant account should 
be consulted to ensure appropriateness.
    (3) The Plant Specific Operations Expense accounts shall include the 
costs of inspecting, testing (except as specified in Account 6533, 
Testing Expense) and reporting on the condition of telecommunications 
plant to determine the need for repairs, replacements, rearrangements 
and changes; performing routine work to prevent trouble (except as 
specified in Account 6533), replacing items of plant other than 
retirement units; rearranging and changing the location of plant not 
retired; repairing material for reuse; restoring the condition of plant 
damaged by storms, floods, fire or other casualties (other than the cost 
of replacing retirement units); inspecting after repairs have been made; 
and receiving training to perform these kinds of work. Also included are 
the costs of direct supervision (immediate of first-level) and office 
support of this work.
    (4) In addition to the activities specified in paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section, the appropriate Plant Specific Operations Expense accounts 
shall include the cost of personnel whose principal job is the operation 
of plant equipment, such as general purpose computer operators, aircraft 
pilots, chauffeurs and shuttle bus drivers. However, when the operation 
of equipment is performed as part of other identifiable functions (such 
as the use of office equipment, capital tools or motor vehicles) the 
operators' cost shall be charged to accounts appropriate for those 
functions. (For costs of operator services personnel, see Accounts 6621, 
Call Completion Services, and 6622, Number Services, and for costs of 
test board personnel see Account 6533.)
    (c) Plant Nonspecific Operations Expense. The Plant Nonspecific 
Operations Expense accounts shall include expenses related to property 
held for future telecommunications use, provisioning expenses, network 
operations expenses, and depreciation and amortization expenses. 
Accounts in this group (except for Account 6540, Access Expense, and 
Accounts 6560 through 6565) shall include the costs of performing 
activities described in narratives for individual accounts. These costs 
shall also include the costs of supervision and office support of these 
activities.
    (d) Customer Operations Expense. The Customer Operations Expense 
accounts shall include the cost of performing customer related marketing 
and services activities described in narratives for individual accounts. 
These costs shall also include the costs of supervision, office support 
and training for these activities.
    (e) Corporate Operations Expense. The Corporate Operations Expense 
accounts shall include the costs of performing executive and planning 
activities and general and administrative activities described in 
narratives for individual accounts. These costs shall also include the 
costs of supervision, office support and training for these activities.

[[Page 439]]

    (f) Expense matrix. The expense accounts shall be maintained by the 
following subsidiary record categories, as appropriate to each account. 
Such subsidiary record categories shall be reported as required by part 
43 of this Commission's Rules and Regulations.
    (1) Salaries and wages. This subsidiary record category shall 
include compensation to employees, such as; wages, salaries, 
commissions, bonuses, incentive awards and termination payments.
    (2) Benefits. This subsidiary record category shall include payroll 
related benefits on behalf of employees such as the following:

Pensions
Savings plan contributions (company portion)
Worker's compensation required by law
Life, hospital, medical, dental, and vision plan insurance
Social Security and other payroll taxes.

    (3) Rents. (i) This subsidiary record category shall include amounts 
paid for the use of real and personal operating property. Amounts paid 
for real property shall be included in Account 6121, Land and Buildings 
Expense. This category includes payments for operating leases but does 
not include payments for capital leases.
    (ii) This subsidiary record category is applicable only to the Plant 
Specific Operations Expense accounts. Incidental rents, e.g., short-term 
rental car expense, shall be categorized as Other Expenses (see 
paragraph (f)(4) of this section) under the account which reflects the 
function for which the incidental rent was incurred.
    (4) Other expenses. This subsidiary record category shall include 
costs which cannot be classified to the other subsidiary record 
categories. Included are material and supplies, including provisioning 
(note also Account 6512, Provisioning Expense); contracted services; 
accident and damage payments, insurance premiums; traveling expenses and 
other miscellaneous costs.
    (5) Clearances. This subsidiary record category shall include 
amounts transferred to Construction accounts (see Sec. 32.2000 
(c)(2)(iii)), other Plant Specific Operations Expense accounts and/or 
Account 3100, Accumulated Depreciation (cost of removal; see 
Sec. 32.2000 (g)(1)(iii)), as appropriate, from Accounts 6112, Motor 
Vehicle Expense, 6113, Aircraft Expense, 6114, Special Purpose Vehicles 
Expense, 6116, Other Work Equipment Expense, 6534, Plant Operations 
Administration Expense, and 6535, Engineering Expense. There shall also 
be transfers to Construction or other Plant Specific Operations Expense 
accounts, as appropriate, from Account 6512, Provisioning Expense. With 
respect to these expenses, companies may establish such clearing 
accounts as they deem necessary to accomplish substantially the same 
results, provided that within 30 days of the opening of such accounts, 
companies shall notify the Commission of the nature and purpose thereof. 
Additional clearing accounts affecting other expense areas may be 
established with prior approval of the Commission. Should companies 
elect, the initial incurred subsidiary record category identification 
may be carried through to the final accounts without this Commission's 
approval.
    (g) Reimbursements. Reimbursements of actual costs incurred in 
connection with joint operations or projects repairing plant due to 
damages by others, and obligations to make changes in telecommunications 
plant (such as highway relocations), shall be credited to the accounts 
originally charged.
    (h) Expense accounts to be maintained.

assets or resources used in the provision of both regulated and 
nonregulated products and services, and which have not established a 
separate subsidiary for that purpose.
    (b) All revenue and expenses (including taxes) incurred in these 
nonregulated activities shall be recorded on separate books of account 
for such operations. Only the net of the total revenues and total 
expenses shall be recorded in this account, with a contra debit or

<R05>
Sec. 32.9000  Glossary of terms.

    When used in this system of accounts:
    Accelerated depreciation means a depreciation method or period of 
time, including the treatment given cost of removal and gross salvage, 
used in calculating depreciation deductions on income tax returns which 
is different from the depreciation method or period of time prescribed 
by this Commission for use in calculating depreciation expense recorded 
in a company's books of account.
    Account means a specific element of a chart of accounts used to 
record, classify and accumulate similar financial transactions resulting 
from the operations of the entity. ``Accounts'' or ``these accounts'' 
refer to the accounts of this system of accounts.
    Accounting system means the total set of interrelated principles, 
rules, requirements, definitions, accounts, records, procedures and 
mechanisms necessary to operate and evaluate the entity from a financial 
perspective. An accounting system generally consists of a chart of 
accounts, various parallel subsystems and subsidiary records. An 
accounting system is utilized to provide the necessary financial 
information to users to meet judiciary and other responsibilities.
    Affiliated companies means companies that directly or indirectly 
through one or more intermediaries, control or are controlled by, or are 
under common control with, the accounting company. See also Control.
    Amortization means the systematic recoveries, through ratable 
charges to expense, of the cost of assets.
    Associated equipment means that equipment which functions with a 
specific type of plant or with two (2) or more types of plant, e.g., 
switching equipment, network power equipment, circuit equipment, common 
channel network signaling equipment or network operations equipment. 
Associated equipment shall be classified to the account appropriate for 
the type of equipment with which it is predominately used rather than on 
its own characteristics.
    Illustrative examples of associated equipment are:

Alarm and signal apparatus
Auxiliary framing
Cable and cable racks
Distributing frames and equipment thereon
Frame and aisle lighting equipment (not permanently attached to the 
building)
Relay racks and panels

    Basic service area means the minimum specified calling area for 
which a tariff is prescribed.
    Book cost means the amount at which property is recorded in these 
accounts,

[[Page 456]]

without deduction of related allowances.
    Common carrier or carrier means any person engaged as a common 
carrier for hire, in interstate or foreign communication by wire or 
radio or in interstate or foreign radio transmission of energy, except 
where reference is made to common carriers not subject to this Act; but 
a person engaged in radio broadcasting shall not, insofar as such person 
is so engaged, be deemed a common carrier.
    Company or the company, when not otherwise indicated in the context, 
means the accounting entity. It includes such unincorporated entities 
which may be subject to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
    Control (including the terms ``controlling,'' ``controlled by,'' and 
``under common control with'') means the possession directly or 
indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the 
management and policies of a company, whether such power is exercised 
through one or more intermediary companies, or alone, or in conjunction 
with, or pursuant to an agreement with, one or more other companies, and 
whether such power is established through a majority or minority 
ownership or voting of securities, common directors, officers, or 
stockholders, voting trusts, holding trusts, affiliated companies, 
contract, or any other direct or indirect means.
    Cost, except as applied to telecommunications plants, franchises, 
and patent rights, means the amount of money actually paid (or the 
current money value of any consideration other than money exchanged) for 
property or services. See also Original Cost.
    Cost of removal means the cost of demolishing, dismantling, 
removing, tearing down, or otherwise disposing of telecommunications 
plant and recovering the salvage, including the cost of transportation 
and handling incident thereto.
    Depreciation means the loss not restored by current maintenance, 
incurred in connection with the consumption or prospective retirement of 
telecommunications plant in the course of service from causes which are 
known to be in current operation, against which the company is not 
protected by insurance, and the effect of which can be forecast with a 
reasonable approach to accuracy. Among the causes to be given 
consideration are wear and tear, decay, action of the elements, 
inadequacy, obsolescence, changes in technology, changes in demand and 
requirements of public authorities.
    Entity means a legal enterprise (common carrier) engaged in 
interstate communications within the meaning of the Communications Act 
of 1934, as amended.
    Group plan, as applied to depreciation accounting, means the plan 
under which depreciation charges are accrued upon the basis of the 
original cost of all property included in each depreciable plant 
account, using the average service life thereof properly weighted, and 
upon the retirement of any depreciable property its cost is charged to 
the depreciation reserve whether or not the particular item has attained 
the average service life.
    Indexed revenue threshold for a given year means $100 million, 
adjusted for inflation, as measured by the Department of Commerce Gross 
Domestic Product Chain-type Price Index (GDP-CPI), for the period from 
October 19, 1992 to the given year. The indexed revenue threshold for a 
given year shall be determined by multiplying $100 million by the ratio 
of the annual value of the GDP-CPI for the given year to the estimated 
seasonally adjusted GDP-CPI on October 19, 1992. The indexed revenue 
threshold shall be rounded to the nearest $1 million. The seasonally 
adjusted GDP-CPI on October 19, 1992 is determined to be 100.69.
    Intangible property means assets that have no physical existence but 
instead have value because of the rights which ownership confers.
    Intrasystems means assets consisting of:
    (1) PBX and Key System Common Equipment (a switchboard or switching 
equipment shared by all stations);
    (2) Associated CPE station equipment (usually telephone or Key 
Telephone Systems); and
    (3) Intrasystem wiring (all cable or wiring and associated 
components which connect the common equipment and the station equipment, 
located on

[[Page 457]]

the customer's side of the demarcation point).
    An intrasystem does not include property, plant or equipment which 
are not solely dedicated to its operation.
    Minor items, as applied to depreciable telecommunications plant, 
means any part or element of such plant, which when removed, (with or 
without replacement) does not initiate retirement accounting.
    Original cost or cost, as applied to telecommunications plant, 
rights of way and other intangible property, means the actual money cost 
of (or the current money value of any consideration other than money 
exchanged for) property at the time when it was first dedicated to use 
by a regulated telecommunications entity, whether the accounting company 
or by predecessors.
For the application of this definition to property acquired from 
predecessors see Sec. 32.2000(b)(1) of Subpart C. Note also the 
definition of Cost in this section.
    Plant retired means plant which has been removed, sold, abandoned, 
destroyed, or otherwise withdrawn from service.
    Retirement units, as applied to depreciable telecommunications 
plant, means those items of plant which when removed (with or without 
replacement) cause the initiation of retirement accounting entries.
    Salvage value means the amount received for property retired, if 
sold, or if retained for reuse, the amount at which the material 
recovered is chargeable to Account 1220, Material and Supplies, or other 
appropriate account.
    Straight-line method, as applied to depreciation accounting, means 
the plan under which the cost of property is charged to operating 
expenses and credited to accumulated depreciation through equal annual 
charges as nearly as may be during its service life.
    Subsidiary record means accumulation of detailed information which 
is required by this Commission to be maintained in support of entries to 
the accounts.
    Subsidiary record categories means those segregations of certain 
regulated costs, expenses and revenues which must be maintained and are 
subject to specific reporting requirements of this Commission.
    Subsystems, parallel mechanisms means processes or procedures which 
augment the use of a chart of accounts in the financial operation of the 
entity. These subsystems operate on and/or process account and 
subsidiary record information for specific purposes.
    Telecommunications means any transmission, emission, or reception of 
signs, signals, writing, images or sounds or intelligence of any nature 
by wire, radio, visual or other electromagnetic systems. This 
encompasses the aggregate of several modes of conveying information, 
signals or messages over a distance. Included in the telecommunications 
industry is the transmitting, receiving, or exchanging of information 
among multiple locations. The minimum elements required for the 
telecommunications process to occur are a message source, a transmission 
medium and a receiver.
    Time of installation means the date at which telecommunications 
plant is placed in service.
    Time of retirement means the date at which telecommunications plant 
is retired from service.
    Tangible property means assets characterized by physical existence, 
such as land, buildings, equipment, furniture, fixtures and tools.

<R04>
                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 36.1  General.

    (a) This part contains an outline of separations procedures for 
telecommunications companies on the station-to-station basis. These 
procedures are applicable either to property costs, revenues, expenses, 
taxes, and reserves as recorded on the books of the company or to 
estimated amounts.
    (1) Where a value basis is used instead of book costs, the ``costs'' 
referred to are the ``values'' of the property derived from the 
valuation.
    (b) The separations procedures set forth in this part are designed 
primarily for the allocation of property costs, revenues, expenses, 
taxes and reserves between state and interstate jurisdictions. For 
separations, where required, of the state portion between exchange and 
toll or for separations of individual exchanges or special services, 
further analyses and studies may be required to adapt the procedures to 
such additional separations.
    (c) The fundamental basis on which separations are made is the use 
of telecommunications plant in each of the operations. The first step is 
the assignment of the cost of the plant to categories. The basis for 
making this assignment is the identification of the plant assignable to 
each category and the determination of the cost of the plant so 
identified. The second step is the apportionment of the cost of the 
plant in each category among the operations by direct assignment where 
possible, and all remaining costs are assigned by the application of 
appropriate use factors.
    (d) In assigning book costs to categories, the costs used for 
certain plant classes are average unit costs which equate to all book 
costs of a particular account or subaccount; for other plant classes, 
the costs used are those which either directly approximate book cost 
levels or which are equated to match total book costs at a given 
location.
    (e) The procedures outlined herein reflect ``short-cuts'' where 
practicable and where their application produces substantially the same 
separations results as would be obtained by the use of more detailed 
procedures, and they assume the use of records generally maintained by 
Telecommunications Companies.
    (f) The classification to accounts of telecommunications property, 
revenues, expenses, etc., set forth in this manual is that prescribed by 
the Federal Communications Commission's Uniform System of Accounts for 
Telecommunications Companies.
    (g) In the assignment of property costs to categories and in the 
apportionment of such costs among the operations, each amount so 
assigned and apportioned is identified as to the account classification 
in which the property is included. Thus, the separated results are 
identified by property accounts and apportionment bases are provided for 
those expenses which are separated on the basis of the apportionment of 
property costs. Similarly, amounts of revenues and expenses assigned 
each of the operations are identified as to account classification.
    (h) The separations procedures described in this part are not to be 
interpreted as indicating what property, revenues, expenses and taxes, 
or what items carried in the income, reserve and retained earnings 
accounts, should or should not be considered in any investigation or 
rate proceeding.

[[Page 461]]


<R05>
Sec. 36.2  Fundamental principles underlying procedures.

    (a) The following general principles underlie the procedures 
outlined in this part:
    (1) Separations are intended to apportion costs among categories or 
jurisdictions by actual use or by direct assignment.
    (2) Separations are made on the ``actual use'' basis, which gives 
consideration to relative occupancy and relative time measurements.
    (3) In the development of ``actual use'' measurements, measurements 
of use are (i) determined for telecommunications plant or for work 
performed by operating forces on a unit basis (e.g., conversation-
minute-kilometers per message, weighted standard work seconds per call) 
in studies of traffic handled or work performed during a representative 
period for all traffic and (ii) applied to overall traffic volumes, 
i.e., 24-hour rather than busy-hour volumes.
    (b) Underlying the procedures included in this manual for the 
separation of plant costs is an over-all concept which may be described 
as follows:
    (1) Telecommunications plant, in general, is segregable into two 
broad classifications, namely, (i) interexchange plant, which is plant 
used primarily to furnish toll services, and (ii) exchange plant, which 
is plant used primarily to furnish local services.
    (2) Within the interexchange classification, there are three broad 
types of plant, i.e., operator systems, switching plant, and trunk 
transmission equipment. Within the exchange classification there are 
four board types of plant, i.e., operator systems, switching plant, 
truck equipment and subscriber plant. Subscriber plant comprises lines 
to the subscriber.
    (3) In general, the basis for apportioning telecommunications plant 
used jointly for state and interstate operations are:
    (i) Operator work time expressed in weighted standard work seconds 
is the basis for measuring the use of operator systems.
    (ii) Holding-time-minutes is the basis for measuring the use of toll 
switching plant.
    (iii) Conversation-minute-kilometers or conversation minutes is the 
basis for measuring the use of interexchange circuit plant and holding-
time minutes is the basis for measuring the use of exchange trunk plant. 
While the use of holding-time-minute-kilometers is the basic fundamental 
allocation factor for interexchange circuit plant and exchange trunk 
plant, the use of conversation-minute-kilometers or conversation-minutes 
for the allocation of interexchange circuit plant and holding-time 
minutes for the allocation of exchange trunk plant are considered 
practical approximations for separations between state and interstate 
operations when related to the broad types of plant classifications used 
herein.
    (iv) A subscriber plant factor is the basis of apportioning the cost 
of message telecommunications subscriber plant and local switching plant 
between State and interstate operations. The subscriber plant factor is 
developed and used according to the procedures set forth in 
Sec. 36.154(c) through Sec. 36.154(f).
    (c) Property rented to affiliates, if not substantial in amount, is 
included as used property of the owning company with the associated 
revenues and expenses treated consistently: Also such property rented 
from affiliates is not included with the used property of the company 
making the separations; the rent paid is included in its expenses. If 
substantial in amount, the following treatment is applied:
    (1) In the case of property rented to affiliates, the property and 
related expenses and rent revenues are excluded from the telephone 
operations of the owning company, and
    (2) In the case of property rented from affiliates, the property and 
related expenses are included with, and the rent expenses are excluded 
from, the telephone operations of the company making the separation.
    (d) Property rented to or from non-affiliates is usually to be 
included as used property of the owning company with the associated 
revenues and expenses treated consistently. In the event the amount is 
substantial, the property involved and the revenues and expenses 
associated therewith may be

[[Page 462]]

excluded from or included in the telecommunications operations of the 
company. When required, the cost of property rented to or from non-
affiliates is determined using procedures that are consistent with the 
procedures for the allocation of costs among the operations.
    (e) Costs associated with services or plant billed to another 
company which have once been separated under procedures consistent with 
general principles set forth in this part, and are thus identifiable as 
entirely interstate or State in nature, shall be directly assigned to 
the appropriate operation and jurisdiction.

                        Central Office Equipment


<R05>
Sec. 36.121  General.

    (a) The costs of central office equipment are carried in the 
following accounts:

Central Office Switching...............  Account 2210                   
  Analog Electronic Switching..........  Account 2211                   
  Digital Electronic Switching.........  Account 2212                   
  Electro-Mechanical Switching.........  Account 2215                   
Operator Systems.......................  Account 2220                   
Central Office--Transmission...........  Account 2230                   
  Radio Systems........................  Account 2231                   
  Circuit Equipment....................  Account 2232                   
                                                                        

    (b) Records of the cost of central office equipment are usually 
maintained for each study area separately by accounts. However, each 
account frequently includes equipment having more than one use. Also, 
equipment in one account frequently is associated closely with equipment 
in the same building in another account. Therefore, the separations 
procedures for central office equipment have been designed to deal with 
categories of plant rather than with equipment in an account.
    (c) In the separation of the cost of central office equipment among 
the operations, the first step is the assignment of the equipment in 
each study area to categories. The basic method of making this 
assignment is the identification of the equipment assignable to each 
category, and the determination of the cost of the identified equipment 
by analysis of accounting, engineering and other records.
    (1) The cost of common equipment not assigned to a specific 
category, e.g., common power equipment, including emergency power 
equipment, aisle lighting and framework, including distributing frames, 
is distributed among the categories in proportion to the cost of 
equipment, (excluding power equipment not dependent upon common power 
equipment) directly assigned to categories.
    (i) The cost of power equipment used by one category is assigned 
directly to that category, e.g., 130 volt power supply provided for 
circuit equipment. The cost of emergency power equipment protecting only 
power equipment used by one category is also assigned directly to that 
category.
    (ii) Where appropriate, a weighting factor is applied to the cost of 
circuit equipment in distributing the power plant costs not directly 
assigned, in order to reflect the generally greater power use per dollar 
of cost of this equipment.
    (d) The second step is the apportionment of the cost of the 
equipment in each category among the operations through the application 
of appropriate use factors or by direct assignment.


<R05>
Sec. 36.122  Categories and apportionment procedures.

    (a) The following categories of central office equipment and 
apportionment procedures therefore are set forth in Secs. 36.123 through 
36.126.

Operator Systems Equipment.............  Category 1.

<R05>
Sec. 36.123  Operator systems equipment--Category 1.

    (a) Operator systems equipment is contained in Account 2220. It 
includes all types of manual telephone switchboards except tandem 
switchboards and those used solely for recording of calling telephone 
numbers in connection with customer dialed charge traffic. It includes 
all face equipment, terminating relay circuits of trunk and toll line 
circuits, cord circuits, cable turning sections, subscriber line 
equipment, associated toll connecting trunk equipment, number checking 
facilities, ticket distributing systems, calculagraphs, chief operator 
and other desks, operator chairs, and other such equipment.
    (1) Operator systems equipment is generally classified according to 
operating arrangements of which the following are typical:

(i) Separate toll boards
(ii) Separate local manual boards
(iii) Combined local manual and toll boards
(iv) Combined toll and DSA boards
(v) Separate DSA and DSB boards
(vi) Service observing boards
(vii) Auxiliary service boards

[[Page 464]]

(viii) Traffic service positions

    (2) If switchboards as set forth in Sec. 36.123(a) are of the key 
pulsing type, the cost of the key pulsing senders, link and trunk finder 
equipment is included with the switchboards.
    (3) DSB boards include the associated DSB dial equipment, such as 
link and sender equipment.
    (4) Traffic service position systems include the common control and 
trunk equipment in addition to the associated groups of positions 
wherever located.
    (b) The cost of the following operator systems equipment is 
apportioned among the operations on the basis of the relative number of 
weighted standard work seconds handled at the switchboards under 
consideration.
    (1) The following types of switchboards at toll centers are 
generally apportioned individually:
    (i) Separate toll boards. These usually include outward, through and 
inward positions in separate lines and associated inward toll 
switchboard positions in line.
    (ii) Switchboards handling both local and toll, either combined or 
having segregated local and toll positions in the same line.
    (iii) Switchboards handling both toll and DSA, either combined or 
having segregated toll and DSA positions in the same line.
    (iv) Traffic service positions, including separately located groups 
of these positions when associated with a common basic control unit.
    (2) The following types of switchboards at toll centers are 
apportioned individually, or by groups of comparable types of boards for 
each exchange:
    (i) Separate local manual boards. This includes the local positions 
of manual boards where inward toll positions are in the same line.
    (ii) Separate DSA boards.
    (iii) Separate DSB boards.
    (3) Tributary boards may be treated individually if warranted or 
they may be treated on a group basis.
    (c) Auxiliary service boards generally handle rate and route, 
information, and intercept service at individual or joint positions. The 
cost of these boards is apportioned as follows:
    (1) The cost of separate directory assistance boards is apportioned 
among the operations on the basis of the relative number of weighted 
standard work seconds handled at the boards under consideration. 
Directory assistance weighted standard work seconds are apportioned 
among the operations on the basis of the classification of these 
weighted standard work seconds as follows:
    (i) Directory assistance weighted standard work seconds first are 
classified between calls received over toll directory assistance trunks 
from operators or customers and all other directory assistance calls.
    (ii) The directory assistance weighted standard work seconds of each 
type further are classified separately among the operations on the basis 
of an analysis of a representative sample of directory assistance calls 
of each type with reference to the locations of the calling and called 
stations for each call.
    (2) The cost of separate intercept boards and automated intercept 
systems in the study area is appportioned among the operations on the 
basis of the relative number of subscriber line minutes of use.
    (3) The cost of separate rate and route boards is generally included 
with the cost of the toll boards served and is apportioned with those 
boards.
    (4) Where more than one auxiliary service is handled at an auxiliary 
board, the cost of the board is apportioned among the auxiliary services 
on the basis of the relative number of weighted standard work seconds 
for each service. The cost of that part of the board allocated to each 
auxiliary service is apportioned among the operations in the same manner 
as for a separate auxiliary board.
    (d) The cost of joint exchange and toll service observing boards is 
first apportioned between exchange and toll use on the basis of the 
relative number of exchange and toll service observing units at these 
boards. The cost of separate toll service observing boards and the toll 
portion of joint service observing boards is apportioned between state 
and interstate operations on the basis of the relative number of toll 
minutes

[[Page 465]]

of use associated with the toll messages originating in the offices 
observed.
    (e) Traffic Service Position System (TSPS) investments are 
apportioned as follows:
    (1) Operator position investments are apportioned on the basis of 
the relative weighted standard work seconds for the entire TSPS complex.
    (2) Remote trunk arrangement (RTA) investments are apportioned on 
the basis of the relative processor real time (i.e., actual seconds) 
required to process TSPS traffic originating from the end offices served 
by each RTA.
    (3) The remaining investments at the central control location, such 
as the stored program control and memory, is apportioned on the basis of 
the relative processor real time (i.e., actual seconds) for the entire 
TSPS complex.


<R05>
Sec. 36.124  Tandem switching equipment--Category 2.

    (a) Tandem switching equipment is contained in Accounts 2210, 2211, 
2212 and 2215. It includes all switching equipment in a tandem central 
office, including any associated tandem switchboard positions and any 
intertoll switching equipment. Intertoll switching equipment includes 
switching equipment used for the interconnection of message toll 
telephone circuits with each other or with local or tandem telephone 
central office trucks, intertoll dial selector equipment, or intertoll 
trunk equipment in No. 5 type electronic offices. Equipment, including 
switchboards used for recording of calling telephone numbers and other 
billing information in connection with customer dialed charge traffic is 
included with Local Switching Equipment--Category 3.
    (1) At toll center toll offices, intertoll switching equipment 
comprises equipment in the toll office used in the interconnection of: 
Toll center to toll center circuits; toll center to tributary circuits; 
tributary to tributary circuits; toll center to tandem circuits or in 
the interconnection of the aforementioned types of circuits with trunks 
to local offices in the toll center city, i.e., interconnection with 
toll switching trunks, operator trunks, information trunks, testing 
trunks, etc. Equipment associated with the local office end of such 
trunks is included with local switching equipment or switchboard 
categories as appropriate.
    (2) At tributary offices, this category includes intertoll switching 
equipment similar to that at toll center toll offices if it is used in 
the interconnection of: Tributary to tributary circuits; tributary to 
subtributary circuits; subtributary to subtributary circuits; toll 
center to subtributary circuits; or if it is used jointly in the 
interconnection of any of the aforementioned types of circuits and in 
the interconnection of such toll circuits with trunk circuits for the 
handling of traffic terminating in the tributary office. Where 
comparable equipment has no joint use but is used only for the handling 
of traffic terminating in the tributary office, it is included in the 
local switching equipment category.
    (3) At all switching entities, this category includes intertoll 
switching equipment similar to that at toll center toll offices if it is 
used in the interconnection of switched private line trunks or TWX 
switching plant trunks when these functions are in addition to the 
message telephone switching function. Switching entities wholly 
dedicated to switching of special services are assigned to Category 3--
Local Switching Equipment.
    (b) The costs of central office equipment items assigned this 
category are to be directly assigned when possible. When direct 
assignment is not possible the costs shall be apportioned among the 
operations on the basis of the relative number of study area minutes of 
use of this equipment.


<R05>
Sec. 36.125  Local switching equipment--Category 3.

    (a) Local switching equipment is included in accounts 2210, 2211, 
2212 and 2215. It comprises all central office switching equipment not 
assigned other categories. Examples of local switching equipment are 
basic switching train, toll connecting trunk equipment, interlocal 
trunks, tandem trunks, terminating senders used for toll completion, 
toll completing train, call reverting equipment, weather and time of day 
service equipment, and

[[Page 466]]

switching equipment at electronic analog or digital remote line 
locations. Equipment used for the identification, recording and timing 
of customer dialed charge traffic, or switched private line traffic 
(e.g. transmitters, recorders, call identity indexers, perforators, 
ticketers, detectors, mastertimes) switchboards used solely for 
recording of calling telephone numbers in connection with customer 
dialed charge traffic, or switched private line traffic (or both) is 
included in this local switching category. Equipment provided and used 
primarily for operator dialed toll or customer dialed charge traffic 
except such equipment included in Category 2 Tandem Switching Equipment 
is also included in this local switching category. This includes such 
items as directors translators, sender registers, out trunk selectors 
and facilites for toll intercepting and digit absorption. Special 
services switching equipment which primarily performs the switching 
function for special services (e.g. switching equipment, TWX 
concentrators and switchboards) is also included in this local switching 
category.
    (1) Local office, as used in Sec. 36.125, comprises one or more 
local switching entities of the same equipment type (e.g., step-by-step, 
No. 5 Crossbar) in an individual location. A local switching entity 
comprises that local central office equipment of the same type which has 
a common intermediate distributing frame, market group or other 
separately identifiable switching unit serving one or more prefixes (NNX 
codes).
    (2) A host/remote local switching complex is composed of an 
electronic analog or digital host office and all of its remote 
locations. A host/remote local switching complex is treated as one local 
office. The current jurisdictional definition of an exchange will apply.
    (b) Beginning January 1, 1993, Category 3 investment for study areas 
with 50,000 or more access lines is apportioned on the basis of relative 
dial equipment minutes of use, (DEM) i.e., the minutes of holding time 
of the originating and terminating local switching equipment, as holding 
time is defined in the Glossary.
    (c) During the 1988-1992 period, Category 3 investment for study 
areas with 50,000 or more access lines is apportioned by the application 
of an interstate allocation factor that is computed by adding the 
following two elements for the appropriate transition year (the A 
component times the composite allocator plus the B component times the 
DEM allocator). The A and B components are specified in Sec. 36.125 (d) 
and (e). The composite allocator is computed by dividing the combined 
interstate investment included in former Central Office Equipment 
Categories 4, 5, 6 and 7 on December 31, 1987, by the combined total 
investment included in former Central Office Equipment Categories 4, 5, 
6 and 7 on December 31, 1987. The DEM allocator is computed in the same 
manner as the interstate allocation factor described in Section 36.125 
(b).
    (d) The ``A Component'' for each of the five years is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 ``A    
                            Year                             Component''
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1988.......................................................          .9 
1989.......................................................          .7 
1990.......................................................          .5 
1991.......................................................          .3 
1992.......................................................          .1 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) The ``B Component'' for each of the five years is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 ``B    
                            Year                             Component''
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1988.......................................................          .1 
1989.......................................................          .3 
1990.......................................................          .5 
1991.......................................................          .7 
1992.......................................................          .9 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (f) For study areas with fewer than 50,000 access lines, Category 3 
investment is apportioned by the application of an interstate allocation 
factor that is the lesser of either .85 or an amount that follows: 
Beginning January 1, 1993, the amount will equal the DEM factor 
specified in Sec. 36.125 (b) multiplied by a weighting factor. During 
the 1988--1992 period, the amount will equal the sum of two elements for 
the appropriate transition year (the A component times the composite 
allocator plus the B component times the DEM allocator times a weighting 
factor). The A and B components are specified in Sec. 36.125 (d)

[[Page 467]]

and (e). The applicable weighting factor is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               Weighting
         No. of access lines in service in study area            factor 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0-10,000.....................................................        3.0
10,001-20,000................................................        2.5
20,001-50,000................................................        2.0
50,001-or above..............................................        1.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (g) For purposes of this section, an access line is a line that does 
not include WATS access lines, special access lines or private lines.

    (iii) All Other Interexchange Circuit Equipment--Category 4.23.
    (3) Host/Remote Message Circuit Equipment--Category 4.3.
    (4) In addition, for the purpose of identifying and separating 
property associated with special services, circuit equipment included in 
Categories 4.12 (other than wideband equipment) 4.13 and 4.23 is 
identified as either basic circuit equipment, i.e., equipment that 
performs functions necessary to provide and operate channels suitable 
for voice transmission (telephone grade channels), or special circuit 
equipment, i.e., equipment that is peculiar to special service circuits. 
Carrier telephone terminals and carrier telephone repeaters are examples 
of basic circuit equipment is general use, while audio program 
transmission amplifiers, bridges, monitoring devices and volume 
indicators, telegraph carrier terminals and telegraph repeaters are 
examples of special circuit equipment in general use. Cost of exchange 
circuit equipment included in Categories 4.12 and 4.13 and the 
interexchange circuit equipment in Categories 4.21, 4.22 and 4.23 are 
segregated between basic circuit equipment and special circuit equipment 
only at those locations where amounts of interexchange and

[[Page 468]]

exchange special circuit equipment are significant. Where such 
segregation is not made, the total costs in these categories are 
classified as basic circuit equipment.
    (c) Apportionment of Exchange Circuit Equipment Among the 
Operations:
    (1) Wideband Exchange Line Circuit Equipment--Category 4.11--The 
cost of exchange circuit equipment in this category is determined 
separately for each wideband facility. The respective costs are 
allocated to the appropriate operation in the same manner as the related 
exchange line cable and wire facilities described in Sec. 36.155.
    (2) Exchange Trunk Circuit Equipment (Wideband and Non-Wideband)--
Category 4.12--The cost of exchange circuit equipment associated with 
this category for the study area is allocated to the appropriate 
operation in the same manner as the related exchange trunk cable and 
wire facilities as described in Sec. 36.155.
    (3) Exchange Line Circuit Equipment Excluding Wideband--Category 
4.13--The cost of Circuit Equipment associated with exchange line plant 
excluding wideband for the study area is assigned to subcategories and 
is allocated to the appropriate operation in the same manner as the 
related exchange line cable and wire facilities for non-wideband service 
as described in Sec. 36.154.
    (d) Apportionment of Interexchange Circuit Equipment among the 
Operations: Procedures to be Used by Interexchange Carriers.
    (1) Interexchange Circuit Equipment Furnished to Another Company for 
Interstate Use--Category 4.21--This category comprises that circuit 
equipment provided for the use of another company as an integral part of 
its interexchange circuit facilities used wholly for interstate 
services. This category includes such circuit equipment as telephone 
carrier, terminals telegraph carrier terminals, and microwave systems 
used wholly for interstate services. The total cost of the circuit 
equipment in this category for the study area is assigned to the 
interstate operation.
    (2) Interexchange Circuit Equipment Used for Wideband Service--
Category 4.22--This category includes the circuit equipment portion of 
interexchange channels used for wideband services. The cost of 
interexchange circuit equipment in this category is determined 
separately for each wideband channel and is segregated between message 
and private line services on the basis of the use of the channels 
provided. The respective costs are allocated to the appropriate 
operation in the same manner as the related interexchange cable and wire 
facilities as described in Sec. 36.156.
    (3) All Other Interexchange Circuit Equipment--Category 4.23--This 
category includes the cost of all interexchange circuit equipment not 
assigned to Categories 4.21 and 4.22. Interexchange carriers shall 
freeze the allocation factors for Category 4.23 investment at levels 
reached on December 31, 1985, derived by using the procedures in effect 
at that time. On January 1, 1988, and thereafter, that frozen allocation 
factor shall be applied to each interexchange carrier's Category 4.23 
investment to derive the interstate allocation. On January 1, 1988, and 
thereafter, the amount of investment allocated to the interstate 
jurisdiction will vary but the relative proportion of the total 
investment that is allocated to the interstate jurisdiction will remain 
frozen at 1985 levels.
    (e) Apportionment of Interexchange Circuit Equipment among the 
Operations: Procedures To Be Used by Exchange Carriers.
    (1) Interexchange Circuit Equipment Furnished to Another Company for 
Interstate Use--Category 4.21--This category comprises that circuit 
equipment provided for the use of another company as an integral part of 
its interexchange circuit facilities used wholly for interstate 
services. This category includes such circuit equipment as telephone 
carrier terminals telegraph carrier terminals, and microwave systems 
used wholly for interstate services. The total cost of the circuit 
equipment in this category for the study area is assigned to the 
interstate operation.
    (2) Interexchange Circuit Equipment Used for Wideband Service--
Category 4.22--This category includes the circuit equipment portion of 
interexchange channels used for wideband services.

[[Page 469]]

The cost of interexchange circuit equipment in this category is 
determined separately for each wideband channel and is segregated 
between message and private line services on the basis of the use of the 
channels provided. The respective costs are allocated to the appropriate 
operation in the same manner as the related interexchange cable and wire 
facilities described in Sec. 36.156.
    (3) All Other Interexchange Circuit Equipment--Category 4.23--This 
category includes the cost of all interexchange circuit equipment not 
assigned to Categories 4.21 and 4.22. The cost of interexchange basic 
circuit equipment used for the following classes of circuits is included 
in this category: Jointly used message circuits, i.e., message switching 
plant circuits carrying messages from the state and interstate 
operations; circuits used exclusively for TWX service; circuits uses for 
interstate private line service; and circuits used for state private 
line services.
    (i) An average interexchange circuit equipment cost per equivalent 
interexchange telephone termination for all circuits is determined and 
applied to the equivalent interexchange telephone termination counts of 
each of the following classes of circuits: Interstate Private Line, 
State Private Line, Message, and TWX. The cost of interstate private 
line circuits is assigned directly to the interstate operation. The cost 
of state private line circuits is assigned directly to the state 
operation. The cost of message circuits is apportioned between the state 
and interstate operations on the basis of the relative number of study 
area conversation-minutes applicable to such facilities.
    (ii) The cost on interexchange circuit equipment assigned TWX 
circuits is apportioned between state and interstate toll in accordance 
with Sec. 36.126(e)(3)(i) and pursuant to the following procedures. The 
cost of circuit equipment associated with the TWX intertoll circuits 
used jointly for state and interstate operations is apportioned between 
the operations on the basis of the relative number of study area TWX 
connection-minutes applicable to such facilities. The cost of circuit 
equipment associated with the interexchange portion of the TWX remote 
access lines is apportioned between state and interstate operation on 
the basis of the relative number of study area TWX connection-minutes 
applicable to those facilities.
    (iii) The cost of special circuit equipment is segregated among TWX 
service, telegraph grade private line services and other private line 
services based on an analysis of the use of the equipment and in 
accordance with Sec. 36.126(b)(4). The cost of TWX special circuit 
equipment is apportioned on the same basis as that used for intertoll 
TWX circuits. The special circuit equipment cost assigned to telegraph 
grade and other private line services is directly assigned to the 
appropriate operation.
    (f) Apportionment of Host/Remote Message Circuit Equipment Among the 
Operations.
    (1) Host/Remote Message Circuit Equipment--Category 4.3. This 
category includes message host/remote location circuit equipment for 
which a message circuit switching function is performed at the host 
central office associated with cable and wire facilities as described in 
Sec. 36.152(c).
    (i) The category 4.3 cost of host/remote circuit equipment assigned 
to message services for the study area is apportioned among the 
exchange, intrastate toll, and interstate toll operations on the basis 
of the assignment of host/remote message cable and wire facilities as 
described in Sec. 36.157.

                        Cable and Wire Facilities


<R05>
Sec. 36.151  General.

    (a) Cable and Wire Facilities, Account 2410, includes the following 
types of communications plant in service: Poles and antenna supporting 
structures, aerial cable, underground cable, buried cable, submarine 
cable, deep sea cable, intrabuilding network cable, aerial wire and 
conduit systems.
    (b) For separations purposes, it is necessary to analyze the cable 
and wire facilities classified in subordinate records in order to 
determine their assignment to the categories listed in the following 
paragraphs.
    (c) In the separation of the cost of cable and wire facilities among 
the operations, the first step is the assignment of the facilities to 
certain categories. The basic method of making this assignment is the 
identification of the facilities assignable to each category and the 
determination of the cost of the facilities so identified. Because of 
variations among companies in the character of the facilities and 
operating conditions, and in the accounting and engineering records 
maintained, the detailed methods followed, of necessity, will vary among 
the companies. The general principles to be followed, however, will be 
the same for all companies.
    (d) The second step is the apportionment of the cost of the 
facilities in each category among the operations through the application 
of appropriate factors or by direct assignment.


<R05>
Sec. 36.152  Categories of Cable and Wire Facilities (C&WF).

    (a) C&WF are basically divided between exchange and interexchange. 
Exchange C&WF consists of the following categories:
    (1) Exchange Line C&WF Excluding Wideband--Category 1--This category 
includes C&W facilities between local central offices and subscriber 
premises used for message telephone, TWX subscriber lines, private line, 
local channels, and for circuits between control terminals and radio 
stations providing very high frequency maritime service or urban or 
highway mobile service.
    (2) Wideband and Exchange Trunk C&WF--Category 2--This category 
includes all wideband, including Exchange Line Wideband and C&WF between 
local central offices and Wideband facilities. It also includes C&WF 
between central offices or other switching points used by any common 
carrier for interlocal trunks wholly within an exchange or metropolitan 
service area, interlocal trunks with one or both terminals outside a 
metropolitan service area carrying some exchange traffic, toll 
connecting trunks, tandem trunks principally carrying exchange traffic, 
the exchange trunk portion of TWX and WATS access lines the exchange 
trunk portion of private line local channels, and the exchange trunk 
portion of circuits between control terminals and radio stations 
providing very high frequency maritime service or urban or highway 
mobile service.
    (3) The procedures for apportioning the cost of exchange cable and 
wire facilites among the operations are set forth in Secs. 36.154 and 
36.155.
    (b) Interexchange C&WF--Category 3--This category includes the C&WF 
used for message toll and toll private

[[Page 471]]

line services. It includes cable and wire facilities carrying intertoll 
circuits, tributary circuits, the interexchange channel portion of 
special service circuits, circuits between control terminals and radio 
stations used for overseas or coastal harbor service, interlocal trunks 
between offices in the different exchange or metropolitan service areas 
carrying only message toll traffic and certain tandem trunks which carry 
principally message toll traffic.
    (1) The procedures for apportioning the cost of interexchange cable 
and wire facilities among the operations are set forth in Sec. 36.156.
    (c) Host/Remote Message C&WF--Category 4--This category includes the 
cost of message host/remote location C&WF for which a message circuit 
switching function is performed at the host central office. It applies 
to C&WF between host offices and all remote locations. The procedures 
for apportioning the cost of these facilities among the operations are 
set forth in Sec. 36.157.


<R05>
Sec. 36.153  Assignment of Cable and Wire Facilities (C&WF) to categories.

    (a) Cable consists of: Aerial cable, underground cable, buried 
cable, submarine cable, deep sea cable and intrabuilding network cable. 
Where an entire cable or aerial wire is assignable to one category, its 
cost and quantity are, where practicable, directly assigned.
    (1) Cable. (i) There are two basic methods for assigning the cost of 
cable to the various categories. Both of them are on the basis of 
conductor cross section. The methods are as follows:
    (A) By section of cable, uniform as to makeup and relative use by 
categories. From an analysis of cable engineering and assignment 
records, determine in terms of equivalent gauge the number of pairs in 
use or reserved, for each category. The corresponding percentages of 
use, or reservation, are applied to the cost of the section of cable, 
i.e., sheath meters times unit cost per meter, to obtain the cost 
assignable to each category.
    (B) By using equivalent pair kilometers, i.e., pair kilometers 
expressed in terms of equivalent gauge. From an analysis of cable 
engineering and assignment records, determine the equivalent pair 
kilometers in use for each category by type of facility, e.g., quadded, 
paired. The equivalent pair kilometers are then divided by a cable fill 
factor to obtain the equivalent pair kilometers in plant. The total 
equivalent pair kilometers in plant assigned to each category is 
summarized by type of facility, e.g., quadded and paired, and priced at 
appropriate average unit costs per equivalent pair kilometer in plant. 
If desired, this study may be made in terms of circuit kilometers rather 
than physical pair kilometers, with average cost and fill data 
consistent with the basis of the facilities kilometer count.
    (ii) In the assignment of the cost of cable under the two basic 
methods described in Sec. 36.153(a)(1)(i) consideration is given to the 
following:
    (A) Method (A) described in Sec. 36.153(a)(1)(i)(A) will probably be 
found more desirable where there is a relatively small amount of cable 
of variable make-up and use by categories. Conversely, method (B) 
described in Sec. 36.153(a)(1)(i)(B) will probably be more desirable 
where there is a large amount of cable of variable make-up and use by 
categories. However, in some cases a combination of both methods may be 
desirable.
    (B) It will be desirable in some cases to determine the amount 
assignable to a particular category by deducting from the total the sum 
of the amounts assigned to all other categories.
    (C) For use in the assignment of poles to categories, the equivalent 
sheath kilometers of aerial cable assigned to each category are 
determined. For convenience, these quantities are determined in 
connection with assignment of cable costs.
    (D) Where an entire cable is assignable to one category, its costs 
and quantity are, where practicable, directly assigned.
    (iii) For cables especially arranged for high-frequency transmission 
such as shielded, disc-insulated and coaxial, recognition is given to 
the additional costs which are charged to the high-frequency complement.
    (2) Cable Loading. (i) Methods for assigning the cost of loading 
coils, cases, etc., to categories are comparable with

[[Page 472]]

those used in assigning the associated cable to categories. Loading 
associated with cable which is directly assigned to a given category is 
also directly assigned. The remaining loading is assigned to categories 
in either of the following bases:
    (A) By an analysis of the use made of the loading facilities where a 
loading coil case includes coils assignable to more than one category, 
e.g., in the case of a single gauge uniformly loaded section, the 
percentage used in the related cable assignment are applicable, or
    (B) By pricing out each category by determining the pair meters of 
loaded pairs assigned to each category and multiplying by the unit cost 
per pair meter of loading by type.
    (3) Other Cable Plant. (i) In view of the small amounts involved, 
the cost of all protected terminals and gas pressure contactor terminals 
in the toll cable subaccounts is assigned to the appropriate 
Interexchange Cable & Wire Facilities categories. The cost of all other 
terminals in the exchange and toll cable subaccounts is assigned to 
Exchange Cable and Wire Facilities.
    (b) Aerial Wire. (1) The cost of wire accounted for as exchange is 
assigned to the appropriate Exchange Cable & Wire Facilities categories. 
The cost of wire accounted for as toll, which is used for exchange, is 
also assigned to the appropriate Exchange Cable & Wire Facilities 
categories. The cost of the remaining wire accounted for as toll is 
assigned to the appropriate Interexchange Cable & Wire Facilities 
categories as described in Sec. 36.156. For companies not maintaining 
exchange and toll subaccounts, it is necessary to review the plant 
records and identify wire plant by use. The cost of wire used for 
providing circuits directly assignable to a category is assigned to that 
category. The cost of wire used for providing circuit facilities jointly 
used for exchange and interexchange lines is assigned to categories on 
the basis of the relative number of circuit kilometers involved.
    (c) Poles and Antenna Supporting Structures. (1) In the assignment 
of these costs, anchors, guys, crossarms, antenna supporting structure, 
and right-of-way are included with the poles.
    (2) Poles. (i) The cost of poles is assigned to categories based on 
the ratio of the cost of poles to the total cost of aerial wire and 
aerial cable.
    (d) Conduit Systems. (1) The cost of conduit systems is assigned to 
categories on the basis of the assignment of the cost of underground 
cable.

<R05>
Sec. 36.154  Exchange Line Cable and Wire Facilities (C&WF)--Category 1--apportionment procedures.

    (a) Exchange Line C&WF--Category 1. The first step in apportioning 
the cost of exchange line cable and wire facilities among the operations 
is the determination of an average cost per working loop. This average 
cost per working loop is determined by dividing the total cost of 
exchange line cable and wire Category 1 in the study area by the sum of 
the working loops described in subcategories listed below. The 
subcategories are:
    Subcategory 1.1--State private lines and state WATS lines. This 
subcategory shall include all private lines and WATS lines carring 
exclusively state traffic as well as private lines and WATS lines 
carrying exclusively interstate traffic as well as private lines and 
WATS lines carrying both state and interstate traffic if the interstate 
traffic on the line involved constitutes ten percent or less of the 
total traffic on the line.
    Subcategory 1.2--Interstate private lines and interstate WATS lines. 
This subcategory shall include all private lines and WATS lines that 
carry exclusively interstate traffic as well as private lines and WATS 
lines carrying both state and interstate traffic if the interstate 
traffic on the line involved constitutes more than ten percent of the 
total traffic on the line.
    Subcategory 1.3--Subscriber or common lines that are jointly used 
for local exchange service and exchange access for state and interstate 
interexchange services.
    (b) The costs assigned to subcategories 1.1 and 1.2 shall be 
directly assigned to the appropriate jurisdication.

[[Page 473]]

    (c) Except as provided in Sec. 36.154(d) through (f), effective 
January 1, 1986, 25 percent of the costs assigned to subcategory 1.3 
shall be allocated to the interstate jurisdiction.
    (d) Except as provided in Sec. 36.154(f), the interstate allocation 
of subcategory 1.3 costs for the years 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992 
will be as follows:
    (1) 1988--The Sec. 36.154(e) allocation factor multiplied by .625 
plus .09375.
    (2) 1989--The Sec. 36.154(e) allocation factor multiplied by .5 plus 
.125.
    (3) 1990--The Sec. 36.154(e) allocation factor multiplied by .375 
plus .15625.
    (4) 1991--The Sec. 36.154(e) allocation factor multiplied by .25 
plus .1875.
    (5) 1992--The Sec. 36.154(e) allocation factor multiplied by .125 
plus .21875.
    (e) For purposes of the transitional allocations described in 
Sec. 36.154(d) and (f) an allocation factor known as the subscriber 
plant factor or SPF that is the sum of the following shall be computed:
    (1) Annual average interstate subscriber line use (SLU), for the 
calendar year 1981.\2\ representing the interstate use of the subscriber 
plant as measured by the ratio of interstate holding time minutes of use 
to total holding time minutes of use applicable to traffic originating 
and terminating in the study area, multiplied by .85, the nationwide 
ratio of subscriber plant costs assignable to the exchange operation per 
minute of exchange use to total subscriber plant cost per total minute 
of use of subscriber plant, plus
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ In the case of a company that cannot calculate the average 
interstate subscriber line usage (SLU) ratio for the calendar year 1981, 
the average interstate SLU for the customarily used 12-month study 
period ending in 1981 may be utilized. In the case of a company for 
which no such 1981 annual average SLU exists, the annual average 
interstate SLU for the initial study period will be utilized.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Twice the annual average interstate subscriber line use ratio 
for the study area for the calendar year 1981, multiplied by the annual 
average composite station rate ratio used for the calendar year 1981 
(ratio of the nationwide, industry-wide average interstate initial 3-
minute station charge at the study area average interstate length of 
haul to the nationwide, industry-wide average total toll initial 3-
minute station charge at the nationwide average length of haul for all 
toll traffic for the total telephone industry).
    (f) Limit on Change in Interstate Allocation. (1) No study area's 
percentage interstate allocation for Subcategory 1.3 Exchange Line C&WF 
and COE, Exchange Line Circuit Equipment Excluding Wideband--Category 
4.13 investment as well as associated maintenance and depreciation shall 
decrease by a total of more than five percentage points from one 
calendar year to the next as a result of the combined operations of 
Secs. 36.154(d) and 36.641(a) and (b).
    (2) The determination of whether the decrease in the interstate 
allocation for a given study area resulting from the operation of 
Secs. 36.154(d) and 36.641(a) through Sec. 36.641(b) exceeds five 
percentage points shall be made by calculating a percentage interstate 
allocation for both of the years involved. This shall be done by 
dividing the interstate allocation of subcategory 1.3 Exchange Line C&WF 
and COE exchange Line circuit Equipment Excluding Wideband Category 4.13 
and associated expenses for each year as calculated pursuant to 
Sec. 36.154(f)(4) by the total unseparated investment in Exchange Line 
C&WF subcategory 1.3 and COE Category 4.13 and associated expenses for 
the corresponding year as calculated pursuant to Sec. 36.154(f)(5).
    (3) If the resulting percentage for the more recent of the two years 
is more than five percentage points less than the percentage for the 
earlier year, the decrease in the interstate allocations shall be 
reduced pro rata for plant investment, maintenance and depreciation so 
that the difference between the two percentages does not equal more than 
five percentage points.
    (4) The sum of the following:
    (i) The net interstate allocation of Exchange Line C&WF--subcategory 
1.3 investment calculated pursuant to Sec. 36.154(d) and (e) multiplied 
by the authorized interstate rate of return.
    (ii) The net interstate allocation of COE Exchange Line Circuit 
Equipment--Category 4.13 investment calculated purusant to 
Sec. 36.154(d) and (e)

[[Page 474]]

multiplied by the authorized interstate rate of return.
    (iii) The interstate allocation of maintenance and depreciation 
attributable to Exchange Line C&WF subcategory 1.3 customer premises 
wire and COE Exhange Line Circuit Equipment--Category 4.13 calculated 
pursuant to Sec. 36.154(d) and (e).
    (iv) The amount of the additional interstate expense allocation 
calculated pursuant to Sec. 36.641.
    (5) The sum of the following:
    (i) The net unseparated Exchange Line C&WF subcategory 1.3 
investment multiplied by the authorized interstate rate of return.
    (ii) The net unseparated COE Exchange Line Circuit--Category 4.13 
investment multiplied by the authorized interstate rate of return.
    (iii) The unseparated maintenance and depreciation attributable to 
Exchange Line C&WF subcategory 1.3 investment, customer premises wiring 
investment and COE Exhange Line Circuit Equipment--Category 4.13 
investment.

number of users of the following services: Message toll telephone and 
telegram (excluding semi-public where tolls are not itemized on the 
bill); TWX; exchange including semi-public; directory advertising; and 
private line services, as determined by analysis for a representative 
period. In determining the number of users, an individual customer is 
counted once for each class of service which it uses; for example, a 
majority of customers are counted both as message toll telephone and 
telegram users and as exchange users.
    (1) Expense allocated to message toll telephone and telegram users

assessed in a particular state, one-half of the end user common line 
access charge billing expense shall be apportioned to the interstate 
operations. If no end user common line charge is assessed for intrastate 
toll access, all of the end user common line access charge billing 
expense shall be assigned to interstate operations.

<R05>
Sec. 36.412  Apportionment procedures.

    (a) For apportionment purposes, the expenses in this account are 
segregated into two groups as follows: (1) Operating Federal, State and 
local income taxes and (2) all other operating taxes.
    (b) Operating Federal, State and local income taxes are apportioned 
among the operations on the basis of the approximate net taxable income 
(positive or negative) applicable to each of the operations. The 
approximate net taxable income from each of the operations is the 
summation of the following amounts apportioned to each operation by 
means of the procedures set forth in this Manual:
    (1) Operating revenues,
    (2) Less operating expenses,
    (3) Less operating taxes except the net income tax being apportioned 
and except any other tax not treated as a deductible item in the 
determination of taxable net income for this purpose.
    (4) Less operating fixed charges.
    (i) The amount of fixed charges attributable to the operations is 
obtained by subtracting the tax component (positive or negative) 
attributable to other than the operating fixed charges, i.e., fixed 
charges on non-operating investments are that proportion of total fixed 
charges which non-operating net investments are of total operating and 
non-operating net investments.
    (ii) Operating fixed charges including interest on Rural Telephone 
Bank Stock are apportioned among the operations on the basis of the 
separation of the cost of telephone plant less appropriate reserves.
    (c) Other operating taxes should be directly assigned to the 
appropriate jurisdiction where possible, e.g., Local Gross Receipts may 
be directly identified as applicable to one jurisdiction. Where direct 
assignment is not feasible, these expenses should be apportioned among 
the operations on the basis of the separation of the cost of 
Telecommunications Plant in Service--Account 2001.

                          Equal Access Expenses


<R05>
Sec. 36.421  Equal access expenses.

    (a) Equal access expenses include only initial incremental pre-
subscription costs and other initial incremental expenditures related 
directly to the provision of equal access, that would not be required to 
upgrade the capabilities of the office involved absent the provision of 
equal access. Equal access expenses are limited to such expenditures for 
converting central offices that serve competitive interexchange carriers 
or where there has been a bona fide request for conversion to equal 
access.
    (b) Equal access expenses are apportioned between the jurisdictions 
by first segregating them from all other expenses in the primary 
accounts and then allocating them on the same basis as equal access 
investment.

            Calculation of Loop Costs for Expense Adjustment


<R05>
Sec. 36.621  Study area total unseparated loop cost.

    (a) For the purpose of calculating the expense adjustment, the study 
area total unseparated loop cost equals the sum of the following:
    (1) Return component for net unseparated Exchange Line C&WF 
subcategory 1.3 investment and Exchange Line CO Circuit Equipment 
Category 4.13 investment. This amount is calculated by deducting the 
accumulated depreciation and noncurrent deferred Federal income taxes 
attributable to C&WF subcategory 1.3 investment and Exchange Line 
Category 4.13 circuit investment reported pursuant to Sec. 36.611(a)(2) 
from the gross investment in Exchange Line C&WF subcategory 1.3 and CO 
Category 4.13 reported pursuant to Sec. 36.611(a)(1) to obtain the net 
unseparated C&WF subcategory 1.3 investment, and CO Category 4.13 
investment. The net unseparated C&WF subcategory 1.3 investment and CO 
Category 4.13 investment is multiplied by the study area's authorized 
interstate rate of return.
    (2) Depreciation expense attributable to C&WF subcategory 1.3 
investment, and CO Category 4.13 investment as reported in 
Sec. 36.611(a)(3).
    (3) Maintenance expense attributable to C&WF subcategory 1.3 
investment, and CO Category 4.13 investment as reported in 
Sec. 36.611(a)(4).
    (4) Corporate Operations Expenses, Operating Taxes and the benefits 
and rent portions of operating expenses, as reported in 
Sec. 36.611(a)(5) attributable to investment in C&WF Category 1.3 and 
COE Category 4.13. This amount is calculated by multiplying the total 
amount of these expenses and taxes by the ratio of the unseparated gross 
exchange plant investment in C&WF Category 1.3 and COE Category 4.13, as 
reported in Sec. 36.611(a)(1), to the unseparated gross 
telecommunications plant investment, as reported in Sec. 36.611(a)(6).

    (a) National Average Unseparated Loop Cost per Working Loop. Except 
as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, this is equal to the sum 
of the Loop Costs for each study area in the country as calculated 
pursuant to Sec. 36.621(a) divided by the sum of the working loops 
reported in Sec. 36.611(a)(8) for each study area in the country. The 
national average unseparated loop cost per working loop shall be 
calculated by the National Exchange Carrier Association.
    (1) The National Average Unseparated Loop Cost per Working Loop 
shall be recalculated by the National Exchange Carrier Association to 
reflect the optional September, December and March update filings.

filings by the most recent filing date.
    (3) The calculation of a new national average to reflect the update 
filings

[[Page 489]]

shall not affect the amount of the additional interstate expense 
allocation for companies which did not make an update filing by the most 
recent filing date.
    (b) Study Area Average Unseparated Loop Cost per Working Loop. This 
is equal to the unseparated loop costs for the study area as calculated 
pursuant to Sec. 36.621(a) divided by the number of working loops 
reported in Sec. 36.611(a)(8) for the study area.
    (1) If a company elects to update the data which it has filed with 
the National Exchange Carrier Association as provided in Sec. 36.612(a), 
the study area average unseparated loop cost per working loop and the 
amount of its additional interstate expense allocation shall be 
recalculated to reflect the updated data.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (c) During an interim period commencing on January 1, 1994, and 
terminating on the effective date of the Commission's universal service 
rules, to be adopted in CC Docket No. 96-45 on or before May 8, 1997, 
the National Average Unseparated Loop Cost per Working Loop shall be the 
greater of:
    (1) The amount calculated pursuant to the method described in 
paragraph (a) of this section; or

shall be subject to any penalty for failing to comply with a collection 
of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) that does 
not display a valid control number. Questions concerning the OMB control 
numbers and expiration dates should be directed to the Records
