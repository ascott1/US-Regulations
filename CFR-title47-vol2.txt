                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2000, consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 20.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of these rules is to set forth the requirements and 
conditions applicable to commercial mobile radio service providers.


<R05>
Sec. 20.3  Definitions.

    Automatic Number Identification (ANI). A system that identifies the 
billing account for a call. For 911 systems, the ANI identifies the 
calling party and may be used as a call back number.
    Commercial mobile radio service. A mobile service that is:
    (a)(1) provided for profit, i.e., with the intent of receiving 
compensation or monetary gain;
    (2) An interconnected service; and
    (3) Available to the public, or to such classes of eligible users as 
to be effectively available to a substantial portion of the public; or
    (b) The functional equivalent of such a mobile service described in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    Designated PSAP. The Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) designated 
by the local or state entity that has the authority and responsibility 
to designate the PSAP to receive wireless 911 calls.
    Incumbent Wide Area SMR Licensees. Licensees who have obtained 
extended implementation authorizations in the 800 MHz or 900 MHz 
service, either by waiver or under Section 90.629 of these rules, and 
who offer real-time, two-way voice service that is interconnected with 
the public switched network.
    Handset-based location technology. A method of providing the 
location of wireless 911 callers that requires the use of special 
location-determining hardware and/or software in a portable or mobile 
phone. Handset-based location technology may also employ additional 
location-determining hardware and/or software in the CMRS network and/or 
another fixed infrastructure.
    Interconnection or Interconnected. Direct or indirect connection 
through automatic or manual means (by wire, microwave, or other 
technologies such as store and forward) to permit the transmission or 
reception of messages or signals to or from points in the public 
switched network.
    Interconnected Service. A service: (a) That is interconnected with 
the public switched network, or interconnected with the public switched 
network through an interconnected service provider, that gives 
subscribers the capability to communicate to or receive communication 
from all other users on the public switched network; or
    (b) For which a request for such interconnection is pending pursuant 
to section 332(c)(1)(B) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 
332(c)(1)(B). A mobile service offers interconnected service even if the 
service allows subscribers to access the public switched network only 
during specified hours of the day, or if the service provides general 
access to points on the public switched network but also restricts 
access in certain limited ways. Interconnected service does not include 
any interface between a licensee's facilities and the public switched 
network exclusively for a licensee's internal control purposes.
    Location-capable handsets. Portable or mobile phones that contain 
special location-determining hardware and/or

[[Page 6]]

software, which is used by a licensee to locate 911 calls.
    Mobile Service. A radio communication service carried on between 
mobile stations or receivers and land stations, and by mobile stations 
communicating among themselves, and includes:
    (a) Both one-way and two-way radio communications services;
    (b) A mobile service which provides a regularly interacting group of 
base, mobile, portable, and associated control and relay stations 
(whether licensed on an individual, cooperative, or multiple basis) for 
private one-way or two-way land mobile radio communications by eligible 
users over designated areas of operation; and
    (c) Any service for which a license is required in a personal 
communications service under part 24 of this chapter.
    Network-based Location Technology. A method of providing the 
location of wireless 911 callers that employs hardware and/or software 
in the CMRS network and/or another fixed infrastructure, and does not 
require the use of special location-determining hardware and/or software 
in the caller's portable or mobile phone.
    Private Mobile Radio Service. A mobile service that is neither a 
commercial mobile radio service nor the functional equivalent of a 
service that meets the definition of commercial mobile radio service. 
Private mobile radio service includes the following:
    (a) Not-for-profit land mobile radio and paging services that serve 
the licensee's internal communications needs as defined in part 90 of 
this chapter. Shared-use, cost-sharing, or cooperative arrangements, 
multiple licensed systems that use third party managers or users 
combining resources to meet compatible needs for specialized internal 
communications facilities in compliance with the safeguards of 
Sec. 90.179 of this chapter are presumptively private mobile radio 
services;
    (b) Mobile radio service offered to restricted classes of eligible 
users. This includes entities eligible in the Public Safety Radio Pool 
and Radiolocation service.
    (c) 220-222 MHz land mobile service and Automatic Vehicle Monitoring 
systems (part 90 of this chapter) that do not offer interconnected 
service or that are not-for-profit; and
    (d) Personal Radio Services under part 95 of this chapter (General 
Mobile Services, Radio Control Radio Services, and Citizens Band Radio 
Services); Maritime Service Stations (excluding Public Coast stations) 
(part 80 of this chapter); and Aviation Service Stations (part 87 of 
this chapter).
    Pseudo Automatic Number Identification (Pseudo-ANI). A number, 
consisting of the same number of digits as ANI, that is not a North 
American Numbering Plan telephone directory number and may be used in 
place of an ANI to convey special meaning. The special meaning assigned 
to the pseudo-ANI is determined by agreements, as necessary, between the 
system originating the call, intermediate systems handling and routing 
the call, and the destination system.
    Public Safety Answering Point. A point that has been designated to 
receive 911 calls and route them to emergency service personnel.
    Public Switched Network. Any common carrier switched network, 
whether by wire or radio, including local exchange carriers, 
interexchange carriers, and mobile service providers, that use the North 
American Numbering Plan in connection with the provision of switched 
services.

[59 FR 18495, Apr. 19, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 38402, July 24, 1996; 
61 FR 40352, Aug. 2, 1996; 62 FR 18843, Apr. 17, 1997; 63 FR 2637, Jan. 
16, 1998; 64 FR 60130, Nov. 4, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 20.5  Citizenship.

    (a) This rule implements section 310 of the Communications Act, 47 
U.S.C. 310, regarding the citizenship of licensees in the commercial 
mobile radio services. Commercial mobile radio service authorizations 
may not be granted to or held by:
    (1) Any foreign government or any representative thereof;
    (2) Any alien or the representative of any alien;
    (3) Any corporation organized under the laws of any foreign 
government;
    (4) Any corporation of which more than one-fifth of the capital 
stock is owned of record or voted by aliens or their representatives or 
by a foreign government or representative thereof

[[Page 7]]

or by any corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country; or
    (5) Any corporation directly or indirectly controlled by any other 
corporation of which more than one-fourth of the capital stock is owned 
of record or voted by aliens, their representatives, or by a foreign 
government or representative thereof, or by any corporation organized 
under the laws of a foreign country, if the Commission finds that the 
public interest will be served by the refusal or revocation of such 
license.
    (b) The limits listed in paragraph (a) of this section may be 
exceeded by eligible individuals who held ownership interests on May 24, 
1993, pursuant to the waiver provisions established in section 332(c)(6) 
of the Communications Act. Transfers of ownership to any other person in 
violation of paragraph (a) of this section are prohibited.

[59 FR 18495, Apr. 19, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 55580, Oct. 28, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 20.6  CMRS spectrum aggregation limit.

    (a) Spectrum limitation. No licensee in the broadband PCS, cellular, 
or SMR services (including all parties under common control) regulated 
as CMRS (see 47 CFR 20.9) shall have an attributable interest in a total 
of more than 45 MHz of licensed broadband PCS, cellular, and SMR 
spectrum regulated as CMRS with significant overlap in any geographic 
area, except that in Rural Service Areas (RSAs), as defined in 47 CFR 
22.909, no licensee shall have an attributable interest in a total of 
more than 55 MHz of licensed broadband PCS, cellular, and SMR spectrum 
regulated as CMRS with significant overlap in any RSA.
    (b) SMR spectrum. To calculate the amount of attributable SMR 
spectrum for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, an entity must 
count all 800 MHz and 900 MHz channels located at any SMR base station 
inside the geographic area (MTA or BTA) where there is significant 
overlap. All 800 MHz channels located on at least one of those 
identified base stations count as 50 kHz (25 kHz paired), and all 900 
MHz channels located on at least one of those identified base stations 
count as 25 kHz (12.5 kHz paired); provided that any discrete 800 or 900 
MHz channel shall be counted only once per licensee within the 
geographic area, even if the licensee in question utilizes the same 
channel at more than one location within the relevant geographic area. 
No more than 10 MHz of SMR spectrum in the 800 and 900 MHz SMR services 
will be attributed to an entity when determining compliance with the 
cap.
    (c) Significant overlap. (1) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this 
section, significant overlap of a PCS licensed service area and CGSA(s) 
(as defined in Sec. 22.911 of this chapter) or SMR service area(s) 
occurs when at least 10 percent of the population of the PCS licensed 
service area for the counties contained therein, as determined by the 
latest available decennial census figures as complied by the Bureau of 
the Census, is within the CGSA(s) and/or SMR service area(s).
    (2) The Commission shall presume that an SMR service area covers 
less than 10 percent of the population of a PCS service area if none of 
the base stations of the SMR licensee are located within the PCS service 
area. For an SMR licensee's base stations that are located within a PCS 
service area, the channels licensed at those sites will be presumed to 
cover 10 percent of the population of the PCS service area, unless the 
licensee shows that its protected service contour for all of its base 
stations covers less than 10 percent of the population of the PCS 
service area.
    (d) Ownership attribution. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this 
section, ownership and other interests in broadband PCS licensees, 
cellular licensees, or SMR licensees will be attributed to their holders 
pursuant to the following criteria:
    (1) Controlling interest shall be attributable. Controlling interest 
means majority voting equity ownership, any general partnership 
interest, or any means of actual working control (including negative 
control) over the operation of the licensee, in whatever manner 
exercised.
    (2) Partnership and other ownership interests and any stock interest 
amounting to 20 percent or more of the equity, or outstanding stock, or 
outstanding voting stock of a broadband

[[Page 8]]

PCS, cellular or SMR licensee shall be attributed, except that ownership 
will not be attributed unless the partnership and other ownership 
interests and any stock interest amount to at least 40 percent of the 
equity, or outstanding stock, or outstanding voting stock of a broadband 
PCS, cellular or SMR licensee if the ownership interest is held by a 
small business or a rural telephone company, as these terms are defined 
in Sec. 1.2110 of this chapter or other related provisions of the 
Commission's rules, or if the ownership interest is held by an entity 
with a non-controlling equity interest in a broadband PCS licensee or 
applicant that is a small business.
    (3) Investment companies, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3, insurance 
companies and banks holding stock through their trust departments in 
trust accounts will be considered to have an attributable interest only 
if they hold 40 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of a 
corporate broadband PCS, cellular or SMR licensee, or if any of the 
officers or directors of the broadband PCS, cellular or SMR licensee are 
representatives of the investment company, insurance company or bank 
concerned. Holdings by a bank or insurance company will be aggregated if 
the bank or insurance company has any right to determine how the stock 
will be voted. Holdings by investment companies will be aggregated if 
under common management.
    (4) Non-voting stock shall be attributed as an interest in the 
issuing entity if in excess of the amounts set forth in paragraph (d)(2) 
of this section.
    (5) Debt and instruments such as warrants, convertible debentures, 
options, or other interests (except non-voting stock) with rights of 
conversion to voting interests shall not be attributed unless and until 
converted, except that this provision does not apply in determining 
whether an entity is a small business, a rural telephone company, or a 
business owned by minorities and/or women, as these terms are defined in 
Sec. 1.2110 of this chapter or other related provisions of the 
Commission's rules.
    (6) Limited partnership interests shall be attributed to limited 
partners and shall be calculated according to both the percentage of 
equity paid in and the percentage of distribution of profits and losses.
    (7) Officers and directors of a broadband PCS licensee or applicant, 
cellular licensee, or SMR licensee shall be considered to have an 
attributable interest in the entity with which they are so associated. 
The officers and directors of an entity that controls a broadband PCS 
licensee or applicant, a cellular licensee, or an SMR licensee shall be 
considered to have an attributable interest in the broadband PCS 
licensee or applicant, cellular licensee, or SMR licensee.
    (8) Ownership interests that are held indirectly by any party 
through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by 
successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in 
the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution 
benchmark to the resulting product, except that if the ownership 
percentage for an interest in any link in the chain exceeds 50 percent 
or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were a 100 
percent interest. (For example, if A owns 20% of B, and B owns 40% of 
licensee C, then A's interest in licensee C would be 8%. If A owns 20% 
of B, and B owns 51% of licensee C, then A's interest in licensee C 
would be 20% because B's ownership of C exceeds 50%.)
    (9) Any person who manages the operations of a broadband PCS, 
cellular, or SMR licensee pursuant to a management agreement shall be 
considered to have an attributable interest in such licensee if such 
person, or its affiliate, has authority to make decisions or otherwise 
engage in practices or activities that determine, or significantly 
influence,
    (i) The nature or types of services offered by such licensee;
    (ii) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (iii) The prices charged for such services.
    (10) Any licensee or its affiliate who enters into a joint marketing 
arrangements with a broadband PCS, cellular, or SMR licensee, or its 
affiliate shall be considered to have an attributable interest, if such 
licensee, or its affiliate, has authority to make decisions

[[Page 9]]

or otherwise engage in practices or activities that determine, or 
significantly influence,
    (i) The nature or types of services offered by such licensee;
    (ii) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (iii) The prices charged for such services.
    (e) Divestiture. (1) Divestiture of interests as a result of a 
transfer of control or assignment of authorization must occur prior to 
consummating the transfer or assignment, except that a licensee that 
meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section 
shall have 90 days from final grant to come into compliance with the 
spectrum aggregation limit.
    (2) An applicant with:
    (i) Controlling or attributable ownership interests in broadband 
PCS, cellular, and/or SMR licenses where the geographic license areas 
cover 20 percent or less of the applicant's service area population;
    (ii) Attributable interests in broadband PCS, cellular, and/or SMR 
licenses solely due to management agreements or joint marketing 
agreements; or
    (iii) Non-controlling attributable interests in broadband PCS, 
cellular, and/or SMR licenses, regardless of the degree to which the 
geographic license areas cover the applicant's service area population, 
shall be eligible to have its application granted subject to a condition 
that the licensee shall come into compliance with the spectrum 
limitation set out in paragraph (a) within ninety (90) days after final 
grant. For purposes of this paragraph, a ``non-controlling attributable 
interest'' is one in which the holder has less than a fifty (50) percent 
voting interest and there is an unaffiliated single holder of a fifty 
(50) percent or greater voting interest.
    (3) The applicant for a license that, if granted, would exceed the 
spectrum aggregation limitation in paragraph (a) of this section shall 
certify on its application that it and all parties to the application 
will come into compliance with this limitation. If such an applicant is 
a successful bidder in an auction, it must submit with its long-form 
application a signed statement describing its efforts to date and future 
plans to come into compliance with the spectrum aggregation limitation. 
A similar statement must also be included with any application for 
assignment of licenses or transfer of control that, if granted, would 
exceed the spectrum aggregation limit.
    (4)(i) Parties holding controlling interests in broadband PCS, 
cellular, and/or SMR licensees that conflict with the attribution 
threshold or geographic overlap limitations set forth in this section 
will be considered to have come into compliance if they have submitted 
to the Commission an application for assignment of license or transfer 
of control of the conflicting licensee (see Secs. 24.839 (PCS), 22.39 
(cellular), and 90.158 of this chapter (SMR)) by which, if granted, such 
parties no longer would have an attributable interest in the conflicting 
license. Divestiture may be to an interim trustee if a buyer has not 
been secured in the required period of time, as long as the applicant 
has no interest in or control of the trustee, and the trustee may 
dispose of the license as it sees fit. Where parties to broadband PCS, 
cellular, or SMR applications hold less than controlling (but still 
attributable) interests in broadband PCS, cellular, or SMR licensee(s), 
they shall submit a certification that the applicant and all parties to 
the application have come into compliance with the limitations on 
spectrum aggregation set forth in this section.
    (ii) Applicants that meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section must tender to the Commission within ninety (90) days of 
final grant of the initial license, such an assignment or transfer 
application or, in the case of less than controlling (but still 
attributable) interests, a written certification that the applicant and 
all parties to the application have come into compliance with the 
limitations on spectrum aggregation set forth in this section. If no 
such transfer or assignment application or certification is tendered to 
the Commission within ninety (90) days of final grant of the initial 
license, the Commission may consider the certification and the 
divestiture statement to be material, bad

[[Page 10]]

faith misrepresentations and shall invoke the condition on the initial 
license or the assignment or transfer, cancelling or rescinding it 
automatically, shall retain all monies paid to the Commission, and, 
based on the facts presented, shall take any other action it may deem 
appropriate.

    Note 1 to Sec. 20.6: For purposes of the ownership attribution 
limit, all ownership interests in operations that serve at least 10 
percent of the population of the PCS service area should be included in 
determining the extent of a PCS applicant's cellular or SMR ownership.
    Note 2 to Sec. 20.6: When a party owns an attributable interest in 
more than one cellular or SMR system that overlaps a PCS service area, 
the total population in the overlap area will apply on a cumulative 
basis.
    Note 3 to Sec. 20.6: Waivers of Sec. 20.6(d) may be granted upon an 
affirmative showing:
    (1) That the interest holder has less than a 50 percent voting 
interest in the licensee and there is an unaffiliated single holder of a 
50 percent or greater voting interest;
    (2) That the interest holder is not likely to affect the local 
market in an anticompetitive manner;
    (3) That the interest holder is not involved in the operations of 
the licensee and does not have the ability to influence the licensee on 
a regular basis; and
    (4) That grant of a waiver is in the public interest because the 
benefits to the public of common ownership outweigh any potential 
anticompetitive harm to the market.

    (14) A mobile service that is the functional equivalent of a 
commercial mobile radio service.
    (i) A mobile service that does not meet the definition of commercial 
mobile radio service is presumed to be a private mobile radio service.
    (ii) Any interested party may seek to overcome the presumption that 
a particular mobile radio service is a private mobile radio service by 
filing a petition for declaratory ruling challenging a mobile service 
provider's regulatory treatment as a private mobile radio service.
    (A) The petition must show that: (1) The mobile service in question 
meets the definition of commercial mobile radio service; or
    (2) The mobile service in question is the functional equivalent of a 
service that meets the definition of a commercial mobile radio service.
    (B) A variety of factors will be evaluated to make a determination 
whether the mobile service in question is the functional equivalent of a 
commercial mobile radio service, including: consumer demand for the 
service to determine whether the service is closely substitutable for a 
commercial mobile radio service; whether changes in price for the 
service under examination, or for the comparable commercial mobile radio 
service would prompt customers to change from one service to the other; 
and market research information identifying the targeted market for the 
service under review.
    (C) The petition must contain specific allegations of fact supported 
by affidavit(s) of person(s) with personal knowledge. The petition must 
be served on the mobile service provider against whom it is filed and 
contain a certificate of service to this effect. The mobile service 
provider may file an opposition to the petition and the petitioner may 
file a reply. The general rules of practice and procedure contained in 
Secs. 1.1 through 1.52 of this chapter shall apply.
    (b) Licensees of a Personal Communications Service or applicants for 
a Personal Communications Service license, and VHF Public Coast Station 
geographic area licensees or applicants, proposing to use any Personal 
Communications Service or VHF Public Coast Station spectrum to offer 
service on a private mobile radio service basis must overcome the 
presumption that Personal Communications Service and VHF Public Coast 
Stations are commercial mobile radio services.
    (1) The applicant or licensee (who must file an application to 
modify its authorization) seeking authority to

[[Page 12]]

dedicate a portion of the spectrum for private mobile radio service, 
must include a certification that it will offer Personal Communications 
Service or VHF Public Coast Station service on a private mobile radio 
service basis. The certification must include a description of the 
proposed service sufficient to demonstrate that it is not within the 
definition of commercial mobile radio service in Sec. 20.3. Any 
application requesting to use any Personal Communications Service or VHF 
Public Coast Station spectrum to offer service on a private mobile radio 
service basis will be placed on public notice by the Commission.
    (2) Any interested party may file a petition to deny the application 
within 30 days after the date of public notice announcing the acceptance 
for filing of the application. The petition shall contain specific 
allegations of fact supported by affidavit(s) of person(s) with personal 
knowledge to show that the applicant's request does not rebut the 
commercial mobile radio service presumption. The petition must be served 
on the applicant and contain a certificate of service to this effect. 
The applicant may file an opposition with allegations of fact supported 
by affidavit. The petitioner may file a reply. No additional pleadings 
will be allowed. The general rules of practice and procedure contained 
in Secs. 1.1 through 1.52 of this chapter and Sec. 22.30 of this chapter 
shall apply.
    (c) Any provider of private land mobile service before August 10, 
1993 (including any system expansions, modifications, or acquisitions of 
additional licenses in the same service, even if authorized after this 
date), and any private paging service utilizing frequencies allocated as 
of January 1, 1993, that meet the definition of commercial mobile radio 
service, shall, except for purposes of Sec. 20.5 (applicable August 10, 
1993 for the providers listed in this paragraph), be treated as private 
mobile radio service until August 10, 1996. After this date, these 
entities will be treated as commercial mobile radio service providers 
regulated under this part.

Sec. 20.13  State petitions for authority to regulate rates.

    (a) States may petition for authority to regulate the intrastate 
rates of any commercial mobile radio service. The petition must include 
the following:

[[Page 14]]

    (1) Demonstrative evidence that market conditions in the state for 
commercial mobile radio services do not adequately protect subscribers 
to such services from unjust and unreasonable rates or rates that are 
unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. Alternatively, a state's 
petition may include demonstrative evidence showing that market 
conditions for commercial mobile radio services do not protect 
subscribers adequately from unjust and unreasonable rates, or rates that 
are unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory, and that a substantial 
portion of the commercial mobile radio service subscribers in the state 
or a specified geographic area have no alternative means of obtaining 
basic telephone service. This showing may include evidence of the range 
of basic telephone service alternatives available to consumers in the 
state.
    (2) The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of the types 
of evidence, information, and analysis that may be considered pertinent 
to determine market conditions and consumer protection by the Commission 
in reviewing any petition filed by a state under this section:
    (i) The number of commercial mobile radio service providers in the 
state, the types of services offered by commercial mobile radio service 
providers in the state, and the period of time that these providers have 
offered service in the state;
    (ii) The number of customers of each commercial mobile radio service 
provider in the state; trends in each provider's customer base during 
the most recent annual period or other data covering another reasonable 
period if annual data is unavailable; and annual revenues and rates of 
return for each commercial mobile radio service provider;
    (iii) Rate information for each commercial mobile radio service 
provider, including trends in each provider's rates during the most 
recent annual period or other data covering another reasonable period if 
annual data is unavailable;
    (iv) An assessment of the extent to which services offered by the 
commercial mobile radio service providers the state proposes to regulate 
are substitutable for services offered by other carriers in the state;
    (v) Opportunities for new providers to enter into the provision of 
competing services, and an analysis of any barriers to such entry;
    (vi) Specific allegations of fact (supported by affidavit of person 
with personal knowledge) regarding anti-competitive or discriminatory 
practices or behavior by commercial mobile radio service providers in 
the state;
    (vii) Evidence, information, and analysis demonstrating with 
particularity instances of systematic unjust and unreasonable rates, or 
rates that are unjust or unreasonably discriminatory, imposed upon 
commercial mobile radio service subscribers. Such evidence should 
include an examination of the relationship between rates and costs. 
Additionally, evidence of a pattern of such rates, that demonstrates the 
inability of the commercial mobile radio service marketplace in the 
state to produce reasonable rates through competitive forces will be 
considered especially probative; and
    (viii) Information regarding customer satisfaction or 
dissatisfaction with services offered by commercial mobile radio service 
providers, including statistics and other information about complaints 
filed with the state regulatory commission.
    (3) Petitions must include a certification that the state agency 
filing the petition is the duly authorized state agency responsible for 
the regulation of telecommunication services provided in the state.
    (4) Petitions must identify and describe in detail the rules the 
state proposes to establish if the petition is granted.
    (5) States have the burden of proof. Interested parties may file 
comments in support or in opposition to the petition within 30 days 
after public notice of the filing of a petition by a state under this 
section. Any interested party may file a reply within 15 days after the 
expiration of the filing period for comments. No additional pleadings 
may be filed. Except for Sec. 1.45 of this chapter, practice and 
procedure rules contained in Secs. 1.42-1.52 of this chapter shall 
apply. The provisions of Secs. 1.771-1.773 of this chapter do not apply.

[[Page 15]]

    (6) The Commission shall act upon any petition filed by a state 
under this paragraph not later than the end of the nine-month period 
after the filing of the petition.
    (7) If the Commission grants the petition, it shall authorize the 
state to regulate rates for commercial mobile radio services in the 
state during a reasonable period of time, as specified by the 
Commission. The period of time specified by the Commission will be that 
necessary to ensure that rates are just and reasonable, or not unjustly 
or unreasonably discriminatory.
    (b) States that regulated rates for commercial mobile services as of 
June 1, 1993, may petition the Commission under this section before 
August 10, 1994, to extend this authority.
    (1) The petition will be acted upon by the Commission in accordance 
with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section.
    (2) The Commission shall act upon the petition (including any 
reconsideration) not later than the end of the 12-month period following 
the date of the filing of the petition by the state involved. Commercial 
mobile radio service providers offering such service in the state shall 
comply with the existing regulations of the state until the petition and 
any reconsideration of the petition are acted upon by the Commission.
    (3) The provisions of paragraph (a)(7) of this section apply to any 
petition granted by the Commission under this paragraph.
    (c) No sooner than 18 months from grant of authority by the 
Commission under this section for state rate regulations, any interested 
party may petition the Commission for an order to discontinue state 
authority for rate regulation.

<R05>
Sec. 20.18  911 Service.

    (a) Scope of section. The following requirements are only applicable 
to Broadband Personal Communications Services (part 24, subpart E of 
this chapter), Cellular Radio Telephone Service (part 22, subpart H of 
this chapter), and Geographic Area Specialized Mobile Radio Services and 
Incumbent Wide Area SMR Licensees in the 800 MHz and 900 MHz bands 
(included in part 90, subpart S of this chapter). In addition, service 
providers in these enumerated services are subject to the following 
requirements solely to the extent that they offer real-time, two way 
switched voice service that is interconnected with the public switched 
network and utilize an in-network switching facility which enables the 
provider to reuse frequencies and accomplish seamless hand-offs of 
subscriber calls.
    (b) Basic 911 Service. Licensees subject to this section must 
transmit all wireless 911 calls without respect to their call validation 
process to a Public Safety Answering Point, provided that ``all wireless 
911 calls'' is defined as ``any call initiated by a wireless user 
dialing 911 on a phone using a compliant radio frequency protocol of the 
serving carrier.''
    (c) TTY Access to 911 Services. Licensees subject to this section 
must be capable of transmitting 911 calls from individuals with speech 
or hearing disabilities through means other than mobile radio handsets, 
e.g., through the use of Text Telephone Devices (TTY).

    Note to paragraph (c):
    Enforcement of the provisions of this paragraph is suspended until 
October 1, 1998, in the case of calls made using a digital wireless 
system that is not compatible with TTY calls, provided that the licensee 
operating such a digital system shall make every reasonable effort to 
notify current and potential subscribers who use or may use such a 
system that they will not be able to make a 911 call over such system 
through the use of a TTY device.

    (d) Phase I enhanced 911 services. (1) As of April 1, 1998, or 
within six months of a request by the designated Public Safety Answering 
Point as set forth in paragraph (j) of this section, whichever is later, 
licensees subject to this section must provide the telephone number of 
the originator of a 911 call and the location of the cell site or base 
station receiving a 911 call from any mobile handset accessing their 
systems to the designated Public Safety Answering Point through the use 
of ANI and Pseudo-ANI.
    (2) When the directory number of the handset used to originate a 911 
call is not available to the serving carrier, such carrier's obligations 
under the paragraph (d)(1) extend only to delivering 911 calls and 
available calling party information to the designated Public Safety 
Answering Point.

    Note to paragraph (d):
    With respect to 911 calls accessing their systems through the use of 
TTYs, licensees subject to this section must comply with the 
requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section, as to 
calls made using a digital wireless system, as of October 1, 1998.

    (e) Phase II enhanced 911 service. Licensees subject to this section 
must

[[Page 17]]

provide to the designated Public Safety Answering Point Phase II 
enhanced 911 service, i.e., the location of all 911 calls by longitude 
and latitude in conformance with Phase II accuracy requirements (see 
paragraph (h) of this section).
    (f) Phase-in for network-based location technologies. Licensees 
subject to this section who employ a network-based location technology 
shall provide Phase II 911 enhanced service to at least 50 percent of 
their coverage area or 50 percent of their population beginning October 
1, 2001, or within 6 months of a PSAP request, whichever is later; and 
to 100 percent of their coverage area or 100 percent of their population 
within 18 months of such a request or by October 1, 2002, whichever is 
later.
    (g) Phase-in for handset-based location technologies. Licensees 
subject to this section who employ a handset-based location technology 
may phase in deployment of Phase II enhanced 911 service, subject to the 
following requirements:
    (1) Without respect to any PSAP request for deployment of Phase II 
911 enhanced service, the licensee shall:
    (i) Begin selling and activating location-capable handsets no later 
than March 1, 2001;
    (ii) Ensure that at least 50 percent of all new handsets activated 
are location-capable no later than October 1, 2001; and
    (iii) Ensure that at least 95 percent of all new digital handsets 
activated are location-capable no later than October 1, 2002.
    (2) Once a PSAP request is received, the licensee shall, in the area 
served by the PSAP:
    (i) Within six months or by October 1, 2001, whichever is later:
    (A) Ensure that 100 percent of all new handsets activated are 
location-capable;
    (B) Install any hardware and/or software in the CMRS network and/or 
other fixed infrastructure, as needed, to enable the provision of Phase 
II enhanced 911 service; and

    (ii) Within two years or by December 31, 2004, whichever is later, 
undertake reasonable efforts to achieve 100 percent penetration of 
location-capable handsets among its subscribers.
    (3) For all 911 calls from portable or mobile phones that do not 
contain the hardware and/or software needed to enable the licensee to 
provide Phase II enhanced 911 service, the licensee shall, after a PSAP 
request is received, support, in the area served by the PSAP, Phase I 
location for 911 calls or other available best practice method of 
providing the location of the portable or mobile phone to the PSAP.
    (4) Licensees employing handset-based location technologies shall 
ensure that location-capable portable or mobile phones shall conform to 
industry interoperability standards designed to enable the location of 
such phones by multiple licensees.
    (h) Phase II accuracy. Licensees subject to this section shall 
comply with the following standards for Phase II location accuracy and 
reliability:
    (1) For network-based technologies: 100 meters for 67 percent of 
calls, 300 meters for 95 percent of calls;
    (2) For handset-based technologies: 50 meters for 67 percent of 
calls, 150 meters for 95 percent of calls.
    (3) For the remaining 5 percent of calls, location attempts must be 
made and a location estimate for each call must be provided to the 
appropriate PSAP.
    (i) Reports on phase II plans. Licensees subject to this section 
shall report to the Commission their plans for implementing Phase II 
enhanced 911 service, including the location-determination technology 
they plan to employ and the procedure they intend to use to verify 
conformance with Phase II accuracy requirements, by October 1, 2000. 
Licensees are required to update these plans within thirty days of the 
adoption of any change. These reports and updates may be filed 
electronically in a manner to be designated by the Commission.
    (j) Conditions for enhanced 911 services. The requirements set forth 
in paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section shall be applicable only 
if the administrator of the designated Public Safety Answering Point has 
requested the services required under those paragraphs and is capable of 
receiving and utilizing the data elements associated

[[Page 18]]

with the service, and a mechanism for recovering the Public Safety 
Answering Point's costs of the enhanced 911 service is in place.
    (k) Dispatch service. A service provider covered by this section who 
offers dispatch service to customers may meet the requirements of this 
section with respect to customers who utilize dispatch service either by 
complying with the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) through (e) 
of this section, or by routing the customer's emergency calls through a 
dispatcher. If the service provider chooses the latter alternative, it 
must make every reasonable effort to explicitly notify its current and 
potential dispatch customers and their users that they are not able to 
directly reach a PSAP by calling 911 and that, in the event of an 
emergency, the dispatcher should be contacted.

<R05>
Sec. 20.20  Conditions applicable to provision of CMRS service by incumbent Local Exchange Carriers.

    (a) Separate affiliate. An incumbent LEC providing in-region 
broadband CMRS shall provide such services through an affiliate that 
satisfies the following requirements:
    (1) The affiliate shall maintain separate books of account from its 
affiliated incumbent LEC. Nothing in this section requires the affiliate 
to maintain separate books of account that comply with part 32 of this 
chapter;
    (2) The affiliate shall not jointly own transmission or switching 
facilities with its affiliated incumbent LEC that the affiliated 
incumbent LEC uses for the provision of local exchange service in the 
same in-region market. Nothing in this section prohibits the affiliate 
from sharing personnel or other resources or assets with its affiliated 
incumbent LEC; and
    (3) The affiliate shall acquire any services from its affiliated 
incumbent LEC for which the affiliated incumbent LEC is required to file 
a tariff at tariffed rates, terms, and conditions. Other transactions 
between the affiliate and the incumbent LEC for services that are not 
acquired pursuant to tariff must be reduced to writing and must be made 
on a compensatory, arm's length basis. All transactions between the 
incumbent LEC and the affiliate are subject to part 32 of this chapter, 
including the affiliate transaction rules. Nothing in this section shall 
prohibit the affiliate from acquiring any unbundled network elements or 
exchange services for the provision of a telecommunications service from 
its affiliated incumbent LEC, subject to the same terms and conditions 
as provided in an agreement approved under section 252 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
    (b) Independence. The affiliate required in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be a separate legal entity from its affiliated incumbent 
LEC. The affiliate may be staffed by personnel of its affiliated 
incumbent LEC, housed in existing offices of its affiliated incumbent 
LEC, and use its affiliated incumbent LEC's marketing and other 
services, subject to paragraphs (a)(3) and (c) of this section.
    (c) Joint marketing. Joint marketing of local exchange and exchange 
access service and CMRS services by an incumbent LEC shall be subject to 
part 32 of this chapter. In addition, such agreements between the 
affiliate and the incumbent LEC must be reduced to writing and made 
available for public inspection upon request at the principle place of 
business of the affiliate and the incumbent LEC. The documentation must 
include a certification statement identical to the certification 
statement currently required to be included with all Automated Reporting 
and Management Information Systems (ARMIS) reports. The affiliate must 
also provide a detailed written description of the terms and conditions 
of the transaction on the Internet within 10 days of the transaction 
through the affiliate's home page.
    (d) Exceptions. (1) Rural telephone companies. Rural telephone 
companies are exempted from the requirements set forth in paragraphs 
(a), (b) and (c)

[[Page 19]]

of this section. A competing telecommunications carrier, interconnected 
with the rural telephone company, however, may petition the FCC to 
remove the exemption, or the FCC may do so on its own motion, where the 
rural telephone company has engaged in anticompetitive conduct.
    (2) Incumbent LECs with fewer than 2 percent of subscriber lines. 
Incumbent LECs with fewer than 2 percent of the nation's subscriber 
lines installed in the aggregate nationwide may petition the FCC for 
suspension or modification of the requirements set forth in paragraphs 
(a), (b) and (c) of this section. The FCC will grant such a petition 
where the incumbent LEC demonstrates that suspension or modification of 
the separate affiliate requirement is
    (i) Necessary to avoid a significant adverse economic impact on 
users of telecommunications services generally or to avoid a requirement 
that would be unduly economically burdensome, and
    (ii) Consistent with the public interest, convenience, and 
necessity.
    (e) Definitions. Terms used in this section have the following 
meanings:
    Affiliate. ``Affiliate'' means a person that (directly or 
indirectly) owns or controls, is owned or controlled by, or is under 
common ownership with, another person. For purposes of this section, the 
term ``own'' means to own an equity interest (or the equivalent thereof) 
of more than 10 percent.
    Broadband Commercial Mobile Radio Service (Broadband CMRS). For the 
purposes of this section, ``broadband CMRS'' means Domestic Public 
Cellular Radio Telecommunications Service (part 22, subpart H of this 
chapter), Specialized Mobile Radio (part 90, subpart S of this chapter), 
and broadband Personal Communications Services (part 24, subpart E of 
this chapter).
    Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (Incumbent LEC). ``Incumbent LEC'' 
has the same meaning as that term is defined in Sec. 51.5 of this 
chapter.
    In-region. For the purposes of this section, an incumbent LEC's 
broadband CMRS service is considered ``in-region'' when 10 percent or 
more of the population covered by the CMRS affiliate's authorized 
service area, as determined by the 1990 census figures, is within the 
affiliated incumbent LEC's wireline service area.
    Rural Telephone Company. ``Rural Telephone Company'' has the same 
meaning as that term is defined in Sec. 51.5 of this chapter.
    (f) Sunset. This section will no longer be effective after January 
1, 2002.

    (a) Licensee qualifications. FCC Form 430 (``Licensee Qualification 
Report'') must be filed annually, no later than March 31 for the end of 
the preceding calendar year, unless the licensee operates solely on a 
common carrier basis and service was not offered at any time during the 
preceding year. Each annual filing must include all changes of 
information required by FCC Form 430 that occurred during the preceding 
year. In those cases in which there has been no change in any of the 
required information, the applicant or licensee, in lieu of submitting a 
new form, may so notify the Commission by letter.
    (b) Additional time to construct--FCC Form 701 (``Application for 
Additional

[[Page 27]]

Time to Construct Radio Station'') shall be filed in duplicate by a 
licensee prior to the expiration of the time for construction noted in a 
license if a licensee seeks to modify the license by extending the 
period of construction.
    (c) Renewal of station license. Except for renewal of special 
temporary authorizations, FCC Form 405 (``Application for Renewal of 
Station License'') must be filed in duplicate by the licensee between 
thirty (30) and sixty (60) days prior to the expiration date of the 
license sought to be renewed. Whenever a group of station licenses in 
the same radio service are to be renewed simultaneously, a single 
``blanket'' application may be filed to cover the entire group, if the 
application identifies each station by call sign and station location 
and if two copies are provided for each station affected. Applicants 
should note also any special renewal requirements under the rules for 
each radio service.
    (d) Assignment of license. FCC Form 305 (``Application for Consent 
to Assignment of Radio Station Construction Authorization or License 
(for Stations in Services Other than Broadcast)'') must be submitted to 
assign voluntarily (as by, for example, contract or other agreement) or 
involuntarily (as by, for example, death, bankruptcy, or legal 
disability) the station license or conditional license. In the case of 
involuntary assignment, the application must be filed within 30 days of 
the event causing the assignment. FCC Form 305 also must be used for 
nonsubstantial (pro forma) assignments. In addition, FCC Form 430 must 
be submitted by the proposed assignee unless such assignee has a current 
and substantially accurate report on file with the Commission. Whenever 
a group of station licenses or conditional licenses in the same radio 
service is to be assigned to a single assignee, a single ``blanket'' 
application may be filed to cover the entire group, if the application 
identifies each station by call sign and station location and if two 
copies are provided for each station affected. The assignment must be 
completed within 45 days from the date of authorization. Upon 
consummation of an approved assignment, the Commission must be notified 
by letter of the date of consummation within 10 days of its occurrence.
    (e) Partial assignment of license. In the microwave services, 
authorization for assignment from one company to another of only a part 
or portions of the facilities (transmitters) authorized under an 
existing license (as distinguished from an assignment of the facilities 
in their entirety) may be granted upon application:
    (1) By the assignee on FCC Form 494 and
    (2) By the assignor on FCC Form 494 for deletion of the assigned 
facilities, indicating concurrence in the assignee's request.

The assignment shall be consummated within 45 days from the date of 
authorization. In the event that consummation does not occur, FCC Form 
494 shall be submitted to return the assignor's license to its original 
condition.

    Editorial Note: At 63 FR 65100, Nov. 25, 1999, paragraphs (f) and 
(g) were redesignated as paragraphs (e) and (f) and newly designated 
paragraph (e) was revised. However, paragraph (e) already exists. The 
text of the newly redesignated paragraph (e) follows.

    (e) Transfer of control of corporation holding a conditional license 
or license. FCC Form 306 (``Application for Consent to Transfer of 
Control'') must be submitted in order to voluntarily or involuntarily 
transfer control (de jure or de facto) of a corporation holding any 
conditional licenses or licenses. In the case of involuntary transfer of 
control, the application must be filed within 30 days of the event 
causing the transfer of control. FCC Form 306 also must be used for 
nonsubstantial (pro forma) transfers of control. In addition, FCC Form 
430 must be submitted by the proposed transferee unless such transferee 
has a current and substantially accurate report on file with the 
Commission. Whenever control of a corporation holding a group of station 
licenses or conditional licenses in the same radio service is to be 
transferred to a single transferee, a single ``blanket'' application may 
be filed to cover the entire transfer, if the application identifies 
each station by call sign and station location and if two copies are 
provided for each station affected. The transfer must be completed 
within 45

[[Page 28]]

days from the date of authorization. Upon consummation of an approved 
transfer, the Commission must be notified by letter of the date of 
consummation within 10 days of its occurrence.
    (f) Antenna Structure Registration. FCC Form 854 (Application for 
Antenna Structure Registration) accompanied by a final Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) determination of ``no hazard'' must be filed by the 
antenna structure owner to receive an antenna structure registration 
number. Criteria used to determine whether FAA notification and 
registration is required for a particular antenna structure are 
contained in Part 17 of this chapter.

    (d) Except when the Commission has declared explicitly to the 
contrary, an informational requirement does not in itself imply the 
processing treatment of decisional weight to be accorded the response.
    (e) All applicants are required to indicate at the time their 
application is filed whether an authorization of the facilities is 
categorically excluded as defined by Sec. 1.1306 of the Commission's 
rules. If answered affirmatively, an Environmental Assessment as 
described by Sec. 1.1311, need not be filed with the application.
    (f) Whenever an individual applicant, or a partner (in the case of a 
partnership) or a full time manager (in the case of a corporation) will 
not actively participate in the day-to-day management and operation of 
proposed facilities, the applicant or licensee will submit a statement 
containing the reasons therefor and disclosing the details of the 
proposed operation, including a demonstration of how control over the 
radio facilities will be retained by the applicant. If the operation of 
a radio station is to be accomplished by contractual arrangement with an 
entity unrelated to an applicant or licensee, the applicant or licensee 
shall file a copy of the agreement or contract which shall demonstrate 
that:

[[Page 29]]

    (1) The operation is accomplished according to general instructions 
provided for by the applicant;
    (2) The applicant retains effective control over the radio 
facilities and their operations; and
    (3) The applicant assumes full responsibility for both the quality 
of service and for contractor compliance with the Commission's Rules.

Sec. 21.15  Technical content of applications.

    Applications shall contain all technical information required by the 
application form and any additional information necessary to fully 
describe the proposed facilities and to demonstrate compliance with all 
technical requirements of the rules governing the radio service involved 
(see subparts C, F and K as appropriate). The following paragraphs 
describe a number of technical requirements.
    (a)(1) Except in the case of applicants for Multipoint Distribution 
Service, applicants proposing a new station location (including receive-
only stations and passive repeaters) must indicate whether the station 
site is owned. If it is not owned, its availability for the proposed 
radio station site must be demonstrated. Under ordinary circumstances, 
this requirement will be considered satisfied if the site is under lease 
or under written option to buy or lease.
    (2) Where any lease or agreement to use land limits or conditions in 
any way the applicant's access or use of the site to provide public 
service, a copy of the lease or agreement (which clearly indicates the 
limitations or conditions) must be filed with the application, except in 
the case of applicants for stations in the Multipoint Distribution 
Service. Multipoint Distribution Service applicants must instead certify 
compliance with the limitations and conditions contained in the lease or 
option agreement.
    (3) Except for BTA and PSA authorization holders, Multipoint 
Distribution Service applicants proposing a new station location must 
certify the proposed station site will be available to the applicant for 
timely construction of the facilities during the initial construction 
period.
    (4) An applicant's failure to include a certification required under 
this Section will result in dismissal of the application. The submission 
of a false certification will subject the applicant to all remedies 
available to the Commission, including the dismissal with prejudice of 
all applications filed by the offending applicant and the revocation of 
authorizations of the offending applicant. Also, if evidence of intent 
exists, the case will be referred to the Department of Justice for 
criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1001. In addition, the submission 
of an intentionally falsified certification will be treated as a 
reflection on an applicant's basic qualifications to become or to remain 
a licensee.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Each application involving a new or modified transmitting 
antenna supporting structure, passive facility, or the addition or 
removal of a transmitting antenna, or the repositioning of an authorized 
antenna for a station must be accompanied by a vertical profile sketch 
of the total structure depicting its structural nature and clearly 
indicating the ground elevation (above sea level) at the structure site, 
the overall height of the structure above ground (including obstruction 
lights when required, lightning rods, etc.) and, if mounted on a 
building, its overall height above the building. The proposed antenna on 
the structure must be clearly identified and its height above-ground 
(measured to the center of radiation) clearly indicated. Alternatively, 
applicants in the Multipoint Distribution Service who filed applications 
on or after September 15, 1995, may provide this information in the MDS 
long-form application.
    (d) Each application proposing a new or modified antenna structure 
for a station (including a passive repeater or signal booster station) 
so as to change its overall height shall indicate whether any necessary 
notification of the

[[Page 30]]

FAA has been made. Complete information as to rules concerning the 
construction, marking and lighting of antenna structures is contained in 
part 17 of this chapter. See also Sec. 21.111 if the structure is used 
by more than one station.
    (e) Antenna Structure Registration Number. Applications proposing 
construction of a new antenna structure or alteration of the overall 
height of an existing antenna structure, where FAA notification prior to 
such construction or alteration is required by part 17 of this chapter, 
must include the FCC Antenna Structure Registration Number for the 
affected structure. If no such number has been assigned at the time the 
application is filed, the applicant must state in the application 
whether or not the antenna structure owner has notified the FAA of the 
proposed construction or alteration and applied to the FCC for an 
Antenna Structure Registration Number in accordance with Part 17 of this 
chapter of this structure for the antenna structure in question.
    (f) Except for applicants in the Multipoint Distribution Service who 
filed applications on or after September 15, 1995, an applicant 
proposing construction of one or more new stations or modification of 
existing stations where substantial changes in the operation or 
maintenance procedures are involved must submit a showing of the general 
maintenance procedures involved to insure the rendition of good public 
communications service. The showing should include but need not be 
limited to the following.
    (1) Location and telephone number (if known) of the maintenance 
center for a point to point microwave system. In lieu of providing the 
location and telephone number of the maintenance on a case by case 
basis, a licensee may file a complete list for all operational stations 
with the Commission and the Engineer-In-Charge of the appropriate radio 
district on an annual basis or at more frequent intervals as necessary 
to keep the information current.
    (2) The manner in which technical personnel are made aware of 
malfunction at any of the stations and the appropriate time required for 
them to reach any of the stations in the event of an emergency. If fault 
alarms are to be used, the items to be alarmed shall be specified as 
well as the location of the alarm center.
    (g) Applications in the Multipoint Distribution Service filed before 
September 15, 1995, proposing a new or replacement antenna (excluding 
omni-directional antennas) shall include an antenna radiation pattern 
showing the antenna power gain distribution in the horizontal plane 
expressed in decibels, unless such pattern is known to be on file with 
the Commission in which case the applicant may reference in its 
application the FCC-ID number that indicates that the pattern is on file 
with the Commission. Multipoint Distribution Service applicants who 
filed applications on or after September 15, 1995 must provide related 
information in completing an MDS long-form application.
    (h) Except for applications in the Multipoint Distribution Service 
filed on or after September 15, 1995, each application in the Point-to-
Point Radio, Local Television Transmission and Digital Electronic 
Message Service (excluding user stations) proposing a new or replacement 
antenna (excluding omni-directional antennas) shall include an antenna 
radiation pattern showing the antenna power gain distribution in the 
horizontal plane expressed in decibels, unless such pattern is known to 
be on file with the Commission in which case the applicant may reference 
in its application the FCC-ID number that indicates that the pattern is 
on file with the Commission. Multipoint Distribution Service applicants 
who filed applications on or after September 15, 1995 must provide 
related information in completing an MDS long-form application.

Sec. 21.19  Waiver of rules.

    Waivers of these rules may be granted upon application or on the 
Commission's own motion. A request for waiver shall contain a statement 
of reasons sufficient to justify a waiver. A waiver will not be granted 
except upon an affirmative showing that:
    (a) The underlying purpose of the rule will not be served, or would 
be frustrated, by its application in the particular case, and that grant 
of the waiver is otherwise in the public interest; or
    (b) The unique facts and circumstances of a particular case render 
application of the rule inequitable, unduly burdensome or otherwise 
contrary to the public interest. Applicants must also show the lack of a 
reasonable alternative.

Sec. 21.20  Defective applications.

    (a) Unless the Commission shall otherwise permit, an application 
will be unacceptable for filing and will be returned to the applicant 
with a brief statement as to the omissions or discrepancies if:
    (1) The application is defective with respect to completeness of 
answers to questions, informational showings, execution, or other 
matters of a formal character; or
    (2) The application does not substantially comply with the 
Commission's rules, regulations, specific requests for additional 
information, or other requirements.

    (b) By way of illustration only, and not in any way limiting the 
scope of paragraph (a), the following are examples of common 
deficiencies which result in defective applications under paragraph (a):
    (1) The application is not properly executed;
    (2) The submitted filing fee (if a filing fee is required) is 
insufficient;
    (3) The application does not demonstrate how the proposed radio 
facilities will serve the public interest, convenience or necessity;
    (4) The application does not demonstrate compliance with the special 
requirements applicable to the radio service involved;
    (5) The application does not certify the availability of the 
proposed station site.
    (6) The application does not include the environmental assessment 
required for any significant environmental impact under the Commission's 
environmental rules (part 1, subpart I);
    (7) The application does not specify the polarization and, where 
applicable, the antenna orientation azimuth and distance;
    (8) The application does not include all necessary exhibits;
    (9) The application is filed after the cutoff date prescribed in 
Sec. 21.31 or Sec. 21.914 of this part; or
    (10) The application proposes the use of a frequency not allocated 
to such use.
    (c) Applications considered defective under paragraph (a) of this 
section may be accepted for filing if:
    (1) The application is accompanied by a request which sets forth the 
reasons in support of a waiver of (or an exception to), in whole or in 
part, any specific rule, regulation, or requirement with which the 
application is in conflict; or
    (2) The Commission, upon its own motion, waives (or allows an 
exception to), in whole or in part, any rule, regulation or requirement.
    (d) If an applicant is requested by the Commission to file any 
documents or any supplementary or explanatory information not 
specifically required in the prescribed application form, a failure to 
comply with such request within a specified time period will be deemed 
to render the application defective and will subject it to dismissal.

Sec. 21.22  Repetitious applications.

    (a) Where an applicant has been afforded an opportunity for a 
hearing with respect to a particular application for a new station, or 
for an extension or enlargement of a service or facilities, and the 
Commission has, after hearing or default, denied the application or 
dismissed it with prejudice, the Commission will not consider a like 
application involving service of the same kind to the same area by the 
same applicant, or by the applicant's successor or assignee, or on 
behalf of or for the benefit of the original parties in interest, until 
after the lapse of 12 months from the effective date of the Commission's 
order. The Commission may, for good cause shown, waive the requirements 
of this section.
    (b) Where an appeal has been taken from the action of the Commission 
denying a particular application, another application for the same class 
of station and for the same area, in whole or in part, filed by the same 
applicant or by the applicant's successor or assignee, or on behalf or 
for the benefit of the original parties in interest, will not be 
considered until the final disposition of such appeal.

Sec. 21.23  Amendment of applications.

    (a)(1) Any pending application may be amended as a matter of right 
if the application has not been designated for hearing, or for 
comparative evaluation pursuant to Sec. 21.35, or for the random 
selection process, provided, however, that the amendments must comply 
with the provisions of Sec. 21.29 as appropriate and the Commission has 
not otherwise forbidden the amendment of pending applications.
    (2) A Multipoint Distribution Service application tentatively 
selected for qualification review by the random selection process may be 
amended as a matter of right up to 14 days after the date of the public 
notice announcing the tentative selection, provided, however, that the 
amendments must comply with the provisions of Sec. 21.29 as appropriate 
and the Commission has not otherwise forbidden the amendment of pending 
applications.
    (3) Provided, however, applications may not be amended if the 
amendments seek more than a pro forma change of ownership or control 
(bankruptcy, death or legal disability) of a pending Multipoint 
Distribution Service application and any amendment or application will 
be dismissed if the amendment or application seeks more than a pro forma 
change of ownership or control.
    (b) Requests to amend an application designated for hearing or for 
comparative evaluation or for tentative selection for qualification 
review by the random selection process may be granted only if a written 
petition demonstrating good cause is submitted and properly served on 
the parties of record, except that Multipoint Distribution Service 
applications tentatively selected in a random selection process may be 
amended as a matter of right as provided in paragraph (a) of this 
section. Provided, however, requests to amend applications will not be 
granted that seek more than a pro forma change of ownership or control 
(bankruptcy, death or legal disability) of a pending Multipoint 
Distribution Service application and any application seeking more than a 
pro forma change of ownership or control will be dismissed.
    (c) The Commission will classify amendments on a case-by-case basis. 
Whenever previous amendments have been filed, the most recent amendment 
will be classified by reference to how the information in question stood 
as of the latest Public Notice issued which concerned the application. 
An amendment will be deemed to be a major amendment subject to 
Sec. 21.27 and Sec. 21.31 under any of the following circumstances:

[[Page 33]]

    (1) If in the Multipoint Distribution Service, the amendment results 
in a substantial modification of the engineering proposal such as (but 
not necessarily limited to):
    (i) A change in, or addition of, a radio frequency channel;
    (ii) A change in polarization of the transmitted signal;
    (iii) A change in type of transmitter emission or an increase in 
emission bandwidth of more than ten (10) percent;
    (iv) A change in the geographic coordinates of a station's 
transmitting antenna of more than ten (10) seconds of latitude or 
longitude, or both;
    (v) Any change which increases the antenna height by 3.0 meters (10 
feet) or more;
    (vi) Any technical change which would increase the effective 
radiated power in any horizontal or vertical direction by more than one 
and one-half (1.5) dB; or
    (vii) Any changes or combination of changes which would cause 
harmful electrical interference to an authorized facility or result in a 
mutually exclusive conflict with another pending application.
    (2) Except during the sixty (60) day amendment period provided for 
in Sec. 21.27(d), any amendment to an application for a new or modified 
response station hub, booster station or point-to-multipoint I 
channel(s) station or to an application for a modified main station that 
reflects any change in the technical specifications of the proposed 
facility, includes any new or modified analysis of potential 
interference to another facility or submits any interference consent 
from a neighboring licensee, shall result in the application being 
assigned a new file number and being treated as newly filed.
    (3) If the amendment would convert a proposal, such that it may have 
a significant impact upon the environment under Sec. 1.1307 of the 
Commission's rules, which would require the submission of an 
environmental assessment, see Sec. 1.1311 of this chapter, and 
Commission environmental review, see Secs. 1.1308 and 1.1312 of this 
chapter.
    (4) If the amendment results in a substantial and material 
alteration of the proposed service.
    (5) If the amendment specifies a substantial change in benefical 
ownership or control (de jure or de facto) of an applicant such that the 
change would require, in the case of an authorized station, the filing 
of a prior assignment or transfer of control application under section 
310(d) of the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 310(d)]. Such a 
change would not be considered major where the assignment or transfer of 
control is for legitimate business purposes other than the acquisition 
of applications.
    (6) If the amendment, or the cumulative effect of the amendment, is 
determined by the Commission otherwise to be substantial pursuant to 
section 309 of the Communications Act of 1934.
    (d) The applicant must serve copies of any amendments or other 
written communications upon the following parties:
    (1) Any applicant whose application appears on its face to be 
mutually exclusive with the application being amended, including those 
applicants originally served under Sec. 21.902;
    (2) Any applicant whose application has been found by the 
Commission, as published in a public notice, to be mutually exclusive 
with the application being amended; and
    (3) Any party who has filed a petition to deny the application or 
other formal objection, when that petition or formal objection has not 
been resolved by the Commission.
    (e) The Commission may waive the service requirements of paragraph 
(e) of this section and prescribe such alternative procedures as may be 
appropriate under the circumstances to protect petitioners' interests 
and to avoid undue delay in a proceeding, if an applicant submits a 
request for waiver which demonstrates that the service requirement is 
unreasonably burdensome. Requests for waiver shall be served on 
petitioners. Oppositions to the petition may be filed within five (5) 
days after the petition is filed and shall be served on the applicant. 
Replies to oppositions will not be entertained.
    (f) Any amendment to an application shall be signed and shall be 
submitted in the same manner, and with the same number of copies, as was 
the original application. Amendments may be made

[[Page 34]]

in letter form if they comply in all other respects with the 
requirements of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 21.25  Application for temporary authorizations.

    (a) In circumstances requiring immediate or temporary use of 
facilities, request may be made for special temporary authority to 
install and/or operate new or modified equipment. Any such request may 
be submitted as an informal application in the manner set forth in 
Sec. 21.5 and must contain full particulars as to the proposed operation 
including all facts sufficient to justify the temporary authority sought 
and the public interest therein. No such request will be considered 
unless the request is received by the Commission at least 10 days prior 
to the date of proposed construction or operation or, where an extension 
is sought, expiration date of the existing temporary authorization.
    (b) Special temporary authorizations may be granted without regard 
to the 30-day public notice requirement of Sec. 21.27(c) when:
    (1) The authorization is for a period not to exceed 30 days and no 
application for regular application is contemplated to be filed;
    (2) The authorization is for a period not to exceed 60 days pending 
the filing of an application for such regular operation;
    (3) The authorization is to permit interim operation to facilitate 
completion of authorized construction or to provide substantially the 
same service as previously authorized; or
    (4) The authorization is made upon a finding that there are 
extraordinary circumstances requiring operation in the public interest 
and that delay in the institution of such service would seriously 
prejudice the public interest.
    (c) Temporary authorization of operations not to exceed 180 days may 
be granted under the standards of section 309(f) of the Communications 
Act where extraordinary circumstances so require. Extensions of the 
temporary authorization for a period of 180 days each may also be 
granted, but the renewal applicant bears a heavy burden to show that 
extraordinary circumstances warrant such an extension.
    (d) In cases of emergency found by the Commission, involving danger 
to life or property or due to damage of equipment, or during a national 
emergency proclaimed by the President or declared by the Congress or 
during the continuance of any war in which the United States is engaged 
and when such action is necessary for the national defense or safety or 
otherwise in furtherance of the war effort, or in cases of emergency 
where the Commission finds that it would not be feasible to secure 
renewal applications from existing licensees or otherwise to follow 
normal licensing procedure, the Commission will grant construction 
permits and station licenses, or modifications or renewals thereof, 
during the emergency found by the Commission or during the continuance 
of any such national emergency or war, as special temporary licenses, 
only for the period of emergency or war requiring such action, without 
the filing of formal applications.

<R05>
Sec. 21.26  Receipt of applications.

    Applications received by the Commission are given a file number for 
administrative convenience, which does not indicate the acceptance of 
the application for filing and processing. After preliminary review 
those applications covered by Sec. 21.27(a) that appear complete will be 
put on public notice as accepted for filing. Neither the assignment of a 
file number nor the listing of the application on public notice as 
accepted for filing indicates that the application has been found 
acceptable for filing or precludes the subsequent return or dismissal of 
the application if

[[Page 35]]

it is found to be defective or not in substantial compliance with the 
Commission's rules.

[52 FR 37779, Oct. 9, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 21.27  Public notice period.

    (a) At regular intervals, the Commission will issue a public notice 
listing:
    (1) The acceptance for filing of applications and major amendments 
thereto;
    (2) Significant Commission actions concerning applications;
    (3) The filing of certifications of completion of construction;
    (4) The receipt of applications for minor modifications made 
pursuant to Sec. 21.41;
    (5) Information which the Commission in its discretion believes of 
public significance; and
    (6) Special environmental considerations as required by part 1 of 
this chapter.
    (7) The BTAs designated for licensing through the competitive 
bidding process and the filing date for short-form applications for 
those areas;
    (8) The auction winners in the competitive bidding process;
    (b) A public notice will not normally be issued for any of the 
following applications:
    (1) For authorization of a minor technical change in the facilities 
of a proposed or authorized station where such a change would not be 
classified as a major amendment to a pending application, as defined by 
Sec. 21.23, or as a minor modification to a license pursuant to 
Sec. 21.41;
    (2) For temporary authorization pursuant to Sec. 21.25;
    (3) For an authorization under any of the proviso clauses of section 
308(a) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 308(a));
    (4) For consent to an involuntary assignment or transfer of control 
of a radio authorization; or
    (5) For consent to a voluntary assignment or transfer of control of 
a radio authorization, where the assignment or transfer does not involve 
a substantial change in ownership or control.
    (c) Except as otherwise provided in this part (e.g., Sec. 21.41), no 
application that has appeared on public notice will be granted until the 
expiration of a period of thirty days following the issuance of the 
public notice listing the application, or any major amendment thereto, 
or until the expiration of a period of thirty days following the 
issuance of a public notice identifying the tentative selectee of a 
random selection process, whichever is later.
    (d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this part, effective as 
of September 17, 1998, there shall be one one-week window, at such time 
as the Commission shall announce by public notice, for the filing of 
applications for high-power signal booster station, response station hub 
and I channels point-to-multipoint transmissions licenses, during which 
all applications shall be deemed to have been filed as of the same day 
for purposes of Secs. 21.909, 21.913 and 74.939(l) of this chapter. 
Following the publication of a public notice announcing the tendering 
for filing of applications submitted during that window, applicants 
shall have a period of sixty (60) days to amend their applications, 
provided such amendments do not result in any increase in interference 
to any previously proposed or authorized station, or to facilities 
proposed during the window, absent consent of the applicant for or 
conditional licensee or licensee of the station that would receive such 
interference. At the conclusion of that sixty (60) day period, the 
Commission shall publish a public notice announcing the acceptance for 
filing of all applications submitted during the initial window, as 
amended during the sixty (60) day period. All petitions to deny such 
applications must be filed within sixty (60) days of such second public 
notice. On the sixty-first (61st) day after the publication of such 
second public notice, applications for new or modified response station 
hub, booster station and I channels point-to-multipoint transmissions 
licenses may be filed and will be processed in accordance with the 
provisions of Secs. 21.909, 21.913 and 74.939(l) of this chapter. 
Notwithstanding Sec. 21.31, each application submitted during the 
initial window shall be granted on the sixty-first (61st) day after the 
Commission shall have given such public notice of its acceptance for 
filing, unless prior to such date either a party in interest timely 
files a formal petition to deny

[[Page 36]]

or for other relief pursuant to Sec. 21.30(a), or the Commission 
notifies the applicant that its application will not be granted. Where 
an application is granted pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, 
the conditional licensee or licensee shall maintain a copy of the 
application at the transmitter site or response station hub until such 
time as the Commission issues a license.

Sec. 21.28  Dismissal and return of applications.

    (a) Except as provided under paragraph (c) of this section and under 
Sec. 21.29, any application may be dismissed without prejudice as a 
matter of right if the applicant requests its dismissal prior to 
designation for hearing or prior to selection of the comparative 
evaluation procedure of Sec. 21.35. An applicant's request for return of 
its application after it has been accepted for filing will be considered 
to be a request for dismissal without prejudice. Requests for dismissal 
shall comply with the provisions of Sec. 21.29 as appropriate.
    (b) A request to dismiss an application without prejudice will be 
considered after designation for hearing, after selection of the 
comparative evaluation procedure of Sec. 21.35, or after selection as a 
tentative selectee in a random selection proceeding, only if:
    (1) A written petition is submitted to the Commission and, in the 
case of applications designated for hearing or comparative evaluation, 
is properly served upon all parties of record;
    (2) The petition is submitted before the issuance date of a public 
notice of Commission action denying the application; and
    (3) The petition complies with the provisions of Sec. 21.29 
(whenever applicable) and demonstrates good cause.
    (c) Except as provided under Sec. 21.29, an application designated 
for inclusion in the random selection process may be dismissed without 
prejudice as a matter of right if the applicant requests its dismissal 
at least 2 days prior to a random selection proceeding. An applicant's 
request for return of its application after it has been accepted for 
filing will be considered to be a request for dismissal without 
prejudice. Requests for dismissal shall comply with the provisions of 
Sec. 21.29 as appropriate.
    (d) The Commission will dismiss an application for failure to 
prosecute or for failure to respond substantially within a specified 
time period to official correspondence or requests for additional 
information. Dismissal will be without prejudice prior to designation 
for hearing, selection of the comparative evaluation procedure of 
Sec. 21.35, or tentative selection by the random selection process, but 
may be with prejudice for unsatisfactory compliance with Sec. 21.29, or 
after designation for hearing, selection of the comparative evaluation 
process, or selection as a tentative selectee in a random selection 
proceeding.
    (e) The Commission will dismiss an application filed by a cable 
television company which fails to comply with the provisions of 
Sec. 21.912 of this part.
    (f) A Multipoint Distribution Service application will be dismissed 
if the applicant seeks to change ownership or control, except in the 
case of a pro forma change of ownership or control (bankruptcy, death, 
or legal disability).

Sec. 21.29  Ownership changes and agreements to amend or to dismiss applications or pleadings.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, applicants 
or any other parties in interest to pending applications shall comply 
with the provisions of this section whenever:
    (1) They participate in any agreement (or understanding) which 
involves any consideration promised or received, directly or indirectly, 
including any agreement (or understanding) for merger of interests or 
the reciprocal withdrawal of applications; and
    (2) The agreement (or understanding) may result in either:
    (i) A proposed substantial change in beneficial ownership or control 
(de jure or de facto) of an applicant such that the change would 
require, in the case of an authorized station, the filing of a

[[Page 37]]

prior assignment or transfer of control application under section 310(d) 
of the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 310(d)], or
    (ii) Proposed withdrawal, amendment or dismissal of any 
application(s), amendment(s), petition(s), pleading(s), or any 
combination thereof, which would thereby permit the grant without 
hearing, comparative evaluation under of Sec. 21.35, or random selection 
of an application previously in contested status.
    (b) The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to any 
engineering agreement (or understanding) which:
    (1) Resolves frequency conflicts with authorized stations or other 
pending applications without the creation of new or increased frequency 
conflicts; and
    (2) Does not involve any consideration promised or received, 
directly or indirectly (including any merger of interests or reciprocal 
withdrawal of applications), other than the mutual benefit of resolving 
the engineering conflict.
    (c) For any agreement subject to this section, the applicant of an 
application which would remain pending pursuant to such an agreement 
will be considered responsible for the compliance by all parties with 
the procedures of this section. Failure of the parties to comply with 
the procedures of this section shall constitute a defect in those 
applications which are involved in the agreement and remain in a pending 
status.
    (d) The principals to any agreement or understanding subject to this 
section shall comply with the standards of paragraph (e) of this section 
in accordance with the following procedure:
    (1) Within ten (10) days after entering into the agreement, the 
parties thereto shall jointly notify the Commission in writing of the 
existence and general terms of such agreement, the identity of all of 
the participants and the applications involved;
    (2) Within thirty (30) days after entering into the agreement, the 
parties thereto shall file any proposed application amendments, motions, 
or requests together with a copy of the agreement which clearly sets 
forth all terms and provisions, and such other facts and information as 
necessary to satisfy the standards of paragraph (e) of this section. 
Such submission shall be accompanied by the certification by affidavit 
of each principal to the agreement declaring that the statements made 
are true, complete, and correct to the best of their knowledge and 
belief, and are made in good faith.
    (3) The Commission may request any further information which in its 
judgment it believes is necessary for a determination under paragraph 
(e) of this section.
    (e) The Commission will grant an application (or applications) 
involved in the agreement (or understanding) only if it finds upon 
examination of the information submitted, and upon consideration of such 
other matters as may be officially noticed, that the agreement is 
consistent with the public interest, and the amount of any monetary 
consideration and the cash value of any other consideration promised or 
received is not in excess of those legitimate and prudent costs directly 
assignable to the engineering, preparation, filing and advocacy of the 
withdrawn, dismissed, or amended application(s), amendment(s), 
petition(s), pleading(s), or any combination thereof. Where such costs 
represent the applicant's in-house efforts, these costs shall include 
only directly assignable costs and shall exclude general overhead 
expenses. [The treatment to be accorded such consideration for 
interstate rate making purposes will be determined at such time as the 
question may arise in an appropriate rate proceeding.] An itemized 
accounting shall be submitted to support the amount of consideration 
involved except where such consideration (including the fair market 
value of any non-cash consideration) promised or received does not 
exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Where consideration involves a 
sale of facilities or merger of interests, the accounting shall clearly 
identify that portion of the consideration allocated for such facilities 
or interests and a detailed description thereof, including estimated 
fair market value. The Commission will not presume an agreement (or 
understanding) to be prima facie contrary to the public interest solely 
because it

[[Page 38]]

incorporates a mutual agreement to withdraw pending application(s), 
amendment(s), petition(s), pleading(s), or any combination thereof.
    (f) Notwithstanding Sec. 21.29(e), amendments will not be granted 
that seek more than a pro forma change of ownership or control 
(bankruptcy, death, or legal disability) of a pending Multipoint 
Distribution Service application, and any Multipoint Distribution 
Service application will be dismissed that seeks more than a pro forma 
change of ownership or control.

Sec. 21.30  Opposition to applications.

    (a) Petitions to deny (including petitions for other forms of 
relief) and responsive pleadings for Commission consideration must:
    (1) Identify the application or applications (including applicant's 
name, station location, Commission file numbers and radio service 
involved) with which it is concerned;
    (2) Be filed in accordance with the pleading limitations, filing 
periods, and other applicable provisions of Secs. 1.41 through 1.52, and 
1.821 through 1.825;
    (3) Contain specific allegations of fact (except for those of which 
official notice may be taken), which shall be supported by affidavit of 
a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof, and which shall be 
sufficient to demonstrate that the petitioner (or respondent) is a party 
in interest and that a grant of, or other Commission action regarding, 
the application would be prima facie inconsistent with the public 
interest;
    (4) Except as provided in Sec. 21.902(i)(6) regarding Instructional 
Television Fixed Service licensees and conditional licensees, in 
Sec. 21.909 regarding MDS response station hubs and in Sec. 21.913 
regarding MDS booster stations, be filed within thirty (30) days after 
the date of public notice announcing the acceptance for filing of any 
such application or major amendment thereto, or identifying the 
tentative selectee of a random selection proceeding in the Multichannel 
Multipoint Distribution Service or for Multipoint Distribution Service 
H-channel stations (unless the Commission otherwise extends the filing 
deadline); and
    (5) Contains a certificate of service showing that it has been 
mailed to the applicant no later than the date of filing thereof with 
the Commission.
    (b) The Commission will classify as informal objections:
    (1) Any petition to deny not filed in accordance with paragraph (a) 
of this section;
    (2) Any petition to deny (or for other forms of relief) an 
application to which the thirty (30) day public notice period of 
Sec. 21.27(c) does not apply; or
    (3) Any comments on, or objections to, the grant of an application 
when the comments or objections do not conform to either paragraph (a) 
of this section or other Commission rules and requirements.
    (c) The Commission will consider informal objections, but will not 
necessarily discuss them specifically in a formal opinion if:
    (1) The informal objection is filed at least one day before 
Commission action on the application; and
    (2) The informal objection is signed by the submitting person (or 
his representative) and discloses his interest.

<R05>
Sec. 21.31  Mutually exclusive applications.

    (a) Except with respect to applications for new or modified response 
stations hubs, booster stations, and point-to-multipoint I channel 
stations, and to applications for modified main stations, filed on the 
same day or during the same window, the Commission will consider 
applications to be mutually exclusive if their conflicts are such that 
grant of one application would effectively preclude by reason of harmful 
electrical interference, or other practical reason, the grant of one or 
more of the other applications.
    (b) An application will be entitled to be included in a random 
selection process or to comparative consideration with one or more 
conflicting applications only if:

[[Page 39]]

    (1) The application is mutually exclusive with the other 
application; and
    (2) The application is received by the Commission in a condition 
acceptable for filing by whichever ``cut-off'' date is earlier:
    (i) Sixty (60) days after the date of the public notice listing the 
first of the conflicting applications as accepted for filing; or
    (ii) One (1) business day preceding the day on which the Commission 
takes final action on the previously filed application (should the 
Commission act upon such application in the interval between thirty (30) 
and sixty (60) days after the date of its public notice).
    (c) Whenever three or more applications are mutually exclusive, but 
not uniformly so, the earliest filed application established the date 
prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, regardless of whether or 
not subsequently filed applications are directly mutually exclusive with 
the first filed application. [For example, applications A, B, and C are 
filed in that order. A and B are directly mutually exclusive, B and C 
are directly mutually exclusive. In order to be considered comparatively 
with B, C must be filed within the ``cut-off'' period established by A 
even though C is not directly mutually exclusive with A.]
    (d) An application otherwise mutually exclusive with one of more 
previously filed applications, but filed after the appropriate date 
prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, will be returned without 
prejudice and will be eligible for refiling only after final action is 
taken by the Commission with respect to the previously filed application 
(or applications).
    (e) For the purposes of this section, any application (whether 
mutually exclusive or not) will be considered to be a newly filed 
application if it is amended by a major amendment (as defined by 
Sec. 21.23), except under any of the following circumstances:
    (1) The application has been designated for comparative hearing, or 
for comparative evaluation (pursuant to Sec. 21.35), and the Commission 
or the presiding officer accepts the amendment pursuant to 
Sec. 21.23(b);
    (2) The amendment resolves frequency conflicts with authorized 
stations or other pending applications which would otherwise require 
resolution by hearing, by comparative evaluation pursuant to Sec. 21.35, 
or by random selection pursuant to Sec. 21.33 provided that the 
amendment does not create new or additional frequency conflicts;
    (3) The amendment reflects only a change in ownership or control 
found by the Commission to be in the public interest, and for which a 
requested exemption from the ``cut-off'' requirements of this section is 
granted, unless the amendment is for more than a pro forma change of 
ownership or control (bankruptcy, death or legal disability) of a 
pending Multipoint Distribution Service application in which event the 
application will be dismissed;
    (4) The amendment reflects only a change in ownership or control 
which results from an agreement under Sec. 21.29 whereby two or more 
applicants entitled to comparative consideration of their applications 
join in one (or more) of the existing applications and request dismissal 
of their other application (or applications) to avoid the delay and cost 
of comparative consideration, unless the amendment is for one (or more) 
pending Multipoint Distribution Service application (or applications) in 
which event the application (or applications) will be dismissed;
    (5) The amendment corrects typographical, transcription, or similar 
clerical errors which are clearly demonstrated to be mistakes by 
reference to other parts of the application, and whose discovery does 
not create new or increased frequency conflicts; or
    (6) The amendment does not create new or increased frequency 
conflicts, and is demonstrably necessitated by events which the 
applicant could not have reasonably foreseen at the time of filing, such 
as, for example:
    (i) The loss of a transmitter or receiver site by condemnation, 
natural causes, or loss of lease or option;
    (ii) Obstruction of a proposed transmission path caused by the 
erection of a new building or other structure; or

[[Page 40]]

    (iii) The discontinuance or substantial technological obsolescence 
of specified equipment, whenever the application has been pending before 
the Commission for two or more years from the date of its filing.

Sec. 21.32  Consideration of applications.

    (a) Applications for an instrument of authorization will be granted 
if, upon examination of the application and upon consideration of such 
other matters as it may officially notice, the Commission finds that the 
grant will serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity.
    (b) The grant shall be without a formal hearing if, upon 
consideration of the application, any pleadings of objections filed, or 
other matters which may be officially noticed, the Commission finds 
that:
    (1) The application is acceptable for filing, and is in accordance 
with the Commission's rules, regulations, and other requirements;
    (2) The application is not subject to comparative consideration 
(pursuant to Sec. 21.31) with another application (or applications), 
except where the competing applicants have chosen the comparative 
evaluation procedure of Sec. 21.35 and a grant is appropriate under that 
procedure;
    (3) A grant of the application would not cause harmful electrical 
interference to an authorized station;
    (4) There are no substantial and material questions of fact 
presented; and
    (5) The applicant is legally, technically, financially and otherwise 
qualified, and a grant of the application would serve the public 
interest.
    (c) If the Commission should grant without a formal hearing an 
application for an instrument of authorization which is subject to a 
petition to deny filed in accordance with Sec. 21.30, the Commission 
will deny the petition by the issuance of a Memorandum Opinion and Order 
which will concisely report the reasons for the denial and dispose of 
all substantial issues raised by the petition.
    (d) Whenever the Commission, without a formal hearing, grants any 
application in part, or subject to any terms or conditions other than 
those normally applied to applications of the same type, it shall inform 
the applicant of the reasons therefor, and the grant shall be considered 
final unless the Commission should revise its action (either by granting 
the application as originally requested, or by designating the 
application for a formal evidentiary hearing) in response to a petition 
for reconsideration which:
    (1) Is filed by the applicant within thirty (30) days from the date 
of the letter or order giving the reasons for the partial or conditioned 
grant;
    (2) Rejects the grant as made and explains the reasons why the 
application should be granted as originally requested; and
    (3) Returns the instrument of authorization.
    (e) The Commission will designate an application for a formal 
hearing, specifying with particularity the matters and things in issue, 
if, upon consideration of the application, any pleadings or objections 
filed, or other matters which may be officially noticed, the Commission 
determines that:
    (1) A substantial and material question of fact is presented;
    (2) The Commission is unable for any reason to make the findings 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section and the application is 
acceptable for filing, complete, and in accordance with the Commission's 
rules, regulations, and other requirements.
    (3) The application is entitled to comparative consideration (under 
Sec. 21.31) with another application (or applications); or
    (4) The application is entitled to comparative consideration 
(pursuant to Sec. 21.31) and the applicants have chosen the comparative 
evaluation procedure of Sec. 21.35 but the Commission deems such 
procedure to be inappropriate.
    (f) The Commission may grant, deny, or take other action with 
respect to an application designated for a formal

[[Page 41]]

hearing pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section or part 1 of this 
chapter.
    (g) Whenever the public interest would be served thereby the 
Commission may grant one or more mutually exclusive applications 
expressly conditioned upon final action on the applications, and then 
either conduct a random section process (in specified services under 
this rules part), designate all of the mutually exclusive applications 
for a formal evidentiary hearing or (whenever so requested) follow the 
comparative evaluation procedures of Sec. 21.35, as appropriate, if it 
appears:
    (1) That some or all of the applications were not filed in good 
faith, but were filed for the purpose of delaying or hindering the grant 
of another application;
    (2) That the public interest requires the prompt establishment of 
radio service in a particular community or area;
    (3) That a delay in making a grant to any applicant until after the 
conclusion of a hearing or a random selection proceeding on all 
applications might jeopardize the rights of the United States under the 
provision of an international agreement to the use of the frequency in 
question; or
    (4) That a grant of one application would be in the public interest 
in that it appears from an examination of the remaining applications 
that they cannot be granted because they are in violation of provisions 
of the Communications Act, other statutes, or of the provisions of this 
chapter.
    (h) Reconsideration or review of any final action taken by the 
Commission will be in accordance with subpart A of part 1 of this 
chapter.

Distribution Service (MDS) H-channel station is mutually exclusive with 
another such application, and satisfies the requirements of Secs. 21.31 
and 21.914, the applicant may be included in the random selection 
process set forth in Secs. 1.821, 1.822 and 1.824 of this chapter.
    (b) Renewal applications shall not be included in a random selection 
process.
    (c) If Multipoint Distribution Service applicants enter into 
settlements, the applicants in the settlement must be represented by one 
application only and will not receive the cumulative number of chances 
in the random selection process that the individual applicants would 
have had if no settlement had been reached.

<R05>
Sec. 21.35  Comparative evaluation of mutually exclusive applications.

    (a) In order to expedite action on mutually exclusive applications 
in services under this rules part where the competitive bidding process 
or random selection process do not apply, the applicants may request the 
Commission to consider their applications without a formal hearing in 
accordance with the summary procedure outlined in paragraph (b) in this 
section if:
    (1) The applications are entitled to comparative consideration 
pursuant to Sec. 21.31;
    (2) The applications have not been designated for formal evidentiary 
hearing; and
    (3) The Commission determines, initially or at any time during the 
procedure outlined in paragraph (b) of this section, that such procedure 
is appropriate, and that, from the information submitted and 
consideration of such other matters as may be officially noticed, there 
are no substantial and material questions of fact presented (other than 
those relating to the comparative merits of the applications) which 
would preclude a grant under paragraphs (a) and (b) of Sec. 21.32.
    (b) Provided that the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section 
are satisfied, applicants may request the Commission to act upon their 
mutually exclusive applications without a formal hearing pursuant to the 
summary procedure outlined below:
    (1) To initiate the procedure, each applicant will submit to the 
Commission a written statement containing:
    (i) A waiver of the applicant's right to a formal hearing;

[[Page 42]]

    (ii) A request and agreement that, in order to avoid the delay and 
expense of a comparative formal hearing, the Commission should exercise 
its judgment to select from among the mutually exclusive applications 
that proposal (or proposals) which would best serve the public interest; 
and
    (iii) The signature of a principal (and the principal's attorney if 
represented).
    (2) After receipt of the written requests of all of the applicants 
the Commission (if it deems this procedure appropriate) will issue a 
notice designating the comparative criteria upon which the applications 
are to be evaluated and will request each applicant to submit, within a 
specified period of time, additional information concerning the 
applicant's proposal relative to the comparative criteria.
    (3) Within thirty (30) days following the due date for filing this 
information, the Commission will accept concise and factual argument on 
the competing proposals from the rival applicants, potential customers, 
and other knowledgeable parties in interest.
    (4) Within fifteen (15) days following the due date for the filing 
of comments, the Commission will accept concise and factual replies from 
the rival applicants.
    (5) From time to time during the course of this procedure the 
Commission may request additional information from the applicants and 
hold informal conferences at which all competing applicants shall have 
the right to be represented.
    (6) Upon evaluation of the applications, the information submitted, 
and such other matters as may be officially noticed the Commission will 
issue a decision granting one (or more) of the proposals which it 
concludes would best serve the public interest, convenience and 
necessity. The decision will report briefly and concisely the reasons 
for the Commission's selection and will deny the other application(s). 
This decision shall be considered final.

be submitted on the application form prescribed by Sec. 21.11 of this 
chapter, and shall be accompanied by the applicable showings required by 
Secs. 21.13, 21.15, 21.17 and 21.39 of this chapter.
    (d) The Commission shall be promptly notified in writing when a 
licensee is voluntarily or involuntarily placed in bankruptcy or 
receivership and when an individual licensee, a member of a partnership 
which is a licensee, or a person directly or indirectly in control of a 
corporation which is a licensee, dies or becomes legally disabled. 
Within thirty days after the occurrence of such bankruptcy, 
receivership, death or legal disability, an application of involuntary 
assignment of such license, or involuntary transfer of control of such 
corporation, shall be filed with the Commission, requesting assignment 
or transfer to a successor legally qualified under the laws of the place 
having jurisdiction over the assets involved.
    (e) The assignor of a station licensed under this part may retain no 
right of

[[Page 43]]

reversion or reassignment of the license and may not reserve the right 
to use the facilities of the station for any period whatsoever. No 
assignment of license will be granted or authorized if there is a 
contract or understanding, express or implied, pursuant to which a right 
of reversion or reassignment of the license or right to use the 
facilities are retained as partial or full consideration for the 
assignment or transfer.
    (f) No special temporary authority, or any rights thereunder, shall 
be assigned or otherwise disposed of, directly or indirectly, 
voluntarily or involuntarily, without prior Commission approval.
    (g) An applicant for voluntary transfer of control or assignment 
under this section where the subject license was acquired by the 
transferor or assignor through a system of random selection shall, 
together with its application for transfer of control or assignment, 
file with the Commission the associated contracts for sale, option 
agreements, management agreements, or other documents disclosing the 
total consideration that the applicant would receive in return for the 
transfer or assignment of its license. This information should include 
not only a monetary purchase price, but also any future, contingent, in-
kind, or other consideration (e.g., management or consulting contracts 
either with or without an option to purchase; below-market financing).

Sec. 21.39  Considerations involving transfer or assignment applications.

    (a) A Multipoint Distribution Service conditional license may not be 
assigned or transferred prior to the completion of construction of the 
facility and the timely filing of the certification of completion of 
construction. However, consent to the assignment or transfer of control 
of a Multipoint Distribution Service conditional license may be given 
prior to the completion of construction and the timely filing of the 
certification of completion of construction where:
    (1) The assignment or transfer does not involve a substantial change 
in ownership or control of the authorized Multipoint Distribution 
Service facilities; or
    (2) The assignment or transfer of control is involuntary due to the 
licensee's bankruptcy, death, or legal disability.
    (b) The Commission will review a proposed transaction to determine 
if the circumstances indicate ``trafficking'' in licenses whenever 
applications (except those involving pro forma assignment or transfer of 
control) for consent to assignment of a license, or for transfer of 
control of a licensee, involve facilities that were:
    (1) Authorized following a comparative hearing and have been 
operated less than one year, or;
    (2) Involve facilities that have not been constructed, or;
    (3) Involve facilities that were authorized following a random 
selection proceeding in which the successful applicant received 
preference and that have been operated for less than one year.

At its discretion, the Commission may require the submission of an 
affirmative, factual showing (supported by affidavits of a person or 
persons with personal knowledge thereof) to demonstrate that the 
proposed assignor or transferor has not acquired an authorization or 
operated a station for the principal purpose of profitable sale rather 
than public service. This showing may include, for example, a 
demonstration that the proposed assignment or transfer is due to changed 
circumstances (described in detail) affecting the licensee subsequent to 
the acquisition of the license, or that the proposed transfer of radio 
facilities is incidental to a sale of other facilities or merger of 
interests.
    (c) If a proposed transfer of radio facilities is incidental to a 
sale of other facilities or merger of interests, any showing requested 
under paragraph (a) of this section shall include an additional exhibit 
which:
    (1) Discloses complete details as to the sale of facilities or 
merger of interests;
    (2) Segregates clearly by an itemized accounting, the amount of 
consideration involved in the sale of facilities or merger of interests; 
and

[[Page 44]]

    (3) Demonstrates that the amount of consideration assignable to the 
facilities or business interests involved represents their fair market 
value at the time of the transaction.
    (d) For the purposes of this section, the one year period is 
calculated using the following dates (as appropriate):
    (1) The initial date of grant of the license, excluding subsequent 
modifications;
    (2) The date of consummation of an assignment or transfer, if the 
station is acquired as the result of an assignment of license, or 
transfer of control of corporate licensee; or
    (3) The median date of the applicable commencement dates (determined 
pursuant to paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section) if the 
transaction involves two or more stations. (The median date is that date 
so selected such that fifty percent of the commencement dates of the 
total number of stations, when arranged in chronological order, lie 
below it and fifty percent lie above it. When the number of stations is 
an even number, the median date will be a value half way between the two 
dates closest to the theoretical median).

Sec. 21.40  Modification of station license.

    (a) Except as provided in Secs. 21.41 and 21.42, no modification of 
a license issued pursuant to this part (or the facilities described 
thereunder) shall be made except upon application to the Commission and 
upon finding by the Commission that:
    (1) Such modification will promote the public interest, convenience 
and necessity, or
    (2) That the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 or of any 
treaty ratified by the United States will be more fully complied with if 
such application is granted.
    (b) No application for modification to extend a license construction 
period will be granted for delays caused by lack of financing or for 
lack of site availability. Applications for time extensions for other 
reasons must include a verified statement from the application showing 
that the licensee has made diligent efforts to construct the facilities 
and:
    (1) That additional time is required due to circumstances beyond the 
applicant's control, in which case the applicant must describe such 
circumstances and must set forth with specificity and justify the 
precise extension period requested; or
    (2) That there are unique and overriding public interest concerns 
that justify such an extension, in which case the applicant must 
identify such interests and must set forth and justify a precise 
extension period.
    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b), when a station 
license has been assigned or transferred pursuant to Sec. 21.38, any 
extension of time will be limited so that the time left to construct 
after Commission grant of the transfer or assignment will be no more 
than the time remaining for construction at the date of the filing of 
the application for transfer or assignment.

Sec. 21.50  Transition of the 2.11-2.13 and 2.16-2.18 GHz bands from Domestic Public Fixed Radio Services to emerging technologies.

    (a) Licensees proposing to implement services using emerging 
technologies (ET Licensees) may negotiate with Domestic Public Fixed 
Radio Service licensees (Existing Licensees) in these bands for the 
purpose of agreeing to terms under which the Existing Licensees would 
relocate their operations to other fixed microwave bands or to other 
media, or alternatively, would accept a sharing arrangement with the

[[Page 48]]

ET Licensee that may result in an otherwise impermissible level of 
interference to the existing licensee's operations. ET Licensees may 
also negotiate agreements for relocation of the Existing Licensees' 
facilities within the 2 GHz band in which all interested parties agree 
to the relocation of the Existing Licensee's facilities elsewhere within 
these bands. ``All interested parties'' includes the incumbent licensee, 
the emerging technology provider or representative requesting and paying 
for the relocation, and any emerging technology licensee of the spectrum 
to which the incumbent's facilities are to be relocated.
    (b) Domestic Public Fixed Radio licensees in bands allocated for 
licensed emerging technology services will maintain primary status in 
these bands until two years after the Commission commences acceptance of 
applications for an emerging technology services, and until one year 
after an emerging technology service licensee initiates negotiations for 
relocation of the fixed microwave licensee's operations or, in bands 
allocated for unlicensed emerging technology services, until one year 
after an emerging technology unlicensed equipment supplier or 
representative initiates negotiations for relocation of the fixed 
microwave licensee's operations. When it is necessary for an emerging 
technology provider or representative of unlicensed device manufacturers 
to negotiate with a fixed microwave licensee with operations in spectrum 
adjacent to that of the emerging technology provider, the transition 
schedule of the entity requesting the move will apply.
    (c) The Commission will amend the operating license of the fixed 
microwave operator to secondary status only if the following 
requirements are met:
    (1) The service applicant, provider, licensee, or representative 
using an emerging technology guarantees payment of all relocation costs, 
including all engineering, equipment, site and FCC fees, as well as any 
reasonable, additional costs that the relocated fixed microwave licensee 
might incur as a result of operation in another fixed microwave band or 
migration to another medium;
    (2) The emerging technology service entity completes all activities 
necessary for implementing the replacement facilities, including 
engineering and cost analysis of the relocation procedure and, if radio 
facilities are used, identifying and obtaining, on the incumbents' 
behalf, new microwave frequencies and frequency coordination; and
    (3) The emerging technology service entity builds the replacement 
system and tests it for comparability with the existing 2 GHz system.
    (d) The 2 GHz microwave licensee is not required to relocate until 
the alternative facilities are available to it for a reasonable time to 
make adjustments, determine comparability, and ensure a seamless 
handoff.
    (e) If within one year after the relocation to new facilities the 2 
GHz microwave licensee demonstrates that the new facilities are not 
comparable to the former facilities, the emerging technology service 
entity must remedy the defects or pay to relocate the microwave licensee 
back to its former or equivalent 2 GHz frequencies.

makes assignments according to a specified channel plan, provisions 
shall be made to prevent the emission included within the occupied 
bandwidth from radiating outside the assigned channel at a level greater 
than that specified in Sec. 21.106.

Sec. 21.113  Quiet zones and Arecibo Coordination Zone.

    Quiet zones are those areas where it is necessary to restrict 
radiation so as to minimize possible impact on the operations of radio 
astronomy or other facilities that are highly sensitive to radio 
frequency interference. The areas involved and procedures required are 
as follows:
    (a) In order to minimize possible harmful interference at the 
National Radio Astronomy Observatory site located at Green Bank, 
Pocahontas County, West Virginia, and at the Naval Radio Research 
Observatory site at Sugar Grove, Pendleton County, West Virginia, any 
applicant for a station authorization other than mobile, temporary base, 
or temporary fixed seeking authorization for a new station or to modify 
an existing station in a manner which would change either the frequency, 
power, antenna height or directivity, or location of such a station 
within the area bounded by 39 deg.15' N. on the north, 78 deg.30' W. on 
the east, 37 deg.30' N. on the south, and 80 deg.30' W. on the west 
shall, at the time of filing such application with the Commission, 
simultaneously notify the Director, National Radio Astronomy 
Observatory, Post Office Box No. 2, Green Bank, West Virginia 24944, in 
writing, of the technical particulars of the proposed operation. Such 
notification shall include the geographical coordinates of the antenna, 
antenna height, antenna directivity (if any), proposed frequency, type 
of emission, and power. In addition, the applicant shall indicate in his 
application to the Commission the date notification was made to the 
Observatory. After receipt of such applications, the Commission will 
allow a period of twenty (20) days for comments or objections in 
response to the notifications indicated. If an objection to the proposed 
operation is received during the 20-day period from the National Radio 
Astronomy Observatory for itself or on behalf of the Naval Radio 
Research Observatory, the Commission will consider all aspects of the 
problem and take whatever action is deemed appropriate.
    (b) In order to minimize possible harmful interference at the Table 
Mountain Radio Receiving Zone of the Research Laboratories of the 
Department of Commerce located in Boulder County, Colorado, applicants 
for new or modified radio facilities in the vicinity of Boulder County, 
Colorado are advised to give due consideration prior to filing 
applications, to the need to protect the Table Mountain Radio Receiving 
Zone from harmful interference. To prevent degradation of this present 
ambient radio signal level at the site, the Department of Commerce seeks 
to ensure that the field strengths of any radiated signals (excluding 
reflected signals) received on this 728.4 hectare (1800 acre) site (in 
the vicinity of coordinates 40 deg. 07' 50" N Latitude, 105 deg. 15' 40" 
W Longitude) resulting from new assignments (other than mobile stations) 
or from the modification or relocation of existing facilities do not 
exceed the following values:

\1\ Equivalent values of power flux density are calculated assuming free
  space characteristic impedance of 376.7=120<greek-p> ohms.
\2\ Space stations shall conform to the power flux density limits at the
  earth's surface specified in appropriate parts of the FCC rules, but
  in no case should exceed the above levels in any 4 kHz band for all
  angles of arrival.

    (1) Advance consultation is recommended particularly for those 
applicants who have no reliable data which indicates whether the field 
strength or power flux density figures in the above table would be 
exceeded by their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In 
such instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining 
whether coordination is recommended:
    (i) All stations within 2.4. kilometers (1.5 miles);
    (ii) Stations within 4.8 kilometers (3 miles) with 50 watts or more 
average effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of 
polarization in the azimuthal direction of the Table Mountain Radio 
Receiving Zone;
    (iii) Stations within 16.1 kilometers (10 miles) with 1 kW or more 
average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of Table Mountain Receiving Zone;
    (iv) Stations within 80.5 kilometers (50 miles) with 25 kW or more 
average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of Table Mountain Receiving Zone.
    (2) Applicants concerned are urged to communicate with the Radio 
Frequency Management Coordinator, Department of Commerce, Research 
Support Services, NOAA R/E5X2, Boulder Laboratories, Boulder, CO 80303; 
telephone (303) 497-6548, in advance of filling their applications with 
the Commission.
    (3) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised 
that such consultation can avoid objections from the Department of 
Commerce or proceedings to modify any authorization which may be granted 
which, in fact, delivers a signal at the site in excess of the field 
strength specified herein.
    (c) Protection for Federal Communications Commission monitoring 
stations:
    (1) Applicants in the vicinity of an FCC monitoring station for a 
radio station authorization to operate new transmitting facilities or 
changed transmitting facilities which would increase the field strength 
produced over the monitoring station over that previously authorized are 
advised to give consideration, prior to filing applications, to the 
possible need to protect the FCC stations from harmful interference. 
Geographical coordinates of the facilities which require protection are 
listed in Sec. 0.121(c) of the Commission's Rules. Applications for 
stations (except mobile stations) which will produce on any frequency a 
direct wave fundamental field strength of greater than 10 mV/m in the 
authorized bandwidth of service (-65.8 dBW/m<SUP>2</SUP> power flux 
density assuming a free space characteristic impedance of 120 ohms) at 
the referenced coordinates, may be examined to determine extent of 
possible interference. Depending on the theoretical field strength value 
and existing root-sum-square or other ambient radio field signal levels 
at the indicated coordinates, a clause protecting the monitoring station 
may be added to the station authorization.
    (2) In the event that calculated value of expected field exceeds 10 
mV/m (-65.8 dBW/m<SUP>2</SUP>) at the reference coordinates, or if there 
is any question whether field strength levels might exceed the threshold 
value, advance consultation with the FCC to discuss any protection 
necessary should be considered. Prospective applicants may communicate 
with: Chief, Compliance and Information Bureau, Federal Communications 
Commission, Washington, DC 20554, Telephone (202) 632-6980.
    (3) Advance consultation is suggested particularly for those 
applicants who have no reliable data which indicates whether the field 
strength or power flux density figure indicated would be exceeded by 
their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In such 
instances, the following is a suggested

[[Page 53]]

guide for determining whether an applicant should coordinate:
    (i) All stations within 2.4 kilometers (1.5 statute miles);
    (ii) Stations within 4.8 kilometers (3 statute miles) with 50 watts 
or more average effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of 
polarization in the azimuthal direction of the Monitoring Stations.
    (iii) Stations within 16.1 kilometers (10 miles) with 1 kW or more 
average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of the Monitoring Station.
    (iv) Stations within 80.5 kilometers (50 miles) with 25 kW or more 
average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of the Monitoring Station.
    (4) Advance coordination for stations operating above 1000 MHz is 
recommended only where the proposed station is in the vicinity of a 
monitoring station designated as a satellite monitoring facility in 
Sec. 0.121(c) of the Commission's Rules and also meets the criteria 
outlined in paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section.
    (5) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised 
that such consultation can avoid objections from the Federal 
Communications Commission or modification of any authorization which 
will cause harmful interference.
    (d) Any applicant for a new permanent base or fixed station to be 
located on the islands of Puerto Rico, Desecheo, Mona, Vieques, and 
Culebra, or for a modification of an existing authorization which would 
change the frequency, power, antenna height, directivity, or location of 
a station on these islands and would increase the likelihood of the 
authorized facility causing interference, shall notify the Interference 
Office, Arecibo Observatory, Post Office Box 995, Arecibo, Puerto Rico 
00613, in writing or electronically, of the technical parameters of the 
proposal. Applicants may wish to consult interference guidelines, which 
will be provided by Cornell University. Applicants who choose to 
transmit information electronically should e-mail to: prcz@naic.edu
    (1) The notification to the Interference Office, Arecibo Observatory 
shall be made prior to, or simultaneously with, the filing of the 
application with the Commission. The notification shall state the 
geographical coordinates of the antenna (NAD-83 datum), antenna height 
above ground, ground elevation at the antenna, antenna directivity and 
gain, proposed frequency and FCC Rule Part, type of emission, effective 
radiated power, and whether the proposed use is itinerant. Generally, 
submission of the information in the technical portion of the FCC 
license application is adequate notification. In addition, the applicant 
shall indicate in its application to the Commission the date 
notification was made to the Arecibo Observatory.
    (2) After receipt of such applications, the Commission will allow 
the Arecibo Observatory a period of 20 days for comments or objections 
in response to the notification indicated. The applicant will be 
required to make reasonable efforts in order to resolve or mitigate any 
potential interference problem with the Arecibo Observatory and to file 
either an amendment to the application or a modification application, as 
appropriate. If the Commission determines that an applicant has 
satisfied its responsibility to make reasonable efforts to protect the 
Observatory from interference, its application may be granted.
    (3) The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to operations that 
transmit on frequencies above 15 GHz.

Sec. 21.117  Transmitter location.

    (a) The applicant shall determine, prior to filing an application 
for a radio station authorization, that the antenna site specified 
therein is adequate to render the service proposed. In cases of 
questionable antenna locations, it is desirable to conduct propagation 
tests to indicate the field intensity which may be expected in the 
principal areas or at the fixed points of communication to be served, 
particularly where severe shadow problems may be expected. In 
considering applications proposing the use of such locations, the 
Commission may require site survey tests to be made pursuant to a 
developmental authorization in the particular service concerned. In such 
cases, propagation tests should be conducted in accordance with 
recognized engineering methods and should be made with a transmitting 
antenna simulating, as near as possible, the proposed antenna 
installation. Full data obtained from such surveys and its analysis, 
including a description of the methods used and the name, address and 
qualifications of the engineer making the survey, must be supplied to 
the Commission.
    (b) The owner of the antenna structure should locate and construct 
such structure as to avoid making them hazardous to air navigation. (See 
part 17 of this chapter for provisions relating to antenna structures.) 
Such installation shall be maintained in good structural condition 
together with any required painting or lighting.

    (a) The equipment at the operating and transmitting positions shall 
be so installed and protected that it is not accessible to, or capable 
of being operated by, persons other than those duly authorized by the 
licensee.
    (b) In any case where the maximum modulating frequency of a 
transmitter is prescribed by the Commission, the transmitter shall be 
equipped with a low-pass or band-pass modulation filter of suitable 
performance characteristics. In those cases where a modulation limiter 
is employed, the modulation filter shall be installed between the 
transmitter stage in which limiting is effected and the modulated stage 
of the transmitter.
    (c) Each transmitter employed in these services shall be equipped 
with an appropriately labeled pilot lamp or meter which will provide 
continuous visual indication at the transmitter when its control 
circuits have been placed in a condition to activate the transmitter. 
Such requirement will not be applicable to MDS response stations or MDS 
booster stations authorized pursuant to Sec. 21.913(e). In addition, 
facilities shall be provided at each transmitter to permit the 
transmitter to be turned on and off independently of any remote control 
circuits associated therewith.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) At each transmitter control point the following facilities shall 
be installed:
    (1) A carrier operated device which will provide continuous visual 
indication when the transmitter is radiating, or, in lieu thereof, a 
pilot lamp or meter which will provide continuous visual indication when 
the transmitter

[[Page 55]]

control circuits have been placed in a condition to activate the 
transmitter.
    (2) Facilities which will permit the operator to turn transmitter 
carrier on and off at will.
    (f) Transmitter control circuits from any control point shall be so 
installed that grounding or shorting any line in the control circuit 
will not cause the transmitter to radiate: Provided, however, That this 
provision shall not be applicable to control circuits of stations which 
normally operate with continuous radiation or to control circuits which 
are under the effective operational control of responsible operating 
personnel 24 hours per day.

Sec. 21.122  Microwave digital modulation.

    (a) Microwave transmitters employing digital modulation techniques 
and operating below 15 GHz shall, with appropriate multiplex equipment, 
comply with the following additional requirement: The bit rate, in bits 
per second, shall be equal to or greater than the bandwidth specified by 
the emission designator in Hertz (e.g., to be acceptable, equipment 
transmitting at a 6 Mb/s rate must not require a bandwidth of greater 
than 6 MHz), except the bandwidth used to calculate the minimum rate 
shall not include any authorized guard band.
    (b) For purposes of compliance with the emission limitation 
requirements of Sec. 21.106(a)(2) of this part and the requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section, digital modulation techniques are 
considered as being employed when digital modulation contributes 50 
percent or more to the total peak frequency deviation of a transmitted 
radio frequency carrier. The total peak frequency deviation shall be 
determined by adding the deviation produced by the digital modulation 
signal and the deviation produced by any frequency division multiplex 
(FDM) modulation used. The deviation (D) produced by the FDM signal 
shall be determined in accordance with Sec. 2.202(f) of part 2 of this 
chapter.
    (c) Transmitters employing digital modulation techniques shall 
effectively eliminate carrier spikes or single frequency tones in the 
output signal to the degree which would be obtained without repetitive 
patterns occurring in the signal.

    (d) An MDS licensee or conditional licensee may apply to exchange 
evenly one or more of its assigned channels with another MDS licensee or 
conditional licensee in the same system, or with an ITFS licensee or 
conditional licensee in the same system. The licensees or conditional 
licensees seeking to exchange channels shall file in tandem with the 
Commission separate pro forma assignment of license applications, each 
attaching an exhibit which clearly specifies that the application is 
filed pursuant to a channel exchange agreement. The exchanged channel(s) 
shall be regulated according to the requirements applicable to the 
assignee.
    (e) Frequencies in the band segments 18,580-18,820 MHz and 18,920-
19,160 MHz that were licensed or had applications pending before the 
Commission as of September 18, 1998 may continue those operations for 
point-to-point return links from a subscriber's location on a shared co-
primary basis with other services under parts 25, 74, 78 and 101 of this 
chapter until June 8, 2010. Prior to June 8, 2010, such stations are 
subject to relocation by licensees in the fixed-satellite service. Such 
relocation is subject to the provisions of Secs. 101.85 through 101.97 
of this chapter. After June 8, 2010, such operations are not entitled to 
protection from fixed-satellite service operations and must not cause 
unacceptable interference to fixed-satellite service station operations. 
No new licenses will be granted in these bands after June 8, 2000.
    (f) MDS H-channel applications. Frequencies in the bands 2650-2656 
MHz, 2662-2668 MHz, or 2674-2680 MHz must be assigned only in accordance 
with the following conditions: All applications for MDS H-channel 
stations must specify either the H1, H2, or H3 channel for which an 
application is filed; however, the Commission may on its own initiative 
assign different channels in these frequency bands if it is determined 
that such action would serve the public interest.
    (g) Frequencies in the bands 2150-2162 MHz, 2596-2644 MHz, 2650-2656 
MHz, 2662-2668 MHz and 2674-2680 MHz are available for point-to-
multipoint use and/or for communications between MDS response stations 
and response station hubs when authorized in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 21.909, provided that such frequencies may be 
employed for MDS response stations only when transmitting using digital 
modulation.

Sec. 21.902  Interference.

    (a) All applicants, conditional licensees, and licensees shall make 
exceptional efforts to avoid harmful interference to other users and to 
avoid blocking potential adjacent channel use in the same city and 
cochannel use in nearby cities. In areas where major

[[Page 66]]

cities are in close proximity, careful consideration should be given to 
minimum power requirements and to the location, height, and radiation 
pattern of the transmitting antenna. Licensees, conditional licensees, 
and applicants are expected to cooperate fully in attempting to resolve 
problems of potential interference before bringing the matter to the 
attention of the Commission.
    (b) As a condition for use of frequency in this service, each 
applicant, conditional licensee, and licensee is required to:
    (1) Not enter into any lease or contract or otherwise take any 
action that would unreasonably prohibit location of another station's 
transmitting antenna at any given site inside its own protected service 
area.
    (2) Cooperate fully and in good faith to resolve interference and 
transmission security problems.
    (3) Engineer the system to provide at least 45 dB of cochannel 
interference protection within the 56.33 km (35 mile) protected service 
area of any authorized or previously-proposed ITFS or incumbent MDS 
station, and at each previously-registered ITFS receive site registered 
as of September 17, 1998 (or the appropriate value for bandwidths other 
than 6 MHz.)
    (4) Engineer the station to provide at least 0 dB of adjacent 
channel interference protection within the 56.33 km (35 mile) protected 
service area of any authorized or previously-proposed ITFS or incumbent 
MDS station, and at each previously-registered ITFS receive site 
registered as of September 17, 1998 (or the appropriate value for 
bandwidths other than 6 MHz.)
    (5)(i) Engineer the station to limit the calculated free space power 
flux density to -73 dBW/m \2\ (or the appropriate value for bandwidth 
other than 6 MHz) at the boundary of a 56.33 km (35 mile) protected 
service area, where there is an unobstructed signal path from the 
transmitting antenna to the boundary; or alternatively, obtain the 
written consent of the entity authorized for the adjoining area to 
exceed the -73 dBW/m \2\ limiting signal strength at the common 
boundary.
    (ii) In determining signal path conditions, the following shall be 
used: a 9.1 meter (30 feet) receiving antenna height, the transmitting 
antenna height, terrain elevations and 4/3 earth radius propagation 
conditions.
    (6) If a proposed station is within 80 km (50 miles) of the Canadian 
or Mexican border, the station must be designed to meet the requirements 
set forth in international treaties.
    (7) Notwithstanding the above, main, booster and response stations 
shall use the following formulas, as applicable, for determining 
compliance with: (1) Radiated field contour limits where bandwidths 
other than 6 MHz are employed at stations utilizing digital emissions; 
and (2) Cochannel and adjacent channel D/U ratios where the bandwidths 
in use at the interfering and protected stations are unequal and both 
stations are utilizing digital modulation or one station is utilizing 
digital modulation and the other station is utilizing either 6 MHz NTSC 
analog modulation or 125 kHz analog modulation (I channels only).
    (i) Contour limit: -73 dBW/m\2\ + 10 log(X/6) dBW/m\2\, where X is 
the bandwidth in MHz of the digital channel.
    (ii) Co-channel D/U: 45 dB + 10 log(X<INF>1</INF>/X<INF>2</INF>) dB, 
where X<INF>1</INF> is the bandwidth in MHz of the protected channel and 
X<INF>2</INF> is the bandwidth in MHz of the interfering channel.
    (iii) Adjacent channel D/U: 0 dB + 10 log(X<INF>1</INF>/
X<INF>2</INF>), dB where X<INF>1</INF> is the bandwidth in MHz of the 
protected channel and X<INF>2</INF> is the bandwidth in MHz of the 
interfering channel.
    (c) The following interference studies must be prepared:
    (1) An analysis of the potential for harmful interference within the 
56.33 km (35 mile) protected service areas of any authorized or 
previously proposed incumbent station:
    (i) If the coordinates of the applicant's proposed transmitter are 
within 160.94 km (100 miles) of the center coordinates of any authorized 
or previously proposed incumbent station with protected service area of 
56.33 km (35 miles) as specified in Sec. 21.902(d); or
    (ii) If the great circle path between the applicant's proposed 
transmitter and the protected service area of any authorized, or 
previously-proposed, cochannel or adjacent-channel station(s) is within 
241.4 kilometers or less and 90

[[Page 67]]

percent or more of the path is over water or within 16.1 kilometers of 
the coast or shoreline of the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the 
Gulf of Mexico, any of the Great Lakes, or any bay associated with any 
of the above (see Secs. 21.901(a) and 74.902 of this chapter);
    (2) Applicants may design interference studies in any manner that 
demonstrates the avoidance of harmful interference, as defined in this 
subpart.
    (i) In lieu of interference studies, applicants may submit in 
accordance with Sec. 21.938 a written statement of no objection to the 
operation of the MDS station.
    (ii) The Commission may direct applicants to submit interference 
studies of a specific nature.
    (3) Except for new stations proposed in applications filed after 
September 15, 1995, in the case of a proposal to operate a non-colocated 
station within the protected service area of an authorized, or 
previously proposed, adjacent channel station, an analysis that 
identifies the areas within the protected service areas of both the 
authorized or previously proposed adjacent channel station and the 
proposed station that cannot be protected as specified in 
Sec. 21.902(b)(4) and an explanation of why the proposed station cannot 
be colocated with the existing or previously proposed station.
    (4) In the case of a proposal for use of channel 2, an analysis of 
the potential for harmful interference with any authorized point-to-
point station located within 80.5 kilometers (50 miles) which utilizes 
the 2160-2162 MHz band; and
    (d)(1) Subject to the limitations contained in paragraph (e) of this 
section, each MDS station licensee shall be protected from harmful 
electrical interference, as determined by the theoretical calculations, 
within a protected service area of which the boundary will be 56.3255 
kilometers (35 miles) from the transmitter site.
    (2) As of September 15, 1995, the location of these protected 
service area boundaries shall become fixed. The center of the circular 
area shall be the geographic latitude and longitude of the transmitting 
antenna site specified in station authorizations or previously proposed 
applications filed at the Commission before September 15, 1995. 
Subsequent transmitter site changes will not change the location of the 
56.3255 kilometers (35 mile) protected service area boundaries.
    (e) No MDS licensee will be protected from harmful interference 
caused by:
    (1) Any station with an earlier filing date.
    (2) Any station that was authorized before July 1984.
    (3) Any multichannel MDS station whose application was pending on 
September 9, 1983.
    (f) In addressing potential harmful interference in this service, 
the following definitions, procedures and other criteria shall apply:
    (1) Cochannel interference is defined as the ratio of the desired 
signal to the undesired signal present in the desired channel, at the 
output of a reference receiving antenna oriented to receive the maximum 
desired signal. Harmful interference will be considered present when a 
calculation using a terrain sensitive signal propagation model 
determines that this ratio is less than 45 dB (or the appropriate value 
for bandwidths other than 6 MHz.)
    (2) Adjacent channel interference is defined as the ratio of the 
desired signal to undesired signal present in an adjacent channel, at 
the output of a reference receiving antenna oriented to receive the 
maximum desired signal level.
    (i) Harmful interference will be considered present when a 
calculation using a terrain sensitive model determines that this ratio 
is less than 0dB (or the appropriate value for bandwidths other than 6 
MHz.)
    (ii) In the alternative, harmful interference will be considered 
present for an ITFS station constructed before May 26, 1983, when a 
calculation using a terrain-sensitive propagation model determines that 
this ratio is less than 10 dB (or the appropriate value for bandwidths 
other than 6 MHz.) unless:
    (A) The individual receive site under consideration has been 
subsequently upgraded with up-to-date reception equipment, in which case 
the ratio shall be less than 0 dB. Absent information presented to the 
contrary, however, the Commission will assume that

[[Page 68]]

reception equipment installation occurred simultaneously with original 
station equipment; or
    (B) The license for an MDS station is conditioned on the proffer to 
the affected ITFS station licensee of equipment capable of providing a 
ratio of 0 dB or more at no expense to the ITFS station licensee, and 
also conditioned, if necessary, on the proffer of installation of such 
equipment; and there has been no showing by the affected ITFS station 
licensee demonstrating good cause and that the proposed equipment will 
not provide a ratio of 0 dB or more, or that installation of such 
equipment, at no expense to the ITFS station licensee, is not possible 
or has not been proffered.
    (3) For purposes of this section all interference calculations 
involving receive antenna performance shall use the reference antenna 
characteristics shown in figure 1.

[[Page 69]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MR91.040

    (4) For purposes of this section, the received signal power level 
(RSL)<INF>dBW</INF> at the output of the FCC reference receiving antenna 
is obtained from the following formulas (or an equivalent adaptation):

(RSL)<INF>dBW</INF>=(EIRP)<INF>dBW</INF>-(L<INF>FS</INF>)<INF>dB</INF>+(G
    <INF>AR</INF>)<INF>dB</INF>
where the free space loss (L<INF>FS</INF>) is

[[Page 70]]

(L<INF>FS</INF>)<INF>dB</INF>=20 log (4<INF>d</INF>/)<INF>dB</INF>

in which the parameters are defined as follows:
(RSL)<INF>dBW</INF> is the received power in decibels referenced to one 
watt.
(EIRP)<INF>dBW</INF> is the equivalent isotropically radiated power in 
decibels above one watt.
d is the distance of the signal path in meters.
<greek-l> is the wavelength of the signal in meters.
G<INF>AR</INF> is the dB gain of the reference receiving antenna above 
an isotropic antenna (obtained from Figure 1 of this section.)

    (5) A determination of signal path conditions shall use a 9.1 meters 
(30 feet) receiving antenna height, the transmitting antenna height, 
terrain elevation, and assume 4/3 earth radius propagation conditions.
    (6) An application will not be accepted for filing if cochannel or 
adjacent channel interference is predicted at the boundary of the 56.33 
km (35 mile) protected service area of an authorized or previously 
proposed incumbent station based on the following criteria:
    (i) Interference calculations shall be made only for directions 
where there is an unobstructed signal path from the site of a proposed 
station to the boundary of any protected area.
    (ii) Calculations of received power levels in units of dBW from the 
proposed station will be made at one degree intervals around the 
protected service area.
    (iii) The assumed value of the desired signal level at the boundary 
of an incumbent station shall be -83 dBW, which is the calculated 
received power in free space at a distance of 56.33 km (35 miles), given 
at EIRP of 2000 watts and a receiver antenna gain of 20 dBi.
    (iv) Harmful interference will be considered to occur at locations 
along the boundary wherever the ratio between the desired signal level 
of -83 dBw and the received power from a proposed cochannel or adjacent 
channel station is less than 45 dB or 0 dB for cochannel or adjacent 
channel proposals, respectively.
    (7) Alternatively, MDS applications will be accepted on the basis of 
an executed written interference agreement between potentially affected 
parties filed in accordance with Sec. 21.938.
    (g)(1) All interference studies prepared pursuant to paragraph (c) 
of this section must be served on all licensees, conditional licensees, 
and applicants for the stations required to be studied by this section. 
This service must include a copy of the FCC application and occur on or

    (2) MDS licensees, conditional licensees and applicants of 
facilities with 56.33 km (35 mile) protected service areas shall notify 
in writing the holders of authorizations for adjoining BTAs or PSAs of 
application filings for modified station licenses, provided the proposed 
facility would produce an unobstructed signal path to any location 
within the adjoining BTA or PSA. This service must include a copy of the 
FCC application and occur on or before the date the application is filed 
with the Commission.
    (h) For purposes of Sec. 21.31(a), an MDS application, except for 
those applications filed on or after September 15, 1995, filed for a 
facility that would cause harmful electrical interference within the 
protected service area of any authorized or previously proposed station

<R05>
Sec. 21.903  Purpose and permissible service.

    (a) Multipoint Distribution Service channels are available for 
transmissions from MDS stations and associated MDS signal booster 
stations to receive locations, and from MDS response stations to 
response station hubs. When service is provided on a common carrier 
basis, subscriber supplied information is transmitted to points 
designated by the subscriber. When service is provided on a non-common 
carrier basis, transmissions may include information originated by 
persons other than the licensee, licensee-manipulated information 
supplied by other persons, or information originated by the licensee. 
Point-to-point radio return links from a subscriber's location to a MDS 
operator's facilities may also be authorized in the 18,580 through 
18,820 MHz and 18,920 through 19,160 MHz bands. Rules governing such 
operation are contained in subpart I of part 101 of this chapter, the 
Point-to-Point Microwave Radio Service.
    (b) Unless otherwise directed or conditioned in the applicable 
instrument of authorization, Multipoint Distribution Service stations 
may render any kind of communications service consistent with the 
Commission's rules on a common carrier or on a non-common carrier basis, 
Provided That:
    (1) Unless service is rendered on a non-common carrier basis, the 
common carrier controls the operation of all receiving facilities (e.g., 
including any equipment necessary to convert the signal to a standard 
television channel, but excluding the television receiver); and
    (2) Unless service is rendered on a non-common carrier basis, the 
common carrier's tariff allows the subscriber the option of owning the 
receiving equipment (except for the decoder) so long as:
    (i) The customer provides the type of equipment as specified in the 
tariff;
    (ii) Such equipment is in suitable condition for the rendition of 
satisfactory service; and
    (iii) Such equipment is installed, maintained, and operated pursuant 
to the common carrier's instructions and control.
    (c) The carrier's tariff shall fully describe the parameters of the 
service to be provided, including the degree of privacy of 
communications a subscriber can expect in ordinary service. If the 
ordinary service does not provide for complete security of transmission, 
the tariff shall make provision for service with such added protection 
upon request.
    (d) An MDS licensee also may alternate, without further 
authorization required, between rendering service on a common carrier 
and non-common carrier basis, provided that the licensee notifies the 
Commission of any service status changes at least 30 days in advance of 
such changes. The notification shall state whether there is any 
affiliation or relationship to any intended or likely subscriber or 
program originator.

<R05>
Sec. 21.904  EIRP limitations.

    (a) The maximum EIRP of a main or booster station shall not exceed 
33 dBW

[[Page 74]]

+ 10log(X/6) dBW, where X is the actual bandwidth if other than 6 MHz, 
except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b)(i) If a main or booster station sectorizes or otherwise uses one 
or more transmitting antennas with a non-omnidirectional horizontal 
plane radiation pattern, the maximum EIRP in a given direction shall be 
determined by the following formula:

EIRP = 33 dBW + 10 log(X/6) dBW + 10 log(360/beamwidth) dBW, where X is 
the channel width in MHz and 10 log(360/beamwidth) <ls-thn-eq> 6 dB.

    (ii) Beamwidth is the total horizontal plane beamwidth of the 
individual transmitting antenna for the station or any sector measured 
at the half-power points.
    (c) An increase in station EIRP, above currently-authorized or 
previously-proposed values, to the maximum values provided in paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section may be authorized, if the requested increase 
would not cause harmful interference to any authorized or previously-
proposed, cochannel or adjacent channel station entitled to interference 
protection under the Commission's rules, or if an applicant demonstrates 
that:
    (1) A station that must be protected from interference could 
compensate for interference by increasing its EIRP; and
    (2) The interfered-with station may increase its own EIRP consistent 
with the rules and without causing harmful interference to any cochannel 
or adjacent channel main or booster station protected service area, 
response station hub or BTA/PSA, for which consent for the increased 
interference has not been obtained; and
    (3) The applicant requesting authorization of an EIRP increase 
agrees to pay all expenses associated with the increase in EIRP by the 
interfered-with station.
    (d) For television transmission if the authorized bandwidth is 4.0 
MHz or more for the visual and accompanying aural signal, the peak power 
of the accompanying aural signal must not exceed 10 percent of the peak 
visual power of the transmitter. The Commission may order a reduction in 
aural signal power to diminish the potential for harmful interference.
    (e) For main, booster and response stations utilizing digital 
emissions with non-uniform power spectral density (e.g. unfiltered 
QPSK), the power measured within any 100 kHz resolution bandwidth within 
the 6 MHz channel occupied by the non-uniform emission cannot exceed the 
power permitted within any 100 kHz resolution bandwidth within the 6 MHz 
channel if it were occupied by an emission with uniform power spectral 
density, i.e., if the maximum permissible power of a station utilizing a 
perfectly uniform power spectral density across a 6 MHz channel were 
2000 watts EIRP, this would result in a maximum permissible power flux 
density for the station of 2000/60 = 33.3 watts EIRP per 100 kHz 
bandwidth. If a non-uniform emission were substituted at the station, 
station power would still be limited to a maximum of 33.3 watts EIRP 
within any 100 kHz segment of the 6 MHz channel, irrespective of the 
fact that this would result in a total 6 MHz channel power of less than 
2000 watts EIRP.

Sec. 21.905  Emissions and bandwidth.

    (a) A station transmitting a television signal shall not exceed a 
bandwidth of 6 MHz (for both visual signal and accompanying aural 
signal), and will normally employ vestigial sideband, amplitude 
modulation (C3F) for the visual signal, and frequency modulation (F3E) 
or (G3E) for the accompanying aural signal.
    (b) Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), digital vestigial 
sideband modulation (VSB), quadrature phase shift key modulation (QPSK), 
code division multiple access (CDMA), and orthogonal frequency division 
multiplex (OFDM) emissions may be employed, subject to compliance with 
the policies set forth in the Declaratory Ruling and Order, 11 FCC Rcd 
18839 (1996). Use of OFDM also is subject to the subsequent Declaratory 
Ruling and Order, DA 99-554 (Mass Med. Bur. rel. Mar. 19, 1999). Other 
digital emissions may be added to those authorized above, including 
emissions with non-uniform power spectral density, if the applicant 
provides information in accordance with

[[Page 75]]

the guidelines and procedures set forth in the Declaratory Ruling and 
Order which clearly demonstrates the spectral occupancy and interference 
characteristics of the emission. The licensee may subchannelize its 
authorized bandwidth, provided that digital modulation is employed and 
the aggregate power does not exceed the authorized power for the 
channel, and may utilize all or a portion of its authorized bandwidth 
for MDS response stations authorized pursuant to Sec. 21.909 of this 
part. The licensee may also, jointly with affected adjacent channel 
licensees, transmit utilizing bandwidth in excess of its authorized 
frequencies, provided that digital modulation is employed, all power 
spectral density requirements set forth in this part are met and the 
out-of-band emissions restrictions set forth in Sec. 21.908 of this part 
are met at and beyond the edges of the channels employed. The wider 
channels thus created may be redivided to create narrower channels.
    (c) Any licensee of a station in the 2150-2162 MHz or 2596-2644 MHz, 
2650-2656 MHz, 2662-2668 MHz, or 2674-2680 MHz frequency bands, after 
notice and opportunity for hearing, may be required to use the frequency 
offset technique to avoid or to minimize harmful interference to another 
licensed station in the 2150-2162 MHz and 2596-2544 MHz, 2650-2656 MHz, 
2662-2668 MHz, and 2674-2680 MHz frequency bands or to make other 
changes as provided in Secs. 21.100, 21.107, 21.900, 21.901, 21.902, 
21.904, 21.905(a), 21.905(b), 21.906, 21.907, and 21.908 of this part.
    (d) Notwithstanding the above, any digital emission which complies 
with the out-of-band emission restrictions of Sec. 21.908 of this part 
may be used in the following circumstances:
    (1) At any MDS main or booster station transmitter which is located 
more than 160.94 km (100 miles) from the nearest boundary of all 
cochannel and adjacent channel ITFS and MDS protected service areas, 
including Basic Trading Areas and Partitioned Service Areas; and
    (2) At all MDS response station transmitters within a response 
service area if all points along the response service area boundary line 
are more than 160.94 km (100 miles) from the nearest boundary of all 
cochannel and adjacent channel ITFS and MDS protected service areas, 
including Basic Trading Areas and Partitioned Service Areas; and
    (3) At any MDS transmitter where all parties entitled by this part 
to interference protection from that transmitter have mutually consented 
to the use at that transmitter of such emissions.

Sec. 21.906  Antennas.

    (a) Main and booster station transmitting antennas shall be 
omnidirectional, except that a directional antenna with a main beam 
sufficiently broad to provide adequate service may be used either to 
avoid possible interference with other users in the frequency band, or 
to provide coverage more consistent with distribution of potential 
receiving points. In lieu of an omnidirectional antenna, a station may 
employ an array of directional antennas in order to reuse spectrum 
efficiently. When an applicant proposes to employ a directional antenna, 
or a licensee notifies the Commission pursuant to Sec. 21.42 of the 
installation of a sectorized antenna system, the applicant shall provide 
the Commission with information regarding the orientation of the 
directional antenna(s), expressed in degree of azimuth, with respect to 
true north, and the make and model of such antenna(s).
    (b) The use of horizontal or vertical plane wave polarization, or 
right hand or left hand rotating elliptical polarization may be used to 
minimize the hazard of harmful interference between systems.
    (c) Transmitting antennas located within 56.3 kilometers (35 miles) 
of the Canadian border should be directed so as to minimize, to the 
extent that is practical, emissions toward the border.
    (d) Directive receiving antennas shall be used at all points other 
than response station hubs and response stations operating with an EIRP 
no greater than -6 dBW per 6 MHz channel and

[[Page 76]]

shall be elevated no higher than necessary to assure adequate service. 
Receiving antenna height shall not exceed the height criteria of Part 17 
of this chapter, unless authorization for use of a specific maximum 
height (above ground and mean sea level) for each location has been 
obtained from the Commission prior to the erection of the antenna. (See 
part 17 of this chapter concerning construction, marking and lighting of 
antenna structures.) A response station operating with an EIRP no 
greater than -6 dBW per 6 MHz channel may use an omnidirectional 
receiving antenna. However, for the purpose of interference protection, 
such response stations will be treated as if utilizing a receive antenna 
meeting the requirements of the reference receiving antenna of Figure 1 
of Sec. 21.902(f)(3).

Sec. 21.908  Transmitting equipment.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the requirements 
of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) of Sec. 73.687 of this chapter 
shall apply to stations in this service transmitting standard television 
signals.

    Editorial Note: At 63 FR 65104, Nov. 25, 1999, paragraph (b) was 
redesignated as paragraph (a) and newly designated paragraph (a) was 
revised. However, paragraph (a) already exists. The text of the newly 
redesignated paragraph (a) follows:

    (a) The maximum out-of-band power of an MDS station transmitter or 
booster transmitting on a single 6 MHz channel with an EIRP in excess of 
-9 dBW employing analog modulation shall be attenuated at the channel 
edges by at least 38 dB relative to the peak visual carrier, then 
linearly sloping from that level to at least 60 dB of attenuation at 1 
MHz below the lower band edge and 0.5 MHz above the upper band edge, and 
attenuated at least 60 dB at all other frequencies. The maximum out-of-
band power of an MDS station transmitter or booster transmitting on a 
single 6 MHz channel or a portion thereof with an EIRP in excess of -9 
dBW (or, when subchannels are used, the appropriately adjusted value 
based upon the ratio of the channel-to-subchannel bandwidths) employing 
digital modulation shall be attenuated at the 6 MHz channel edges at 
least 25 dB relative to the licensed average 6 MHz channel power level, 
then attenuated along a linear slope to at least 40 dB at 250 kHz beyond 
the nearest channel edge, then attenuated along a linear slope from that 
level to at least 60 dB at 3 MHz above the upper and below the lower 
licensed channel edges, and attenuated at least 60 dB at all other 
frequencies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in situations where an MDS 
station or booster station transmits, or where adjacent channel 
licensees jointly transmit, a single signal over more than one 
contiguous 6 MHz channel utilizing digital modulation with an EIRP in 
excess of -9 dBW (or, when subchannels or superchannels are used, the 
appropriately adjusted value based upon the ratio of 6 MHz to the 
subchannel or superchannel bandwidth), the maximum out-of-band power 
shall be attenuated at the channel edges of those combined channels at 
least 25 dB relative to the power level of each channel, then attenuated 
along a linear slope from that level to at least 40 dB at 250 kHz above 
or below the channel edges of those combined channels, then attenuated 
along a linear slope from that level to at least 60 dB at 3 MHz above 
the upper and below the lower edges of those combined channels, and 
attenuated at least 60 dB at all other frequencies. However, should 
harmful interference occur as a result of emissions outside the assigned 
channel, additional attenuation may be required. A transmitter licensed 
prior to November 1, 1991, that remains at the station site initially 
licensed, and does not comply with this paragraph, may continue to be 
used for its life if it does not cause harmful interference to the 
operation of any other licensee. Any non-conforming transmitter replaced 
after November 1, 1991, must be replaced by a transmitter meeting the 
requirements of this paragraph.
    (b) A booster transmitting on multiple contiguous or non-contiguous 
channels carrying separate signals (a

[[Page 77]]

``broadband'' booster) with an EIRP in excess of -9 dBW per 6 MHz 
channel and employing analog, digital or a combination of these 
modulations shall have the following characteristics:
    (1) For broadband boosters operating in the frequency range of 
2.150-2.160/2 GHz, the maximum out-of-band power shall be attenuated at 
the upper and lower channel edges forming the band edges by at least 25 
dB relative to the licensed analog peak visual carrier or digital 
average power level (or, when subchannels are used, the appropriately 
adjusted value based on upon the ratio of the channel-to-subchannel 
bandwidths), then linearly sloping from that level to at least 40 dB of 
attenuation at 0.25 MHz above and below the band edges, then linearly 
sloping from that level to at least 60 dB of attenuation at 3.0 MHz 
above and below the band edges, and attenuated at least 60 dB at all 
other frequencies.
    (2) For broadband boosters operating in the frequency range of 
2.500-2.690 GHz, the maximum out-of-band power shall be attenuated at 
the upper and lower channel edges forming the band edges by at least 25 
dB relative to the licensed analog peak visual carrier or digital 
average power level (or, when subchannels are used, the appropriately 
adjusted value based on upon the ratio of the channel-to-subchannel 
bandwidths), then linearly sloping from that level to at least 40 dB of 
attenuation at 0.25 MHz above and below the band edges, then linearly 
sloping from that level to at least 50 dB of attenuation at 3.0 MHz 
above and below the band edges, then linearly sloping from that level to 
at least 60 dB of attenuation at 20 MHz above and below the band edges, 
and attenuated at least 60 dB at all other frequencies.
    (3) Within unoccupied channels in the frequency range of 2.500-2.690 
GHz, the maximum out-of-band power shall be attenuated at the upper and 
lower channel edges of an unoccupied channel by at least 25 dB relative 
to the licensed analog peak visual carrier power level or digital 
average power level of the occupied channels (or, when subchannels or 
125 kHz channels are used, the appropriately adjusted value based upon 
the ratio of the channel-to-subchannel bandwidths), then linearly 
sloping from that level to at least 40 dB of attenuation at 0.25 MHz 
above and below the occupied channel edges, then linearly sloping from 
that level to at least 50 dB of attenuation at 3.0 MHz above and below 
the occupied channel edges, and attenuated at least 50 dB at all other 
unoccupied frequencies.
    (c) Boosters operating with an EIRP less than -9 dBW per 6 MHz 
channel shall have no particular out-of-band power attenuation 
requirement, except that if they cause harmful interference, their 
operation shall be terminated within 2 hours of notification by the 
Commission until the interference can be cured.
    (d) The maximum out-of-band power of an MDS response station using 
all or part of a 6 MHz channel, employing digital modulation and 
transmitting with an EIRP greater than -6 dBW per 6 MHz channel shall be 
attenuated (as measured in accordance with paragraph (e) of this 
section) at the 6 MHz channel edges at least 25 dB relative to the 
average 6 MHz channel power level, then attenuated along a linear slope 
to at least 40 dB at 250 kHz beyond the nearest channel edge, then 
attenuated along a linear slope from that level to at least 60 dB at 3 
MHz above the upper and below the lower licensed channel edges, and 
attenuated at least 60 dB at all other frequencies. The maximum out-of-
band power of an MDS response station using all or part of a 6 MHz 
channel, employing digital modulation and transmitting with an EIRP no 
greater than -6 dBW per 6 MHz channel shall be attenuated (as measured 
in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section) at the channel edges 
at least 25 dB relative to the average 6 MHz channel transmitter output 
power level (P), then attenuated along a linear slope to at least 40 dB 
or 33+10log(P) dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation, at 250 kHz 
beyond the nearest channel edge, then attenuated along a linear slope 
from that level to at least 60 dB or 43+10log(P) dB, whichever is the 
lesser attenuation, at 3 MHz above the upper and below the lower 
licensed channel edges, and attenuated at least 60 dB or 43+10log(P) dB, 
whichever is the lesser attenuation, at all other frequencies.

[[Page 78]]

Where MDS response stations with digital modulation utilize all or part 
of more than one contiguous 6 MHz channel to form a larger channel 
(e.g., a channel of width 12 MHz), the above-specified attenuations 
shall be applied only at the upper and lower edges of the overall 
combined channel. Notwithstanding these provisions, should harmful 
interference occur as a result of emissions outside the assigned 
channel(s), additional attenuation may be required by the Commission.
    (e) In measuring compliance with the out-of-band emissions 
limitations, the licensee shall employ one of two methods in each 
instance: (1) absolute power measurement of the average signal power 
with one instrument, with measurement of the spectral attenuation on a 
separate instrument; or (2) relative measurement of both the average 
power and the spectral attenuation on a single instrument. The formula 
for absolute power measurements is to be used when the average signal 
power is found using a separate instrument, such as a power meter; the 
formula gives the amount by which the measured power value is to be 
attenuated to find the absolute power value to be used on the spectrum 
analyzer or equivalent instrument at the spectral point of concern. The 
formula for relative power measurements is to be used when the average 
signal power is found using the same instrument as used to measure the 
attenuation at the specified spectral points, and allows different 
resolution bandwidths to be applied to the two parts of the measurement; 
the formula gives the required amplitude separation (in dB) between the 
flat top of the (digital) signal and the point of concern.
    For absolute power measurements:

Attenuation in dB (below channel power) = A + 10<INF>log</INF> 
    (C<INF>BW</INF> / R<INF>Bw</INF>)

    For relative power measurements:

Attenuation in dB (below flat top) = A + 10<INF>log</INF> 
    (R<INF>BW1</INF> / R<INF>BW2</INF>)

Where:

A = Attenuation specified for spectral point (e.g., 25, 35, 40, 60 dB)
C<INF>BW</INF> = Channel bandwidth (for absolute power measurements)
R<INF>BW</INF> = Resolution bandwidth (for absolute power measurements)
R<INF>BW1</INF> = Resolution bandwidth for flat top measurement 
(relative)
R<INF>BW2</INF> = Resolution bandwidth for spectral point measurement 
(relative)

Sec. 21.909  MDS response stations.

    (a) An MDS response station is authorized to provide communication 
by voice, video and/or data signals with its associated MDS response 
station hub or MDS station. An MDS response station may be operated only 
by the licensee of an MDS station, by any lessee of the MDS station or 
response station hub, or by a subscriber of either. The authorized 
channel may be divided to provide distinct subchannels for each of more 
than one response station, provided that digital modulation is employed 
and the aggregate power does not exceed the authorized power for the 
channel. An MDS response station may also, jointly with other licensees, 
transmit utilizing bandwidth in excess of that authorized to the 
station, provided that digital modulation is employed, all power 
spectral density requirements set forth in this part are met, and the 
out-of-band emissions restrictions set forth in Sec. 21.908(b) or 
paragraph (j) of this section are complied with. When a 125 kHz channel 
is employed, the specific channel which may be used by the response 
station is determined in accordance with Secs. 21.901 and 74.939(j) of 
this chapter.
    (b) MDS response stations that utilize the 2150-2162 MHz band, the 
2500-2686 MHz band, and/or the 125 kHz channels may be installed and 
operated without an individual license, to communicate with a response 
station hub, provided that the conditions set forth in paragraph (g) of 
this section are met and that the MDS response stations' technical 
parameters are consistent with all applicable rules in this part and 
with the terms and conditions set out in the Commission's Declaratory 
Ruling and Order, 11 FCC Rcd 18839 (1996).
    (c) An applicant for a response station hub license, or for 
modification thereto where not subject to Sec. 21.41 or Sec. 21.42, 
shall:

[[Page 79]]

    (1) File FCC Form 331 with Mellon Bank, and certify on that form 
that it has complied with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) and (d) 
of this section and that the interference data submitted under paragraph 
(d) of this section is complete and accurate. Failure to certify 
compliance and to comply completely with the requirements of paragraphs 
(c)(2) and (d) of this section shall result in dismissal of the 
application or revocation of the response station hub license, and may 
result in imposition of a monetary forfeiture; and
    (2) Submit the following (see Sec. 21.902(m) for permissible formats 
and media) to the Commission's Reference Room:
    (i) The data files required by Appendix D to the Report and Order in 
MM Docket 97-217, FCC 98-231, ``Methods For Predicting Interference From 
Response Station Transmitters And To Response Station Hubs And For 
Supplying Data on Response Station Systems''; and
    (ii) The demonstrations and certifications required by paragraph (d) 
of this section.
    (d) An applicant for a response station hub license shall prepare 
the following:
    (1) A demonstration describing the system channel plan, to the 
extent that such information is not contained in the data file required 
in (c)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (2) A demonstration that:
    (i) The proposed response station hub is within a protected service 
area, as defined in Sec. 21.902(d) or Sec. 21.933, to which the 
applicant is entitled either:
    (A) by virtue of its being the licensee of an incumbent MDS station 
whose channels are being converted for MDS response station use; or
    (B) by virtue of its holding a Basic Trading Area or Partitioned 
Service Area authorization. In the case of an application for response 
stations to utilize one or more of the 125 kHz response channels, such 
demonstration shall establish that the response station hub is within 
the protected service area of the station authorized to utilize the 
associated E-Group or F-Group channel(s); and
    (ii) The entire proposed response service area is within a protected 
service area to which the applicant is entitled either (A) by virtue of 
its being the licensee of an incumbent MDS station whose channels are 
being converted for MDS response station use; or (B) by virtue of its 
holding a Basic Trading Area or Partitioned Service Area authorization. 
In the alternative, the applicant may demonstrate that the licensee 
entitled to any cochannel protected service area which is overlapped by 
the proposed response service area has consented to such overlap. In the 
case of an application for response stations to utilize one or more of 
the 125 kHz response channels, such demonstration shall establish that 
the response service area is entirely within the protected service area 
of the station authorized to utilize the associated E-Group or F-Group 
channel(s), or, in the alternative, that the licensee entitled to any 
cochannel protected service area which is overlapped by the proposed 
response service area has consented to such overlap; and
    (iii) The combined signals of all simultaneously operating MDS 
response stations within all response service areas and oriented to 
transmit towards their respective response station hubs, and all 
cochannel MDS stations and booster stations licensed to or applied for 
by the applicant will not generate a power flux density in excess of -73 
dBW/m<SUP>2</SUP> (or the appropriately adjusted value based on the 
actual bandwidth used if other than 6 MHz, see Sec. 21.902(b)(7)(i)) 
outside the boundaries of the applicant's protected service area, as 
measured at locations for which there is an unobstructed signal path, 
except to the extent that consent of affected licensees has been 
obtained or consents have been granted pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(ii) 
of this section to an extension of the response service area beyond the 
boundaries of the protected service area; and
    (iv) The combined signals of all simultaneously operating MDS 
response stations within all response service areas and oriented to 
transmit towards their respective response station hubs, and all 
cochannel MDS stations and booster stations licensed to or applied for 
by the applicant, will result in a desired to undesired signal ratio of

response station hub; and
    (C) at any registered receive site of any authorized or previously-
proposed cochannel ITFS station or booster station located within 160.94 
km (100 miles) of the proposed response station hub, or, in the 
alternative, that the licensee of or applicant for such cochannel 
station or hub consents to the application; and
    (v) The combined signals of all simultaneously operating MDS 
response stations within all response service areas and oriented to 
transmit towards their respective response station hubs, and all 
cochannel MDS stations and booster stations licensed to or applied for 
by the applicant, will result in a desired to undesired signal ratio of 
at least 0 dB (or the appropriately adjusted value based on the actual 
bandwidth used if other than 6 MHz, see Sec. 21.902(b)(7)(iii)):
    (A) within the protected service area of any authorized or 
previously-proposed adjacent channel MDS or ITFS station with a 56.33 km 
(35 mile) protected service area with center coordinates located within 
160.94 km (100 miles) of the proposed response station hub; and
    (B) within the booster service area of any adjacent channel booster 
station entitled to such protection pursuant to Secs. 21.913(f) or 
74.985(f) of this chapter and located within 160.94 km (100 miles) of 
the proposed response station hub; and
    (C) at any registered receive site of any authorized or previously-
proposed adjacent channel ITFS station or booster station located within 
160.94 km (100 miles) of the proposed response station hub, or, in the 
alternative, that the licensee of or applicant for such adjacent channel 
station or hub consents to the application; and
    (vi) The combined signals of all simultaneously operating MDS 
response stations within all response service areas and oriented to 
transmit towards their respective response station hub and all cochannel 
MDS stations and booster stations licensed to or applied for by the 
applicant will comply with the requirements of paragraph (i) of this 
section and Sec. 74.939(i) of this chapter.
    (3) A certification that the application has been served upon

with a protected service area that adjoins the applicant's protected 
service area;
    (iii) the holder of a cochannel or adjacent channel authorization 
for any BTA or PSA inside whose boundaries are locations for which there 
is an unobstructed signal path for combined signals from within the 
response station hub applicant's protected service area; and
    (iv) every licensee of, or applicant for, any cochannel or adjacent 
channel, authorized or previously-proposed, incumbent MDS station with a 
56.33 km (35 mile) protected service area with center coordinates 
located within 160.94 km (100 miles) of the proposed response station 
hub;

miles) of the proposed response station hub; and
    (vi) every licensee of any non-cochannel or non-adjacent channel 
ITFS station (including any booster station) with one or more registered 
receive sites in, or within 1960 feet of the proposed response station 
service area.
    (e) Except as set forth in Sec. 21.27(d), applications for response 
station hub licenses may be filed at any time. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of

[[Page 81]]

part 21 (including Sec. 21.31), applications for response station hub 
licenses meeting the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section shall 
cut-off applications that are filed on a subsequent day for facilities 
that would cause harmful electromagnetic interference to the proposed 
response station hubs. A response station hub shall not be entitled to 
protection from interference caused by facilities proposed on or prior 
to the day the application for the response station hub license is 
filed. Response stations shall not be required to protect from 
interference facilities proposed on or after the day the application for 
the response station hub license is filed.
    (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 21.30(b)(4) and except as 
set forth in Sec. 21.27(d), any petition to deny an application for a 
response station hub license shall be filed no later than the sixtieth 
(60th) day after the date of public notice announcing the filing of such 
application or major amendment thereto. Notwithstanding Sec. 21.31 and 
except as provided in Sec. 21.27(d), an application for a response 
station hub license that meets the requirements of this section shall be 
granted on the sixty-first (61st) day after the Commission shall have 
given public notice of the acceptance for filing of it, or of a major 
amendment to it if such major amendment has been filed, unless prior to 
such date either a party in interest timely files a formal petition to 
deny or for other relief pursuant to Sec. 21.30(a), or the Commission 
notifies the applicant that its application will not be granted. Where 
an application is granted pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, 
the conditional licensee or licensee shall maintain a copy of the 
application at the response station hub until such time as the 
Commission issues a response station hub license.
    (g) An MDS response station hub license shall be conditioned upon 
compliance with the following:
    (1) No MDS response station shall be located beyond the response 
service area of the response station hub with which it communicates; and
    (2) No MDS response station shall operate with a transmitter output 
power in excess of 2 watts; and
    (3) No response station shall operate with an EIRP in excess of that 
specified in the application for the response station hub for the 
particular regional class of characteristics with which the response 
station is associated, and such response station shall not operate with 
an EIRP in excess of 33 dBW + 10log(X/6) dBW, where X is the channel 
width in MHz, and
    (4) Each response station shall employ a transmission antenna 
oriented towards the response station hub with which the response 
station communicates and such antenna shall be no less directive than 
the worst-case outer envelope pattern specified in the application for 
the response station hub for the regional class of characteristics with 
which the response station is associated; and
    (5) The combined out-of-band emissions of all response stations 
using all or part of one or multiple contiguous 6 MHz channels and 
employing digital modulation shall comply with Sec. 21.908(d). The 
combined out-of-band emissions of all response stations using all or 
part of one or multiple contiguous 125 kHz channels shall comply with 
paragraph (j) of this section. However, should harmful interference 
occur as a result of emissions outside the assigned channel, additional 
attenuation may be required; and
    (6) The response stations transmitting simultaneously at any given 
time within any given region of the response service area utilized for 
purposes of analyzing the potential for interference by response 
stations shall conform to the numerical limits for each class of 
response station proposed in the application for the response station 
hub license. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a response station hub 
licensee subchannelizes pursuant to Sec. 21.909(a) and limits the 
maximum EIRP emitted by any individual response station proportionately 
to the fraction of the channel that the response station occupies, the 
licensee may operate simultaneously on each subchannel the number of 
response stations specified in the license. Moreover, the licensee of a 
response station hub may alter the number of response stations of any 
class operated simultaneously in a given region, without

[[Page 82]]

prior Commission authorization, provided that the licensee:
    (i) Files with the Commission (see Sec. 21.902(m) for permissible 
format(s) and media) a demonstration indicating the number of response 
stations of such class(es) to be operated simultaneously in such region 
and a certification that it has complied with the requirements of 
paragraphs (g)(6)(ii) and (iii) of this section and that the 
interference data submitted pursuant to paragraph (g)(6)(ii) is complete 
and accurate; and
    (ii) Provides the Commission's Reference Room (see Sec. 21.902(m) 
for permissible formats and media) with an update of the previously-
filed response station data and with a demonstration that such 
alteration will not result in any increase in interference to the 
protected service area or protected receive sites of any existing or 
previously-proposed, cochannel or adjacent channel MDS or ITFS station 
or booster station, to the protected service area of any MDS Basic 
Trading Area or Partitioned Service Area licensee entitled to protection 
pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, or to any existing or 
previously-proposed, cochannel or adjacent channel response station hub, 
or response station under Sec. 21.949 or Sec. 74.949 of this chapter; or 
that the applicant for or licensee of such facility has consented to 
such interference; and
    (iii) Serves a copy of such demonstration and certification upon 
each party entitled to be served pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section; and
    (7) Where an application is granted under this section, if a 
facility operated pursuant to that grant causes harmful, unauthorized 
interference to any cochannel or adjacent channel facility, it must 
promptly remedy the interference or immediately cease operations of the 
interfering facility, regardless of whether any petitions to deny or for 
other relief were filed against the application during the application 
process. The burden of proving that a facility operated under this 
section is not causing harmful, unauthorized interference lies on the 
licensee of the alleged interfering facility, following the filing of a 
documented complaint of interference by an affected party; and
    (8) In the event any MDS or ITFS receive site suffers interference 
due to block downconverter overload, the licensee of each non-co/
adjacent response station hub with a response service area within five 
miles of such receive site shall cooperate in good faith to 
expeditiously identify the source of the interference. Each licensee of 
a response station hub with an associated response station contributing 
to such interference shall bear the joint and several obligation to 
promptly remedy all block downconverter overload interference at any 
ITFS registered receive site or at any receive site within an MDS or 
ITFS protected service area applied for prior to the submission of the 
application for the response station hub license, regardless of whether 
the receive site suffering the interference was constructed prior to or 
after the construction of the response station(s) causing the 
downconverter overload; provided, however, that the licensee of the 
registered ITFS receive site or the MDS or ITFS protected service area 
must cooperate fully and in good faith with efforts by the response 
station hub licensee to prevent interference before constructing 
response stations and/or to remedy interference that may occur. In the 
event that the associated response station(s) of more than one response 
station hub licensee contribute(s) to block downconverter interference 
at an MDS or ITFS receive site, such hub licensees shall cooperate in 
good faith to remedy promptly the interference.
    (h) Applicants must comply with Part 17 of this chapter concerning 
notification to the Federal Aviation Administration of proposed antenna 
construction or alteration for all hub stations and associated response 
stations.
    (i) Response station hubs shall be protected from cochannel and 
adjacent channel interference in accordance with the following criteria:
    (1) An applicant for any new or modified MDS or ITFS station 
(including any high-power booster station or response station hub) shall 
be required to demonstrate interference protection to a response station 
hub within 160.94 km (100 miles) of the proposed facilities. In

[[Page 83]]

lieu of the interference protection requirements set forth in 
Secs. 21.902(b)(3) through (b)(5), 21.938(b)(1) and (2) and (c), and 
74.903 of this chapter, such demonstration shall establish that the 
proposed facility will not increase the effective power flux density of 
the undesired signals generated by the proposed facility and any 
associated main stations, booster stations or response stations at the 
response station hub antenna for any sector. In lieu of the foregoing, 
an applicant for a new MDS or ITFS main station license or for a new or 
modified response station hub or booster license may demonstrate that 
the facility will not increase the noise floor at a reception antenna of 
the response station hub by more than 1 dB for cochannel signals and 45 
dB for adjacent channel signals, provided that:
    (i) The entity submitting the application may only invoke this 
alternative once per response station hub reception sector; or
    (ii) The licensee of the affected response station hub may consent 
to receive a certain amount of interference at its hub.
    (2) Commencing upon the filing of an application for an MDS response 
station hub license and until such time as the application is dismissed 
or denied or, if the application is granted, a certification of 
completion of construction is filed, the MDS station whose channels are 
being utilized shall be entitled both to interference protection 
pursuant to Secs. 21.902(b)(3) through (b)(5), 21.938(b)(1) and (2) and 
(c), and 74.903 of this chapter, and to protection of the response 
station hub pursuant to the preceding paragraph. Unless the application 
for the response station hub license specifies that the same frequencies 
also will be employed for digital and/or analog point-to-multipoint 
transmissions by MDS stations and/or MDS booster stations, upon the 
filing of a certification of completion of construction of an MDS 
response station hub where the channels of an MDS station are being 
utilized as response station transmit frequencies, the MDS station whose 
channels are being utilized for response station transmissions shall no 
longer be entitled to interference protection pursuant to 
Secs. 21.902(b)(3) through (b)(5), 21.938(b)(1) and (2) and (c), and 
74.903 of this chapter within the response service area with regard to 
any portion of any 6 MHz channel employed solely for response station 
communications. Upon the certification of completion of construction of 
an MDS response station hub where the channels of an MDS station are 
being utilized for response station transmissions and the application 
for the response station hub license specifies that the same frequencies 
will be employed for point-to-multipoint transmissions, the MDS station 
whose channels are being utilized shall be entitled both to interference 
protection pursuant to Secs. 21.902(b)(3) through (b)(5), 21.938(b)(1) 
and (2) and (c), and 74.903 of this chapter, and to protection of the 
response station hub pursuant to the preceding provisions of this 
paragraph.
    (j) 125 kHz wide response channels shall be subject to the following 
requirements: The 125 kHz wide channel shall be centered at the assigned 
frequency. If amplitude modulation is used, the carrier shall not be 
modulated in excess of 100%. If frequency modulation is used, the 
deviation shall not exceed <plus-minus>25 kHz. Any emissions outside the 
channel shall be attenuated at the channel edges at least 35 dB below 
peak output power when analog modulation is employed or 35 dB below 
licensed average output power when digital modulation is employed (or, 
when subchannels are used, the appropriately adjusted value based upon 
the ratio of the channel-to-subchannel bandwidths). Any emissions more 
than 125 kHz from either channel edge, including harmonics, shall be 
attenuated at least 60 dB below peak output power when analog modulation 
is employed, or at least 60 dB below licensed average output power when 
digital modulation is employed (or, when subchannels are used, the 
appropriately adjusted value based upon the ratio of the channel-to-
subchannel bandwidths). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in situations 
where adjacent channel licensees jointly transmit over more than one 
contiguous channel utilizing digital modulation, the maximum out-of-band 
power shall be attenuated at the edges of those combined channels at 
least 35 dB

[[Page 84]]

relative to the licensed average power level of each channel. Emissions 
more than 125 kHz from either edge of the combined channels, including 
harmonics, shall be attenuated at least 60 dB below peak analog power or 
average digital power of each channel, as appropriate.
    (k) A response station may be operated unattended. The overall 
performance of the response station transmitter shall be checked by the 
hub licensee as often as necessary to ensure that it is functioning in 
accordance with the requirements of the Commission's rules. The licensee 
of a response station hub is responsible for the proper operation of all 
associated response station transmitters. Each response station hub 
licensee is responsible for maintaining, and making available to the 
Commission upon request, a list containing all customer names and 
addresses, plus the technical parameters (EIRP, emission, bandwidth, 
antenna pattern/ height/ orientation/ polarization) pertinent to each 
class of response station within the response service area.
    (l) The transmitting apparatus employed at MDS response stations 
shall have received type certification.
    (m) An MDS response station shall be operated only when engaged in 
communications with its associated MDS response station hub or MDS 
station or booster station, or for necessary equipment or system tests 
and adjustments. Upon initial installation, and upon relocation and 
reinstallation, a response station transmitter shall be incapable of 
emitting radiation unless, and until, it has been activated by reception 
of a signal from the associated MDS station or booster station. A hub 
station licensee shall be capable of remotely de-activating any and all 
response station transmitters within its RSA by means of signals from 
the associated MDS station or booster station. Radiation of an 
unmodulated carrier and other unnecessary transmissions are forbidden.
    (n) All response stations utilizing an EIRP greater than 18 dBW 
shall be installed by the associated hub licensee or by the licensee's 
employees or agents. For the purposes of this section, all EIRP dBW 
values assume the use of a 6 MHz channel. For channel bandwidths other 
than 6 MHz, the EIRP dBW values should be adjusted up (channel >6 MHz) 
or down (channel 6 MHz) by 10 log(X/6) dBW, where X is the channel width 
in MHz. For response stations located within 1960 feet of an ITFS 
receive site registered and built prior to the filing of the application 
for the hub station license, the hub licensee must notify the licensee 
of the ITFS receive site at least one business day prior to the 
activation of these response stations. The notification must contain, 
for each response station to be activated, the following information: 
name and telephone number of a contact person who will be responsible 
for coordinating the resolution of any interference problems; street 
address; geographic coordinates to the nearest second; channels/
subchannels (transmit only); and transmit antenna pattern, EIRP, 
orientation and height AMSL. (If transmit antenna pattern, EIRP, 
orientation or height AMSL are not known with specificity at the time of 
notification, the hub licensee may, instead, specify the worst-case 
values for the class of response station being activated.) Such notice 
to the ITFS licensee shall be given in writing by certified mail unless 
the ITFS licensee has requested delivery by email or facsimile. The ITFS 
licensee may waive the notification requirement on a site-specific basis 
or on a system-wide basis. The notification provisions of this section 
shall not apply if:
    (1) The response station will operate at an EIRP no greater than -6 
dBW; or
    (2) The response station will operate at an EIRP greater than -6 dBW 
and no more than 18 dBW and:
    (i) The channels being received at the ITFS site are neither the 
same as, nor directly adjacent to, the channel(s) to be transmitted from 
the response station; and
    (ii) The hub station licensee has replaced, at its expense, the 
frequency downconverters used at all ITFS receive sites registered and 
constructed prior to the filing of the hub station application which are 
within 1960 feet of the hub station's response service area; and

[[Page 85]]

    (iii) The downconverters, at a minimum, conform to the following 
specifications:
    (A) A frequency of operation covering the 2150-2162 MHz band or the 
2500-2686 MHz band; and
    (B) A third-order intercept point of 30 dBm; and
    (C) A conversion gain of 32 dB, or the same conversion gain as the 
existing ITFS downconverter, whichever is least; and
    (D) A noise figure of no greater than 2.5 dB, or no more than 1 dB 
greater than the noise figure of the existing ITFS downconverter, 
whichever is greater; and
    (iv) The proposal to upgrade the ITFS downconverter was made in 
writing and served upon the affected ITFS licensee, conditional licensee 
or applicant at the same time the application for the response station 
hub license was served on cochannel and adjacent channel ITFS parties 
and no objection was made within the 60-day period allowed for petitions 
to deny the hub station application.
    (o) Interference calculations shall be performed in accordance with 
Appendix D (as amended) to the Report and Order in MM Docket 97-217, FCC 
98-231, ``Methods For Predicting Interference From Response Station 
Transmitters and To Response Station Hubs and For Supplying Data on 
Response Station Systems.'' (Note: This document is subject to change 
and will be updated/amended as needed without prior notification. 
Applicants should always utilize the most current version of the 
document, as found at the Commission's internet web site, http://
www.fcc.gov/mmb/vsd/files/methodology.doc). Compliance with out-of-band 
emission limitations shall be established in accordance with 
Sec. 21.908(e).

Sec. 21.910  Special procedures for discontinuance, reduction or impairment of service by common carrier licensees.

    (a) Any licensee who has elected common carrier status and who seeks 
to discontinue service on a common carrier basis and instead provide 
service on a non-common carrier basis, or who otherwise intends to 
reduce or impair service the carrier shall notify all affected customers 
of the planned discontinuance, reduction or impairment on or before the 
date that the licensee provides notice to the Commission pursuant to 
Sec. 21.903(d).
    (b) Notice shall be in writing to each affected customer unless the 
Commission authorizes in advance, for good cause shown, another form of 
notice. Notice shall include the following:
    (1) Name and address of carrier; and
    (2) Date of planned service discontinuance, reduction or impairment; 
and
    (3) Points or geographic areas of service affected; and
    (4) How many and which channels are affected.

Sec. 21.911  Annual reports.

    (a) No later than March 1 of each year for the preceding calendar 
year, each licensee in the Multipoint Distribution Service shall file 
with the Commission two copies of a report which must include the 
following:
    (1) Name and address of licensee;
    (2) Station(s) call letters and primary geographic service area(s);
    (3) The following statistical information, preferably in tabular 
form, for the licensee's station (and each channel thereof);
    (i) The total number of separate subscribers served during the 
calendar year;
    (ii) The total hours of transmission service rendered during the 
calendar year to all subscribers;
    (iii) The total hours of transmission service rendered during the 
calendar year in the following categories: entertainment, education and 
training, public service, data transmission, and other services;
    (iv) A list of each period of time during the calendar year in which 
a station was not operational due to removal or alteration of equipment 
or facilities; and
    (v) A list of each period of time during the calendar year in which 
the station rendered no service as authorized, if the time period was a 
consecutive period longer than 48 hours.

[[Page 86]]

    (b) The licensee, by an appropriate corporate officer, controlling 
partner, or individual proprietor, must certify this report as to the 
accuracy and completeness of the information contained therein.
    (c) A copy of each year's report shall be retained in the principal 
office of the licensee and shall be readily available to the public for 
reference and inspection.

<R05>
Sec. 21.912  Cable television company eligibility requirements and MDS/cable cross-ownership.

    (a) Nothwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 21.900 of this part, 
initial or modified authorizations for stations in the 2150-2162 MHz and 
2596-2680 MHz frequency bands may not be granted to a cable operator if 
a portion of the Multipoint Distribution Service (MDS) station's 
protected services area is within the portion of the franchise area 
actually served by the cable operator's cable system. No cable operator 
may acquire such authorization either directly, or indirectly through an 
affiliate owned operated, or controlled by or under common control with 
a cable operator.
    (b) No licensee of a station in this service may lease transmission 
time or capacity to a cable operator either directly, or indirectly 
through an affiliate owned, operated, controlled by, or under common 
control with a cable operator, if a portion of the Multipoint 
Distribution Service (MDS) station's protected services area is within 
the portion of the franchise area actually served by the cable 
operator's cable system.
    (c) Applications for new stations, station modifications, 
assignments or transfers of control by cable operators of stations in 
the 2150-2162 MHz and 2596-2680 MHz frequency bands shall include a 
showing that no portion of the protected service area of the MDS station 
is within the portion of the franchise area actually served by the cable 
operator's cable system, or of any entity indirectly affiliated, owned, 
operated, controlled by, or under common control with the cable 
operator.

    Note 1: In applying the provisions of this section, ownership and 
other interests in MDS licensees or cable television systems will be 
attributed to their holders and deemed cognizable pursuant to the 
following criteria:

    (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, partnership and direct 
ownership interests and any voting stock interest amounting to 5% or 
more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate MDS licensee or 
cable television system will be cognizable;
    (b) No minority voting stock interest will be cognizable if there is 
a single holder of more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock of the 
corporate MDS licensee or cable television system in which the minority 
interest is held;
    (c) Investment companies, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3, insurance 
companies and banks holding stock through their trust departments in 
trust accounts will be considered to have a cognizable interest only if 
they hold 20% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate MDS 
licensee or cable television system, or if any of the officers or 
directors of the MDS licensee or cable television system are 
representatives of the investment company, insurance company or bank 
concerned. Holdings by a bank or insurance company will be aggregated if 
the bank or insurance company has any right to determine how the stock 
will be voted. Holdings by investment companies will be aggregated if 
under common management.
    (d) Attribution of ownership interests in an MDS licensee or cable 
television system that are held indirectly by any party through one or 
more intervening corporations will be determined by successive 
multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in the 
vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution 
benchmark to the resulting product, except that wherever the ownership 
percentage for any link in the chain exceeds 50%, it shall not be 
included for purposes of this multiplication. [For example, if A owns 
10% of company X, which owns 60% of company Y, which owns 25% of 
``Licensee,'' then X's interest in ``Licensee'' would be 25% (the same 
as Y's interest since X's interest in Y exceeds 50%), and A's interest 
in ``Licensee'' would be 2.5% (0.1 x 0.25). Under the 5% attribution 
benchmark, X's interest in ``Licensee'' would be cognizable, while A's 
interest would not be cognizable.]
    (e) Voting stock interests held in trust shall be attributed to any 
person who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, to any person 
who has the sole power to sell such stock, and to any person who has the 
right to revoke the trust at will or to replace the trustee at will. If 
the trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business 
relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary, the grantor or 
beneficiary, as appropriate, will be attributed with the stock interests 
held in

[[Page 87]]

trust. An otherwise qualified trust will be ineffective to insulate the 
grantor or beneficiary from attribution with the trust's assets unless 
all voting stock interests held by the grantor or beneficiary in the 
relevant MDS licensee or cable television system are subject to said 
trust.
    (f) Subject to paragraph (j) of this Note, holders of non-voting 
stock shall not be attributed an interest in the issuing entity. Subject 
to paragraph (j) of this Note, holders of debt and instruments such as 
warrants, convertible debentures, options or other non-voting interests 
with rights of conversion to voting interests shall not be attributed 
unless and until conversion is effected.
    (g)(1) A limited partnership interest shall be attributed to a 
limited partner unless that partner is not materially involved, directly 
or indirectly, in the management or operation of the MDS or cable 
television activities of the partnership and the licensee or system so 
certifies. An interest in a Limited Liability Company (``LLC'') or 
Registered Limited Liability Partnership (``RLLP'') shall be attributed 
to the interest holder unless that interest holder is not materially 
involved, directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of the 
MDS or cable television activities of the partnership and the licensee 
or system so certifies.
    (2) In order for a licensee or system that is a limited partnership 
to make the certification set forth in paragraph (g)(1) of this Note, it 
must verify that the partnership agreement or certificate of limited 
partnership, with respect to the particular limited partner exempt from 
attribution, establishes that the exempt limited partner has no material 
involvement, directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of 
the MDS or cable television activities of the partnership. In order for 
a licensee or system that is an LLC or RLLP to make the certification 
set forth in paragraph (g)(2) of this Note, it must verify that the 
organizational document, with respect to the particular interest holder 
exempt from attribution, establishes that the exempt interest holder has 
no material involvement, directly or indirectly, in the management or 
operation of the MDS or cable television activities of the LLC or RLLP. 
The criteria which would assume adequate insulation for purposes of this 
certification are described in the Memorandum Opinion and Order in MM 
Docket No. 83-46, 50 FR 27438, July 3, 1985, as modified on 
reconsideration in the Memorandum Opinion and Order in MM Docket No. 83-
46, 52 FR 1630, January 15, 1987. Irrespective of the terms of the 
certificate of limited partnership or partnership agreement, or other 
organizational document in the case of an LLC or RLLP, however, no such 
certification shall be made if the individual or entity making the 
certification has actual knowledge of any material involvement of the 
limited partners, or other interest holders in the case of an LLC or 
RLLP, in the management or operation of the MDS or cable television 
businesses of the partnership or LLC or RLLP.
    (3) In the case of an LLC or RLLP, the licensee or system seeking 
installation shall certify, in addition, that the relevant state statute 
authorizing LLCs permits an LLC member to insulate itself as required by 
our criteria.
    (h) Officers and directors of an MDS licensee or cable television 
system are considered to have a cognizable interest in the entity with 
which they are so associated. If any such entity engages in businesses 
in addition to its primary business of MDS or cable television service, 
it may request the Commission to waive attribution for any officer or 
director whose duties and responsibilities are wholly unrelated to its 
primary business. The officers and directors of a parent company of an 
MDS licensee or cable television system, with an attributable interest 
in any such subsidiary entity, shall be deemed to have a cognizable 
interest in the subsidiary unless the duties and responsibilities of the 
officer or director involved are wholly unrelated to the MDS licensee or 
cable television system subsidiary, and a statement properly documenting 
this fact is submitted to the Commission. [This statement may be 
included on the Licensee Qualification Report.] The officers and 
directors of a sister corporation of an MDS licensee or cable television 
system shall not be attributed with ownership of these entities by 
virtue of such status.
    (i) Discrete ownership interests will be aggregated in determining 
whether or not an interest is cognizable under this section. An 
individual or entity will be deemed to have a cognizable investment if:
    (1) The sum of the interests held by or through ``passive 
investors'' is equal to or exceeds 20 percent; or
    (2) The sum of the interests other than those held by or through 
``passive investors'' is equal to or exceeds 5 percent; or
    (3) The sum of the interests computed under paragraph (i)(1) of this 
Note plus the sum of the interests computed under paragraph (i)(2) of 
this Note is equal to or exceeds 20 percent.
    (j) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b), (f), and (g) of this Note, the 
holder of an equity or debt interest or interests in an MDS licensee or 
cable television system subject to the MDS/cable cross-ownership rule 
(``interest holder'') shall have that interest attributed if:
    (1) the equity (including all stockholdings, whether voting or 
nonvoting, common or preferred) and debt interest or interests, in the 
aggregate, exceed 33 percent of the total asset value (all equity plus 
all debt) of that MDS licensee or cable television system; and

[[Page 88]]

    (2) the interest holder also holds an interest in an MDS licensee or 
cable television system that is attributable under paragraphs of this 
Note other than this paragraph (j) and which operates in any portion of 
the franchise area served by that cable operator's cable system.
    (k) The term ``area served by a cable system'' means any area 
actually passed by the cable operator's cable system and which can be 
connected for a standard connection fee.
    (l) As used in this section ``cable operator'' shall have the same 
definition as in Sec. 76.5 of this chapter.
    Note 2: The Commission will entertain requests to waive the 
restrictions in paragraph (a) of this section where necessary to ensure 
that all significant portions of the franchise area are able to obtain 
multichannel video service. Such waiver requests should be filed in 
accordance with special relief procedures set forth in Sec. 76.7.

    (d) The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section 
will not apply to one MDS or MMDS channel used to provide locally-
produced programming to cable headends. Locally-produced programming is 
programming produced in or near the cable operator's franchise area and 
not broadcast on a television station available within that franchise 
area. A cable operator will be permitted one MDS channel in an MMDS 
protected service area for this purpose, and no more than one MDS 
channel in an MMDS protected service area may be used by a cable 
television company or its affiliate or lessor pursuant to this 
paragraph. The licensee for a cable operator providing local programming 
pursuant to a lease must include in a notice filed with the Common 
Carrier Bureau a cover letter explicitly identifying itself or its 
lessee as a local cable operator and stating that the lease was executed 
to facilitate the provision of local programming. The first application 
or the first lease notification in an area filed with the Commission 
will be entitled to the exemption. The limitations on one MDS channel 
per party and per area include any cable/MDS operations grandfathered 
pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section or cable/ITFS operations 
grandfathered pursuant to Sec. 74.931(e) of this chapter.\1\ The cable 
operator must demonstrate in its MDS/MMDS application that the proposed 
local programming will be provided within one year from the date its 
application is granted. Local programming service pursuant to a lease 
must be provided within one year of the date of the lease or one year of 
grant of the licensee's application for the leased channel, whichever is 
later. If an MDS license for these purposes is granted and the 
programming is subsequently discontinued, the license will be 
automatically forfeited the day after local programming service is 
discontinued.
    (e) Applications filed by cable television companies, or affiliates, 
for MDS channels prior to February 8, 1990, will not be subject to the 
prohibitions of this section. Applications filed on February 8, 1990, or 
thereafter will be returned. Lease arrangements between cable and MDS 
entities for which a lease or a firm agreement was signed prior to 
February 8, 1990, will also not be subject to the prohibitions of this 
section. Leases between cable television companies, or affiliates, and 
MDS/MMDS station licensees, conditional licensees, or applicansts 
executed on February 8, 1990, or thereafter, are invalid.
    (1) Applications filed by cable operators, or affiliates, for MMDS 
channels prior to February 8, 1990, will not be subject to the 
prohibitions of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) 
below, applications filed on February 8, 1990, or thereafter will be 
returned. Lease arrangements between cable and MDS entities for which a 
lease or a firm agreement was signed prior to February 8, 1990, will 
also not be subject to the prohibitions of this section. Except as 
provided in paragraph (e)(2) below, leases between cable operators, or 
affiliates, and MDS/MMDS station licensees, conditional licensees, or 
applicants executed on or before February 8, 1990, or thereafter are 
invalid.
    (2) Applications filed by cable operators, or affiliates for MDS 
channels after February 8, 1990, and prior to October 5, 1992, will not 
be subject to the prohibition of this section, if, pursuant to the then 
existing overbuild or rural exceptions, the applications were allowed 
under the then existing cable/MMDs cross-ownership prohibitions. Lease 
arrangements between cable operators and MDS entities for which a lease 
or firm agreement was signed

[[Page 89]]

after February 8, 1990, and prior to October 5, 1992, will not be 
subject to the prohibitions of this section, if, pursuant to the then 
existing rural and overbuild exceptions, the lease arrangements were 
allowed.
    (3) The limitations on cable television ownership in this section do 
not apply to any cable operator in any franchise area in which a cable 
operator is subject to effective competition as determined under section 
623(l) of the Communications Act.
    (f) Interested persons may file a petition to deny an application 
filed pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section within 30 days after the 
Commission gives public notice that the application or petition has been 
filed. Petitions must be served upon the applicant, and must contain a 
complete and detailed showing, supported by affidavit, of any facts or 
considerations relied upon. The applicant may file an opposition to the 
petition to deny within 30 days after the filing of the petition, and 
must serve copies upon all persons who have filed petitions to deny. The 
Commission, after consideration of the pleadings, will determine whether 
the public interest, convenience and necessity would be served by the 
grant or denial of the application, in whole or in part. The Commission 
may specify other procedures, such as oral argument, evidentiary hearing 
or further written submission directed to particular aspects, as it 
deems appropriate.

    Notes: In these grandfathered situations, we will consider granting 
waivers to permit the use of a second MDS channel for the delivery of 
locally produced programming. Because allocating a second channel to 
this use would further reduce the channel capacity available for 
wireless cable service, we will require an applicant for the second 
channel to demonstrate, at a minimum, that it is ready and able to 
provide additional locally produced programming to area cable systems, 
and that no other practical means of delivering the programming are 
available to it. In considering requests for waiver, we will also take 
into account the competitive environment for the production and delivery 
of locally produced programming in the relevant markets.

Sec. 21.913  Signal booster stations.

    (a) An MDS booster station may reuse channels to repeat the signals 
of MDS stations or to originate signals on MDS channels. The aggregate 
power flux density generated by an MDS station and all associated signal 
booster stations and all simultaneously operating cochannel response 
stations may not exceed -73 dBW/m<SUP>2</SUP> (or the appropriately 
adjusted value based on the actual bandwidth used if other than 6 MHz, 
see Sec. 21.902(b)(7)(i)) at or beyond the boundary of the protected 
service area, as defined in Secs. 21.902(d) and 21.933, of the main MDS 
station whose channels are being reused, as measured at locations for 
which there is an unobstructed signal path, unless the consent of the 
affected cochannel licensee is obtained.
    (b) A licensee or conditional licensee of an MDS station, or the 
capacity lessee of such MDS station upon the written consent of the 
licensee or conditional licensee, may secure a license for a high power 
signal booster station that has a maximum EIRP in excess of -9 dBW + 10 
log(X/6) dBW where X is the channel width in MHz, if it complies with 
the out-of-band emission requirements of Sec. 21.908. Any licensee of a 
high-power booster station that is a capacity lessee shall, upon 
termination or expiration of the capacity lease, automatically assign 
the booster station license to the licensee or conditional licensee of 
the MDS station by and upon written notice to the Commission signed by 
the lessee and such licensee or conditional licensee. If upon 
termination or expiration of the capacity lease the licensee or 
conditional licensee no longer desires or needs the high-power booster 
station license, such a license must be returned to the Commission. The 
applicant for a high-power station, or for modification thereto, where 
not subject to Sec. 21.41 or Sec. 21.42, shall file FCC Form 331 with 
Mellon Bank, and certify on that form that the applicant has complied 
with

[[Page 90]]

the additional requirements of this paragraph (b), and that the 
interference data submitted under this paragraph is complete and 
accurate. Failure to certify compliance and to comply completely with 
the following requirements of this paragraph (b) shall result in 
dismissal of the application or revocation of the high-power MDS signal 
booster station license, and may result in imposition of a monetary 
forfeiture. The applicant is additionally required to submit (see 
Sec. 21.902(m) for permissible format(s) and media) to the Commission's 
Reference Room the following information:
    (1) A demonstration that the proposed signal booster station site is 
within the protected service area, as defined in Secs. 21.902(d) and 
21.933, of the MDS station whose channels are to be reused; and
    (2) A study which demonstrates that the aggregate power flux density 
of the MDS station and all associated booster stations and 
simultaneously operating cochannel response stations licensed to or 
applied for by the applicant, measured at or beyond the boundary of the 
protected service area of the MDS station whose channels are to be 
reused, does not exceed -73 dBW/m<SUP>2</SUP> (or the appropriately 
adjusted value based on the actual bandwidth used if other than 6 MHz, 
see Sec. 21.902(b)(7)(i)) at locations for which there is an 
unobstructed signal path, unless the consent of the affected licensees 
has been obtained; and
    (3) In lieu of the requirements of Sec. 21.902(c) and (i), a study 
which demonstrates that the proposed booster station will cause no 
harmful interference (as defined in Sec. 21.902(f)) to cochannel and 
adjacent channel, authorized or previously-proposed ITFS and MDS 
stations with protected service area center coordinates as specified in 
Sec. 21.902(d), to any authorized or previously-proposed response 
station hubs, booster stations or I channel stations associated with 
such ITFS and MDS stations, or to any ITFS receive sites registered as 
of September 17, 1998, within 160.94 kilometers (100 miles) of the 
proposed booster station's transmitter site. Such study shall consider 
the undesired signal levels generated by the proposed signal booster 
station, the main station, all other licensed or previously-proposed 
associated booster stations, and all simultaneously operating cochannel 
response stations licensed to or applied for by the applicant. In the 
alternative, a statement from the affected MDS or ITFS licensee or 
conditional licensee stating that it does not object to operation of the 
high-power MDS signal booster station may be submitted; and
    (4) A description of the booster service area; and
    (5) A demonstration either
    (i) That the booster service area is entirely within the protected 
service area to which the licensee of a station whose channels are being 
reused is entitled by virtue of its being the licensee of an incumbent 
MDS station, or by virtue of its holding a Basic Trading Area or 
Partitioned Service Area authorization; or
    (ii) That the licensee entitled to any cochannel protected service 
area which is overlapped by the proposed booster service area has 
consented to such overlap; and
    (6) A demonstration that the proposed booster service area can be 
served by the proposed booster without interference; and
    (7) A certification that copies of the materials set forth in 
paragraph (b) of this section have been served upon the licensee or 
conditional licensee of each station (including each response station 
hub and booster station) required to be studied pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section, and upon any affected holder of a Basic Trading 
Area or Partitioned Service Area authorization pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section.
    (8) If the applicant is a capacity lessee, a certification that:
    (i) The licensee or conditional licensee has provided its written 
consent to permit the capacity lessee to apply for the booster station 
license; and
    (ii) The applicant and the licensee or conditional licensee have 
entered into a lease that is in effect at the time of such filing.
    (c) Except as provided in Sec. 21.27(d), applications for high-power 
MDS signal booster station licenses may be filed at any time. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of part 21 (including Sec. 21.31), 
applications for high-power MDS signal

[[Page 91]]

booster station licenses meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of 
this section shall cut-off applications that are filed on a subsequent 
day for facilities that would cause harmful electromagnetic interference 
to the proposed booster stations.
    (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 21.30(a)(4) and except as 
provided in Sec. 21.27(d), any petition to deny an application for a 
high-power MDS signal booster station license shall be filed no later 
than the sixtieth (60th) day after the date of public notice announcing 
the filing of such application or major amendment thereto. 
Notwithstanding Sec. 21.31 and except as provided in Sec. 21.27(d), an 
application for a high-power MDS signal booster station license that 
meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section shall be granted 
on the sixty-first (61st) day after the Commission shall have given 
public notice of the acceptance for filing of it, or of a major 
amendment to it if such major amendment has been filed, unless prior to 
such date either a party in interest timely files a formal petition to 
deny or for other relief pursuant to Sec. 21.30(a), or the Commission 
notifies the applicant that its application will not be granted. Where 
an application is granted pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, 
the conditional licensee or licensee shall maintain a copy of the 
application at the MDS booster station until such time as the Commission 
issues a high-power MDS signal booster station license.
    (e) A licensee or conditional licensee of an MDS station, or the 
capacity licensee of such MDS station upon the written consent of the 
licensee or conditional licensee, shall be eligible to install and 
operate a low power signal booster station that has a maximum EIRP of -9 
dBW + log10(X/6) dBW, where X is the channel width in MHz. A low-power 
MDS signal booster station may operate only on one or more MDS channels 
that are licensed to the licensee of the MDS booster station, but may be 
operated by a third party with a fully-executed lease or consent 
agreement with the MDS conditional licensee or licensee. Any licensee of 
a low-power booster station that is a capacity lessee shall, upon 
termination or expiration of the capacity lease, automatically assign 
the booster station license to the licensee or conditional licensee of 
the MDS station by and upon written notice to the Commission signed by 
the lessee and such licensee or conditional licensee. If upon 
termination or expiration of the capacity lease the licensee or 
conditional licensee no longer desires or needs the low-power booster 
station license, such a license must be returned to the Commission. An 
MDS licensee, conditional licensee, or capacity lessee thereof, may 
install and commence operation of a low-power MDS signal booster station 
for the purpose of retransmitting the signals of the MDS station or for 
originating signals. Such installation and operation shall be subject to 
the condition that for sixty (60) days after installation and 
commencement of operation, no objection or petition to deny is filed by 
the licensee of a, or applicant for a previously-proposed, cochannel or 
adjacent channel ITFS or MDS station with a transmitter within 8.0 
kilometers (5 miles) of the coordinates of the low-power MDS signal 
booster station. An MDS licensee, conditional licensee, or capacity 
lessee thereof seeking to install a low-power MDS signal booster station 
under this rule must submit a FCC Form 331 to the Commission within 48 
hours after installation. In addition, the MDS licensee, conditional 
licensee, or capacity lessee must submit the following information (see 
Sec. 21.902(m) for permissible format(s) and media) to the Commission's 
Reference Room:
    (1) A description of the booster service area; and
    (2) A demonstration either
    (i) That the booster service area is entirely within the protected 
service area to which each licensee of a station whose channels are 
being reused is entitled by virtue of its being the licensee of an 
incumbent MDS station, or by virtue of its holding a Basic Trading Area 
or Partitioned Service Area authorization; or
    (ii) That the licensee entitled to any cochannel protected service 
area which is overlapped by the proposed booster service area has 
consented to such overlap; and
    (3) A demonstration that the proposed booster service area can be

[[Page 92]]

served by the proposed booster without interference; and
    (4) A certification that:
    (i) The maximum power level of the signal booster transmitter does 
not exceed -9 dBW + 10 log(X/6) dBW, where X is the channel width in 
MHz; and
    (ii) Where the booster is operating on channel D4, E1, F1, E2, F2, 
E3, F3, E4, F4 and/or G1, no registered receiver of an ITFS E or F 
channel station, constructed prior to May 26, 1983, is located within a 
1.61 km (1 mile) radius of the coordinates of the booster, or in the 
alternative, that a consent statement has been obtained from the 
affected ITFS licensee; and
    (iii) The applicant has complied with Sec. 1.1307 of this chapter; 
and
    (iv) Each MDS and/or ITFS station licensee (including the licensees 
of booster stations and response station hubs) with protected service 
areas and/or registered receivers within a 8 km (5 mile) radius of the 
coordinates of the booster has been given notice of its installation; 
and
    (v) The signal booster site is within the protected service area of 
the MDS station whose channels are to be reused; and
    (vi) The aggregate power flux density of the MDS station and all 
associated booster stations and simultaneously operating cochannel 
response stations licensed to or applied for by the applicant, measured 
at or beyond the boundary of the protected service areas of the MDS 
stations whose channels are to be reused, does not exceed -73 dBW/
m<SUP>2</SUP> (or the appropriately adjusted value based on the actual 
bandwidth used if other than 6 MHz, see Sec. 21.902(b)(7)(i)) at 
locations for which there is an unobstructed signal path, unless the 
consent of the affected licensees has been obtained; and
    (vii) The antenna structure will extend less than 6.10 meters (20 
feet) above the ground or natural formation or less than 6.10 meters (20 
feet) above an existing manmade structure (other than an antenna 
structure); and
    (viii) The applicant understands and agrees that, in the event 
harmful interference is claimed by the filing of an objection or 
petition to deny, it must terminate operation within two (2) hours of 
notification by the Commission, and must not recommence operation until 
receipt of written authorization to do so by the Commission; and
    (ix) If the applicant is a capacity lessee, a certification that:
    (A) The licensee or conditional licensee has provided its written 
consent to permit the capacity lessee to apply for the booster station 
license; and
    (B) The applicant and the licensee or conditional licensee have 
entered into a lease that is in effect at the time of such filing.
    (f) Commencing upon the filing of an application for a high-power 
MDS signal booster station license and until such time as the 
application is dismissed or denied or, if the application is granted, a 
certification of completion of construction is filed, an applicant for 
any new or modified MDS or ITFS station (including a response station 
hub, high-power booster station, or I Channels station) shall 
demonstrate compliance with the interference protection requirements set 
forth in Secs. 21.902 (b)(3) through (b)(5), 21.938 (b) (1) and (2) and 
(c), or 74.903 of this chapter with respect to any previously-proposed 
or authorized booster service area both using the transmission 
parameters of the high-power MDS signal booster station (e.g., EIRP, 
polarization(s) and antenna height) and the transmission parameters of 
the MDS station whose channels are to be reused by the high-power MDS 
signal booster station. Upon the filing of a certification of completion 
of construction of an MDS booster station applied for pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section, or upon the submission of an MDS booster 
station notification pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, the MDS 
station whose channels are being reused by the MDS signal booster shall 
no longer be entitled to interference protection pursuant to 
Secs. 21.902 (b)(3) through (b)(5), 21.938 (b) (1) and (2) and (c), and 
74.903 of this chapter within the booster service area based on the 
transmission parameters of the MDS station whose channels are being 
reused. A booster station shall not be entitled to protection from 
interference caused by facilities proposed on or prior to the day the 
application or notification for the booster station is

[[Page 93]]

filed. A booster station shall not be required to protect from 
interference facilities proposed on or after the day the application or 
notification for the booster station is filed.
    (g) Where an application is granted under paragraph (d) of this 
section, if a facility operated pursuant to that grant causes harmful, 
unauthorized interference to any cochannel or adjacent channel facility, 
it must promptly remedy the interference or immediately cease operations 
of the interfering facility, regardless of whether any petitions to deny 
or for other relief were filed against the application during the 
application process. The burden of proving that a high-power MDS signal 
booster station is not causing harmful, unauthorized interference lies 
on the licensee of the alleged interfering facility, following the 
filing of a documented complaint of interference by an affected party.
    (h) In the event any MDS or ITFS receive site suffers interference 
due to block downconverter overload, the licensee of each non-co/
adjacent channel signal booster station within five miles of such 
receive site shall cooperate in good faith to expeditiously identify the 
source of the interference. Each licensee of a signal booster station 
contributing to such interference shall bear the joint and several 
obligation to remedy promptly all interference resulting from block 
downconverter overload at any ITFS registered receive site or at any 
receive site within an MDS or ITFS protected service area applied for 
prior to the submission of the application or notification for the 
signal booster station, regardless of whether the receive site suffering 
the interference was constructed prior to or after the construction of 
the signal booster station(s) causing the downconverter overload; 
provided, however, that the licensee of the registered ITFS receive site 
or the MDS or ITFS protected service area must cooperate fully and in 
good faith with efforts by signal booster station licensees to prevent 
interference before constructing the signal booster station and/or to 
remedy interference that may occur. In the event that more than one 
signal booster station licensee contributes to block downconverter 
interference at an MDS or ITFS receive site, such licensees shall 
cooperate in good faith to remedy promptly the interference.

    (a)(1) A BTA authorization holder has a five-year build-out period, 
beginning on the date of the grant of the BTA authorization and 
terminating on the 5th year anniversary of the grant of the 
authorization, within which it may develop and expand MDS station 
operations within its service area.
    (2) This period is not extended by the grant of subsequent 
authorizations (i.e., grant of a station license or modification).
    (3) Timely certifications of completion of construction for each MDS 
station within a BTA or partitioned service area must be filed upon 
completion of construction of a station.
    (b) Each BTA authorization holder has the exclusive right to build, 
develop, expand and operate MDS stations within its BTA service area 
during the five-year build-out period. The Commission will not accept 
competing applications for MDS station licenses within the BTA service 
area during this period.
    (c)(1) Within five years of the grant of a BTA authorization, the 
authorization holder must construct MDS stations to provide signals 
pursuant to Sec. 21.907 that are capable of reaching at least two-thirds 
of the population of the applicable service area, excluding the 
populations within protected service areas of incumbent stations.
    (2) Sixty days prior to the end of the five-year build out period, 
the BTA authorization holder must file with the Commission proof that 
demonstrates the holder has met the requirements of Sec. 21.930(c)(1). 
The most recent census figures available from the U.S. Department of 
Commerce, Bureau of Census prior to the expiration of the authorization 
holder's five-year build-out period will be used to determine compliance 
with population-based requirements. In no event shall census figures 
gathered prior to 1990 be used.
    (d)(1) If the Commission finds that the BTA authorization holder has 
demonstrated that it has met the requirements of Sec. 21.930(c)(1), the 
Commission will issue a declaration that the holder has met such 
requirements.
    (2) If the Commission finds that the BTA authorization holder has 
not provided a signal as required in Sec. 21.930(c)(1), the Commission 
shall partition from the BTA any unserved area, using county lines as a 
guide, and shall re-authorize service to the unserved area pursuant to 
the MDS competitive bidding procedures of this subpart. Applications for 
such unserved areas are not acceptable for filing until a filing date is 
announced through a public notice.
    (i) The competitive bidding procedures set forth in Secs. 21.950 to 
21.961 shall be followed by applicants seeking authority to provide MDS 
service to the unserved partitioned area.
    (ii) The BTA authorization holder originally authorized to provide

Sec. 21.931  Partitioned service areas (PSAs).

    (a)(1) The holder of a BTA authorization may enter into contracts 
with eligible parties to partition any portion of its service area 
according to county boundaries, or according to other geopolitical 
subdivision boundaries, or multiple contiguous counties or geopolitical 
subdivisions within the BTA service area.
    (2)(i) Partitioning contracts must be filed with the Commission 
within 30 days of the date that such agreements are reached.
    (ii) The contracts must include descriptions of the areas being 
partitioned and include any documentation necessary to convey to the 
Commission the precise boundaries of the partitioned area.

[[Page 97]]

    (3) Parties to partitioning contracts must file concurrently with 
such contracts one of the following, where appropriate:
    (i) An MDS long-form application for authority to operate a new MDS 
station within the PSA;
    (ii) Applications for assignment or transfer of existing stations 
with the PSA; or
    (iii) A statement of intention as defined in Sec. 21.956(a) along 
with a completed FCC Form 430.
    (b) The eligibility requirements applicable to BTA authorization 
holders also apply to those individuals and entities seeking PSA 
authorizations.
    (c) Any individual or entity acquiring the rights to a partitioned 
area of a BTA also acquires the rights to any previously authorized 
individual stations located within the partitioned area that were held 
by the previous authorization holder, provided that grantable 
applications for assignment and transfer of control, FCC Forms 702 and 
704, are filed for existing stations and that acceptable amendments to 
pending long-form applications are filed. Pending long-form applications 
filed by the previous authorization holder for transmitter sites within 
the PSA may also be dismissed without prejudice at the applicant's 
request.
    (d) Authorizations for PSAs will be issued in accordance with 
Sec. 21.958; however, when individual stations within an PSA are 
assigned along with the partitioned area, the authorization will be 
granted concurrently with the grant of the applications for assignment 
and transfer of the existing stations.
    (e) Subsequent to issuance of the authorization for a PSA, thee 
partitioned area will be treated as a separate protected service area.
    (f)(1) When any area within a BTA becomes a PSA, the remaining 
counties and other geopolitical subdivisions within that BTA will also 
be subsequently treated and classified as a PSA(s).
    (2) At the time a BTA is partitioned, the Commission shall cancel 
the BTA authorization initially issued and issue a PSA authorization to 
the former BTA authorization holder.
    (g) The duties and responsibilities imposed upon BTA authorization 
holders in this part and throughout the Commission's rules, such as 
Sec. 21.930(c)(1), apply to the holders of PSA authorizations.
    (h) The build-out period for PSAs voluntarily partitioned shall be 
the remainder of the five-year build-out period applicable to the BTA or 
PSA from which the PSA was drawn. For PSA authorizations issued pursuant 
to Sec. 21.930(d)(2) and the competitive bidding process, the build-out 
period is five years, beginning on the date of the grant of the PSA 
authorization. The requirements of Sec. 21.930(c)(1) also apply to the 
holders of authorizations for PSAs.

Television Fixed Service pursuant to the manner in which interference is 
defined in Sec. 74.903(a).
    (c)(1) ITFS applicants may locate a new station in an unused portion 
of a BTA or PSA where interference to a previously-proposed or 
authorized MDS station of a BTA or PSA authorization holder would not be 
predicted.
    (2) With respect to ITFS applications only and for purposes of 
determining the existence of harmful electromagnetic interference as 
caused to MDS stations licensed to BTA or PSA authorization holders by 
subsequently proposed ITFS stations within that BTA, MDS stations 
licensed to BTA and PSA authorization holders and will have a protected 
service area of 56.33 km (35 miles), centered on the antenna site of the 
MDS stations.
    (3) The 56.33 km (35 mile) protected service area afforded to a 
previously-proposed or authorized MDS station of a BTA or PSA 
authorization holder with respect to a subsequently proposed ITFS 
station is entitled to the interference protection standards of 
Sec. 21.902.
    (4) An ITFS station authorized before September 15, 1995 may be 
modified, provided the power flux density of that station does not 
exceed -73 dBW/m\2\ (or the appropriate value for bandwidth other than 6 
MHz) at locations along the 56.33 km (35 mile) circle centered on the 
then-existing transmitting antenna site or service area of a collocated 
incumbent MDS station, as applicable.
    (d) Unless the affected parties have executed a written interference 
agreement in accordance with Sec. 21.937, it shall be the responsibility 
of a BTA or PSA authorization holder to correct at its expense any

MDS service at locations within other BTAs or PSAs or within the 56.33 
km (35 mile) protected service areas of authorized or previously 
proposed ITFS and MDS stations (incumbents), or at authorized or 
previously proposed ITFS receive sites.
    (e) Unless specifically excepted, BTA or PSA authorization holders 
are governed by the interference protection and other technical 
provisions applicable to MDS.
    (f) The calculated free space power flux density from an MDS 
station, other than an incumbent MDS station, may not exceed -73 dBW/
m\2\ (or the appropriate value for bandwidth other than 6 MHz) at 
locations on BTA or PSA boundaries for which there is an unobstructed 
signal path from the transmitting antenna to the boundary, unless the 
applicant has obtained the written consent of the authorization holder 
for the affected BTA or PSA.
    (g)(1) Authorization holders for BTAs or PSAs must notify 
authorization holders of adjoining areas of their application filings 
for new or modified stations; provided the proposed facility would 
produce an unobstructed signal path anywhere within the adjoining BTA or 
PSA.
    (2) This service of written notification must include a copy of the 
FCC application and occur on or before the date the application is filed 
with the Commission.
    (3) With regard to incumbent MDS stations, authorization holders for

[[Page 100]]

BTAs or PSAs must comply with the requirements of Sec. 21.902.
    (h) Where a PSA adjoins a BTA and both authorizations are held by 
the same individual or entity, the PSA shall be considered an extension 
of the protected service area of the BTA regarding the interference 
protection, limiting signal strength, and notification provisions of 
this section.

Sec. 21.951  MDS competitive bidding procedures.

    (a) The following competitive bidding procedures will generally be 
used in MDS auctions. Additional, specific procedures may be set forth 
by public notice. The Commission may also design and test alternative 
procedures. See 47 CFR 1.2103 and 1.2104.
    (1) Competitive bidding design. Simultaneous multiple round bidding 
will be used in MDS auctions, unless the Commission specifies by public 
notice the use of sequential oral (open outcry) bidding or sealed 
bidding (either sequential or simultaneous). Combinatorial bidding may 
also be used with any type of auction design.
    (2) Competitive bidding mechanisms. The Commission may utilize the 
following mechanisms in MDS auctions:
    (i) Sequencing. The Commission will establish and may vary the 
sequence in which the BTA service areas will be auctioned.
    (ii) Grouping. In the event the Commission uses either a 
simultaneous multiple round competitive bidding design or combinational 
bidding, the Commission will determine which BTA service areas will be 
auctioned simultaneously or in combination.
    (iii) Reservation price. The Commission may establish a reservation 
price, either disclosed or undisclosed, below which a BTA service area 
subject to auction will not be awarded.
    (iv) Minimum bid increments. The Commission will, by announcement 
before or during an MDS auction, require minimum bid increments in 
dollar or percentage terms.
    (v) Stopping rules. The Commission will establish stopping rules 
before or during multiple round MDS auctions in

[[Page 102]]

order to terminate an auction within a reasonable time.
    (vi) Activity Rules. The Commission will establish activity rules 
which require a minimum amount of bidding activity. In the event that 
the Commission establishes an activity rule in connection with a 
simultaneous multiple round auction, the Commission will allow bidders 
to request and to receive automatically waivers of such rule, the number 
of which will be determined by the Commission.
    (vii) Suggested minimum bid. The Commission may establish suggested 
minimum bids on each BTA service area subject to auction. Bids below the 
suggested minimum bid would count as activity under the activity rule 
only if no bids at or above the suggested minimum bid are received.
    (b) Identities of bidders. The Commission will generally release 
information concerning the identities of bidders before each auction but 
may choose, on an auction-by-auction basis, to withhold the identity of 
the bidders associated with bidder identification numbers. The 
Commission will announce by public notice before the MDS auction where 
the bidders' identities will be revealed.
    (c) Commission control of auction. The Commission may delay, 
suspend, or cancel an MDS auction in the event of a natural disaster, 
technical obstacle, evidence of security breach, unlawful bidding 
activity, administrative necessity, or for any other reason that affects 
the fair and efficient conduct of the competitive bidding. The 
Commission also has the authority, at its sole discretion, to resume the 
competitive bidding starting from the beginning of the current or some 
previous round or cancel the competitive bidding in its entirety.

Sec. 21.952  Bidding application procedures.

    (a) Short-form applications. To participate in MDS auctions, all 
applicants must submit short-form applications, along with all required 
certifications and exhibits specified by such forms, pursuant to the 
provisions of Sec. 1.2105(a) and any Commission public notices. See 47 
CFR 1.2105(a).
    (b) Filing of short-form applications. Prior to any MDS auction, the 
Commission will issue a public notice announcing the availability of BTA 
service areas and, in the event that mutually exclusive short-form 
applications (as defined by Sec. 21.925(a)(2)) are filed, the date of 
the auction for those BTA service areas. This public notice also will 
specify the date on or before which applicants intending to participate 
in an MDS auction must file their short-form applications in order to be 
eligible for that auction, and it will contain information necessary for 
completion of the application as well as other important information 
such as the material which must accompany the forms, any filing fee that 
must accompany the application or any upfront payment that will need to 
be submitted, and the location where the application must be filed.
    (c) Modification and dismissal of short-form applications.
    (1) Any short-form application that is not signed in some manner or 
form, including by electronic means, and does not contain all requisite 
certifications is unacceptable for filing and cannot be corrected 
subsequent to any applicable filing deadline. Such short-form 
application will be dismissed with prejudice.
    (2) The Commission will provide bidders a limited opportunity to 
cure certain defects specified herein and to resubmit an amended short-
form application. For MDS, we classify all amendments to a short-form 
application as major, except those to correct minor errors or defects, 
such as typographical errors, or those to reflect ownership changes or 
formation of bidding consortia or joint bidding arrangements 
specifically permitted under Sec. 21.953. A short-form application may 
be modified to make minor amendments. However, applicants who fail to 
correct defects in their short-form applications in a timely manner as 
specified by public notice will have their applications dismissed with 
no opportunity for resubmission.
    (3) A short-form application will be considered to be a newly filed 
application if it is amended by a major amendment and may not be 
resubmitted after applicable filing deadlines.

<R05>
Sec. 21.953  Prohibition of collusion.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this 
section, after the filing of short-form applications, all applicants in 
an MDS auction are prohibited from cooperating, collaborating, 
discussing or disclosing in any manner the substance of their bids or 
bidding strategies, or discussing or negotiating settlement agreements, 
with other applicants until after the winning bidder makes the required 
down payment, unless such applicants are members of a bidding consortium 
or other joint bidding arrangement identified on the applicant's short-
form application. Communications among applicants concerning matters 
unrelated to the MDS auction will be permitted after the filing of 
short-form applications.
    (b) Applicants may modify their short-form applications to reflect 
formation of consortia or changes in ownership at any time before or 
during an auction, provided such changes do not result in a change in 
control of the applicant, and provided that the parties forming 
consortia or entering into ownership agreements have not applied for the 
same BTA service area.
    (c) After the filing of short-form applications, applicants may make 
agreements to bid jointly for BTA service areas, provided the parties to 
the agreement have not applied for the same service areas.
    (d) After the filing of short-form applications, a holder of a non-
controlling attributable interest in an entity submitting a short-form 
application may, under the circumstances specified in Sec. 1.2105(c)(4), 
acquire an ownership interest in, form a consortium with, or enter into 
a joint bidding arrangement with, other applicants for the same BTA 
service areas. See 47 CFR 1.2105(c)(4).
    (e) To reflect the changes in ownership or in the membership of 
consortia or joint bidding arrangements specified in paragraphs (b), (c) 
and (d) of this section, applicants must amend their short-form 
applications by submitting a revised short-form application, filed 
within two business days of any such change; such modifications will not 
be considered major amendments of the applications within the meaning of 
Sec. 21.952(c)(2). However, any amendment which results in the change of 
control of an applicant will be considered a major amendment of the 
short-form.
    (f) For purposes of this section, the terms ``applicant'' and ``bids 
or bidding strategies'' are defined as set forth in 47 CFR 1.2105(c)(5).

[60 FR 36558, July 17, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 21.954  Submission of up front payments.

    (a) The Commission will require applicants to submit an upfront 
payment prior to the MDS auction. The amount of the upfront payment for 
each BTA service area being auctioned and the procedures for submitting 
it will be set forth in a public notice. Upfront payments may be made by 
wire transfer or by cashier's check drawn in U.S. dollars from a 
financial institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation and must be made payable to the Federal 
Communications Commission. No interest will be paid on upfront payments.
    (b) For MDS auctions, the Commission will require each applicant to 
submit an upfront payment equal to the largest combination of activity 
units (as defined in the Commission's activity rules established 
pursuant to Sec. 21.951(a)(2)(vi)) associated with the BTAs on which the 
applicant anticipates being active in any single round or bidding. 
Applicants who are small businesses eligible for reduced upfront 
payments will be required to submit an upfront payment amount in 
accordance with Sec. 21.960(c). If an upfront payment is not in 
compliance with the Commission's rules, or if insufficient funds are 
tendered to constitute a valid upfront payment, the applicant shall have 
a limited opportunity to correct its submission to bring it up to the 
minimum valid upfront payment prior to the auction. An applicant who 
fails to submit a sufficient upfront payment to qualify it to bid on any 
BTA service area being auctioned will be ineligible to bid, its 
application will be dismissed, and any upfront payment it has made will 
be returned.
    (c) The upfront payment(s) of a bidder will be credited toward any 
down payment required for the BTA service

[[Page 104]]

areas on which the bidder is the winning bidder. Where the upfront 
payment amount exceeds the required down payment of a winning bidder, 
the Commission may refund the excess amount after determining that no 
bid withdrawal payments are owned by that bidder. In the event a payment 
is assessed pursuant to Sec. 21.959(a) for bid withdrawal or default, 
upfront payments or down payments on deposit with the Commission will be 
used to satisfy the bid withdrawal or default payment before being 
applied toward any additional payment obligations that the winning 
bidder may have.

[60 FR 36559, July 17, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 21.955  Submission of down payments.

    (a) After bidding has ended on all BTA service areas, the Commission 
will identify and notify the winning bidders and declare the bidding 
closed in the MDS auction. Within five (5) business days after being 
notified that it is a winning bidder on a particular BTA service 
area(s), a winning bidder must submit to the Commission's lockbox bank 
such additional funds as are necessary to bring its total deposits 
(upfront payment plus down payment) up to twenty (20) percent of its 
winning bid(s). This down payment may be made by wire transfer or by 
cashier's check in U.S. dollars from a financial institution whose 
deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and 
must be made payable to the Federal Communications Commission.
    (b) Winning bidders who are small businesses eligible for 
installment payments under Sec. 21.960(b) are only required to bring 
their total deposits up to ten (10) percent of their winning bids. Such 
small businesses must pay the remainder of the twenty (20) percent down 
payment within five (5) business days following release of the public 
notice stating that their BTA authorizations are ready to be issued.
    (c) Down payments will be held by the Commission until the winning 
bidder has been issued its BTA authorization and has paid the remaining 
balance of its winning bid, in which case it will not be returned, or 
until the winning bidder is found unqualified to be a station licensee 
or has defaulted, in which case it will be returned, less applicable 
default payments. No interest will be paid on any down payment.

[60 FR 36559, July 17, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 21.956  Filing of long-form applications or statements of intention.

    (a)(1) Within 30 business days of being notified of its status as a 
winning bidder, each winning bidder for a BTA service area will be 
required to submit either:
    (i) An initial long-form application for an MDS station license, 
along with any required exhibits; or
    (ii) A statement of intention with regard to the BTA service area, 
along with any required exhibits, showing the encumbered nature of the 
BTA, identifying all previously authorized or proposed MDS and ITFS 
facilities, and describing in detail the winning bidder's plan for 
obtaining the previously authorized and/or proposed MDS stations within 
the BTA.
    (2) A winning bidder that fails to submit either the initial long-
form application or statement of intention as required under this 
section, and fails to establish good cause for any late-filed 
application or statement, shall be deemed to have defaulted and will be 
subject to the payments set forth in Sec. 21.959(a).
    (b) Each initial long-form application for an MDS station license 
within an auction winner's BTA service area, and each statement of 
intention with regard to an auction winner's BTA service area, must also 
include the following:
    (1) FCC Form 430;
    (2) An exhibit detailing the terms and conditions and parties 
involved in any bidding consortia, joint venture, partnership or other 
agreement or arrangement the winning bidder had entered into relating to 
the competitive bidding process prior to the time bidding was completed 
(see 47 CFR 1.207(d));
    (3) An exhibit complying with 47 CFR 1.2110(i) and 21.960(e), if the 
winning bidder submitting the long-form application or statement of 
intention claims status as a designated entity.
    (c) Subsequent long-form applications for additional MDS station 
licenses within the BTA service areas of winning bidders may be 
submitted at

[[Page 105]]

any time during the five year build-out period and need not contain the 
exhibits specified in paragraphs (b)(2) through (3) of this section.

[60 FR 36559, July 17, 1995, as amended at 61 FR 18098, Apr. 24, 1996]]


<R05>
Sec. 21.957  Petitions to deny against long-from applications; comments on statements of intention.

    (a) Within thirty (30) days after the Commission gives public notice 
that a long-form application for an MDS station license submitted by a 
winning bidder within its BTA service area has been accepted for filing, 
petitions to deny that application may be filed. Any such petitions and 
oppositions thereto must comply with the requirements of 47 CFR 1.2108 
and 21.30.
    (b) Parties wishing to comment on or oppose the issuance of a BTA 
authorization issued in connection with the filing of a statement of 
intention by a winning bidder must do so prior to the Commission's 
issuance of the BTA authorization.

[60 FR 36559, July 17, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 21.958  Full payment and issuance of BTA authorizations.

    Each winning bidder, except for small businesses eligible for 
installment payments under Sec. 21.960(b), must pay the balance of its 
winning bid for its BTA service area(s) in a lump sum within five (5) 
business days following the release of the public notice stating that 
the BTA authorization(s) is ready to be issued. A winning bidder who 
submitted a long-form application for an MDS station license within its 
BTA service area pursuant to Sec. 21.956(a) will receive its BTA 
authorization concurrent with the grant of its MDS conditional station 
license within its BTA service area. A winning bidder who submitted a 
statement of intention with regard to its BTA service area pursuant to 
Sec. 21.956(a) will receive its BTA authorization following the 
Commission's review of its statement of intention. The Commission will 
issue a BTA authorization to a winning bidder within ten (10) business 
days following notification of receipt of full payment of the amount of 
the winning bid.

[60 FR 36559, July 17, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 21.959  Withdrawal, default and disqualification.

    (a) When the Commission conducts an MDS simultaneous multiple round 
auction, the Commission will impose additional payment requirements on 
bidders who withdraw high bids during the course of an auction, who 
default on down or full payments due after an auction closes, or who are 
disqualified. The withdrawal and default payments set forth below will 
be deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the 
withdrawing, defaulting or disqualified bidder has deposited with the 
Commission.
    (1) Bid withdrawal prior to close of auction. A bidder who withdraws 
a high bid during the course of an auction will be subject to a payment 
equal to the difference between the amount bid and the amount of the 
winning bid the next time the license is offered by the Commission. No 
withdrawal payment will be assessed if the subsequent winning bid 
exceeds the withdrawn bid.
    (2) Default or disqualification after close of auction. See 
Sec. 1.2104 (g)(2) of this chapter.
    (b) If the Commission were to conduct a sequential oral (open 
outcry) auction or sealed bid auction for MDS, the Commission may modify 
the payments set forth in paragraph (a) of this section to be paid in 
the event of bid withdrawal, default or disqualification; provided, 
however, that such payments shall not exceed the payments specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (1) In the case of sealed bidding:
    (i) If a bid is withdrawn before the Commission releases the initial 
public notice announcing the winning bidder(s), no bid withdrawal 
payment will be assessed.
    (ii) If a bid is withdrawn after the Commission release the initial 
public notice announcing the winning bidder(s), the bid withdrawal 
payment will be equal to the difference between the high bid amount and 
the amount of the next highest bid. Losing bidders will only be subject 
to this bid withdrawal payment for a period of thirty (30) days after 
the Commission release the initial public notice announcing the winning 
bidders.
    (2) In the case of oral sequential (open outcry) bidding:

[[Page 106]]

    (i) If a bid is withdrawn before the bidder has declared the bidding 
to be closed for the BTA service area bid on, no bid withdrawal payment 
will be assessed.
    (ii) If a bid is withdrawn after the Commission has declared the 
bidding to be closed for the BTA service area bid on, the bid withdrawal 
payment of paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section will apply.
    (c) If a winning bidder withdraws it bid after the Commission has 
declared competitive bidding closed or fails to remit the required down 
payment within five (5) business days after the Commission has declared 
competitive bidding closed, the bidder will be deemed to have defaulted, 
its application will be dismissed, and it will be liable for the default 
payment specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. In such event, 
the Commission may either re-auction the BTA service area to existing or 
new applicants or offer it to the other highest bidders (in descending 
order) at their final bids.
    (d) A winning bidder who is found unqualified to be an MDS station 
licensee, fails to remit the balance of its winning bid in a timely 
manner, or defaults or is disqualified for any reason after having made 
the required down payment, will be deemed to have defaulted and will be 
liable for the payment set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. In 
such event, the Commission will generally conduct another auction for 
the BTA service area, affording new parties an opportunity to file 
applications for such service area.
    (e) Bidders who are found to have violated the antitrust laws or the 
Commission's rules in connection with their participation in the MDS 
competitive bidding process may be subject, in addition to any other 
applicable sanctions, to loss of their upfront payment, down payment or 
full bid amount, and may be prohibited from participating in future 
auctions.

<R05>
Sec. 21.960  Designated entity provisions for MDS.

    (a) Designated entities. As specified in this section, designated 
entities that are winning bidders for BTA service areas are eligible for 
special incentives in the auction process. See 47 CFR 1.2110.
    (b) Installment payments. Small businesses and small business 
consortia may elect to pay the full amount of their winning bids for BTA 
service areas in installments over a ten (10) year period running from 
the date that their BTA authorizations are issued.
    (1) Each eligible winning bidder paying for its BTA authorization(s) 
on an installment basis must deposit by wire transfer or cashier's check 
in the manner specified in Sec. 21.955 sufficient additional funds as 
are necessary to bring its total deposits to ten (10) percent of its 
winning bid(s) within five (5) business days after the Commission has 
declared it the winning bidder and closed the bidding. Failure to remit 
the required payment will make the bidder liable for the payments set 
forth in Sec. 21.959(a)(2).
    (2) Within five (5) business days following release of the public 
notice stating that the BTA authorization of a winning bidder eligible 
for installment payments is ready to be issued, the winning bidder shall 
pay another ten (10) percent of its winning bid, thereby commencing the 
eligible bidder's installment payment plan. The Commission will issue 
the BTA authorization to the eligible winning bidder within ten (10) 
business days following notification of receipt of this additional ten 
(10) percent payment. Failure to remit the required payment will make 
the bidder liable for the payments set forth in Sec. 21.959(a)(2).
    (3) Upon issuance of a BTA authorization to a winning bidder 
eligible for installment payments, the Commission will notify such 
eligible BTA authorization holder of the terms of its installment 
payment plan. For MDS, such installment payment plans will:
    (i) Impose interest based on the rate of ten (10) year U.S. Treasury 
obligations at the time of issuance of the BTA authorization, plus two 
and one half (2.5) percent;
    (ii) Allow installment payments for a ten (10) year period running 
from the date that the BTA authorization is issued;
    (iii) Begin with interest-only payments for the first two (2) years; 
and

[[Page 107]]

    (iv) Amortize principal and interest over the remaining years of the 
ten (10) year period running from the date that the BTA authorization is 
issued.
    (4) Conditions and obligations. See Sec. 1.2110(f)(4) of this 
chapter.
    (5) Unjust enrichment. (i) If an eligible BTA authorization holder 
that utilizes installment financing under this paragraph seeks to assign 
or transfer control of its BTA authorization to an entity not meeting 
the eligibility standards for installment payments, the holder must make 
full payment of the remaining unpaid principal and any unpaid interest 
accrued through the date of assignment or transfer as a condition of 
approval. If an eligible BTA authorization holder that utilizes 
installment financing under this subsection seeks to partition, pursuant 
to Sec. 21.931, a portion of its BTA containing one-third or more of the 
population of the area within its control in the licensed BTA to an 
entity not meeting the eligibility standards for installment payments, 
the holder must make full payment of the remaining unpaid principal and 
any unpaid interest accrued through the date of partition as a condition 
of approval.
    (ii) If a BTA authorization holder that utilizes installment 
financing under this subsection seeks to make any change in ownership 
structure that would result in the holder losing eligibility for 
installment payments, the holder shall first seek Commission approval 
and must make full payment of the remaining unpaid principal and any 
unpaid interest accrued through the date of the change in ownership 
structure as a condition of approval. Increases in gross revenues that 
result from revenues from operations, business development or expanded 
service shall not be considered changes in ownership structure under 
this paragraph.
    (c) Reduced upfront payments. A prospective bidder that qualifies as 
a small business, or as a small business consortia, is eligible for a 
twenty-five (25) percent reduction in the amount of the upfront payment 
required by Sec. 21.954. To be eligible to bid on a particular BTA, a 
small business will be required to submit an upfront payment equal to 
seventy-five (75) percent of the upfront payment amount specified for 
that BTA in the public notice listing the upfront payment amounts 
corresponding to each BTA service area being auctioned.
    (d) Bidding credits. A winning bidder that qualifies as a small 
business, or as a small business consortia, may use a bidding credit of 
fifteen (15) percent to lower the cost of its winning bid on any of the 
BTA authorizations awarded in the MDS auction.
    (1) Unjust enrichment. See Sec. 1.2111 of this chapter.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (e) Short-form application certification; Long-form application or 
statement of intention disclosure. An MDS applicant claiming designated 
entity status shall certify on its short-form application that it is 
eligible for the incentives claimed. A designated entity that is a 
winning bidder for a BTA service area(s) shall, in addition to 
information required by Sec. 21.956(b), file an exhibit to either its 
initial long-form application for an MDS station license, or to its 
statement of intention with regard to the BTA, which discloses the gross 
revenues for each of the past three years of the winning bidder and its 
affiliates. This exhibit shall describe how the winning bidder claiming 
status as a designated entity satisfies the designated entity 
eligibility requirements, and must list and summarize all agreements 
that affect designated entity status, such as partnership agreements, 
shareholder agreements, management agreements and other agreements, 
including oral agreements, which establish that the designated entity 
will have both de facto and de jure control of the entity. See 47 CFR 
1.2110(i).
    (f) Records maintenance. All holders of BTA authorizations acquired 
by auction that claim designated entity status shall maintain, at their 
principal place of business or with their designated agent, an updated 
documentary file of ownership and revenue information necessary to 
establish their status. Holders of BTA authorizations or their 
successors in interest shall maintain such files for a ten (10) year 
period running from the date that their BTA authorizations are issued. 
The files must be made available to the Commission upon request.

[[Page 108]]

    (g) Audits. BTA authorization holders claiming eligibility under 
designated entity provisions shall be subject to audits by the 
Commission, using in-house or contract resources. Selection for an audit 
may be random, on information, or on the basis of other factors. Consent 
to such audits is part of the certification included in the short-form 
application. Such consent shall include consent to the audit of the 
holders' books, documents and other material (including accounting 
procedures and practices), regardless of form or type, sufficient to 
confirm that such holders' representations are, and remain, accurate. 
Such consent shall also include inspection at all reasonable times of 
the facilities, or parts thereof, engaged in providing and transacting 
business or keeping records regarding licensed MDS offerings, and shall 
also include consent to the interviewing of principals, employees, 
customers, and suppliers of the BTA authorization holders.

Sec. 21.961  Definitions applicable to designated entity provisions.

    (a) Scope. The definitions in this section apply to Sec. 21.960, 
unless otherwise specified in that section.
    (b) Small business; consortium of small businesses.
    (1) A small business is an entity that together with its affiliates 
has average annual gross revenues that are not more than $40 million for 
the preceding three calendar years.
    (2) Aggregation of gross revenues.
    (i) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the 
gross revenues of the applicant (or BTA authorization holder) and its 
affiliates shall be considered on a cumulative basis and aggregated for 
purposes of determining whether the applicant (or holder) is a small 
business.
    (ii) Where an applicant (or BTA authorization holder) is a 
consortium of small businesses, the gross revenues of each small 
business shall not be aggregated.
    (3) A small business consortium is a conglomerate organization 
formed as a joint venture between mutually-independent business firms, 
each of which individually satisfies the definition of a small business.
    (c) Gross revenues shall mean all income received by an entity, 
whether earned or passive, before any deductions are made for costs of 
doing business (e.g., cost of goods sold), as evidenced by audited 
financial statements for the preceding relevant number of calendar 
years, or, if audited financial statements were not prepared on a 
calendar-year basis, for the preceding relevant number of fiscal years. 
If an entity was not in existence for all or part of the relevant 
period, gross revenues shall be evidenced by the audited financial 
statements of the entity's predecessor-in-interest or, if there is no 
identifiable predecessor-in-interest, unaudited financial statements 
certified by the applicant as accurate.
    (d) The definition of an affiliate of an applicant is set forth in 
47 CFR 1.2110(b)(4).

            Subpart B--Licensing Requirements and Procedures

                     Applications and Notifications


<R05>
Sec. 22.107  General application requirements.

    In general, applications for authorizations, assignments of 
authorizations, or consent to transfer of control of licensees in the 
Public Mobile Services must:
    (a) Demonstrate the applicant's qualifications to hold an 
authorization in the Public Mobile services;
    (b) State how a grant would serve the public interest, convenience, 
and necessity;
    (c) Contain all information required by FCC rules or application 
forms;
    (d) Propose operation of a facility in compliance with all rules 
governing the Public Mobile service;
    (e) Be amended as necessary to remain substantially accurate and 
complete in all significant respects, in accordance with the provisions 
of Sec. 1.65 of this chapter; and,
    (f) Be signed in accordance with Sec. 1.743 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 22.131  Procedures for mutually exclusive applications.

    Two or more pending applications are mutually exclusive if the grant 
of one application would effectively preclude the grant of one or more 
of the others under Commission rules governing the

[[Page 117]]

Public Mobile Services involved. The Commission uses the general 
procedures in this section for processing mutually exclusive 
applications in the Public Mobile Services. Additional specific 
procedures are prescribed in the subparts of this part governing the 
individual Public Mobile Services (see Secs. 22.509, 22.717, and 22.949) 
and in part 1 of this chapter.
    (a) Separate applications. Any applicant that files an application 
knowing that it will be mutually exclusive with one or more applications 
should not include in the mutually exclusive application a request for 
other channels or facilities that would not, by themselves, render the 
application mutually exclusive with those other applications. Instead, 
the request for such other channels or facilities should be filed in a 
separate application.
    (b) Filing groups. Pending mutually exclusive applications are 
processed in filing groups. Mutually exclusive applications in a filing 
group are given concurrent consideration. The Commission may dismiss as 
defective (pursuant to Sec. 1.945 of this chapter) any mutually 
exclusive application(s) whose filing date is outside of the date range 
for inclusion in the filing group. The types of filing groups used in 
day-to-day application processing are specified in paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section. A filing group is one of the following types:
    (1) Renewal filing group. A renewal filing group comprises a timely-
filed application for renewal of an authorization and all timely-filed 
mutually exclusive competing applications (see Sec. 1.935 of this 
chapter).
    (2) Same-day filing group. A same-day filing group comprises all 
mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is the same day, which 
is normally the filing date of the first-filed application(s).
    (3) Thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group. A 30-day notice and 
cut-off filing group comprises mutually exclusive applications whose 
filing date is no later than thirty (30) days after the date of the 
Public Notice listing the first-filed application(s) (according to the 
filing dates) as acceptable for filing.
    (4) Window filing group. A window filing group comprises mutually 
exclusive applications whose filing date is within an announced filing 
window. An announced filing window is a period of time between and 
including two specific dates, which are the first and last dates on 
which applications (or amendments) for a particular purpose may be 
accepted for filing. In the case of a one-day window, the two dates are 
the same. The dates are made known to the public in advance.
    (c) Procedures. Generally, the Commission may grant one application 
in a filing group of mutually exclusive applications and dismiss the 
other application(s) in the filing that are excluded by that grant, 
pursuant to Sec. 1.945 of this chapter.
    (1) Selection methods. In selecting the application to grant, the 
Commission will use competitive bidding.
    (2) Dismissal of applications. The Commission may dismiss any 
application in a filing group that is defective or otherwise subject to 
dismissal under Sec. 1.945 of this chapter, either before or after 
employing selection procedures.
    (3) Type of filing group used. Except as otherwise provided in this 
part, the type of filing group used in the processing of two or more 
mutually exclusive applications depends upon the purpose(s) of the 
applications.
    (i) If one of the mutually exclusive applications is a timely-filed 
application for renewal of an authorization, a renewal filing group is 
used.
    (ii) If any mutually exclusive application filed on the earliest 
filing date is an application for modification and none of the mutually 
exclusive applications is a timely-filed application for renewal, a 
same-day filing group is used.
    (iii) If all of the mutually exclusive applications filed on the 
earliest filing date are applications for initial authorization, a 30-
day notice and cut-off filing group is used, except that, for Phase I 
unserved area applications in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service, a 
one-day window filing group is used (see Sec. 22.949).
    (4) Disposition. If there is only one application in any type of 
filing group, the Commission may grant that application and dismiss 
without prejudice any mutually exclusive applications not in the filing 
group. If there is more

[[Page 118]]

than one mutually exclusive application in a filing group, the 
Commission disposes of these applications as follows:
    (i) Applications in a renewal filing group. All mutually exclusive 
applications in a renewal filing group are designated for comparative 
consideration in a hearing.
    (ii) Applications in a 30-day notice and cut-off filing group.
    (A) If all of the mutually exclusive applications in a 30-day notice 
and cut-off filing group are applications for initial authorization, the 
FCC administers competitive bidding procedures in accordance with 
Sec. 22.201 through Sec. 22.227 and subpart Q of part 1 of this chapter, 
as applicable. After such procedures, the application of the successful 
bidder may be granted and the other applications may be dismissed 
without prejudice.
    (B) If any of the mutually exclusive applications in a 30-day notice 
and cut-off filing group is an application for modification, the 
Commission may attempt to resolve the mutual exclusivity by facilitating 
a settlement between the applicants. If a settlement is not reached 
within a reasonable time, the FCC may designate all applications in the 
filing group for comparative consideration in a hearing. In this event, 
the result of the hearing disposes all of the applications in the filing 
group.
    (iii) Applications in a same-day filing group. If there are two or 
more mutually exclusive applications in a same-day filing group, the 
Commission may attempt to resolve the mutual exclusivity by facilitating 
a settlement between the applicants. If a settlement is not reached 
within a reasonable time, the Commission may designate all applications 
in the filing group for comparative consideration in a hearing. In this 
event, the result of the hearing disposes of all of the applications in 
the filing group.
    (iv) Applications in a window filing group. Applications in a window 
filing group are processed in accordance with the procedures for a 30-
day notice and cut-off filing group in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this 
section.
    (d) Terminology. For the purposes of this section, terms have the 
following meanings:
    (1) The filing date of an application is the date on which that 
application was received in a condition acceptable for filing or the 
date on which the most recently filed major amendment to that 
application was received, whichever is later, excluding major amendments 
in the following circumstances:
    (i) The major amendment reflects only a change in ownership or 
control found by the Commission to be in the public interest;
    (ii) The major amendment as received is defective or otherwise found 
unacceptable for filing; or
    (iii) The application being amended has been designated for hearing 
and the Commission or the presiding officer accepts the major amendment.
    (2) An application for initial authorization is:
    (i) Any application requesting an authorization for a new system or 
station;
    (ii) Any application requesting authorization for an existing 
station to operate on an additional channel, unless the additional 
channel is for paired two-way radiotelephone operation, is in the same 
frequency range as the existing channel(s), and will be operationally 
integrated with the existing channel(s) such as by trunking;
    (iii) Any application requesting authorization for a new transmitter 
at a location more than 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from any existing 
transmitters of the applicant licensee on the requested channel or 
channel block; or
    (iv) Any application to expand the CGSA of a cellular system (as 
defined in Sec. 22.911), except during the five-year build-out period.
    (v) Any ``short-form'' application (filed on FCC Form 175) 
requesting a new paging geographic area authorization.

<R05>
Sec. 22.143  Construction prior to grant of application.

    Applicants may construct facilities in the Public Mobile services 
prior to grant of their applications, subject to

[[Page 119]]

the provisions of this section, but must not operate such facilities 
until the FCC grants an authorization. If the conditions stated in this 
section are not met, applicants must not begin to construct facilities 
in the Public Mobile Services.
    (a) When applicants may begin construction. An applicant may begin 
construction of a facility 35 days after the date of the Public Notice 
listing the application for that facility as acceptable for filing, 
except that an applicant whose application to operate a new cellular 
system was selected in a random selection process may begin construction 
of that new cellular system 35 days after the date of the Public Notice 
listing it as the tentative selectee.
    (b) Notification to stop. If the FCC for any reason determines that 
construction should not be started or should be stopped while an 
application is pending, and so notifies the applicant, orally (followed 
by written confirmation) or in writing, the applicant must not begin 
construction or, if construction has begun, must stop construction 
immediately.
    (c) Assumption of risk. Applicants that begin construction pursuant 
to this section before receiving an authorization do so at their own 
risk and have no recourse against the United States for any losses 
resulting from:
    (1) Applications that are not granted;
    (2) Errors or delays in issuing Public Notices;
    (3) Having to alter, relocate or dismantle the facility; or
    (4) Incurring whatever costs may be necessary to bring the facility 
into compliance with applicable laws, or FCC rules and orders.
    (d) Conditions. Except as indicated, all pre-grant construction is 
subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The application is not mutually exclusive with any other 
application, except for successful bidders and tentative selectees in 
the Cellular Radiotelephone Service;
    (2) No petitions to deny the application have been filed;
    (3) The application does not include a request for a waiver of one 
or more FCC rules;
    (4) For any construction or alteration that would exceed the 
requirements of Sec. 17.7 of this chapter, the licensee has notified the 
appropriate Regional Office of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA 
Form 7460-1), filed a request for antenna height clearance and 
obstruction marking and lighting specifications (FCC Form 854) with the 
FCC, PRB, Support Services Branch, Gettysburg, PA 17325;
    (5) The applicant has indicated in the application that the proposed 
facility would not have a significant environmental effect, in 
accordance with Secs. 1.1301 through 1.1319 of this chapter; and,
    (6) Under applicable international agreements and rules in this 
part, individual coordination of the proposed channel assignment(s) with 
a foreign administration is not required.


<R05>
Sec. 22.150  Standard pre-filing technical coordination procedure.

    For operations on certain channels in the Public Mobile Services, 
carriers must attempt to coordinate the proposed use of spectrum with 
other spectrum users prior to filing an application for authority to 
operate a station. Rules requiring this procedure for specific channels 
and types of stations are contained in the subparts governing the 
individual Public Mobile Services.
    (a) Coordination comprises two steps--notification and response. 
Each step may be accomplished orally or in writing.
    (b) Notification must include relevant technical details of the 
proposal. At minimum, this should include the following:
    (1) Geographical coordinates of the antenna site(s).
    (2) Transmitting and receiving channels to be added or changed.
    (3) Transmitting power, emission type and polarization.
    (4) Transmitting antenna pattern and maximum gain.
    (5) Transmitting antenna height above ground level.
    (c) Applicants and licensees receiving notification must respond 
promptly, even if no channel usage conflicts are anticipated. If any 
notified party fails to respond within 30 days, the applicant may file 
the application without a response from that party.

[[Page 120]]

    (d) The 30-day period begins on the date the notification is 
submitted to the Commission via the ULS. If the notification is by mail, 
this date may be ascertained by:
    (1) The return receipt on certified mail,
    (2) The enclosure of a card to be dated and returned by the party 
being notified, or
    (3) A reasonable estimate of the time required for the mail to reach 
its destination. In this case, the date when the 30-day period will 
expire must be stated in the notification.
    (e) All channel usage conflicts discovered during the coordination 
process should be resolved prior to filing of the application. If the 
applicant is unable or unwilling to resolve a particular conflict, the 
application may be accepted for filing if it contains a statement 
describing the unresolved conflict and a brief explanation of the 
reasons why a resolution was not achieved.
    (f) If a number of changes in the technical parameters of a proposed 
facility become necessary during the course of the coordination process, 
an attempt should be made to minimize the number of separate 
notifications. If the changes are incorporated into a completely revised 
notice, the items that were changed from the previous notice should be 
identified.
    (g) In situations where subsequent changes are not numerous or 
complex, the party receiving the changed notification should make an 
effort to respond in less than 30 days. If the applicant believes a 
shorter response time is reasonable and appropriate, it should so 
indicate in the notice and suggest a response date.
    (h) If a subsequent change in the technical parameters of a proposed 
facility could not affect the facilities of one or more of the parties 
that received an initial notification, the applicant is not required to 
coordinate that change with these parties. However, these parties must 
be advised of the change and of the opinion that coordination is not 
required.

Sec. 22.157  Distance computation.

    The method given in this section must be used to compute the 
distance between any two locations, except that, for computation of 
distance involving stations in Canada and Mexico, methods for distance 
computation specified in the applicable international agreement, if any, 
must be used instead. The method set forth in this paragraph is 
considered to be sufficiently accurate for distances not exceeding 475 
km (295 miles).
    (a) Convert the latitudes and longitudes of each reference point 
from degree-minute-second format to degree-decimal format by dividing 
minutes by 60 and seconds by 3600, then adding the results to degrees.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17NO94.000

    (b) Calculate the mean geodetic latitude between the two reference 
points by averaging the two latitudes:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17NO94.001

    (c) Calculate the number of kilometers per degree latitude 
difference for the mean geodetic latitude calculated in paragraph (b) of 
this section as follows:

[[Page 121]]


    (f) Calculate the East-West distance in kilometers as follows:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17NO94.005
    
    (g) Calculate the distance between the locations by taking the 
square root of the sum of the squares of the East-West and North-South 
distances:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17NO94.006

    (h) Terms used in this section are defined as follows:
    (1) LAT1<INF>dd</INF> and LON1<INF>dd</INF> are the coordinates of 
the first location in degree-decimal format.
    (2) LAT2<INF>dd</INF> and LON2<INF>dd</INF> are the coordinates of 
the second location in degree-decimal format.
    (3) ML is the mean geodetic latitude in degree-decimal format.
    (4) KPD<INF>lat</INF> is the number of kilometers per degree of 
latitude at a given mean geodetic latitude.
    (5) KPD<INF>lon</INF> is the number of kilometers per degree of 
longitude at a given mean geodetic latitude.
    (6) NS is the North-South distance in kilometers.
    (7) DIST is the distance between the two locations, in kilometers.


<R05>
Sec. 22.159  Computation of average terrain elevation.

    Average terrain elevation must be calculated by computer using 
elevations from a 30 second point or better topographic data file. The 
file must be identified. If a 30 second point data file is used, the 
elevation data must be processed for intermediate points using 
interpolation techniques; otherwise, the nearest point may be used. In 
cases of dispute, average terrain elevation determinations can also be 
done manually, if the results differ significantly from the computer 
derived averages.
    (a) Radial average terrain elevation is calculated as the average of 
the elevation along a straight line path from 3 to 16 kilometers (2 and 
10 miles) extending radially from the antenna site. If a portion of the 
radial path extends over foreign territory or water, such portion must 
not be included in the computation of average elevation unless the 
radial path again passes over United States land between 16 and 134 
kilometers (10 and 83 miles) away from the station. At least 50 evenly 
spaced data points for each radial should be used in the computation.
    (b) Average terrain elevation is the average of the eight radial 
average terrain elevations (for the eight cardinal radials).
    (c) For locations in Dade and Broward Counties, Florida, the method 
prescribed above may be used or average terrain elevation may be assumed 
to be 3 meters (10 feet).


<R05>
Sec. 22.161  Application requirements for ASSB.

    Applications for base stations employing amplitude compandored 
single sideband modulation (ASSB) must contain the following 
information:
    (a) The application must describe fully the modulation 
characteristics, emission and occupied bandwidth, and specify the center 
frequency of the emission for each channel, carrier frequency, and pilot 
channels, if any. The emission must fall completely within a channel 
assignable for two-way operation in the Paging and Radiotelephone 
Service, Rural Radiotelephone Service or Offshore Radiotelephone 
Service.
    (b) The application must contain interference studies between 
stations within an authorized bandwidth, whether FM-to-ASSB, ASSB-to-FM, 
or ASSB-to-ASSB in accordance with the following: For ASSB stations, the 
transmitter nearest to the protected station must be used. The effective 
radiated power in the direction of the protected station must be the sum 
of the peak effective radiated power of all transmitters in the group, 
in the direction of the protected station. The antenna center of 
radiation height above average terrain must be the highest antenna 
center of radiation height of any transmitter in the group in the 
direction of the protected station. The channel of the group is assumed 
to be the same as that of the protected station (co-channel), and 
studies must be made in accordance with Sec. 22.567.


<R05>
Sec. 22.165  Additional transmitters for existing systems.

    A licensee may operate additional transmitters at additional 
locations on the same channel or channel block as

[[Page 122]]

its existing system without obtaining prior Commission approval 
provided:
    (a) International coordination. The locations and/or technical 
parameters of the additional transmitters are such that individual 
coordination of the channel assignment(s) with a foreign administration, 
under applicable international agreements and rules in this part, is not 
required.
    (b) Antenna structure registration. Certain antenna structures must 
be registered with the Commission prior to construction or alteration. 
Registration requirements are contained in part 17 of this chapter.
    (c) Environmental. The additional transmitters must not have a 
significant environmental effect as defined by Secs. 1.1301 through 
1.1319 of this chapter.
    (d) Paging and Radiotelephone Service. The provisions in this 
paragraph apply for stations in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service.
    (1) The interfering contours of the additional transmitter(s) must 
be totally encompassed by the composite interfering contour of the 
existing station (or stations under common control of the applicant) on 
the same channel, except that this limitation does not apply to 
nationwide network paging stations or in-building radiation systems.
    (2) Additional transmitters in the 43 MHz frequency range operate 
under developmental authority, subject to the conditions set forth in 
Sec. 22.411.
    (3) The additional transmitters must not operate on control channels 
in the 72-76 MHz, 470-512 MHz, 928 MHz, 932 MHz, 941 MHz or 959 MHz 
frequency ranges.
    (e) Cellular radiotelephone service. During the five-year build-out 
period, the service area boundaries of the additional transmitters, as 
calculated by the method set forth in Sec. 22.911(a), must remain within 
the market, except that the service area boundaries may extend beyond 
the market boundary into the area that is part of the CGSA or is already 
encompassed by the service area boundaries of previously authorized 
facilities. After the five-year build-out period, the service area 
boundaries of the additional transmitters, as calculated by the method 
set forth in Sec. 22.911(a), must remain within the CGSA. Licensees must 
notify the Commission (FCC Form 601) of any transmitters added under 
this section that cause a change in the CGSA boundary. The notification 
must include full size and reduced maps, and supporting engineering, as 
described in Sec. 22.953(a)(5)(i) through (iii). If the addition of 
transmitters involves a contract service area boundary (SAB) extension 
(see Sec. 22.912), the notification must include a statement as to 
whether the five-year build-out period for the system on the relevant 
channel block in the market into which the SAB extends has elapsed and 
whether the SAB extends into any unserved area in the market. The 
notification must be made electronically via the ULS, or delivered to 
the filing place (see Sec. 1.913 of this chapter) no later than 15 days 
after the addition is made.
    (f) Air-ground Radiotelephone Service. Ground stations may be added 
to Commercial Aviation air-ground systems at previously established 
ground station locations, pursuant to Sec. 22.859, subject to compliance 
with the applicable technical rules. This section does not apply to 
General Aviation air-ground stations.
    (g) Rural Radiotelephone Service. A ``service area'' and 
``interfering contours'' must be determined using the same method as for 
stations in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service. The service area and 
interfering contours so determined for the additional transmitter(s) 
must be totally encompassed by the similarly determined composite 
service area contour and predicted interfering contour, respectively, of 
the existing station on the same channel. This section does not apply to 
Basic Exchange Telecommunications Radio Systems.
    (h) Offshore Radiotelephone Service. This section does not apply to 
stations in the Offshore Radiotelephone Service.
    (i) Provision of information upon request. Upon request by the FCC, 
licensees must supply administrative or technical information concerning 
the additional transmitters. At the time transmitters are added pursuant 
to this section, licensees must make a record of the pertinent technical 
and administrative information so that

[[Page 123]]

such information is readily available. See Sec. 22.303.

    (b) Grouping. The FCC will determine which licenses will be 
auctioned simultaneously or in combination based on interdependency and 
administrative circumstances.
    (c) Minimum Bid Increments. The FCC may, by public announcement 
before or during an auction, require minimum bid increments in dollar or 
percentage terms.
    (d) Stopping Rules. The FCC may establish stopping rules before or 
during an auction in order to terminate the auction within a reasonable 
time.
    (e) Activity Rules. The FCC may establish activity rules which 
require a minimum amount of bidding activity. In the event that the FCC 
establishes an activity rule in connection with a simultaneous multiple 
round auction, each bidder may request waivers of such rule during the 
auction. The FCC may, by public announcement either before or during an 
auction, specify or vary the number of waivers available to each bidder.


<R05>
Sec. 22.207  Withdrawal, default, and disqualification payments.

    The FCC will impose payments on bidders who withdraw high bids 
during the course of an auction, who default on payments due after an 
auction terminates, or who are disqualified. When the FCC conducts a 
simultaneous multiple round auction, payments will be calculated as set 
forth in Secs. 1.2104(g) and 1.2109 of this chapter. When the amount of 
such a payment cannot be determined, a deposit of up to 20 percent of 
the amount bid on the license will be required.


<R05>
Sec. 22.209  Bidding applications (FCC Form 175 and 175-S Short-form).

    Each applicant to participate in competitive bidding for paging 
geographic area authorizations must submit an application (FCC Forms 175 
and 175-S) pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 1.2105 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 22.211  Submission of upfront payments and down payments.

    (a) The FCC will require applicants to submit an upfront payment 
prior to the start of a paging auction. The amount of the upfront 
payment for each geographic area license auctioned and the procedures 
for submitting it will be set forth by the Wireless Telecommunications 
Bureau in a Public Notice in accordance with Sec. 1.2106 of this 
chapter.
    (b) Each winning bidder in a paging auction must submit a down 
payment to the FCC in an amount sufficient to

[[Page 124]]

bring its total deposits up to 20 percent of its winning bid. All 
winning bidders except small businesses will be required to make such 
payment within ten business days following the release of a Public 
Notice announcing the close of bidding. Small businesses must bring 
their deposits up to 10 percent of their winning bids within ten 
business days following the release of a Public Notice announcing the 
close of bidding, and must pay an additional 10 percent prior to 
licensing, by a date and time to be specified by Public Notice.


<R05>
Sec. 22.213  Long-form application (FCC Form 601).

    Each successful bidder for a paging geographic area authorization 
must submit a ``long-form'' application (Form 601) within ten (10) 
business days after being notified by Public Notice that it is the 
winning bidder. Applications for paging geographic area authorizations 
on FCC Form 601 must be submitted in accordance with Sec. 1.2107 and 
Sec. 1.2112 of this chapter, all applicable procedures set forth in the 
rules in this part, and any applicable Public Notices that the FCC may 
issue in connection with an auction. After an auction, the FCC will not 
accept long-form applications for paging geographic area authorizations 
from anyone other than the auction winners and parties seeking 
partitioned authorizations pursuant to agreements with auction winners 
under Sec. 22.221 of this part.

[64 FR 33781, June 24, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 22.215  Authorization grant, denial, default, and disqualification.

    (a) Each winning bidder will be required to pay the full balance of 
its winning bid no later than ten (10) business days following the 
release date of a Public Notice establishing the payment deadline. If a 
winning bidder fails to pay the balance of its winning bids in a lump 
sum by the applicable deadline as specified by the Commission, it will 
be allowed to make payment no later than ten (10) business days after 
the payment deadline, provided that it also pays a late fee equal to 
five (5) percent of the amount due. When a winning bidder fails to pay 
the balance of its winning bid by the late payment deadline, it is 
considered to be in default on its authorization(s) and subject to the 
applicable default payments. Authorizations will be awarded upon the 
full and timely payment of winning bids and any applicable late fees.
    (b) A bidder that withdraws its bid subsequent to the close of 
bidding, defaults on a payment due, or is disqualified, is subject to 
the payments specified in Sec. 22.207, Sec. 1.2104(g), or Sec. 1.2109 of 
this chapter, as applicable.

Sec. 22.217  Bidding credits for small businesses.

    (a) A winning bidder that qualifies as a small business or a 
consortium of small businesses as defined in Sec. 22.223(b)(1)(i) of 
this part may use a bidding credit of thirty-five (35) percent to lower 
the cost of its winning bid. A winning bidder that qualifies as a small 
business or a consortium of small businesses as defined in 
Sec. 22.223(b)(1)(ii) of this part may use a bidding credit of twenty-
five (25) percent to lower the cost of its winning bid.
    (b) Unjust Enrichment:
    (1) If a small business that utilizes a bidding credit under this 
section seeks to transfer control or assign an authorization to an 
entity that is not a small business under Sec. 22.223(b)(1), or seeks to 
make any other change in ownership that would result in the licensee 
losing eligibility as a small business, the small business must seek FCC 
approval and reimburse the U.S. government for the amount of the bidding 
credit (plus interest at the rate imposed for installment financing at 
the time the license was awarded), as a condition of approval of such 
assignment, transfer, or other ownership change.
    (2) If a small business that utilizes a bidding credit under this 
section seeks to transfer control or assign an authorization to a small 
business meeting the eligibility standards for a lower bidding credit, 
or seeks to make any other change in ownership that would result in the 
licensee qualifying for a lower bidding credit under this section, the 
licensee must seek FCC approval and reimburse the U.S. government for 
the difference between the amount of the

[[Page 125]]

bidding credit obtained by the licensee and the bidding credit for which 
the assignee, transferee, or licensee is eligible under this section 
(plus interest at the rate imposed for installment financing at the time 
the license was awarded), as a condition of the approval of such 
assignment, transfer, or other ownership change.
    (3) The amount of payments made pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1) and 
(b)(2) of this section will be reduced over time as follows: A transfer 
in the first two years of the license term will result in a forfeiture 
of 100 percent of the value of the bidding credit (or the difference 
between the bidding credit obtained by the original licensee and the 
bidding credit for which the post-transfer licensee is eligible); in 
year 3 of the license term the payment will be 75 percent; in year 4 the 
payment will be 50 percent; and in year 5 the payment will be 25 
percent, after which there will be no assessment.
    (4) If a small business that utilizes a bidding credit under this 
section partitions its authorization or disaggregates its spectrum to an 
entity not meeting the eligibility standards for the same bidding 
credit, the partitioning or disaggregating licensee will be subject to 
the provisions concerning unjust enrichment as set forth in 
Sec. 1.2111(e) (2) and (3) of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 22.221  Eligibility for partitioned licenses.

    If partitioned licenses are being applied for in conjunction with a 
license(s) to be awarded through competitive bidding procedures--
    (a) The applicable procedures for filing short-form applications and 
for submitting upfront payments and down payments contained in this 
chapter shall be followed by the applicant, who must disclose as part of 
its short-form application all parties to agreement(s) with or among 
other entities to partition the license pursuant to this section, if won 
at auction (see 47 CFR 1.2105(a)(2)(viii));
    (b) Each party to an agreement to partition the authorization must 
file a long-form application (FCC Form 601) for its respective, mutually 
agreed-upon geographic area together with the application for the 
remainder of the MEA or EA filed by the auction winner.
    (c) If the partitioned authorization is being applied for as a 
partial assignment of the MEA or EA authorization following grant of the 
initial authorization, request for authorization for partial assignment 
of an authorization shall be made pursuant to Sec. 1.948 of this part.

[59 FR 59507, Nov. 17, 1994, as amended at 64 FR 33781, June 24, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 22.223  Definitions concerning competitive bidding process.

    (a) Scope. The definitions in this section apply to Secs. 22.201 
through 22.227, unless otherwise specified in those sections.
    (b) Small business; consortium of small businesses. (1) A small 
business is an entity that either:
    (i) Together with its affiliates and controlling interests has 
average gross revenues that are not more than $3 million for the 
preceding three years; or
    (ii) Together with its affiliates and controlling interests has 
average gross revenues that are not more than $15 million for the 
preceding three years.
    (2) For purposes of determining whether an entity meets either the 
$3 million or $15 million average annual gross revenues size standard 
set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the gross revenues of the 
entity, its affiliates, and controlling interests shall be considered on 
a cumulative basis and aggregated.
    (3) A consortium of small businesses is a conglomerate organization 
formed as a joint venture between or among mutually independent business 
firms, each of which individually satisfies the definition of a small 
business in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Each individual member 
must establish its eligibility as a small business, as defined in this 
section. Where an applicant (or licensee) is a consortium of small 
businesses, the gross revenues of each small business shall not be 
aggregated.
    (4) Applicants without identifiable controlling interests. Where an 
applicant (or licensee) cannot identify controlling interests under the 
standards

[[Page 126]]

set forth in this section, the gross revenues of all interest holders in 
the applicant, and their affiliates, will be attributable.
    (c) Gross Revenues. Gross revenues shall mean all income received by 
an entity, whether earned or passive, before any deductions are made for 
costs of doing business (e.g., cost of goods sold). Gross revenues are 
evidenced by audited financial statements for the relevant number of 
calendar or fiscal years preceding the filing of the applicant's short-
form application. If an entity was not in existence for all or part of 
the relevant period, gross revenues shall be evidenced by the audited 
financial statements of the entity's predecessor-in-interest or, if 
there is no identifiable predecessor-in-interest, unaudited financial 
statements certified by the applicant as accurate. When an applicant 
does not otherwise use audited financial statements, its gross revenues 
may be certified by its chief financial officer or its equivalent.
    (d) Affiliate.--(1) Basis for Affiliation. An individual or entity 
is an affiliate of an applicant if such individual or entity:
    (i) Directly or indirectly controls or has the power to control the 
applicant, or
    (ii) Is directly or indirectly controlled by the applicant, or
    (iii) Is directly or indirectly controlled by a third party or 
parties who also control or have the power to control the applicant, or
    (iv) Has an ``identity of interest'' with the applicant.
    (2) Nature of control in determining affiliation. (i) Every business 
concern is considered to have one or more parties who directly or 
indirectly control or have the power to control it. Control may be 
affirmative or negative and it is immaterial whether it is exercised so 
long as the power to control exists.

    Example for paragraph (d)(2)(i). An applicant owning 50 percent of 
the voting stock of another concern would have negative power to control 
such concern since such party can block any action of the other 
stockholders. Also, the bylaws of a corporation may permit a stockholder 
with less than 50 percent of the voting stock to block any actions taken 
by the other stockholders in the other entity. Affiliation exists when 
the applicant has the power to control a concern while at the same time 
another person, or persons, are in control of the concern at the will of 
the party or parties with the power of control.

    (ii) Control can arise through stock ownership; occupancy of 
director, officer or key employee positions; contractual or other 
business relations; or combinations of these and other factors. A key 
employee is an employee who, because of his/her position in the concern, 
has a critical influence in or substantive control over the operations 
or management of the concern.
    (iii) Control can arise through management positions if the voting 
stock is so widely distributed that no effective control can be 
established.

    Example for paragraph (d)(2)(iii). In a corporation where the 
officers and directors own various size blocks of stock totaling 40 
percent of the corporation's voting stock, but no officer or director 
has a block sufficient to give him/her control or the power to control 
and the remaining 60 percent is widely distributed with no individual 
stockholder having a stock interest greater than 10 percent, management 
has the power to control. If persons with such management control of the 
other entity are controlling principals of the applicant, the other 
entity will be deemed an affiliate of the applicant.

    (3) Identity of interest between and among persons. Affiliation can 
arise between or among two or more persons with an identity of interest, 
such as members of the same family or persons with common investments. 
In determining if the applicant controls or is controlled by a concern, 
persons with an identity of interest will be treated as though they were 
one person.
    (i) Spousal affiliation. Both spouses are deemed to own or control 
or have the power to control interests owned or controlled by either of 
them, unless they are subject to a legal separation recognized by a 
court of competent jurisdiction in the United States.
    (ii) Kinship affiliation. Immediate family members will be presumed 
to own or control or have the power to control interests owned or 
controlled by other immediate family members. In this context 
``immediate family member'' means father, mother, husband, wife, son, 
daughter, brother, sister, father- or mother-in-law, son- or daughter-
in-law, brother- or sister-in-law, step-father, or -mother, step-

[[Page 127]]

brother, or -sister, step-son, or -daughter, half-brother or -sister. 
This presumption may be rebutted by showing that:
    (A) The family members are estranged,
    (B) The family ties are remote, or
    (C) The family members are not closely involved with each other in 
business matters.

    Example for paragraph (d)(3)(ii). A owns a controlling interest in 
Corporation X. A's sister-in-law, B, has a controlling interest in a 
paging geographic area authorization application. Because A and B have a 
presumptive kinship affiliation, A's interest in Corporation X is 
attributable to B, and thus to the applicant, unless B rebuts the 
presumption with the necessary showing.

    (4) Affiliation through stock ownership. (i) An applicant is 
presumed to control or have the power to control a concern if he/she 
owns or controls or has the power to control 50 percent or more of its 
voting stock.
    (ii) An applicant is presumed to control or have the power to 
control a concern even though he/she owns, controls, or has the power to 
control less than 50 percent of the concern's voting stock, if the block 
of stock he/she owns, controls, or has the power to control is large as 
compared with any other outstanding block of stock.
    (iii) If two or more persons each owns, controls or has the power to 
control less than 50 percent of the voting stock of a concern, such 
minority holdings are equal or approximately equal in size, and the 
aggregate of these minority holdings is large as compared with any other 
stock holding, the presumption arises that each one of these persons 
individually controls or has the power to control the concern; however, 
such presumption may be rebutted by a showing that such control or power 
to control, in fact, does not exist.
    (5) Affiliation arising under stock options, convertible debentures, 
and agreements to merge. Stock options, convertible debentures, and 
agreements to merge (including agreements in principle) are generally 
considered to have a present effect on the power to control the concern. 
Therefore, in making a size determination, such options, debentures, and 
agreements will generally be treated as though the rights held 
thereunder had been exercised. However, neither an affiliate nor an 
applicant can use such options and debentures to appear to terminate its 
control over another concern before it actually does so.

    Example 1 for paragraph (d)(5). If company B holds an option to 
purchase a controlling interest in company A, who holds a controlling 
interest in a paging geographic area authorization application, the 
situation is treated as though company B had exercised its rights and 
had become owner of a controlling interest in company A. The gross 
revenues of company B must be taken into account in determining the size 
of the applicant.
    Example 2 for paragraph (d)(5). If a large company, BigCo, holds 70% 
(70 of 100 outstanding shares) of the voting stock of company A, who 
holds a controlling interest in a paging geographic area authorization 
application, and gives a third party, SmallCo, an option to purchase 50 
of the 70 shares owned by BigCo, BigCo will be deemed to be an affiliate 
of company A, and thus the applicant, until SmallCo actually exercises 
its options to purchase such shares. In order to prevent BigCo from 
circumventing the intent of the rule which requires such options to be 
considered on a fully diluted basis, the option is not considered to 
have present effect in this case.
    Example 3 for paragraph (d)(5). If company A has entered into an 
agreement to merge with company B in the future, the situation is 
treated as though the merger has taken place.

    (6) Affiliation under voting trusts. (i) Stock interests held in 
trust shall be deemed controlled by any person who holds or shares the 
power to vote such stock, to any person who has the sole power to sell 
such stock, and to any person who has the right to revoke the trust at 
will or to replace the trustee at will.
    (ii) If a trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business 
relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary, the stock interests held 
in trust will be deemed controlled by the grantor or beneficiary, as 
appropriate.
    (iii) If the primary purpose of a voting trust, or similar 
agreement, is to separate voting power from beneficial ownership of 
voting stock for the purpose of shifting control of or the power to 
control a concern in order that such concern or another concern may meet 
the Commission's size standards, such voting trust shall not be 
considered

[[Page 128]]

valid for this purpose regardless of whether it is or is not recognized 
within the appropriate jurisdiction.
    (7) Affiliation through common management. Affiliation generally 
arises where officers, directors, or key employees serve as the majority 
or otherwise as the controlling element of the board of directors and/or 
the management of another entity.
    (8) Affiliation through common facilities. Affiliation generally 
arises where one concern shares office space and/or employees and/or 
other facilities with another concern, particularly where such concerns 
are in the same or related industry or field of operations, or where 
such concerns were formerly affiliated, and through these sharing 
arrangements one concern has control, or potential control, of the other 
concern.
    (9) Affiliation through contractual relationships. Affiliation 
generally arises where one concern is dependent upon another concern for 
contracts and business to such a degree that one concern has control, or 
potential control, of the other concern.
    (10) Affiliation under joint venture arrangements. (i) A joint 
venture for size determination purposes is an association of concerns 
and/or individuals, with interests in any degree or proportion, formed 
by contract, express or implied, to engage in and carry out a single, 
specific business venture for joint profit for which purpose they 
combine their efforts, property, money, skill and knowledge, but not on 
a continuing or permanent basis for conducting business generally. The 
determination whether an entity is a joint venture is based upon the 
facts of the business operation, regardless of how the business 
operation may be designated by the parties involved. An agreement to 
share profits/losses proportionate to each party's contribution to the 
business operation is a significant factor in determining whether the 
business operation is a joint venture.
    (ii) The parties to a joint venture are considered to be affiliated 
with each other.
    (e) Controlling interest. (1) For purposes of this section, 
controlling interest includes individuals or entities with de jure and 
de facto control of the applicant. De jure control is greater than 50 
percent of the voting stock of a corporation, or in the case of a 
partnership, the general partner. De facto control is determined on a 
case-by-case basis. An entity must disclose its equity interest and 
demonstrate at least the following indicia of control to establish that 
it retains de facto control of the applicant:
    (i) The entity constitutes or appoints more than 50 percent of the 
board of directors or management committee;
    (ii) The entity has authority to appoint, promote, demote, and fire 
senior executives that control the day-to-day activities of the 
licensee; and
    (iii) The entity plays an integral role in management decisions.
    (2) Calculation of certain interests. (i) Ownership interests shall 
be calculated on a fully diluted basis; all agreements such as warrants, 
stock options and convertible debentures will generally be treated as if 
the rights thereunder already have been fully exercised.
    (ii) Partnership and other ownership interests and any stock 
interest equity, or outstanding stock, or outstanding voting stock shall 
be attributed as specified below.
    (iii) Stock interests held in trust shall be attributed to any 
person who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, to any person 
who has the sole power to sell such stock, and, to any person who has 
the right to revoke the trust at will or to replace the trustee at will. 
If the trustee has a familial, personal, or extra-trust business 
relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary, the grantor or 
beneficiary, as appropriate, will be attributed with the stock interests 
held in trust.
    (iv) Non-voting stock shall be attributed as an interest in the 
issuing entity.
    (v) Limited partnership interests shall be attributed to limited 
partners and shall be calculated according to both the percentage of 
equity paid in and the percentage of distribution of profits and losses.
    (vi) Officers and directors of an entity shall be considered to have 
an attributable interest in the entity. The officers and directors of an 
entity that controls a licensee or applicant shall be considered to have 
an attributable interest in the licensee or applicant.

[[Page 129]]

    (vii) Ownership interests that are held indirectly by any party 
through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by 
successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in 
the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution 
benchmark to the resulting product, except that if the ownership 
percentage for an interest in any link in the chain exceeds 50 percent 
or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were a 100 
percent interest.
    (viii) Any person who manages the operations of an applicant or 
licensee pursuant to a management agreement shall be considered to have 
an attributable interest in such applicant or licensee if such person or 
its affiliate pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section has authority to 
make decisions or otherwise engage in practices or activities that 
determine, or significantly influence,
    (A) The nature or types of services offered by such an applicant or 
licensee;
    (B) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (C) The prices charged for such services.
    (ix) Any licensee or its affiliate who enters into a joint marketing 
arrangement with an applicant or licensee, or its affiliate, shall be 
considered to have an attributable interest, if such applicant or 
licensee, or its affiliate, has authority to make decisions or otherwise 
engage in practices or activities that determine, or significantly 
influence,
    (A) The nature or types of services offered by such an applicant or 
licensee;
    (B) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (C) The prices charged for such services.

photocopy, licensees may instead make available at each regularly 
attended control point the address or location where the licensee's 
current authorization and other records may be found. The station call 
sign must be clearly and legibly marked on or near every transmitting 
facility, other than mobile transmitters, of the station.


<R05>
Sec. 22.305  Operator and maintenance requirements.

    FCC operator permits and licenses are not required to operate, 
repair or maintain equipment authorized in the Public Mobile Services. 
Station licensees are responsible for the proper operation and 
maintenance of their stations, and for compliance with FCC rules.


<R05>
Sec. 22.307  Operation during emergency.

    Licensees of stations in the Public Mobile services may, during a 
period of emergency in which normal communications facilities are 
disrupted as a result of hurricane, flood, earthquake or other natural 
disaster, civil unrest,

[[Page 131]]

widespread vandalism, national emergencies or emergencies declared by 
Executive Order of the President, use their stations to temporarily 
provide emergency communications services in a manner or configuration 
not normally allowed by this part, provided that such operations comply 
with the provisions of this section.
    (a) Technical limitations. Public Mobile stations providing 
temporary emergency communications service must not transmit:
    (1) On channels other than those authorized for normal operations.
    (2) With power in excess of that authorized for normal operations;
    (3) Emission types other than those authorized for normal 
operations.
    (b) Discontinuance. Temporary emergency use of Public Mobile

Transmission of station identification may be temporarily delayed to 
avoid interrupting the continuity of any public communication in 
progress, provided that station identification is transmitted at the 
conclusion of that public communication.
    (c) Station identification must be transmitted by telephony using 
the English language or by telegraphy using the international Morse 
code, and in a form that can be received using equipment appropriate for 
the modulation type employed, and understood without the use of 
unscrambling devices, except that, alternatively, station identification 
may be transmitted digitally, provided that the licensee provides the 
Commission with information sufficient to decode the digital 
transmission to ascertain the call sign. Station identification 
comprises transmission of the call sign assigned by the Commission to 
the station, however, the following may be used in lieu of the call 
sign.
    (1) For transmission from subscriber operated transmitters, the 
telephone number or other designation assigned by the carrier, provided 
that a written record of such designations is maintained by the carrier;
    (2) For general aviation airborne mobile stations in the Air-Ground

prejudice or discrimination based upon sex, race, color, religion, or 
national origin, from the licensee's personnel policies and practices 
and working conditions.
    (v) Conduct a continuing review of job structure and employment 
practices and adopt positive recruitment, training, job design and other 
measures needed in order to ensure genuine equality of opportunity to 
participate fully in all organizational units, occupations and levels of 
responsibility.
    (2) The program must reasonably address specific concerns through 
policies and actions as set forth in this paragraph, to the extent that 
they are appropriate in consideration of licensee size, location and 
other factors.
    (i) To assure nondiscrimination in recruiting. (A) Posting notices 
in the licensee's offices informing applicants for employment of their 
equal employment rights and their right to notify the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Federal Communications Commission 
(FCC), or other appropriate agency. Where a substantial number of 
applicants are Spanish-surnamed Americans, such notice should be posted 
in both Spanish and English.
    (B) Placing a notice in bold type on the employment application 
informing prospective employees that discrimination because of sex, 
race, color, religion or national origin is prohibited, and that they 
may notify the EEOC, the FCC or other appropriate agency if they believe 
they have been discriminated against.

Instructing employees of the licensee who make hiring decisions that all 
applicants for all jobs are to be considered without discrimination.
    (B) Where union agreements exist, cooperating with the union or 
unions in the development of programs to assure qualified minority 
persons or females of equal opportunity for employment, and including an 
effective nondiscrimination clause in new or renegotiated union 
agreements.

[[Page 133]]

    (C) Avoiding use of selection techniques or tests that have the 
effect of discriminating against minority groups or females.
    (iii) To assure nondiscriminatory placement and promotion. (A) 
Instructing employees of the licensee who make decisions on placement 
and promotion that minority employees and females are to be considered 
without discrimination, and that job areas in which there is little or 
no minority or female representation should be reviewed to determine 
whether this results from discrimination.
    (B) Giving minority groups and female employees equal opportunity 
for positions which lead to higher positions. Inquiring as to the 
interest and skills of all lower-paid employees with respect to any of 
the higher-paid positions, followed by assistance, counseling, and 
effective measures to enable employees with interest and potential to 
qualify themselves for such positions.
    (C) Reviewing seniority practices to insure that such practices are 
nondiscriminatory and do not have a discriminatory effect.
    (D) Avoiding use of selection techniques or tests that have the 
effect of discriminating against minority groups or females.

employees shall file with the FCC, no later than May 31st following the 
grant of that licensee's first Public Mobile Services authorization, a 
statement describing fully its current equal employment opportunity 
program, indicating specific practices to be followed in order to assure 
equal employment opportunity on the basis of sex, race, color, religion 
or national origin in such aspects of employment practices as regards 
recruitment, selection, training, placement, promotion, pay, working 
conditions, demotion, layoff and termination. Any licensee having 16 or 
more full-time employees that changes its existing equal employment 
opportunity program shall file with the FCC, no later than May 31st 
thereafter, a revised statement reflecting the change(s).

    Note to paragraph (b) of Sec. 22.321: Licensees having 16 or more 
full-time employees that were granted their first Public Mobile Services 
authorization prior to January 1, 1995, and do not have a current EEO 
statement on file with the FCC, must file such statement, required by 
paragraph (b) of this section, no later than May 31, 1995.

    (c) Report of complaints filed against licensees. Each licensee, 
regardless of how many employees it has, shall submit an annual report 
to the FCC no later than May 31st of each year indicating whether any 
complaints regarding violations by the licensee or equal employment 
provisions of Federal, State, Territorial, or local law have been filed 
before anybody having competent jurisdiction.
    (1) The report should state the parties involved, the date filing, 
the courts or agencies before which the matters have been heard, the 
appropriate file number (if any), and the respective disposition or 
current status of any such complaints.
    (2) Any licensee who has filed such information with the EEOC may 
file a notification of such filing with the FCC in lieu of a report.
    (d) Complaints of violations of Equal Employment Programs. 
Complaints alleging employment discrimination against a common carrier 
licensee are considered by the FCC in the following manner:
    (1) If a complaint raising an issue of discrimination is received 
against a licensee who is within the jurisdiction of the EEOC, it is 
submitted to that agency. The FCC maintains a liaison with that agency 
that keeps the FCC informed of the disposition of complaints filed 
against common carrier licensees.
    (2) Complaints alleging employment discrimination against a common 
carrier licensee who does not fall under the jurisdiction of the EEOC 
but is covered by appropriate enforceable State law, to which penalties 
apply, may be submitted by the FCC to the respective State agency.

[[Page 134]]

    (3) Complaints alleging employment discrimination against a common 
carrier licensee who does not fall under the jurisdiction of the EEOC or 
an appropriate State law, are accorded appropriate treatment by the FCC.
    (4) The FCC will consult with the EEOC on all matters relating to 
the evaluation and determination of compliance by the common carrier 
licensees with the principles of equal employment as set forth herein.
    (5) Complaints indicating a general pattern of disregard of equal 
employment practices which are received against a licensee that is 
required to file an employment report to the FCC under Sec. 1.815(a) of 
this chapter are investigated by the FCC.
    (e) FCC records. A copy of every annual employment report, equal 
employment opportunity program statement, reports on complaints 
regarding violation of equal employment provisions of Federal, State, 
Territorial, or local law, and copies of all exhibits, letters, and 
other documents filed as part thereof, all amendments thereto, all 
correspondence between the licensee and the FCC pertaining to the 
reports after they have been filed and all documents incorporated 
therein by reference, are open for public inspection at the offices of 
the FCC.
    (f) Licensee records. Each licensee required to file annual 
employment reports (pursuant to Sec. 1.815(a) of this chapter), equal 
employment opportunity program statements, and annual reports on 
complaints regarding violations of equal employment provisions of 
Federal, State, Territorial, or local law shall maintain for public 
inspection a file containing a copy of each such report and copies of 
all exhibits, letters, and other documents filed as part thereto, all 
correspondence between the licensee and the FCC pertaining to the 
reports after they have been filed and all documents incorporated 
therein by reference. The documents must be retained for a period of 2 
years.

Sec. 22.323  Incidental communication services.

    Carriers authorized to operate stations in the Public Mobile radio 
services may use these stations to provide other communications services 
incidental to the primary public mobile service for which the 
authorizations were issued, provided that:
    (a) The costs and charges of subscribers who do not wish to use 
incidental services are not increased as a result of provision of 
incidental services to other subscribers;
    (b) The quality of the primary public mobile service does not 
materially deteriorate as a result of provision of incidental services, 
and neither growth nor availability of the primary public mobile service 
is significantly diminished as a result of provision of incidental 
services; and
    (c) The provision of the incidental services is not inconsistent 
with the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or with FCC rules and 
policies.

[59 FR 59507, Nov. 17, 1994, as amended at 63 FR 68944, Dec. 14, 1998; 
65 FR 49202, Aug. 11, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 22.325  Control points.

    Each station in the Public Mobile Services must have at least one 
control point and a person on duty who is responsible for station 
operation. This section does not require that the person on duty be at 
the control point or continuously monitor all transmissions of the 
station. However, the control point must have facilities that enable the 
person on duty to turn off the transmitters in the event of a 
malfunction.

                         Technical Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 22.351  Channel assignment policy.

    The channels allocated for use in the Public Mobile Services are 
listed in the applicable subparts of this part. Channels and channel 
blocks are assigned in such a manner as to facilitate the rendition of 
service on an interference-free basis in each service area. Except as 
otherwise provided in this part, each channel or channel block is 
assigned exclusively to one common carrier in each service area. All 
applicants for, and licensees of, stations in the Public Mobile Services 
shall cooperate in the selection and use of channels in order to 
minimize interference and obtain the most efficient use of the allocated 
spectrum.

[[Page 135]]


<R05>
Sec. 22.352  Protection from interference.

    Public Mobile Service stations operating in accordance with FCC 
rules that provide technical channel assignment criteria for the radio 
service and channels involved, all other applicable FCC rules, and the 
terms and conditions of their authorizations are normally considered to 
be non-interfering. If the FCC determines, however, that interference 
that significantly interrupts or degrades a radio service is being 
caused, it may, in accordance with the provisions of sections 303(f) and 
316 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, (47 U.S.C. 303(f), 
316), require modifications to any Public Mobile station as necessary to 
eliminate such interference.
    (a) Failure to operate as authorized. Any licensee causing 
interference to the service of other stations by failing to operate its 
station in full accordance with its authorization and applicable FCC 
rules shall discontinue all transmissions, except those necessary for 
the immediate safety of life or property, until it can bring its station 
into full compliance with the authorization and rules.
    (b) Intermodulation interference. Licensees should attempt to 
resolve such interference by technical means.
    (c) Situations in which no protection is afforded. Except as 
provided elsewhere in this part, no protection from interference is 
afforded in the following situations:
    (1) Interference to base receivers from base or fixed transmitters. 
Licensees should attempt to resolve such interference by technical means 
or operating arrangements.
    (2) Inteference to mobile receivers from mobile transmitters. No 
protection is provided against mobile-to-mobile interference.
    (3) Interference to base receivers from mobile transmitters. No 
protection is provided against mobile-to-base interference.
    (4) Interference to fixed stations. Licensees should attempt to 
resolve such interference by technical means or operating arrangements.
    (5) Anomalous or infrequent propagation modes. No protection is 
provided against interference caused by tropospheric and ionospheric 
propagation of signals.
    (6) Facilities for which the Commission is not notified. No 
protection is provided against interference to the service of any 
additional or modified transmitter operating pursuant to Secs. 1.929 or 
22.165, unless and until the licensee modifies its authorization using 
FCC Form 601.
    (7) In-building radiation systems. No protection is provided against 
interference to the service of in-building radiation systems (see 
Sec. 22.383).

63 FR 68944, Dec. 14, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 22.353  Blanketing interference.

    Licensees of Public Mobile Services stations are responsible for 
resolving cases of blanketing interference in accordance with the 
provisions of this section.
    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, licensees 
must resolve any cases of blanketing interference in their area of 
responsibility caused by operation of their transmitter(s) during a one-
year period following commencement of service from new or modified 
transmitter(s). Interference must be resolved promptly at no cost to the 
complainant.
    (b) The area of responsibility is that area in the immediate 
vicinity of the transmitting antenna of stations where the field 
strength of the electromagnetic radiation from such stations equals or 
exceeds 115 dB<greek-m>V/m. To determine the radial distance to the 
boundary of this area, the following formula must be used:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17NO94.007

where d is the radial distance to the boundary, in kilometers
p is the radial effective radiated power, in kilowatts


The maximum effective radiated power in the pertinent direction, without 
consideration of the antenna's vertical radiation pattern or height, 
must be used in the formula.
    (c) Licensees are not required to resolve blanketing interference to 
mobile

[[Page 136]]

receivers or non-RF devices or blanketing interference occurring as a 
result of malfunctioning or mistuned receivers, improperly installed 
consumer antenna systems, or the use of high gain antennas or antenna 
booster amplifiers by consumers.
    (d) Licensees that install transmitting antennas at a location where 
there are already one or more transmitting antennas are responsible for 
resolving any new cases of blanketing interference in accordance with 
this section.
    (e) Two or more licensees that concurrently install transmitting 
antennas at the same location are jointly responsible for resolving 
blanketing interference cases, unless the FCC can readily determine 
which station is causing the interference, in which case the licensee of 
that station is held fully responsible.
    (f) After the one year period of responsibility to resolve 
blanketing interference, licensees must provide upon request technical 
information to complainants on remedies for blanketing interference.


<R05>
Sec. 22.355  Frequency tolerance.

<R05>
Sec. 22.357  Emission types.

    Any authorized station in the Public Mobile Services may transmit 
any emission type provided that the resulting emission complies with the 
appropriate emission mask. See Secs. 22.359, 22.861 and 22.917.

[61 FR 54099, Oct. 17, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 22.359  Emission masks.

    Unless otherwise indicated in the rules governing a specific radio 
service, all transmitters intended for use in the Public Mobile Services 
must be designed to comply with the emission masks outlined in this 
section. If an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes 
harmful interference, the FCC may, at its discretion, require greater 
attenuation than specified in this section.
    (a) Analog modulation. For transmitters other than those employing 
digital modulation techniques, the mean or peak envelope power of 
adjacent channel emissions must be attenuated below the output mean or 
peak envelope power of the total emission (P, in Watts) in accordance 
with the following schedule:
    (1) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the 
assigned channel by more than 50 percent up to and including 100 percent 
of the authorized bandwidth:

at least 25 dB:

    (2) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the 
assigned channel by more than 100 percent up to and including 250 
percent of the authorized bandwidth:

at least 35 dB:

    (3) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the 
assigned channel by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth:

at least 43 + 10 log P dB, or 80 dB, whichever is the lesser 
attenuation.

    (b) Digital modulation. For transmitters not equipped with an audio 
low pass filter and for transmitters employing digital modulation 
techniques, the mean or peak envelope power of sideband emissions must 
be attenuated below the mean or peak envelope power of the total 
emission (P, in Watts) in accordance with the following schedule:
    (1) For transmitters that operate in the frequency ranges 35 to 44 
MHz, 72 to 73 MHz, 75.4 to 76.0 MHz and 152 to 159 MHz,
    (i) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the 
assigned channel by a displacement frequency f<INF>d</INF>

[[Page 137]]

(in kHz) of more than 5 kHz but not more than 10 kHz:

at least 83 log (f<INF>d</INF><divide>5) dB;

    (ii) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the 
assigned channel by a displacement frequency f<INF>d</INF> (in kHz) of 
more than 10 kHz but not more than 250 percent of the authorized 
bandwidth:

at least 29 log f<INF>d</INF>2<divide>11) dB or 50 dB, whichever is the 
lesser attenuation;

    (iii) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the 
assigned channel by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth:

at least 43 + 10 log P dB, or 80 dB, whichever is the lesser 
attenuation.

    (2) For transmitters that operate in the frequency ranges 450 to 512 
MHz and 929 to 932 MHz,
    (i) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the 
assigned channel by a displacement frequency f<INF>d</INF> (in kHz) of 
more than 5 kHz but not more than 10 kHz:


at least 83 log (f<INF>d</INF><divide>5) dB;

    (ii) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the 
assigned channel by a displacement frequency f<INF>d</INF> (in kHz) of 
more than 10 kHz but not more than 250 percent of the authorized 
bandwidth:

at least 116 log (f<INF>d</INF><divide>6.1) dB, or 50 + 10 log P dB, or 
70 dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation;

    (iii) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the 
assigned channel by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth:

at least 43 + 10 log P dB, or 80 dB, whichever is the lesser 
attenuation.

    (c) Measurement procedure. Either peak or average power may be used, 
provided that the same technique is used for both the adjacent channel 
or sideband emissions and the total emission. The resolution bandwidth 
of the measuring instrument must be set to 300 Hz for measurements on 
any frequency removed from the center frequency of the assigned channel 
by no more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth and 30 kHz for 
measurements on any frequency removed from the center frequency of the 
assigned channel by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth.


<R05>
Sec. 22.361  Standby facilities.

    Licensees of stations in the Public Mobile Services may install 
standby transmitters for the purpose of continuing service in the event 
of failure or during required maintenance of regular transmitters 
without obtaining separate authorization, provided that operation of the 
standby transmitters would not increase the service areas or 
interference potential of the stations, and that such standby 
transmitters use the same antenna as the regular transmitters they 
temporarily replace.

                 Subpart D--Developmental Authorizations


<R05>
Sec. 22.401  Description and purposes of developmental authorizations.

    Communications common carriers may apply for, and the FCC may grant, 
authority to construct and operate one or more transmitters subject to 
the rules in this subpart and other limitations, waivers and/or 
conditions that may be prescribed. Authorizations granted on this basis 
are developmental authorizations. In general, the FCC grants 
developmental authorizations in situations and circumstances where it 
cannot reasonably be determined in advance whether a particular 
transmitter can be operated or a particular service can be provided 
without causing interference to the service of existing stations. For 
example, the FCC may grant developmental authorizations for:
    (a) Field strength surveys to evaluate the technical suitability of 
antenna locations for stations in the Public Mobile Services;
    (b) Experimentation leading to the potential development of a new 
Public Mobile Service or technology; or,
    (c) Stations transmitting on channels in certain frequency ranges, 
to provide a trial period during which it can be individually determined 
whether such stations can operate without causing excessive interference 
to existing services.


<R05>
Sec. 22.403  General limitations.

    The provisions and requirements of this section are applicable to 
all developmental authorizations.
    (a) Developmental authorizations are granted subject to the 
condition that they may be cancelled by the FCC at any time, upon notice 
to the licensee, and without the opportunity for a hearing.
    (b) Except as otherwise indicated in this subpart, developmental 
authorizations normally terminate one year from the date of grant. The 
FCC may, however, specify a different term.
    (c) Stations operating under developmental authorizations must not 
interfere with the services of regularly authorized stations.
    (d) A grant of a developmental authorization does not provide any 
assurance that the FCC will grant an application for regular 
authorization to operate the same transmitter(s), even if operation 
during the developmental period has not caused interference and/or the 
developmental program is successful.


<R05>
Sec. 22.409  Developmental authorization for a new Public Mobile Service or technology.

    The FCC may grant applications for developmental authority to 
construct and operate transmitters for the purpose of developing a new 
Public Mobile Service or a new technology not regularly authorized under 
this part, subject to the requirements of this section. Such 
applications may request the use of any portion of the spectrum 
allocated for Public Mobile Services in the Table of Frequency 
Allocations contained in part 2 of this chapter, regardless of whether 
that spectrum is regularly available under this part. Requests to use 
any portion of the spectrum for a service or purpose other than that 
indicated in the Table of Frequency Allocations in part 2 of this

[[Page 141]]

chapter may be made only in accordance with the provisions of part 5 of 
this chapter.
    (a) Preliminary determination. The FCC will make a preliminary 
determination with respect to the factors in paragraphs (a)(1) through 
(a)(3) of this section before acting on an application for developmental 
authority pursuant to this section. These factors are:
    (1) That the public interest, convenience or necessity warrants 
consideration of the establishment of the proposed service or 
technology;
    (2) That the proposal appears to have potential value to the public 
that could warrant the establishment of the new service or technology;
    (3) That some operational data should be developed for consideration 
in any rule making proceeding which may be initiated to establish such 
service or technology.
    (b) Petition required. Applications for developmental authorizations 
pursuant to this section must be accompanied by a petition for rule 
making requesting the FCC to amend its rules as may be necessary to 
provide for the establishment of the proposed service or technology.
    (c) Application requirements. Authorizations for developmental 
authority pursuant to this section will be issued only upon a showing 
that the applicant has a definite program of research and development 
which has reasonable promise of substantial contribution to the services 
authorized by this part. The application must contain an exhibit 
demonstrating the applicant's technical qualifications to conduct the 
research and development program, including a description of the nature 
and extent of engineering facilities that the applicant has available 
for such purpose. Additionally, the FCC may, in its discretion, require 
a showing of financial qualification.
    (d) Communication service for hire prohibited. Stations authorized 
under developmental authorizations granted pursuant to this section must 
not be used to provide communication service for hire, unless otherwise 
specifically authorized by the FCC.
    (e) Adherence to program. Carriers granted developmental 
authorization pursuant to this section must substantially adhere to the 
program of research and development described in their application for 
developmental authorization, unless the FCC directs otherwise.
    (f) Report requirements. Upon completion of the program of research 
and development, or upon the expiration of the developmental 
authorization under which such program was permitted, or at such times 
during the term of the station authorization as the FCC may deem 
necessary to evaluate the progress of the developmental program, the 
licensee shall submit a comprehensive report, containing:
    (1) A description of the progress of the program and a detailed 
analysis of any result obtained;
    (2) Copies of any publications produced by the program;
    (3) A listing of any patents applied for, including copies of any 
patents issued;
    (4) Copies of any marketing surveys or other measures of potential 
public demand for the new service;
    (5) A description of the carrier's experiences with operational 
aspects of the program including--
    (i) The duration of transmissions on each channel or frequency range 
and the technical parameters of such transmissions; and,
    (ii) Any interference complaints received as a result of operation 
and how these complaints were investigated and resolved.
    (g) Confidentiality. Normally, applications and developmental 
reports are a part of the FCC's public records. However, an applicant or 
licensee may request that the FCC withhold from public records specific 
exhibits, reports and other material associated with a developmental 
authorization.
    (h) Renewal. Expiring developmental authorizations issued pursuant 
to this section may be renewed if the carrier--
    (1) Shows that further progress in the program of research and 
development requires additional time to operate under developmental 
authorization;
    (2) Complied with the reporting requirements of paragraph (f) of 
this section; and,

[[Page 142]]

    (3) Immediately resolved to the FCC's satisfaction all complaints of 
interference caused by the station operating under developmental 
authority.

Sec. 22.411  Developmental authorization of 43 MHz paging transmitters.

    Because of the potential for interference to the intermediate 
frequency stages of receivers in broadcast television sets and video 
recorders, 43 MHz paging channels are assigned only under developmental 
authorizations subject to the requirements of this section, except as 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (a) Carrier responsibility. Carriers so authorized shall operate the 
43 MHz paging service under developmental authority for a period of two 
years. During the two year developmental period, carriers must resolve 
any broadcast television receiver intermediate frequency interference 
problems that may occur as a result of operation of the 43 MHz paging 
transmitter(s). Carriers shall inform subscribers receiving service on 
the channels assigned under developmental authority during the 
developmental period that this service could be terminated by the FCC on 
short notice if such action were to become necessary to eliminate 
interference. Carriers shall notify the appropriate FCC Field Office, in 
advance, of the date on which service to subscribers is to begin.
    (b) Periodic surveys. To determine the extent of any interference to 
broadcast television receivers resulting from operation of 43 MHz paging 
stations authorized pursuant to this section, carriers shall conduct 
semi-annual surveys during the first two years of operation. The first 
such survey is to begin on the date when service to subscribers 
commences. For each survey, the carrier shall contact at least 25 
television viewers to determine whether they have experienced 
interference.
    (1) The carrier shall contact viewers located throughout the 
geographic area encompassed by a 3 kilometer (2 mile) radius of the 43 
MHz paging transmitter antenna site. The carrier must not attempt to 
obtain a misleading survey by contacting only viewers less likely to be 
experiencing interference. For example, the carrier must not contact 
only the viewers located most distant from the paging transmitter 
antenna site. Instead, the carrier shall contact viewers located near 
the paging transmitter antenna site.
    (2) The carrier shall not, in subsequent surveys, contact viewers 
who were contacted in a previous survey; provided that, in the event 
that all of the viewers within 3 kilometers (2 miles) have been 
contacted, viewers located near the paging transmitter antenna site 
shall be contacted again.
    (c) Periodic reports. Following each survey, the carrier shall 
submit to the FCC a written report disclosing and evaluating the extent 
of any interference. These reports must include:
    (1) The number of the report (1 to 4);
    (2) The station call sign;
    (3) The file number of the application that resulted in the 
developmental authorization;
    (4) An exact description of the transmitter location(s);
    (5) The date(s) and time of day when the survey was conducted;
    (6) The survey method used (e.g. telephone, on-site, etc.);
    (7) The names, addresses and telephone numbers of the viewers 
contacted;
    (8) If interference resulted from operation of the 43 MHz paging 
station, a summary of how the interference problem was resolved;
    (9) The names and telephone numbers of any technical personnel 
consulted and/or employed to resolve interference problems.
    (d) Exceptions. The FCC may grant a regular authorization in the 
Paging and Radiotelephone Service for a 43 MHz paging station in the 
following circumstances:
    (1) After the two-year developmental period, provided that broadcast 
TV interference complaints have been resolved by the carrier in a 
satisfactory manner. Licensees that hold a developmental authorization 
for a 43 MHz paging station and wish to request a regular authorization 
must file an application using FCC Form 601 via the ULS prior to the 
expiration of the developmental period.

[[Page 143]]

    (2) In the case of the assignment of or a transfer of control of a 
regular authorization of a 43 MHz paging station in the Paging and 
Radiotelephone Service, provided that the station has been in continuous 
operation providing service with no substantial interruptions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Availability. The FCC may determine whether to issue a paging 
geographic area authorization for any specific channel or channel pair 
in any specific paging geographic area. The FCC may replace existing 
site specific authorizations for facilities on a channel or channel pair 
located in a paging geographic area with a paging geographic area 
authorization for that channel or channel pair, if in its sole 
discretion, the FCC determines that the public interest would be served 
by such replacement.
    (d) Filing windows. The FCC accepts applications for paging 
geographic area authorizations only during filing windows. The FCC 
issues Public Notices announcing in advance the dates of the filing 
windows, and the specific paging geographic areas and channels for which 
applications may be accepted.
    (e) One grant per geographic area. The FCC may grant one and only 
one application for a paging geographic area authorization for any 
specific channel or channel pair in any specific paging geographic area 
defined in paragraph (b) of this section. Selection from among mutually 
exclusive applications for a paging geographic area authorization will 
be made in accordance with the procedures in Secs. 22.131 and 22.200 
through 22.299. If after the selection process but prior to filing a 
``long form'' application, a successful bidder decides to partition the 
paging geographic area, the FCC may require and accept multiple ``long 
form'' applications from the consortium members.
    (f) Exclusive right to expand. During the term of a paging 
geographic area authorization, the FCC does not accept, from anyone 
other than the paging geographic area licensee, any major application 
for authorization to operate a facility that would serve unserved area 
within the paging geographic area specified in that paging geographic 
area authorization, on the channel specified in that paging geographic 
area authorization, unless any extension of the interfering contour of 
the proposed facility falls:
    (1) Within the composite interfering contour of another licensee; 
or,
    (2) Into unserved area and the paging geographic area licensee 
consents to such extension.
    (g) Subsequent applications not accepted. During the term of a 
paging geographic area authorization, the FCC does not accept any 
application for authorization relating to a facility that is or would be 
located within the paging geographic area specified in that paging 
geographic area authorization, on the channel specified in that paging 
geographic area authorization, except in the following situations:

[[Page 146]]

    (1) FCC grant of an application authorizing the construction of the 
facility could have a significant environmental effect as defined by 
Sec. 1.1307 of this chapter. See Sec. 22.115(a)(5).
    (2) Specific international coordination procedures are required, 
prior to assignment of a channel to the facility, pursuant to a treaty 
or other agreement between the United States government and the 
government of Canada or Mexico. See Sec. 22.169.
    (3) The paging geographic area licensee or another licensee of a 
system within the paging geographic area applies to assign its 
authorization or for FCC consent to a transfer of control.
    (h) Adjacent geographic area coordination required. Before 
constructing a facility for which the interfering contour (as defined in 
Sec. 22.537 or Sec. 22.567 of this part, as appropriate for the channel 
involved) would extend into another paging geographic area, a paging 
geographic area licensee must obtain the consent of the relevant co-
channel paging geographic area licensee, if any, into whose area the 
interfering contour would extend. Licensees are expected to cooperate 
fully and in good faith attempt to resolve potential interference 
problems before bringing matters to the FCC. In the event that there is 
no co-channel paging geographic area licensee from whom to obtain 
consent in the area into which the interfering contour would extend, the 
facility may be constructed and operated subject to the condition that, 
at such time as the FCC issues a paging geographic area authorization 
for that adjacent geographic area, either consent must be obtained or 
the facility modified or eliminated such that the interfering contour no 
longer extends into the adjacent geographic area.
    (i) Protection of existing service. All facilities constructed and 
operated pursuant to a paging geographic area authorization must provide 
co-channel interference protection in accordance with Sec. 22.537 or 
Sec. 22.567, as appropriate for the channel involved, to all authorized 
co-channel facilities of exclusive licensees within the paging 
geographic area. Non-exclusive licensees on the thirty-five exclusive 
929 MHz channels are not entitled to exclusive status, and will continue 
to operate under the sharing arrangements established with the exclusive 
licensees and other non-exclusive licensees that were in effect prior to 
February 19, 1997. MEA, EA, and nationwide geographic area licensees 
have the right to share with non-exclusive licensees on the thirty-five 
exclusive 929 MHz channels on a non-interfering basis.
    (j) Site location restriction. The transmitting antenna of each 
facility constructed and operated pursuant to a paging geographic area 
authorization must be located within the paging geographic area 
specified in the authorization.
    (k) Coverage requirements. Failure by an MEA or EA licensee to meet 
either the coverage requirements in paragraphs (k)(1) and (k)(2) of this 
section, or alternatively, the substantial service requirement in 
paragraph (k)(3) of this section, will result in automatic termination 
of authorizations for those facilities that were not authorized, 
constructed, and operating at the time the geographic area authorization 
was granted. MEA and EA licensees have the burden of showing when their 
facilities were authorized, constructed, and operating, and should 
retain necessary records of these sites until coverage requirements are 
fulfilled. For the purpose of this paragraph, to ``cover'' area means to 
include geographic area within the composite of the service contour(s) 
determined by the methods of Secs. 22.537 or 22.567 as appropriate for 
the particular channel involved. Licensees may determine the population 
of geographic areas included within their service contours using either 
the 1990 census or the 2000 census, but not both.
    (1) No later than three years after the initial grant of an MEA or 
EA geographic area authorization, the licensee must construct or 
otherwise acquire and operate sufficient facilities to cover one third 
of the population in the paging geographic area. The licensee must 
notify the FCC at the end of the three-year period pursuant to 
Sec. 1.946 of this chapter, either that it has satisfied this 
requirement or that it plans to satisfy the alternative requirement to 
provide substantial service in accordance with paragraph (k)(3) of this 
section.

[[Page 147]]

    (2) No later than five years after the initial grant of an MEA or EA 
geographic area authorization, the licensee must construct or otherwise 
acquire and operate sufficient facilities to cover two thirds of the 
population in the paging geographic area. The licensee must notify the 
FCC at the end of the five year period pursuant to Sec. 1.946 of this 
chapter, either that it has satisfied this requirement or that it has 
satisfied the alternative requirement to provide substantial service in 
accordance with paragraph (k)(3) of this section.
    (3) As an alternative to the coverage requirements of paragraphs 
(k)(1) and (k)(2) of this section, the paging geographic area licensee 
may demonstrate that, no later than five years after the initial grant 
of its paging geographic area authorization, it provides substantial 
service to the paging geographic area. ``Substantial service'' means 
service that is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of 
mediocre service that would barely warrant renewal.

<R05>
Sec. 22.507  Number of transmitters per station.

    This section concerns the number of transmitters licensed under each 
station authorization in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service, other 
than paging geographic area authorizations.
    (a) Operationally related transmitters. Each station must have at 
least one transmitter. There is no limit to the number of transmitters 
that a station may comprise. However, transmitters within a station 
should be operationally related and/or should serve the same general 
geographical area. Operationally related transmitters are those that 
operate together as a system (e.g., trunked systems, simulcast systems), 
rather than independently.
    (b) Split of large systems. The FCC may split wide-area systems into 
two or more stations for administrative convenience. Except for 
nationwide paging and other operationally related transmitters, 
transmitters that are widely separated geographically are not licensed 
under a single authorization.
    (c) Consolidation of separate stations. The FCC may consolidate 
site-specific contiguous authorizations upon request (FCC Form 601) of 
the licensee, if appropriate under paragraph (a) of this section. Paging 
licensees may include remote, stand-alone transmitters under the single 
system-wide authorization, if the remote, stand-alone transmitter is 
linked to the system via a control/repeater facility or by satellite. 
Including a remote, stand-alone transmitter in a system-wide 
authorization does not alter the limitations provided under 
Sec. 22.503(f) on entities other than the paging geographic area 
licensee. In the alternative, paging licensees may maintain separate 
site-specific authorizations for stand-alone or remote transmitters. The 
earliest expiration date of the authorizations that make up the single 
system-wide authorization will determine the expiration date for the 
system-wide authorization. Licensees must file timely renewal 
applications for site-specific authorizations included in a single 
system-wide authorization request until the request is approved. Renewal 
of the system-wide authorization will be subject to Sec. 1.949 of this 
chapter.
    (d) Replacement of site-by-site authorizations with single 
authorization. After a paging geographic area authorization for a 
channel has been issued, the FCC may, on its own motion, replace the 
authorization(s) of any other licensee (for facilities located within 
that paging geographic area on that channel) with a single replacement 
authorization.

Sec. 22.509  Procedures for mutually exclusive applications in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service.

    Mutually exclusive applications in the Paging and Radiotelephone 
Service, including those that are mutually exclusive with applications 
in the Rural Radiotelephone Service, are processed in accordance with 
Sec. 22.131 and with this section.
    (a) Applications in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service may be 
mutually exclusive with applications in the Rural Radiotelephone Service 
if they

[[Page 148]]

seek authorization to operate facilities on the same channel in the same 
area, or the technical proposals are otherwise in conflict. See 
Sec. 22.567.
    (b) A modification application in either service filed on the 
earliest filing date may cause all later-filed mutually exclusive 
applications of any type in either service to be ``cut off'' (excluded 
from a same-day filing group) and dismissed, pursuant to 
Sec. 22.131(c)(3)(ii) and Sec. 22.131(c)(4).

Sec. 22.513  Partitioning and disaggregation.

    MEA and EA licensees may apply to partition their authorized 
geographic service area or disaggregate their authorized spectrum at any 
time following grant of their geographic area authorizations. Nationwide 
geographic area licensees may apply to partition their authorized 
geographic service area or disaggregate their authorized spectrum at any 
time as of August 23, 1999.
    (a) Application required. Parties seeking approval for partitioning 
and/or disaggregation shall apply for partial assignment of a license 
pursuant to Sec. 1.948 of this chapter.
    (b) Partitioning. In the case of partitioning, requests for 
authorization for partial assignment of a license must include, as 
attachments, a description of the partitioned service area and a 
calculation of the population of the partitioned service area and the 
authorized geographic service area. The partitioned service area shall 
be defined by 120 sets of geographic coordinates at points at every 3 
degrees azimuth from a point within the partitioned service area along 
the partitioned service area boundary unless either an FCC-recognized 
service area is used (e.g., MEA or EA) or county lines are followed. The 
geographical coordinates must be specified in degrees, minutes, and 
seconds to the nearest second latitude and longitude, and must be based 
upon the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83). In the case where FCC-
recognized service areas or county lines are used, applicants need only 
list the specific area(s) through use of FCC designations or county 
names that constitute the partitioned area.
    (c) Disaggregation. Spectrum may be disaggregated in any amount.
    (d) Combined partitioning and disaggregation. Licensees may apply 
for partial assignment of authorizations that propose combinations of 
partitioning and disaggregation.
    (e) License term. The license term for a partitioned license area 
and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original 
licensee's license term as provided for in Sec. 1.955 of this chapter.
    (f) Coverage requirements for partitioning. (1) Parties to a 
partitioning agreement must satisfy at least one of the following 
requirements:
    (i) The partitionee must satisfy the applicable coverage 
requirements set forth in Sec. 22.503(k)(1), (2) and (3) for the 
partitioned license area; or
    (ii) The original licensee must meet the coverage requirements set 
forth in Sec. 22.503(k)(1), (2) and (3) for the entire geographic area. 
In this case, the partitionee must meet only the requirements for 
renewal of its authorization for the partitioned license area.
    (2) Parties seeking authority to partition must submit with their 
partial assignment application a certification signed by both parties 
stating which of the above options they select.
    (3) Partitionees must submit supporting documents showing compliance 
with their coverage requirements as set forth in Sec. 22.503(k)(1), (2) 
and (3).
    (4) Failure by any partitionee to meet its coverage requirements 
will result in automatic cancellation of the partitioned authorization 
without further Commission action.
    (g) Coverage requirements for disaggregation. (1) Parties to a 
disaggregation agreement must satisfy at least one of the following 
requirements:
    (i) Either the disaggregator or disaggregatee must satisfy the 
coverage requirements set forth in Sec. 22.503

[[Page 149]]

(k)(1), (2) and (3) for the entire license area; or
    (ii) Parties must agree to share responsibility for meeting the 
coverage requirements set forth in Sec. 22.503 (k)(1), (2) and (3) for 
the entire license area.
    (2) Parties seeking authority to disaggregate must submit with their 
partial assignment application a certification signed by both parties 
stating which of the above requirements they meet.
    (3) Disaggregatees must submit supporting documents showing 
compliance with their coverage requirements as set forth in Sec. 22.503 
(k)(1), (2) and (3).
    (4) Parties that accept responsibility for meeting the coverage 
requirements and later fail to do so will be subject to automatic 
license cancellation without further Commission action.

Sec. 22.535  Effective radiated power limits.

    The effective radiated power (ERP) of transmitters operating on the 
channels listed in Sec. 22.531 must not exceed the limits in this 
section.
    (a) Maximum ERP. The ERP must not exceed the applicable limits in 
this paragraph under any circumstances.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             Maximum ERP
                   Frequency range (MHz)                       (Watts)

152-159....................................................         1400
931-932....................................................         3500
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Basic power limit. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the ERP of transmitters on the VHF channels must not exceed 500 
Watts.
    (c) Height-power limit. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the ERP of transmitters on the VHF channels must not exceed the 
amount that would result in an average distance to the service contour 
of 32.2 kilometers (20 miles). The average distance to the service 
contour is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of the distances 
determined using the procedures specified in Sec. 22.537 for the eight 
cardinal radial directions, excluding cardinal radial directions for 
which 90% or more of the distance so calculated is over water.
    (d) Encompassed interfering contour areas. Transmitters are exempt 
from the basic power and height-power limits of this section if the area 
within their interfering contours is totally encompassed by the 
interfering contours of operating co-channel base transmitters 
controlled by the same licensee. For the purpose of this paragraph, 
operating transmitters are authorized transmitters that are providing 
service to subscribers.
    (e) Adjacent channel protection. The ERP of transmitters must not 
exceed 500 Watts if they:
    (1) Transmit on a channel in the 152-159 MHz frequency range and are 
located less than 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) from any station licensed in 
the Private Radio Services that receives on an adjacent channel; or,
    (2) Transmit on channel 158.10 or 158.70 MHz and are located less 
than 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) from any station licensed in the Public 
Mobile Services that receives on either of the following adjacent 
channels: 158.07 MHz or 158.67 MHz.
    (f) Signal boosters. The effective radiated power of signal boosters 
must not

[[Page 152]]

exceed 5 watts ERP under any normal operating condition.

<R05>
Sec. 22.537  Technical channel assignment criteria.

    The rules in this section establish technical assignment criteria 
for the channels listed in Sec. 22.531. These criteria permit channel 
assignments to be made in a manner such that reception by public paging 
receivers of signals from base transmitters, within the service area of 
such base transmitters, is protected from interference caused by the 
operation of independent co-channel base transmitters.
    (a) Contour overlap. The FCC may grant an application requesting 
assignment of a channel to a proposed base transmitter only if:
    (1) The interfering contour of the proposed transmitter does not 
overlap the service contour of any protected co-channel transmitter 
controlled by a carrier other than the applicant, unless that carrier 
has agreed in writing to accept any interference that may result from 
operation of the proposed transmitter; and,
    (2) The service contour of the proposed transmitter does not overlap 
the interfering contour of any protected co-channel transmitter 
controlled by a carrier other than the applicant, unless the applicant 
agrees to accept any interference that may result from operation of the 
protected co-channel transmitter; and,
    (3) The area and/or population to which service would be provided by 
the proposed transmitter is substantial, and service gained would exceed 
that lost as a result of agreements to accept interference.
    (b) Protected transmitter. For the purposes of this section, 
protected transmitters are authorized transmitters for which there is a 
current FCC public record and transmitters proposed in prior-filed 
pending applications.
    (c) VHF service contour. For paging stations transmitting on the VHF 
channels, the distance from the transmitting antenna to the service 
contour along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows:
d=1.243 x h<SUP>0.40</SUP> x p<SUP>0.20</SUP>
where d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts
    (1) Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 
must be used as the value for h in the above formula.
    (2) The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than 
27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction or 0.1 Watt, whichever 
is more.
    (3) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the service 
contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is 
routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function 
of angle. However, in resolving petitions to deny, the FCC may calculate 
the distance to the service contour using the formula in paragraph (c) 
of this section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the inter-station 
radial and additional radials above and below the inter-station radial 
at 2.5 deg. intervals.
    (d) VHF interfering contour. For paging stations transmitting on the 
VHF channels, the distance from the transmitting antenna to the 
interfering contour along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows:
d=6.509 x h<SUP>0.28</SUP> x p<SUP>0.17</SUP>
where d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts
    (1) Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 
must be used as the value for h in the above formula.
    (2) The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than 
27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction or 0.1 Watt, whichever 
is more.
    (3) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the interfering 
contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is 
routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function 
of angle. In resolving petitions to deny, however, the FCC may calculate 
the distance to the interfering contour using the formula in paragraph 
(d) of this section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the inter-station 
radial and additional radials

[[Page 153]]

above and below the inter-station radial at 2.5 deg. intervals.
    (e) 931 MHz service contour. For paging stations transmitting on the 
931 MHz channels, the service contour is a circle, centered on the 
transmitting antenna, with a radius determined from Table E-1 of this 
section.

    (g) In-building radiation systems. The locations of in-building 
radiation systems must be within the service contour(s) of the 
licensee's authorized transmitter(s) on the same channel. In-building 
radiation systems are not protected facilities, and therefore do not 
have service or interfering contours.

compliance with Sec. 22.165 and notwithstanding paragraphs (e) and (f) 
of this section, signal boosters operating on the 931 MHz channels with 
an antenna HAAT not exceeding 30 meters (98 feet) are deemed to have as 
a service contour a circle with a radius of 1.0 kilometer (0.6 mile) and 
as an interfering contour a circle with a radius of 10 kilometers (6.2 
miles).

Sec. 22.539  Additional channel policies.

    The rules in this subsection govern the processing of applications 
for a paging channel when the applicant has applied for or been granted 
an authorization for other paging channels in the

[[Page 154]]

same geographic area. This section applies to applications proposing to 
use the channels listed in Sec. 22.531, excluding the nationwide network 
paging channels and broadcast station subcarriers, or the channels 
listed in Sec. 22.561, where the application proposes to use those 
channels to provide paging service only. The general policy of the 
Commission is to assign one paging channel in an area to a carrier per 
application cycle. That is, a carrier must apply for one paging channel, 
receive the authorization, construct the station, provide service to the 
subscribers, and notify the Commission of commencement of service to 
subscribers by using FCC Form 601 before applying for an additional 
paging channel in that area. This notification must be sent by 
electronic filing via the ULS.
    (a) VHF transmitters in same area. Any transmitter on any VHF 
channel listed in Sec. 22.531 is considered to be in the same geographic 
area as another transmitter on any other VHF channel listed in 
Sec. 22.531 if:
    (1) One transmitter location is within the service area of the other 
transmitter; or,
    (2) The area within the overlap of the service contours of the two 
transmitters constitutes 50 percent or more of the service area of 
either of the transmitters.
    (b) 931 MHz transmitters in same area. Any transmitter on any 931 
MHz channel is considered to be in the same geographic area as another 
transmitter on any channel listed in Sec. 22.531 if it is located less 
than 64.4 kilometers (40 miles) from the transmitter. Likewise, any 
transmitter on any channel listed in Sec. 22.531 is considered to be in 
the same geographic area as another transmitter on any 931 MHz channel 
if it is located less than 64.4 kilometers (40 miles) from that 
transmitter.
    (c) Initial channel. The FCC will not assign more than one channel 
for new paging stations. Paging stations are considered to be new if 
there are no authorized transmitters on any channel listed in 
Sec. 22.531 controlled by the applicant in the same geographic area.
    (d) Additional channel. Applications for transmitters to be located 
in the same geographic area as an authorized station controlled by the 
applicant, but to operate on a different channel, are considered as 
requesting an additional channel for the authorized station, unless 
paragraph (e) of this section applies.
    (e) Additional transmitters on same channel. Notwithstanding other 
provisions of this section, the following applications are not 
considered to be requests for an additional paging channel:
    (1) Applications for transmitters to be located in the same 
geographic area as an authorized station controlled by the applicant, 
and to operate on the same paging channel;
    (2) Applications for transmitters to be located within a paging 
geographic area for which the applicant holds the paging geographic area 
authorization for the requested channel; and,
    (3) Applications for paging geographic area authorizations.
    (f) Amendment of pending application. If the FCC receives and 
accepts for filing an application for a transmitter to be located in the 
same geographic area as a transmitter proposed in a pending application 
previously filed by the applicant, but on a different channel, the 
subsequent application is considered as a major amendment to change the 
technical proposal of the prior application, unless paragraph (e) 
applies. The filing date of any application so amended is the date the 
FCC received the subsequent application.
    (g) Dismissal of premature applications for additional channel. If 
the FCC receives an application requesting an additional channel for an 
authorized station prior to receiving notification that the station is 
providing service to subscribers on the authorized channel(s), the FCC 
may dismiss that application without prejudice in accordance with 
Sec. 22.128.

Sec. 22.551  Nationwide network paging service.

    The rules in this section govern the application for and provision 
of nationwide network paging service on the channels reserved 
specifically for such service in Sec. 22.531(b).

[[Page 155]]

    (a) Nationwide network providers; organizers. If and when a 
nationwide network paging channel becomes available for assignment, the 
FCC will issue a Public Notice inviting applications from eligibles 
seeking to provide or organize a nationwide network paging service. The 
Public Notice will provide complete details regarding application 
requirements and procedures.
    (b) Licensing. The FCC may issue a paging geographic area 
authorization to the nationwide network provider or organizer. All 
transmissions of nationwide network messages on the channels reserved 
for such service in Sec. 22.531(b) are authorized solely under the 
authorization(s) of the nationwide network provider or organizer, 
notwithstanding whether or not the messages pass through facilities 
owned, operated or licensed to affiliated local carriers.

Sec. 22.559  Paging application requirements.

    In addition to information required by subparts B and D and 
Sec. 22.529, applications for authorization to operate a paging 
transmitter on the channels listed in Sec. 22.531, other than 
applications for a paging geographic area authorization, must contain 
the applicable supplementary information described in this section.
    (a) Interference exhibit. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section, an exhibit demonstrating compliance with Sec. 22.537 with 
regard to protected transmitters is required for applications to operate 
a transmitter on the VHF channels. This exhibit must:
    (1) Identify each protected transmitter located within 109 
kilometers (68 miles) of the proposed transmitter in directions in which 
the distance to the interfering contour is 76.5 kilometers (47.5 miles) 
or less, and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) of the proposed 
transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering 
contour exceeds 76.5 kilometers (47.5 miles).
    (2) For each protected transmitter identified, show the results of 
distance calculations indicating that there would be no overlap of 
service and interfering contours, or alternatively, indicate that the 
licensee of or applicant for the protected transmitter and/or the 
applicant, as required, have agreed in writing to accept any 
interference resulting from operation of the proposed transmitter.
    (b) Encompassment exhibit. An exhibit showing that the area within 
the interfering contour of the proposed transmitter would be totally 
encompassed by interfering contours of operating co-channel base 
transmitters controlled by the applicant is required for applications to 
operate a transmitter with ERP exceeding the basic power and height-
power limits of Sec. 22.535. For VHF transmitters, this encompassment 
exhibit may substitute for the interference exhibit required in 
paragraph (a) of this section.

one-way or two-way public land mobile service, either individually or 
collectively under a paging geographic area authorization. The paging 
geographic areas used for these channels are the EAs (see 
Sec. 22.503(b)(3)). These channels may be assigned for use by mobile or 
base transmitters as indicated, and or by fixed transmitters (including 
control, repeater or other fixed transmitters). The mobile channels may 
also be assigned for use by base or fixed transmitters under certain 
circumstances (see Sec. 22.567(h)). Unless otherwise indicated, all 
channels have a bandwidth of 20 kHz and are designated by their center 
frequencies in MegaHertz.

<R05>
Sec. 22.563  Provision of rural radiotelephone service upon request.

    Channels in the frequency ranges 152.03-152.81, 157.77-158.67, 
454.025-454.650 and 459.025-459.650 MHz, inclusive, are also allocated 
for assignment in the Rural Radiotelephone Service. Stations in the 
Paging and Radiotelephone Service that provide two-way public mobile 
service on these channels must also provide rural radiotelephone service 
upon request from a subscriber.


<R05>
Sec. 22.565  Transmitting power limits.

    The transmitting power of base, mobile and fixed transmitters 
operating on the channels listed in Sec. 22.561 must not exceed the 
limits in this section.
    (a) Maximum ERP. The effective radiated power (ERP) of base and 
fixed transmitters must not exceed the applicable limits in this 
paragraph under any circumstances.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             Maximum ERP
                   Frequency range (MHz)                       (watts)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

157-159....................................................          150
454-455....................................................         3500
459-460....................................................          150
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Basic power limit. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the ERP of base transmitters must not exceed 500 Watts.
    (c) Height-power limits. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the ERP of base transmitters must not exceed the amount that 
would result in an average distance to the service contour of 41.6 
kilometers (26 miles) for VHF channels or 30.7 kilometers (19 miles) for 
UHF channels. The average distance to the service contour is calculated 
by taking the arithmetic mean of the distances determined using the 
procedures specified in Sec. 22.567 for the eight cardinal radial 
directions, excluding cardinal radial directions for which 90% or more 
of the distance so calculated is over water.
    (d) Encompassed interfering contour areas. Base transmitters are 
exempt from the basic power and height-power limits of this section if 
the area within their interfering contours is totally encompassed by the 
interfering contours of operating co-channel based transmitters 
controlled by the same licensee. For the purpose of this paragraph, 
operating transmitters are authorized transmitters that are providing 
service to subscribers.
    (e) Adjacent channel protection. The ERP of base and fixed 
transmitters must not exceed 500 Watts if they transmit on channel 
454.025 MHz and are located less than 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) from any 
Private Radio Services station receiving on adjacent channel 454.0000 
MHz.
    (f) Mobile transmitters. The transmitter output power of mobile 
transmitters must not exceed 60 watts.
    (g) Other transmitters. The ERP of dispatch and auxiliary test 
transmitters must not exceed 100 watts.


<R05>
Sec. 22.567  Technical channel assignment criteria.

    The rules in this section establish technical assignment criteria 
for the channels listed in Sec. 22.561. The criteria in paragraphs (a) 
through (f) of this section permit channel assignments to be made in a 
manner such that reception by public mobile receivers of signals from 
base transmitters, within the service area of such base transmitters, is 
protected from interference caused by the operation of independent co-
channel base and fixed transmitters in the Paging and Radiotelephone 
Service and central office stations, including

[[Page 157]]

Basic Exchange Telephone Radio Systems (BETRS), in the Rural 
Radiotelephone Service. Additional criteria in paragraph (g) of this 
section permit channel assignments to be made in a manner such that 
BETRS communications are protected from interference caused by the 
operation of independent co-channel base and fixed transmitters in the 
Paging and Radiotelephone Service and other central office stations in 
the Rural Radiotelephone Service. Separate criteria in paragraph (h) of 
this section apply only to assignment of the channels designated in 
Sec. 22.561 as mobile channels to base and fixed transmitters, and 
permit these channel assignments to be made in a manner such that 
reception by public base and fixed receivers of signals from associated 
mobile and fixed transmitters is protected from interference caused by 
the operation of independent co-channel base and fixed transmitters.
    (a) Contour overlap. The FCC may grant an application requesting 
assignment of a channel to a proposed base, fixed or central office 
station transmitter only if:
    (1) The interfering contour of the proposed transmitter does not 
overlap the service contour of any protected co-channel transmitter 
controlled by a carrier other than the applicant, unless that carrier 
has agreed in writing to accept any interference that may result from 
operation of the proposed transmitter; and
    (2) The service contour of the proposed transmitter does not overlap 
the interfering contour of any protected co-channel transmitter 
controlled by a carrier other than the applicant, unless the application 
contains a statement that the applicant agrees to accept any 
interference that may result from operation of the protected co-channel 
transmitter; and
    (3) The area and/or population to which service would be provided by 
the proposed transmitter is substantial, and service gained would exceed 
that lost as a result of agreements to accept interference.
    (b) Protected transmitter. For the purposes of this section, 
protected transmitters are authorized transmitters for which there is a 
current FCC public record and transmitters proposed in prior-filed 
pending applications, in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service and the 
Rural Radiotelephone Service.
    (c) VHF service contour. For base stations transmitting on the VHF 
channels, the radial distance from the transmitting antenna to the 
service contour along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows:

d=1.609 x h<SUP>0.40</SUP>  x p<SUP>0.20</SUP>

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts
    (1) Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 
must be used as the value for h in the above formula.
    (2) The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than 
27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction, or 0.1 Watt, whichever 
is more.
    (3) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the service 
contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is 
routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function 
of angle. However, in resolving petitions to deny, the FCC may calculate 
the distance to the service contour using the formula in paragraph (c) 
of this section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the inter-station 
radial and additional radials above and below the inter-station radial 
at 2.5 deg. intervals.
    (d) VHF interfering contour. For base and fixed stations 
transmitting on the VHF channels, the radial distance from the 
transmitting antenna to the interfering contour along each cardinal 
radial is calculated as follows:
    (1) If the radial antenna HAAT is less than 150 meters:

d=8.577 x h<SUP>0.24</SUP> x p<SUP>0.19</SUP>

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 must 
be used as the value for h in the above formula.
    (2) If the radial antenna HAAT is 150 meters or more:

d=12.306 x h<SUP>0.23</SUP> x p<SUP>0.14</SUP>

[[Page 158]]


where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    (3) The value used for p in the above formulas must not be less than 
27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction, or 0.1 Watt, whichever 
is more.
    (4) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the interfering 
contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is 
routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function 
of angle. However, in resolving petitions to deny, the FCC may calculate 
the distance to the interfering contour using the appropriate formula in 
paragraph (d) of this section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the 
inter-station radial and additional radials above and below the inter-
station radial at 2.5 deg. intervals.
    (e) UHF service contour. For base stations transmitting on the UHF 
channels, the radial distance from the transmitting antenna to the 
service contour along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows:

d=1.726 x h<SUP>0.35</SUP> x p<SUP>0.18</SUP>

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    (1) Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 
must be used as the value for h in the above formula.
    (2) The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than 
27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction, or 0.1 Watt, whichever 
is more.
    (3) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the service 
contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is 
routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function 
of angle. However, in resolving petitions to deny, the FCC may calculate 
the distance to the service contour using the formula in paragraph (e) 
of this section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the inter-station 
radial and addition radials above and below the below the inter-station 
radial at 2.5 deg. intervals.
    (f) UHF interfering contour. For base and fixed stations 
transmitting on the UHF channels, the radial distance from the 
transmitting antenna to the interfering contour along each cardinal 
radial is calculated as follows:
    (1) If the radial antenna HAAT is less than 150 meters:

d=9.471 x h<SUP>0.23</SUP> x p<SUP>0.15</SUP>

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 must 
be used as the value for h in the above formula.
    (2) If the radial antenna HAAT is 150 meters or more:

d=6.336 x h<SUP>0.31</SUP> x p<SUP>0.15</SUP>

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    (3) The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than 
27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction, or 0.1 Watt, whichever 
is more.
    (4) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the interfering 
contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is 
routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function 
of angle. However, in resolving petitions to deny, the FCC may calculate 
the distance to the interfering contour using the appropriate formula in 
paragraph (f) of this section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the 
inter-station radial and additional radials above and below the inter-
station radial at 2.5 deg. intervals.
    (g) Protection for BETRS. In applying the provisions of paragraph 
(a) of this section, if either or both of the transmitters involved is a 
BETRS central office station, the following contour substitutions must 
be used:
    (1) The service contour of the BETRS central office station(s) is a 
circle, centered on the central office station antenna, with a radius of 
40 kilometers (25 miles).
    (2) The interfering contour of any station of any type, when 
determining whether it would overlap the service

[[Page 159]]

contour of a BETRS central office station, is calculated as follows:

d=36.364 x h<SUP>0.2</SUP> x  p<SUP>0.1</SUP>

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 must 
be used as the value for h in the above formula. The value used for p in 
the above formula must not be less than 27 dB less than the maximum ERP 
in any direction, or 0.1 Watt, whichever is more.
    (h) Assignment of mobile channels to base or fixed transmitters. 
Mobile channels may be assigned to base or fixed transmitters if the 
following criteria are met:
    (1) The paired base channel, as designated in Sec. 22.561, is 
assigned to base transmitters in the same geographical area operated by 
the same licensee.
    (2) The authorization is granted subject to the condition that no 
interference be caused to fixed receivers in use on or prior to the date 
of the grant.


<R05>
Sec. 22.569  Additional channel policies.

    The rules in this section govern the processing of applications for 
a mobile channel when the applicant has applied or been granted an 
authorization for other mobile channels in the same geographic area. 
This section applies to applications proposing to use the channels 
listed in Sec. 22.561, except applications that propose to use these 
channels to provide paging service only, which are subject to 
Sec. 22.539, instead of this section. The general policy of the FCC is 
to assign no more than two channels in an area to a carrier per 
application cycle. That is, a carrier must apply for no more than two 
channels, receive the authorization, construct the station, provide 
service to subscribers, and notify the FCC of commencement of service to 
subscribers (FCC Form 489) before applying for additional mobile 
channels in that area.
    (a) Transmitters in same area. Any transmitter on any channel listed 
in Sec. 22.561 is considered to be in the same geographic area as 
another transmitter or any other channel listed in Sec. 22.561 if:
    (1) One transmitter location is within the service area of the other 
transmitter; or,
    (2) The area within the overlap of the service contours of the two 
transmitters constitutes 50 percent or more of the service area of 
either of the transmitters.
    (b) Initial channel. The FCC will not assign more than two channels 
for new stations. Stations are considered to be new if there are no 
authorized transmitters on any channel listed in Sec. 22.561 controlled 
by the applicant in the same geographic area.
    (c) Additional channel. Applications for transmitters to be located 
in the same geographic area as an authorized station controlled by the 
applicant, but to operate on a different channel, are considered as 
requests for an additional channel for the authorized station, unless 
paragraph (d) of this section applies.
    (d) Additional transmitters on same channel. Notwithstanding other 
provisions of this section, the following applications are not 
considered to be requests for an additional channel:
    (1) Applications for transmitters to be located in the same 
geographic area as an authorized station controlled by the applicant, 
and to operate on the same paging channel;
    (2) Applications for transmitters to be located within a paging 
geographic area for which the applicant holds the paging geographic area 
authorization for the requested channel; and,
    (3) Applications for paging geographic area authorizations.
    (e) [Reserved]
    (f) Dismissal of application constituting cumulative request for 
more than two channels. If the FCC receives an application for a 
transmitter to be located in the same geographic area as a transmitter 
proposed in a pending application previously filed by the applicant, but 
on different channels such that, considered together, the applications 
would constitute a request for more than two channels, the FCC may 
dismiss the subsequent application without prejudice.
    (g) Dismissal of premature applications for additional channel. If 
the FCC receives an application requesting two additional channels (or 
one additional

[[Page 160]]

channel) for an authorized station prior to receiving notification that 
the station is providing service to subscribers on all (or all except 
one) of the authorized channels, the FCC may dismiss that application 
without prejudice.

<R05>
Sec. 22.571  Responsibility for mobile stations.

    Mobile stations that are subscribers in good standing to a two-way 
service in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service, when receiving service 
from that station, are considered to be operating under the 
authorization of that station. Licensees are responsible for exercising 
effective operational control over mobile stations receiving service 
through their stations. Mobile stations that are subscribers in good 
standing to a two-way service in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service, 
while receiving service from a different station, are considered to be 
operating under the authorization of such different station. The 
licensee of such different station is responsible, during such temporary 
period, for exercising effective operational control over such mobile 
stations as if they were subscribers to it.


<R05>
Sec. 22.573  Use of base transmitters as repeaters.

    As an additional function, base transmitters may be used as 
repeaters. Licensees must be able to turn the base transmitter on or off 
from the control point regardless of whether a subscriber-operated 
transmitter is transmitting.


<R05>
Sec. 22.575  Use of mobile channel for remote control of station functions.

    Carriers may remotely control station functions (e.g. shut down or 
reactivate base transmitters, turn aviation obstruction warning lights 
on or off, etc.) using a control transmitter operating on a mobile 
channel, subject to the conditions in this section and in 
Sec. 22.567(h).
    (a) The control transmitter must be capable of overriding 
transmissions from subscriber-operated transmitters if necessary. 
Subscriber-operated transmitters must not be capable of being used to 
deliberately or accidentally prevent the licensee from controlling the 
station.
    (b) The licensee must implement measures designed to prevent station 
functions from being controlled by persons not authorized by the 
licensee to control the station.
    (c) The control transmitter location must be within the composite 
service contour of the licensee's authorized station on the paired base 
channel.


<R05>
Sec. 22.577  Dispatch service.

    Carriers licensed under this subpart may provide dispatch service in 
accordance with the rules in this section.
    (a) Installation without prior FCC approval. A station licensee may 
install or remove dispatch points for subscribers without obtaining 
prior FCC approval. A station licensee may install or remove dispatch 
transmitters for subscribers without applying for specific 
authorization, provided that the following conditions are met.
    (1) Each dispatch transmitter must be able to transmit only on the 
mobile channel that is paired with the channel used by the base station.
    (2) The antenna of the dispatch transmitter must not exceed the 
criteria in Sec. 17.7 of this chapter that determine whether the FAA 
must be notified of the proposed construction.
    (3) The output power of the dispatch transmitter must not exceed 10 
Watts.
    (4) The dispatch transmitter must be incapable of overriding the 
functioning of any control transmitter that may be using the same 
channel.
    (5) The dispatch transmitter must be under the continuous 
supervision of the licensee.
    (b) Notification. Licensees must notify the Commission by filing FCC 
Form 601 whenever a dispatch transmitter is installed pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section. The notification must include the name 
and address of the subscriber(s) for which the dispatch transmitter was 
installed, the location of the dispatch transmitter, the height of 
antenna structure above ground and above mean sea level, the channel(s) 
used, and the call sign and location of the base station.

[[Page 161]]

    (c) Termination without hearing. Operation of a dispatch transmitter 
pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be terminated by 
the FCC without a hearing upon notice to the licensee.
    (d) Dispatch transmitters requiring authorization. A dispatch 
transmitter that does not meet all of the requirements of paragraph (a) 
of this section may be installed only upon the grant of an application 
for authorization by electronically filing FCC Form 601.
    (e) Permissible communications. A dispatch transmitter operated by a 
subscriber may communicate only with mobile transmitters operated by 
that subscriber through the associated base transmitter.

63 FR 68945, Dec. 14, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 22.579  Operation of mobile transmitters across U.S.-Canada border.

    Mobile stations licensed by Canada may receive two-way service while 
in the United States from stations licensed under this part, after 
authorization has been granted by the FCC. Mobile stations that normally 
operate under the authority of base stations licensed under this part 
may receive two-way service while in Canada from stations licensed under 
this part or by Canada, upon authorization by Canada.


<R05>
Sec. 22.589  One-way or two-way application requirements.

    In addition to information required by subparts B and D and 
Sec. 22.529, applications for authorization to operate a paging 
transmitter on the channels listed in Sec. 22.531, other than 
applications for a paging geographic area authorization, must contain 
the applicable supplementary information described in this section.
    (a) Interference exhibit. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section, an exhibit demonstrating compliance with Sec. 22.567 with 
regard to protected transmitters is required. This exhibit must:
    (1) For UHF channels, identify each protected transmitter located 
within 108 kilometers (67 miles) of the proposed transmitter in 
directions in which the distance to the interfering contour is 76.4 
kilometers (47.5 miles) or less, and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) 
of the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the 
interfering contour exceeds 76.4 kilometers (47.5 miles); and identify 
each protected Basic Exchange Telephone Radio System central office 
transmitter in the Rural Radiotelephone Service within 231 kilometers 
(144 miles),
    (2) For VHF channels, identify each protected transmitter located 
within 135 kilometers (84 miles) of the proposed transmitter in 
directions in which the distance to the interfering contour is 93.3 
kilometers (58 miles) or less, and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) of 
the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the 
interfering contour exceeds 93.3 kilometers (58 miles).
    (3) For each protected transmitter identified, show the results of 
distance calculations indicating that there would be no overlap of 
service and interfering contours, or alternatively, indicate that the 
licensee of or applicant for the protected transmitter and/or the 
applicant, as required, have agreed in writing to accept any 
interference resulting from operation of the proposed transmitter.
    (b) Encompassment exhibit. An exhibit showing that the area within 
the interfering contour of the proposed transmitter would be totally 
encompassed by interfering contours of operating co-channel base 
transmitters controlled by the applicant is required for applications to 
operate a transmitter with ERP exceeding the basic power and height-
power limits of Sec. 22.565. This encompassment exhibit may substitute 
for the interference exhibit required in paragraph (a) of this section.

    (a) The 72-76 MHz channels may be assigned under developmental 
authority pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 22.413. The 72-76 MHz 
channels may also be used in point-to-multipoint configurations. The 72-
76 MHz channels are also allocated for assignment in the Private Radio 
Services (see part 90 of this chapter).
    (b) Channels in the frequency ranges 2110-2130 and 2160-2180 MHz are 
also allocated for assignment in the broadband Personal Communications 
Service (see part 24 of this chapter), the Multipoint Distribution 
Service and the Point-to-Point Microwave Radio Service (see part 21 of 
this chapter). Assignment of channels in these ranges is subject to the 
transition rules in Sec. 22.602.
    (c) Channels in the frequency ranges 488.250-490.750 and 491.250-
493.750 MHz may be assigned only to inter-island fixed stations located

Sec. 22.593  Effective radiated power limits.

    The effective radiated power of fixed stations operating on the 
channels listed in Sec. 22.591 must not exceed 150 Watts. The equivalent 
isotropic radiated power of fixed stations operating in the frequency 
ranges 2110-2130 and 2160-2180 MHz must not exceed the limits set forth 
in part 21 of this chapter for stations operating in these frequency 
ranges.


<R05>
Sec. 22.599  Assignment of 72-76 MHz channels.

    Because of the potential for interference to the reception of TV 
Channels 4 and 5 by broadcast television sets and video recorders, 
assignments of the 72-76 MHz channels are subject to the following 
conditions:
    (a) Assignments of 72-76 MHz channels for use within 129 kilometers 
(80 miles) of a full service TV station transmitting on TV Channel 4 or 
5 are subject to the condition that the licensee must eliminate any 
interference caused to television reception on TV Channels 4 and 5. If 
the FCC notifies the licensee of an interference problem and the 
licensee does not resolve the problem within 90 days of such 
notification, operation of the interfering 72-76 MHz fixed station must 
be immediately discontinued.
    (b) 72-76 MHz channels may be assigned for use within 16 kilometers 
(10 miles) of a full service TV station transmitting on TV Channel 4 or 
5 under a developmental authorization, pursuant to Sec. 22.413. However, 
for use within 50 meters (164 feet) of a TV station transmitting on TV 
Channel 4 or 5, 72-76 MHZ channels may be assigned

[[Page 163]]

under a regular authorization, rather than a developmental 
authorization.


<R05>
Sec. 22.601  Assignment of microwave channels.

    Assignment of the microwave channels listed in Sec. 22.591 is 
subject to the transition rules in Sec. 22.602. No new systems will be 
authorized under this part.
    (a) Coordination required. Before filing applications for authority 
to modify existing stations on these channels or major amendments to 
such applications, carriers must coordinate the planned channel usage, 
using the procedure outlined in Sec. 22.150, with affected parties in 
this radio service and the Point-to-Point Microwave Service and the 
Multipoint Distribution Service. Affected parties are licensees and 
other applicants with previously filed pending applications whose 
stations could affect or be affected by the proposed modification of the 
existing station in terms of interference.
    (b) System parameters. In designing a system modification, the 
applicant must select sites, equipment and channels that will avoid 
harmful interference to other users. All parties must cooperate fully 
and make reasonable efforts to resolve technical problems and conflicts 
that may inhibit the most effective and efficient use of the radio 
spectrum; however, a party receiving notification is not obligated to 
suggest changes or re-design a proposal in cases involving conflicts. 
The applicant must identify in the application all parties with which 
the technical proposal was coordinated. In the event that technical 
problems are not resolved or if an affected party does not respond to 
coordination efforts within 30 days after notification, an explanation 
must be contained in the application. Where technical conflicts are 
resolved by an agreement between the parties that requires special 
procedures to reduce the likelihood of harmful interference (such as the 
use of artificial site shielding), or would result in a reduction of 
quality or capacity of either system, the details thereof must be 
contained in the application.
    (c) Bandwidth. Applicants must request the minimum emission 
bandwidth necessary. The FCC does not authorize bandwidths larger than 
800 kHz under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 22.602  Transition of the 2110-2130 and 2160-2180 MHz channels to emerging technologies.

    The microwave channels listed in Sec. 22.591 have been allocated for 
use by emerging technologies (ET) services. No new systems will be 
authorized under this part. The rules in this section provide for a 
transition period during which existing Paging and Radiotelephone 
Service (PARS) licensees using these channels may relocate operations to 
other media or to other fixed channels, including those in other 
microwave bands. For PARS licensees relocating operations to other 
microwave bands, authorization must be obtained under part 101 of this 
chapter.
    (a) Licensees proposing to implement ET services may negotiate with 
PARS licensees authorized to use these channels, for the purpose of 
agreeing to terms under which the PARS licensees would--
    (1) Relocate their operations to other fixed microwave bands or 
other media, or alternatively,
    (2) Accept a sharing arrangement with the ET licensee that may 
result in an otherwise impermissible level of interference to the PARS 
operations.
    (b) PARS operations on these channels will continue to be co-primary 
with other users of this spectrum until two years after the FCC 
commences acceptance of applications for ET services, and until one year 
after an ET licensee initiates negotiations for relocation of the fixed 
microwave licensee's operations.
    (c) Voluntary Negotiations. During the two year voluntary 
negotiation period, negotiations are strictly voluntary and are not 
defined by any parameters. However, if the parties have not reached an 
agreement within one year after the commencement of the voluntary 
period, the PARS licensee must allow the ET licensee (if it so chooses) 
to gain access to the existing facilities to be relocated so that an 
independent third party can examine the PARS licensee's 2 GHz system and 
prepare an estimate of the cost and the time needed to relocate the PARS 
licensee to

[[Page 164]]

comparable facilities. The ET licensee must pay for any such estimate.
    (d) Mandatory Negotiations. If a relocation agreement is not reached 
during the two year voluntary period, the ET licensee may initiate a 
mandatory negotiation period. This mandatory period is triggered at the 
option of the ET licensee, but ET licensees may not invoke their right 
to mandatory negotiation until the voluntary negotiation period has 
expired. Once mandatory negotiations have begun, a PARS licensee may not 
refuse to negotiate and all parties are required to negotiate in good 
faith. Good faith requires each party to provide information to the 
other that is reasonably necessary to facilitate the relocation process. 
In evaluating claims that a party has not negotiated in good faith, the 
FCC will consider, inter alia, the following factors:
    (1) Whether the ET licensee has made a bona fide offer to relocate 
the PARS licensee to comparable facilities in accordance with Section 
101.75(b) of this chapter;
    (2) If the PARS licensee has demanded a premium, the type of premium 
requested (e.g., whether the premium is directly related to relocation, 
such as system-wide relocations and analog-to-digital conversions, 
versus other types of premiums), and whether the value of the premium as 
compared to the cost of providing comparable facilities is 
disproportionate (i.e., whether there is a lack of proportion or 
relation between the two);
    (3) What steps the parties have taken to determine the actual cost 
of relocation to comparable facilities;
    (4) Whether either party has withheld information requested by the 
other party that is necessary to estimate relocation costs or to 
facilitate the relocation process. Any party alleging a violation of our 
good faith requirement must attach an independent estimate of the 
relocation costs in question to any documentation filed with the 
Commission in support of its claim. An independent cost estimate must 
include a specification for the comparable facility and a statement of 
the costs associated with providing that facility to the incumbent 
licensee.
    (e) Involuntary period. After the periods specified in paragraph (b) 
of this section have expired, ET licensees may initiate involuntary 
relocation procedures under the Commission's rules. ET licensees are 
obligated to pay to relocate only the specific microwave links to which 
their systems pose an interference problem. Under involuntary 
relocation, a PARS licensee is required to relocate, provided that:
    (1) The ET applicant, provider, licensee or representative 
guarantees payment of relocation costs, including all engineering, 
equipment, site and FCC fees, as well as any legitimate and prudent 
transaction expenses incurred by the PARS licensee that are directly 
attributable to an involuntary relocation, subject to a cap of two 
percent of the hard costs involved. Hard costs are defined as the actual 
costs associated with providing a replacement system, such as equipment 
and engineering expenses. ET licensees are not required to pay PARS 
licensees for internal resources devoted to the relocation process. ET 
licensees are not required to pay for transaction costs incurred by PARS 
licensees during the voluntary or mandatory periods once the involuntary 
period is initiated or for fees that cannot be legitimately tied to the 
provision of comparable facilities;
    (2) The ET applicant, provider, licensee or representative completes 
all activities necessary for implementing the replacement facilities, 
including engineering and cost analysis of the relocation procedure and, 
if radio facilities are involved, identifying and obtaining, on the 
incumbents behalf, new channels and frequency coordination; and,
    (3) The ET applicant, provider, licensee or representative builds 
the replacement system and tests it for comparability with the existing 
2 GHz system.
    (f) Comparable Facilities. The replacement system provided to an 
incumbent during an involuntary relocation must be at least equivalent 
to the existing PARS system with respect to the following three factors:
    (1) Throughput. Communications throughput is the amount of 
information transferred within a system in a

[[Page 165]]

given amount of time. If analog facilities are being replaced with 
analog, the ET licensee is required to provide the PARS licensee with an 
equivalent number of 4 kHz voice channels. If digital facilities are 
being replaced with digital, the ET licensee must provide the PARS 
licensee with equivalent data loading bits per second (bps). ET 
licensees must provide PARS licensees with enough throughput to satisfy 
the PARS licensee's system use at the time of relocation, not match the 
total capacity of the PARS system.
    (2) Reliability. System reliability is the degree to which 
information is transferred accurately within a system. ET licensees must 
provide PARS licensees with reliability equal to the overall reliability 
of their system. For digital data systems, reliability is measured by 
the percent of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a desired value, 
and for analog or digital voice transmissions, it is measured by the 
percent of time that audio signal quality meets an established 
threshold. If an analog voice system is replaced with a digital voice 
system, only the resulting frequency response, harmonic distortion, 
signal-to-noise ratio and its reliability will be considered in 
determining comparable reliability.
    (3) Operating Costs. Operating costs are the cost to operate and 
maintain the PARS system. ET licensees must compensate PARS licensees 
for any increased recurring costs associated with the replacement 
facilities (e.g. additional rental payments, increased utility fees) for 
five years after relocation. ET licensees may satisfy this obligation by 
making a lump-sum payment based on present value using current interest 
rates. Additionally, the maintenance costs to the PARS licensee must be 
equivalent to the 2 GHz system in order for the replacement system to be 
considered comparable.
    (g) The PARS licensee is not required to relocate until the 
alternative facilities are available to it for a reasonable time to make 
adjustments, determine comparability, and ensure a seamless handoff.
    (h) The Commission's Twelve-Month Trial Period. If, within one year 
after the relocation to new facilities, the PARS licensee demonstrates 
that the new facilities are not comparable to the former facilities, the 
ET applicant, provider, licensee or representative must remedy the 
defects or pay to relocate the PARS licensee to one of the following: 
its former or equivalent 2 GHz channels, another comparable frequency 
band, a land-line system, or any other facility that satisfies the 
requirements specified in paragraph (f) of this section. This trial 
period commences on the date that the PARS licensee begins full 
operation of the replacement link. If the PARS licensee has retained its 
2 GHz authorization during the trial period, it must return the license 
to the Commission at the end of the twelve months.
    (i) After April 25, 1996, all major modifications and extensions to 
existing PARS systems operating on channels in the 2110-2130 and 2160-
2180 MHz bands will be authorized on a secondary basis to future ET 
operations. All other modifications will render the modified PARS 
license secondary to future ET operations unless the incumbent 
affirmatively justifies primary status and the incumbent PARS licensee 
establishes that the modification would not add to the relocation costs 
of ET licensees. Incumbent PARS licensees will maintain primary status 
for the following technical changes:
    (1) Decreases in power;
    (2) Minor changes (increases or decreases) in antenna height;
    (3) Minor location changes (up to two seconds);
    (4) Any data correction which does not involve a change in the 
location of an existing facility;
    (5) Reductions in authorized bandwidth;
    (6) Minor changes (increases or decreases) in structure height;
    (7) Changes (increases or decreases) in ground elevation that do not 
affect centerline height;
    (8) Minor equipment changes.
    (j) Sunset. PARS licensees will maintain primary status in the 2110-
2130 and 2160-2180 MHz bands unless and until an ET licensee requires 
use of the spectrum. ET licensees are not required to pay relocation 
costs after the relocation rules sunset (i.e. ten years after the 
voluntary period begins for the first ET licensees in the service). Once

[[Page 166]]

the relocation rules sunset, an ET licensee may require the incumbent to 
cease operations, provided that the ET licensee intends to turn on a 
system within interference range of the incumbent, as determined by TIA 
Bulletin 10-F or any standard successor. ET licensee notification to the 
affected PARS licensee must be in writing and must provide the incumbent 
with no less than six months to vacate the spectrum. After the six-month 
notice period has expired, the PARS licensee must turn its license back 
into the Commission, unless the parties have entered into an agreement 
which allows the PARS licensee to continue to operate on a mutually 
agreed upon basis. If the parties cannot agree on a schedule or an 
alternative arrangement, requests for extension will be accepted and 
reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The Commission will grant such 
extensions only if the incumbent can demonstrate that:
    (1) It cannot relocate within the six-month period (e.g., because no 
alternative spectrum or other reasonable option is available), and;
    (2) The public interest would be harmed if the incumbent is forced 
to terminate operations (e.g., if public safety communications services 
would be disrupted).

Sec. 22.603  488-494 MHz fixed service in Hawaii.

    Before filing applications for authorization of inter-island control 
and/or repeater stations, applicants must coordinate the planned channel 
usage with existing licensees and other applicants with previously filed 
applications, using the procedure outlined in Sec. 22.150. Applicants 
and licensees shall cooperate fully and make reasonable efforts to 
resolve any channel usage conflicts. In situations where technical 
solutions to such conflicts cannot be devised, the FCC may select a 
channel or channels to assign or may designate the application(s) for 
hearing. To be acceptable for filing, applications and major technical 
amendments must contain a certification that coordination has been 
completed and an exhibit listing the name(s) of the licensees and 
applicants with which the planned channel usage has been coordinated.

Sec. 22.623  System configuration.

    This section requires a minimum configuration for point-to-
multipoint systems using the channels listed in Sec. 22.621.
    (a) 928-960 MHz. The channels may be assigned, individually or 
paired, only to fixed transmitters in a system that controls at least 
four public mobile base transmitters that transmit on the same channel. 
If a 932-933 MHz channel and a 941-942 MHz channel are assigned as a 
pair, the 941-942 MHz channel must be assigned only to control 
transmitters; the 932-933 MHz channel may be assigned to control or 
fixed relay transmitters.
    (b) 470-512 MHz. These channels may be assigned only individually 
(unpaired), to control transmitters that directly control at least four 
public mobile base transmitters that transmit on the same channel. Fixed 
relay transmitters are not authorized.
    (c) Selection and assignment. The FCC selects and assigns a channel 
when granting applications for authorization to operate a new station to 
transmit in the 470-512, 932-933 and 941-942 MHz frequency ranges. 
Applicants having a preference may request the assignment of a specific 
channel or channel pair, but the FCC may in some cases be unable to 
satisfy such requests.


<R05>
Sec. 22.625  Transmitter locations.

    This section governs where point-to-multipoint transmitters on the 
channels listed in Sec. 22.621 may be located.
    (a) 928-960 MHz. In this frequency range, the required minimum 
distance separation between co-channel fixed transmitters is 113 
kilometers (70 miles). However, this requirement may be waived if the 
applicant submits an engineering analysis that shows that no 
interference would be caused to either system. In such a case, a 
developmental authorization may be issued (see Sec. 22.415). If no 
interference is experienced during the term of the developmental 
authorization, the licensee may apply for a regular authorization.
    (b) 470-512 MHz. The purpose of the rule in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section is to define the areas in which the 470-512 MHz channels are 
allocated for public mobile use. The purpose of the rules in paragraphs 
(b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section is to reduce the likelihood that 
interference to television reception from public mobile operations on 
these channels will occur.
    (1) Control transmitter locations. Control transmitter locations 
must be within 80 kilometers (50 miles) of the designated locations in 
this paragraph.

mile) from the main transmitter locations of all TV stations 
transmitting on TV channels separated by 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, or 8 TV channels 
from the TV channel containing the frequencies on which the control 
station will transmit. This requirement is intended to reduce the 
likelihood of intermodulation interference.
    (3) Co-channel protection from control transmitters with high 
antennas. This paragraph applies only to control transmitters that 
utilize an antenna height of more than 152 meters (500 feet) above 
average terrain. The distance between the location of such a control 
transmitter and the applicable protected TV station location specified 
in this paragraph must equal or exceed the sum of the distance from the 
control transmitter location to the radio horizon in the direction of 
the specified location and 89 kilometers (55 miles--representing the 
distance from the main transmitter location of the TV station to its 
Grade B contour in the direction of the control transmitter). The 
protected TV station locations in this paragraph are the locations of 
record as of September 1974, and these do not change even though the TV 
stations may have been subsequently relocated.
    (i) The protected TV station locations are as follows:

    (b) 470-512 MHz limits. The purpose of the rules in paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section is to reduce the likelihood that 
interference to television receiption from public mobile operations on 
these channels will occur. The protected TV station locations specified 
in this section are the locations of record as of September 1974, and 
these do not change even though the TV stations may have been 
subsequently relocated.
    (1) Co-channel protection. The ERP of control transmitters must not 
exceed the limits in the tables in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(iii) 
of this section. The limits depend upon the height above average terrain 
of the control transmitter antenna and the distance between the control 
transmitter and the nearest protected TV station location in paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section.
    (i) The protected TV station locations are as follows (all 
coordinates are referenced to North American Datum 1983 (NAD83)):

<R05>
Sec. 22.653  Eligibility.

    Only licensees already authorized to provide trunked mobile service 
or their successors in interest are eligible to apply for additional use 
of these channels for trunked mobile service, and then only in the urban 
areas already authorized.


<R05>
Sec. 22.655  Channel usage.

    The FCC is redesignating the public mobile channels in the 470-512 
MHz range from trunked mobile operation to point-to-multipoint operation 
as the demand for trunked mobile service decreases.
    (a) The licensees in each market shall measure channel usage at 
least once every 3 months. These measurements shall be reported to the 
FCC within 30 days. Measurements shall be taken during the busiest 12-
hour periods on 3 days (within a 7-day period) having normal usage. The 
information must be reported separately for each of the 3 days selected, 
must be reported by dates, and must disclose the following:
    (1) The number of mobile units in service during each of the days 
specified;
    (2) The number of calls completed each hour;
    (3) The total number of minutes during each hour that the channels 
were

[[Page 173]]

utilized for communications by the mobile units;
    (4) The average channel usage for the busiest hour for the 3 days 
measured; and
    (5) Any additional information that more accurately reflects channel 
usage.
    (b) If the measured probability of blocking decreases below 25%, the 
FCC will redesignate channels not needed to maintain blocking at 25% or 
less. The number of channels needed to maintain blocking below 25% will 
be determined from the channel usage reports and the Erlang C tables.
    (c) Although two or more channels are necessary to provide trunked 
service, the FCC may, pursuant to this section, reduce to one the number 
of channels assigned. In such cases, the licensee may provide non-
trunked two-way public mobile service on the one remaining channel.


<R05>
Sec. 22.657  Transmitter locations.

    The purpose of the rules in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
is to define the areas in which the 470-512 MHz channels are allocated 
for public mobile use. The purpose of the rules in paragraphs (c) 
through (f) of this section is to reduce the likelihood that 
interference to television reception from public mobile operations on 
these channels will occur. The protected TV station locations specified 
in paragraphs (d), (e)(1) and (f) of this section are the locations of 
record as of September 1974, and these do not change even though the TV 
stations may have been subsequently relocated.
    (a) Base transmitter locations. Base transmitter locations must be 
within 80 kilometers (50 miles) of the designated locations in this 
paragraph. Mobile transmitters must not be operated at locations more 
than 129 kilometers (80 miles) from the designated locations in this 
paragraph. Note: All coordinates are referenced to North American Datum 
1983 (NAD83).

    (b) Mobile area of operation. Mobile transmitters must not be 
operated at locations more than 48 kilometers (30 miles) from all 
associated base stations.
    (c) Protection from intermodulation interference. Base transmitter 
locations must be at least 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) from the current main 
transmitter locations of all TV stations transmitting on TV channels 
separated by 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, or 8 TV channels from the TV channel 
containing the frequencies on which the base station will transmit. This 
requirement is intended to reduce the likelihood of intermodulation 
interference.
    (d) Adjacent channel protection from mobile transmitters. Base 
transmitter locations must be at least 145 kilometers (90 miles) from 
the applicable protected TV station locations specified in this 
paragraph. This requirement is intended to provide a 0 dB minimum 
desired to undesired signal strength ratio at the Grade B contour of an 
adjacent channel TV station. Note: All coordinates are referenced to 
North American Datum 1983 (NAD83).

    (f) Co-channel protection from base transmitters with high antennas. 
This paragraph applies only to base transmitter locations in the New 
York-Northeastern New Jersey urban area that utilize an antenna height 
of more than 152 meters (500 feet) above average terrain. The distance 
between the location of such a base transmitter and the applicable 
protected TV station location specified in this paragraph must equal or 
exceed the sum of the distance from the base transmitter location to the 
radio horizon in the direction of the specified location and 89 
kilometers (55 miles--representing the distance from the main 
transmitter location of the TV station to its Grade B contour in the 
direction of the base transmitter). The distance to the radio horizon is 
calculated as follows:

    (g) The FCC may waive specific distance separation requirements of 
paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section if the applicant submits an 
engineering analysis which demonstrates that terrain effects and/or 
operation with less effective radiated power would satisfy the 
applicable minimum desired to undesired signal strength ratios at the 
Grade B contours of the protected TV stations. For this purpose, the 
Grade B contour of a TV station is deemed to be a circle with a 89 
kilometer (55 mile) radius, centered on the protected TV station 
location, and along which the median TV signal field strength is 64 
dB<greek-m>V/m. In any showing intended to demonstrate compliance with 
the minimum desired to undesired signal ratio requirements of this 
section, all predicted field strengths must have been determined using 
the UHF TV propagation curves contained in part 73 of this chapter.

Sec. 22.659  Effective radiated power limits.

    The purpose of the rules in this section, which limit effective 
radiated power (ERP), is to reduce the likelihood that interference to 
television reception from public mobile operations on these channels 
will occur. The protected TV station locations specified in this section 
are the locations of record as of September 1974, and these do not 
change even though the TV stations may have been subsequently relocated.
    (a) Maximum ERP. The ERP of base transmitters must not exceed 100 
Watts under any circumstances. The ERP of mobile transmitters must not 
exceed 60 Watts under any circumstances.
    (b) Co-channel protection from base transmitters. The ERP of base 
transmitters in the New York-Northeastern New Jersey urban area must not 
exceed the limits in the tables referenced in paragraphs (b)(2) and 
(b)(3) of this section. The limits depend upon the height above average 
terrain of the base transmitter antenna and the distance between the 
base transmitter and the nearest protected TV station

<R04>
                 Subpart F--Rural Radiotelephone Service


<R05>
Sec. 22.701  Scope.

    The rules in this subpart govern the licensing and operation of 
stations and systems in the Rural Radiotelephone Service. The licensing 
and operation of these stations and systems is also subject to rules 
elsewhere in this part that apply generally to the Public Mobile 
Services. In case of conflict, however, the rules in this subpart 
govern.


<R05>
Sec. 22.702  Eligibility.

    Existing and proposed communications common carriers are eligible to 
hold authorizations to operate conventional central office, interoffice 
and rural stations in the Rural Radiotelephone Service. Only local 
exchange carriers that have been state certified to provide basic 
exchange telephone service (or others having state approval to provide 
such service) in the pertinent area are eligible to hold authorizations 
for Basic Exchange Telephone Radio Systems (BETRS). Subscribers are also 
eligible to hold authorizations to operate rural subscriber stations in 
the Rural Radiotelephone Service.


<R05>
Sec. 22.703  Separate rural subscriber station authorization not required.

    A separate authorization is not required for rural subscriber 
stations for which the effective radiated power does not exceed 60 Watts 
and for which FAA notification of construction or alteration of the 
antenna structure is not required (see criteria in Sec. 17.7 of this 
chapter). Authority to operate such rural subscriber stations is 
conferred by the authorization of the central office or base station 
from which they receive service.


<R05>
Sec. 22.705  Rural radiotelephone system configuration.

    Stations in the Rural Radiotelephone Service are authorized to 
communicate as follows:
    (a) Rural subscriber stations are authorized to communicate with and 
through the central office station(s) with which they are associated. 
However, where the establishment of a central office station in this 
service is not feasible, rural subscriber stations may be authorized to 
communicate with and through a base station in the Paging and 
Radiotelephone Service.
    (b) Central office stations may communicate only with rural 
subscriber stations.
    (c) Interoffice stations may communicate only with other interoffice 
stations.


<R05>
Sec. 22.709  Rural radiotelephone service application requirements.

    In addition to information required by Subparts B and D of this 
part, FCC Form 601 applications for authorization to operate a station 
in the Rural Radiotelephone Service must contain the applicable 
supplementary information described in this section.

<R05>
Sec. 22.719  Additional channel policy for rural radiotelephone stations.

    The rules in this section govern the processing of applications for 
central office stations that request a rural radiotelephone channel pair 
when the applicant has applied for or been granted an authorization for 
other rural radiotelephone channel pairs in the same area. The general 
policy of the FCC is to promote effective use of the spectrum by 
encouraging the use of spectrum-efficient technologies (i.e. BETRS) and 
by assigning the minimum number of channels necessary to provide 
service.
    (a) Transmitters in same area. Any central office station 
transmitter on any channel pair listed in Sec. 22.725 is considered to 
be in the same area as another central office station transmitter on any 
other channel pair listed in Sec. 22.725 if the transmitting antennas 
are located within 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) of each other.
    (b) Initial channel pairs. The FCC does not assign more than two 
channel pairs for new central office stations, unless there are more 
than eight rural subscriber stations to be served. Stations are 
considered to be new if there are no authorized transmitters on any 
channel listed in Sec. 22.725 controlled by the applicant in the same 
geographic area.
    (c) Additional channel pairs. Applications for central office 
station transmitters to be located in the same area as an authorized 
central office station controlled by the applicant, but to operate on a 
different channel pair(s) are considered as requests for additional 
channel pair(s) for the authorized central office station. The FCC may 
grant applications for additional channel pairs provided that the need 
for each additional channel pair (after the first two) is established 
and fully justified in terms of achieving the required grade of service 
(blocking probability), and the applicant demonstrates that there will 
still be adequate spectrum available in the area to meet realistic 
estimates of current and future demand for paging, two-way mobile and 
rural radiotelephone services. In the case of conventional rural 
radiotelephone central office stations, an explanation must be provided 
as to why BETRS technology is not being used instead of additional 
channel pairs.

Sec. 22.721  Geographic area authorizations.

    Eligible persons may apply for a paging geographic area 
authorization in the Rural Radiotelephone Service, on the channel pairs 
listed in Sec. 22.725, by following the procedures and requirements set 
forth in Sec. 22.503 for paging geographic area authorizations.

[62 FR 11636, Mar. 12, 1997]

[[Page 180]]


<R05>
Sec. 22.723  Secondary site-by-site authorizations.

    Authorizations for new facilities (including new sites and 
additional channel pairs for existing sites) in the Rural Radiotelephone 
Service (including BETRS facilities) may be granted after May 12, 1997 
only on the condition that such authorizations shall be secondary to any 
existing or future co-channel paging geographic area authorization in 
the Paging and Radiotelephone Service or the Rural Radiotelephone 
Service. If the paging geographic area licensee notifies the Rural 
Radiotelephone Service licensee that operation of a co-channel secondary 
facility must be discontinued because it may cause interference to 
existing or planned facilities, the Rural Radiotelephone Service 
licensee must discontinue operation of that facility on the particular 
channel pair involved no later than six months after such notice.

Sec. 22.725  Channels for conventional rural radiotelephone stations.

    The following channels are allocated for paired assignment to 
transmitters that provide conventional rural radiotelephone service. 
These channels may be assigned for use by central office or rural 
subscriber stations as indicated, and interoffice stations. These 
channels may be assigned also for use by relay stations in systems where 
it would be impractical to provide rural radiotelephone service without 
the use of relay stations. All channels have a bandwidth of 20 kHz and 
are designated by their center frequencies in MegaHertz.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Basic power limit. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section,

[[Page 181]]

the ERP of central office station transmitters must not exceed 500 
Watts.
    (c) Height-power limits. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the ERP of central office station transmitters must not exceed 
the amount that would result in an average distance to the ``service 
contour'' of 41.6 kilometers (26 miles) for VHF channels or 30.7 
kilometers (19 miles) for UHF channels. The average distance to the 
``service contour'' is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of the 
distances determined using the procedures specified in Sec. 22.567 for 
the eight cardinal radial directions, excluding cardinal radial 
directions for which 90% or more of the distance so calculated is over 
water.
    (d) Encompassed interfering contour areas. Central office station 
transmitters are exempt from the basic power and height-power limits of 
this section if the area within their interfering contours is totally 
encompassed by the interfering contours of operating co-channel central 
office station transmitters controlled by the same licensee. For the 
purpose of this paragraph, operating transmitters are authorized 
transmitters that are providing service to subscribers.
    (e) Adjacent channel protection. The ERP of central office station 
transmitters must not exceed 500 Watts if they transmit on channel 
454.025 MHz and are located less than 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) from any 
Private Radio Services station receiving on adjacent channel 454.000 
MHz.
    (f) Meteor burst stations. The transmitter output power for stations 
using meteor burst propagation modes must not exceed 2000 Watts for 
central office stations and 500 Watts for rural subscriber stations.


<R05>
Sec. 22.729  Meteor burst propagation modes.

    The rules in this section govern stations in this service that use 
meteor burst propagation modes to provide rural radiotelephone service 
in Alaska.
    (a) Channel assignments. The channels 42.40 and 44.10 MHz may be 
assigned to central office stations and rural subscriber stations, 
respectively, on a primary basis. The channels 44.20 and 45.90 MHz may 
be assigned to central office and rural subscriber stations, 
respectively, on a secondary basis to Private Radio services stations 
using meteor burst propagation modes.
    (b) Transmitting power. The transmitter output power must not exceed 
2000 Watts for central office stations and 500 Watts for rural 
subscriber stations.
    (c) Station locations. Co-channel central office stations of 
different licensees must be at least 241 kilometers (150 miles) apart. A 
rural subscriber station and a central office station of different 
licensees must be at least 241 kilometers (150 miles) apart if the rural 
subscriber stations of the different licensees operate on the same 
channel. The FCC may waive the requirements of this paragraph if the 
affected users agree to a cooperative sharing arrangement.
    (d) Emission type. Only type F1D emission is authorized.
    (e) Bandwidth. The authorized bandwidth is 20 kHz.
    (f) Station identification. Station identification is required only 
for the central office station.
    (g) Interference. Stations authorized under the provisions of this 
section must not cause harmful interference to the service of stations 
in other radio services.
    (h) Developmental authorization. Meteor burst communications systems 
may be authorized under developmental authorizations pursuant to 
Sec. 22.419.


<R05>
Sec. 22.731  Emission limitations.

    Upon application for multichannel operation, the FCC may authorize 
emission bandwidths wider than those specified in Sec. 22.357, provided 
that spectrum utilization is equal to or better than that achieved by 
single channel operation.


<R05>
Sec. 22.733  Priority of service.

    Within the Rural Radiotelephone Service, the channels listed in 
Sec. 22.725 are intended primarily for use in rendition of public 
message service between rural subscriber and central office stations and 
to provide radio trunking facilities between central offices. The 
channels may also be used, however, for the rendition of private

[[Page 182]]

leased-line communication service provided that such usage would not 
reduce or impair the extent or quality of communication service that 
would be available, in the absence of private leased-line service, to 
the general public receiving or subsequently requesting public message 
service from a central office.


<R05>
Sec. 22.737  Temporary fixed stations.

    The FCC may, upon proper application therefor, authorize the 
construction and operation of temporary fixed stations. Temporary fixed 
stations are to be used as rural subscriber, interoffice, or central 
office stations when those stations are unavailable or when service from 
those stations is disrupted by storms or emergencies.
    (a) Six month limitation. If it is necessary for a temporary fixed 
station to remain at the same location for more than six months, the 
licensee of that station must apply for authorization to operate the 
station at the specific location at least 30 days before the end of the 
six month period.
    (b) International communications. Communications between the United 
States and Canada or Mexico must not be carried using a temporary fixed 
station without prior authorization from the FCC. Licensees desiring to 
carry such communications should apply sufficiently in advance to allow 
for the time necessary to coordinate with Canada or Mexico.

                  General Aviation Air-Ground Stations


<R05>
Sec. 22.805  Channels for general aviation air-ground service.

    The following channels are allocated for the provision of 
radiotelephone service to airborne mobile subscribers in general 
aviation aircraft. These channels have a bandwidth of 20 kHz and are 
designated by their center frequencies in MegaHertz.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) Channel 454.675 MHz is assigned to each and every ground 
station, to be used only for automatically alerting airborne mobile 
stations of incoming calls.
    (b) All airborne mobile channels are assigned for use by each and 
every airborne mobile station.


<R05>
Sec. 22.809  Transmitting power limits.

    The transmitting power of ground and airborne mobile transmitters 
operating on the channels listed in Sec. 22.805 must not exceed the 
limits in this section.
    (a) Ground station transmitters. The effective radiated power of 
ground stations must not exceed 100 Watts and must not be less than 50 
Watts, except as provided in Sec. 22.811.
    (b) Airborne mobile transmitters. The transmitter power output of 
airborne mobile transmitters must not exceed 25 Watts and must not be 
less than 4 Watts.


<R05>
Sec. 22.811  Idle tone.

    Whenever a ground station transmitter authorized to transmit on any 
of the communications channels listed in Sec. 22.805 is available for 
service but is not providing service, a modulated signal must be 
continuously transmitted on the communication channel assigned to that 
transmitter. While this modulated signal is transmitted, the transmitter 
power must be between 10 and 20 dB lower than the normal transmitting 
power.


<R05>
Sec. 22.813  Technical channel pair assignment criteria.

    The rules in this section establish technical assignment criteria 
for the channel pairs listed in Sec. 22.805. These criteria are intended 
to provide substantial service volumes over areas that have significant 
local and regional general aviation activity, while maintaining the 
continuous nationwide in-route coverage of the original geographical 
layout.
    (a) Distance separation for co-channel ground stations. The FCC may 
grant an application requesting assignment of a communication channel 
pair to a proposed ground transmitter only if the proposed antenna 
location is at least 800 kilometers (497 miles) from the antenna 
location of the nearest co-channel ground transmitter in the United 
States, its territories and possessions; and 1000 kilometers (621 miles) 
from the antenna location of the nearest co-channel ground transmitter 
in Canada.
    (b) Dispersion. The FCC may grant an application requesting 
assignment of a communication channel pair to a proposed ground 
transmitter only if there are no more than five different communication 
channel pairs already assigned to ground transmitters with antenna 
locations within a 320 kilometer (199 mile) radius of the proposed 
antenna location.


<R05>
Sec. 22.815  Construction period for general aviation ground stations.

    The construction period (see Sec. 22.142) for general aviation 
ground stations is 12 months.


<R05>
Sec. 22.817  Additional channel policies.

    The rules in this section govern the processing of applications for 
authority

[[Page 185]]

to operate a ground station transmitter on any ground station 
communication channel listed in Sec. 22.805 when the applicant has 
applied or been granted an authorization for other ground station 
communication channels in the same area. The general policy of the FCC 
is to assign one ground station communication channel in an area to a 
carrier per application cycle, up to a maximum of six ground station 
communication channels per area. That is, a carrier must apply for one 
ground station communication channel, receive the authorization, 
construct the station, and notify the FCC of commencement of service 
before applying for an additional ground station communication channel 
in that area.
    (a) Air-ground transmitters in same area. Any transmitter on any of 
the ground station channels listed in Sec. 22.805 is considered to be in 
the same area as another transmitter on any ground station channel 
listed in Sec. 22.805 if it is located less than 350 kilometers (217 
miles) from that transmitter.
    (b) Initial channel. The FCC will not assign more than one ground 
station communication channel for new ground stations. Ground stations 
are considered to be new if there are no authorized ground station 
transmitters on any channel listed in Sec. 22.805 controlled by the 
applicant in the same area.
    (c) Additional channel. Applications for ground transmitters to be 
located in the same area as an authorized ground station controlled by 
the applicant, but to operate on a different ground station 
communication channel, are considered as requesting an additional 
channel for the authorized station.
    (d) Amendment of pending application. If the FCC receives and 
accepts for filing an application for a ground station transmitter to be 
located in the same area as a ground station transmitter proposed in a 
pending application previously filed by the applicant, but on a 
different ground station communication channel, the subsequent 
application is treated as a major amendment to change the technical 
proposal of the prior application. The filing date of any application so 
amended is the date the FCC received the subsequent application.
    (e) Dismissal of premature applications for additional channel. If 
the FCC receives an application requesting an additional ground station 
communication channel for an authorized ground station prior to 
receiving notification that the station is providing service to 
subscribers on the authorized channel(s), the FCC may dismiss that 
application without prejudice.
    (f) Dismissal of applications for seventh channel. If the FCC 
receives an application requesting an additional ground station 
communication channel for an authorized ground station which would, if 
granted, result in that station being assigned more than six ground 
station communication channels in the same area, the FCC may dismiss 
that application without prejudice.


<R05>
Sec. 22.819  AGRAS compatibility requirement.

    Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, stations 
transmitting on the channels listed in Sec. 22.805 must operate in 
compliance with the technical and operational requirements contained in 
the document, ``Technical Reference, Air-ground Radiotelephone Automated 
Service (AGRAS), System Operation and Equipment Characteristics'', dated 
April 12, 1985.
    (a) Until January 1, 1996, stations may continue to operate in 
compliance with the previous standard adopted in Docket 16073.
    (b) Copies of the document referenced in this section may be 
obtained from the FCC's copying contractor.

                 Commercial Aviation Air-Ground Systems


<R05>
Sec. 22.857  Channel plan for commercial aviation air-ground systems.

    The 849-851 and 894-896 MHz frequency ranges are allocated for block 
assignment to nationwide air-ground systems providing radiotelephone 
service to passengers aboard commercial aircraft. These frequency ranges 
may also be used to provide service to persons in general aviation or 
other aircraft. Ground stations transmit on channels in the 849-851 MHz 
range. Airborne mobile stations transmit on

[[Page 186]]

channels in the 894-896 MHz range. Systems using these channels must 
conform to the channel plan described in this section.
    (a) Channel blocks. The spectrum allocated for commercial aviation 
air-ground systems is divided into ten channel blocks, numbered 1 
through 10. All ground stations in each geographical area must use the 
same channel block for communication with airborne mobile stations in 
flight, in accordance with Sec. 22.859.
    (1) Each channel block is subdivided into 6 control channels labeled 
P-1 through P-6, and 29 communications channels labeled C-1 through C-
29.
    (2) The authorized channel bandwidths are as follows:
    (i) Each control channel has a bandwidth of 3.2 kHz.
    (ii) Each communications channel has a bandwidth of 6 kHz.
    (b) The center frequencies (in MegaHertz) of the communications and 
control channels are listed in Tables G-1 and G-2 of this section.

                                                           Table G-1.--Ground Station Channels

    Any appropriate emission type may be used to provide air-ground 
radiotelephone service on the channels listed in Sec. 22.857, provided 
that the emission limitations of this section are met.
    (a) Emission mask. The emission mask described in this paragraph 
applies instead of those in Sec. 22.359. The power of any emission in 
each of the adjacent channels must be at least 30 dB below the power of 
the total emission. The power of any emission in any of the channels 
other than the one being used and the adjacent channels must be at least 
50 dB below the power of the total emission.
    (b) Airborne mobile transmitters. The power of any emission in each 
of the adjacent channels must not exceed -130 dBm at any ground station 
receiver, assuming a 0 dBi receive antenna. The power of any emission in 
any of the channels other than the one being used and the adjacent 
channels must not exceed -148 dBm at any ground station receiver, 
assuming a 0 dBi receive antenna.
    (c) Ground station transmitters. The effective radiated power (ERP) 
of any emission outside of the frequency ranges set forth in Sec. 22.857 
must not exceed -10 dBm. The ERP of any emission in each of the adjacent 
channels must not exceed +10 dBm. The ERP of any emission in any of the 
channels other than the one being used and the adjacent channels must 
not exceed -5 dBm.
    (d) If an emission on any frequency outside of the authorized 
bandwidth causes harmful interference, the FCC may require greater 
attenuation of that emission than required in paragraph (a) of this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 22.863  Transmitter frequency tolerance.

    Ground station transmitter frequencies must be maintained within 0.1 
parts per million (ppm) of the channel reference or center frequencies. 
Doppler shift correction must be used to ensure that the frequencies of 
the signals of airborne mobile stations received at ground stations 
remain within 0.2 ppm of the channel reference or center frequencies.

[[Page 190]]


<R05>
Sec. 22.865  Automatic channel selection procedures.

    Operation of stations using the channels listed in Sec. 22.857 must 
be in accordance with the procedures in this section.
    (a) A communications channel is not available for use by a ground 
station if it is already in use by another ground station at the same 
location. Ground station equipment must automatically determine whether 
channels are in use by other ground stations at the same location, and 
may employ radio frequency signal monitoring to do so. For example, a 
communications channel may be determined to be in use if the received 
signal power on that channel at the ground station exceeds -115 dBm, 
which, assuming a 0 dB gain 895 MHz receive antenna, corresponds to a 
field strength of approximately 19 dB<greek-m>V/m. Ground stations may 
employ an alternative method of determining whether a communications 
channel is in use provided that such procedure is at least as reliable 
as radio frequency signal monitoring.
    (b) Data indicating which communications channels are available for 
use are transmitted by ground stations on the assigned control channels.
    (c) A call is originated when an airborne mobile station selects a 
communications channel based on the received data from ground stations 
and other factors, and transmits an identification code (which 
identifies the specific ground station from which service is requested) 
on the selected communications channel. The ground station from which 
service has been requested may then obtain any necessary billing 
information and complete the call.
    (d) A ground station may not transmit on a communications channel 
unless it has received the proper identification code. After a ground 
station has begun to transmit on a communications channel, that channel 
is not available to ground stations other than the one from which 
service has been requested until the call is terminated.
    (e) A call is terminated by the ground station when either a hang-up 
signal is transmitted by the airborne mobile station, or the signal from 
the airborne mobile station on the communications channel is lost for a 
period of 15 continuous seconds. The hang-up signal is the on-off keying 
(50% duty cycle) of an unmodulated carrier over a period of one second 
with pulse duration of 5 milliseconds. However, if all carriers 
authorized to operate air-ground systems using the channels listed in 
Sec. 22.857 agree that an alternative hang-up signal and/or procedure 
would be more efficient or beneficial, such alternative hang-up signal 
and/or procedure may be used. The carriers must jointly give prior 
notification to the FCC if an alternative hang-up signal and/or 
procedure is used.


<R05>
Sec. 22.867  Effective radiated power limits.

    The effective radiated power (ERP) of ground and airborne stations 
operating on the channels listed in Sec. 22.857 must not exceed the 
limits in this section.
    (a) The ERP of airborne mobile station transmitters must not exceed 
30 Watts.
    (b) The ERP of ground station transmitters must not exceed 100 
Watts.
    (c) The ERP of low power ground station transmitters operating 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of Sec. 22.859 must not exceed 1 Watt.


<R05>
Sec. 22.869  Assignment of control channels.

    The FCC selects and assigns exclusively one control channel to each 
commercial aviation air-ground licensee.


<R05>
Sec. 22.871  Control channel transition period.

    The rules in this section provide for a period of transition during 
which the experimental air-ground system operating on the channels 
listed in Sec. 22.857 will be discontinued and replaced by a system 
operating in full compliance with the rules in this subpart. The 
experimental system may continue to exclusively use a 3.2 kHz control 
channel contained within the bandwidth of communications channel C-2 of 
each channel block until September 9, 1996. After that date 
communications channel C-2 will be available for use by all carriers 
authorized to operate an air-ground system on the channels listed in 
Sec. 22.857.

<R05>
Sec. 22.873  Construction period for commercial aviation air-ground systems.

    Construction of a new commercial aviation air-ground system is 
considered to be completed for the purpose of this section and 
Sec. 22.142 when the number of ground stations specified in this section 
are constructed and operational.
    (a) Stage I. At least 25 ground stations must be constructed and 
operational within 3 years. Licensees must notify the Commission by 
using FCC Form 601 as soon as this requirement is met.
    (b) Stage II. At least 50 ground stations must be constructed and 
operational within 5 years. Nationwide service to subscribers must 
commence within 5 years. Licensees must notify the Commission by using 
FCC Form 601 as soon as this requirement is met.

               Subpart H--Cellular Radiotelephone Service


<R05>
Sec. 22.900  Scope.

    The rules in this subpart govern the licensing and operation of 
cellular radiotelephone systems. Licensing and operation of these 
systems are also subject to rules elsewhere in this part that apply 
generally to the Public Mobile Services. In case of conflict, however, 
the rules in this subpart govern.


<R05>
Sec. 22.901  Cellular service requirements and limitations.

    Cellular system licensees must provide cellular mobile 
radiotelephone service upon request to subscribers in good standing, 
including roamers, as provided in Sec. 20.12 of this chapter. A cellular 
system licensee may refuse or terminate service, however, subject to any 
applicable state or local requirements for timely notification, to any 
subscriber who operates a cellular telephone in an airborne aircraft in 
violation of Sec. 22.925 or otherwise fails to cooperate with the 
licensee in exercising operational control over mobile stations pursuant 
to Sec. 22.927.
    (a) Service area information. Licensees must inform prospective 
subscribers of the area in which reliable service can be expected.
    (b) Lack of capacity. If a licensee refuses a request for cellular 
service because of a lack of system capacity, it must report that fact 
to the FCC in writing, explaining how it plans to increase capacity.
    (c) Dispatch service. Cellular systems may provide dispatch service.
    (d) Alternative technologies and co-primary services. Licensees of 
cellular systems may use alternative cellular technologies and/or 
provide fixed services on a co-primary basis with their mobile 
offerings, including personal communications services (as defined in 
part 24 of this chapter) on the spectrum within their assigned channel 
block. Cellular carriers that provide mobile services must make such 
service available to

[[Page 193]]

subscribers whose mobile equipment conforms to the cellular system 
compatibility specification (see Sec. 22.933).
    (1) Licensees must perform or obtain an engineering analysis to 
ensure that interference to the service of other cellular systems will 
not result from the implementation of co-primary fixed services or 
alternative cellular technologies.
    (2) Alternative technology and co-primary fixed services are exempt 
from requirements for incidental communications services of Sec. 22.323, 
the channeling requirements of Sec. 22.905, the modulation requirements 
of Sec. 22.915, the wave polarization requirements of Sec. 22.367, the 
compatibility specification in Sec. 22.933 and the emission limitations 
of Secs. 22.357 and 22.917, except for emission limitations that apply 
to emissions outside the assigned channel block.

Sec. 22.907  Coordination of channel usage.

    Licensees in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service must coordinate, 
with the appropriate parties, channel usage at each transmitter location 
within 121 kilometers (75 miles) of any transmitter locations authorized 
to other licensees or proposed by tentative selectees or other 
applicants, except those with mutually exclusive applications.
    (a) Licensees must cooperate and make reasonable efforts to resolve 
technical problems that may inhibit effective and efficient use of the 
cellular radio spectrum; however, licensees are not obligated to suggest 
extensive changes to or redesign other licensees' cellular systems. 
Licensees must make reasonable efforts to avoid blocking the growth of 
other cellular systems that are likely to need additional capacity in 
the future.
    (b) If technical problems are addressed by an agreement or operating 
agreement between the licensees that would result in a reduction of 
quality or capacity of either system, the licensees must notify the 
Commission by updating FCC Form 601.

Sec. 22.909  Cellular markets.

    Cellular markets are standard geographic areas used by the FCC for 
administrative convenience in the licensing of cellular systems. 
Cellular markets comprise Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and 
Rural Service Areas (RSAs). All cellular markets and the counties they 
comprise are listed in Public Notice Report No. CL-92-40

[[Page 194]]

``Common Carrier Public Mobile Services Information, Cellular MSA/RSA 
Markets and Counties'', dated January 24, 1992, DA 92-109, 7 FCC Rcd 742 
(1992).
    (a) MSAs. Metropolitan Statistical Areas are 306 areas, including 
New England County Metropolitan Areas and the Gulf of Mexico Service 
Area (water area of the Gulf of Mexico, border is the coastline), 
defined by the Office of Management and Budget, as modified by the FCC.
    (b) RSAs. Rural Service Areas are 428 areas, other than MSAs, 
established by the FCC.


<R05>
Sec. 22.911  Cellular geographic service area.

    The Cellular Geographic Service Area (CGSA) of a cellular system is 
the geographic area considered by the FCC to be served by the cellular 
system. The CGSA is the area within which cellular systems are entitled 
to protection and within which adverse effects for the purpose of 
determining whether a petitioner has standing are recognized.
    (a) CGSA determination. The CGSA is the composite of the service 
areas of all of the cells in the system, excluding any area outside the 
cellular market boundary, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, and excluding any area within the CGSA of another cellular 
system. The service area of a cell is the area within its service area 
boundary (SAB). The distance to the SAB is calculated as a function of 
effective radiated power (ERP) and antenna center of radiation height 
above average terrain (HAAT), height above sea level (HASL) or height 
above mean sea level (HAMSL).
    (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) of this section, 
the distance from a cell transmitting antenna to its SAB along each 
cardinal radial is calculated as follows:

d=2.531 x h<SUP>0.34</SUP> xp<SUP>0.17</SUP>

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    (2) For the cellular systems authorized to serve the Gulf of Mexico 
MSA, the distance from a cell transmitting antenna to its SAB along each 
cardinal radial is calculated as follows:

d=6.895 x h<SUP>0.30</SUP> xp<SUP>0.15</SUP>

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    (3) The value used for h in the formula in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section must not be less than 8 meters (26 feet) HASL (or HAMSL, as 
appropriate for the support structure). The value used for h in the 
formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must not be less than 30 
meters (98 feet) HAAT, except that for unserved area applications 
proposing a cell with an ERP not exceeding 10 Watts, the value for h 
used in the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to determine the 
service area boundary for that cell may be less than 30 meters (98 feet) 
HAAT, but not less than 3 meters (10 feet) HAAT.
    (4) The value used for p in the formulas in paragraphs (a)(1) and 
(a)(2) of this section must not be less than 0.1 Watt or 27 dB less than 
(1/500 of) the maximum ERP in any direction, whichever is more.
    (5) Whenever use of the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
pursuant to the exception contained in paragraph (a)(3) of this section 
results in a calculated distance that is less than 5.4 kilometers (3.4 
miles), the radial distance to the service area boundary is deemed to be 
5.4 kilometers (3.4 miles).
    (6) The distance from a cell transmitting antenna to the SAB along 
any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is calculated by linear 
interpolation of distance as a function of angle.

    Note to paragraph (a) of Sec. 22.911: On May 13, 1994, the United 
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit instructed 
the FCC to vacate the provisions of old Sec. 22.903(a), now 
Sec. 22.911(a), insofar as they apply to cellular systems licensed to 
serve the Gulf of Mexico MSA (GMSA), pending reconsideration of an issue 
remanded to the FCC in that decision. See Petroleum Communications, Inc. 
v. Federal Communications Commission, No. 92-1670 and RVC Services, 
Inc., D/B/A Coastel Communications Company v. Federal Communications 
Commission, No. 93-1016, ____ F.2d ____, ____ (D.C. Cir. 1994). 
Accordingly, notwithstanding the provisions of

[[Page 195]]

Sec. 22.911(a), until further notice, the authorized CGSAs of the 
cellular systems licensed to serve the GMSA are those which were 
authorized prior to January 11, 1993.

    (b) Alternative CGSA determination. If a carrier believes that the 
method described in paragraph (a) of this section produces a CGSA that 
departs significantly (<plus-minus>20% in the service area of any cell) 
from the geographic area where reliable cellular service is actually 
provided, the carrier may submit, as an exhibit to an application for 
modification of the CGSA using FCC Form 601, a depiction of what the 
carrier believes the CGSA should be. Such submissions must be 
accompanied by one or more supporting propagation studies using methods 
appropriate for the 800-900 MHz frequency range, including all 
supporting data and calculations, and/or by extensive field strength 
measurement data. For the purpose of such submissions, cellular service 
is considered to be provided in all areas, including ``dead spots'', 
between the transmitter location and the locus of points where the 
predicted or measured median field strength finally drops to 32 
dB<greek-m>V/m (i.e. does not exceed 32 dB<greek-m>V/m further out). If, 
after consideration of such submissions, the FCC finds that adjustment 
to a CGSA is warranted, the FCC may grant the application.
    (1) The alternative CGSA determination must define the CGSA in terms 
of distances from cell sites to cell SABs along the eight cardinal 
radials, with other points along the SAB determined in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(6) of this section. The distances used for the cardinal 
radials must be representative of the coverage within the 45 deg. 
sectors, as depicted by the alternative CGSA determination.
    (2) If an uncalibrated predictive model is used to depict the CGSA, 
the alternative CGSA determination must identify factors (e.g. terrain 
roughness or features) that could plausibly account for the difference 
between actual coverage and that defined by the formula in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section. If actual measurements or a measurement-
calibrated predictive model are used to depict the CGSA, and this fact 
is disclosed in the alternative CGSA determination, it is not necessary 
to offer an explanation of the difference between actual coverage and 
that defined by the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the 
formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is clearly inapplicable for 
the cell(s) in question (e.g. for microcells), this should be disclosed 
in the alternative CGSA determination.
    (3) The provision for alternative CGSA determinations was made in 
recognition that the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is a 
general model that provides a reasonable approximation of coverage in 
most land areas, but may substantially under-predict or over-predict 
coverage in specific areas with unusual terrain roughness or features, 
and may be inapplicable for certain purposes, e.g. cells with a radial 
distance to the SAB less than 8 kilometers (5 miles). In such cases, 
alternative methods that utilize more specific models are appropriate. 
Accordingly, the FCC does not consider use of the formula in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section with parameters outside of the limits in 
paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4) and (a)(5) of this section or with data for 
radials other than the cardinal radials to be a valid alternative method 
for determining the CGSA of a cellular system.
    (c) CGSA extension areas. SAB extensions (areas outside of the 
cellular market boundary, but within the service area as calculated 
using the methods of paragraph (a) of this section) are part of the CGSA 
only under the following circumstances:
    (1) During the five year build-out period of the system in the 
cellular market containing the extension, the licensees of systems on 
the same channel block in adjacent cellular markets may agree that the 
portion of the service area of one system that extends into unserved 
areas in the other system's cellular market is part of the CGSA of the 
former system.
    (2) At the end of the five year build-out period of the system in 
the cellular market containing the extension, the portion of the service 
area that extends into unserved areas in another cellular market becomes 
part of the CGSA, provided that the licensee of the system so extended 
files a system information update in accordance with Sec. 22.947(c).

[[Page 196]]

    (3) For original systems in MSAs, extensions of the CGSA authorized 
by the FCC are part of the CGSA to the extent authorized.
    (d) Protection afforded. Within the CGSA determined in accordance 
with this section, cellular systems are entitled to protection from co-
channel and first-adjacent channel interference and from capture of 
subscriber traffic by adjacent systems on the same channel block.
    (1) Licensees must cooperate in resolving co-channel and first-
adjacent channel interference by changing channels used at specific 
cells or by other technical means.
    (2) Protection from capture of subscriber traffic is applied and 
limited in accordance with the following:
    (i) Subscriber traffic is captured if an SAB of one cellular system 
overlaps the CGSA of another operating cellular system. Therefore, 
cellular licensees must not begin to operate any facility that would 
cause an SAB to overlap the existing CGSA of another cellular system on 
the same channel block, without first obtaining the written consent of 
the licensee of that system. However, cellular licensees may continue to 
operate existing facilities that produce an SAB overlapping a 
subsequently-authorized portion of the CGSA of another cellular system 
on the same channel block until the licensee of that system requests 
that the SAB be removed from its CGSA. Such request may be made directly 
to the licensee of the overlapping system or to the FCC. In the event 
such request is made, the licensee of the overlapping system must reduce 
the transmitting power or antenna height (or both) at the pertinent cell 
site as necessary to remove the SAB from the CGSA of the other system, 
unless a written consent from the licensee of the other system allowing 
the SAB to remain is obtained. Cellular licensees may enter into 
contracts with the licensees of other cellular systems on the same 
channel block to allow SABs to overlap CGSAs.
    (ii) Cellular licensees are at most entitled to have a CGSA free of 
SABs from other cellular systems on the same channel block.
    (e) Unserved areas. Unserved areas are areas outside of all existing 
CGSAs (on either of the channel blocks), to which the Communications Act 
of 1934, as amended, is applicable.

Sec. 22.912  Service area boundary extensions.

    This section contains rules governing service area boundary (SAB) 
extensions. SAB extensions are areas outside of the cellular market 
boundary, but within the service area as calculated using the methods of 
Sec. 22.911(a). Cellular systems must be designed to comply with the 
rules in this section. Applications proposing systems that would not 
comply with the rules in this section are defective. Service within SAB 
extensions is not protected from interference or capture under 
Sec. 22.911(d) unless and until the area within the SAB extension 
becomes a part of the cellular geographic service area (CGSA) in 
accordance with Sec. 22.911(c).
    (a) De minimis extensions. Except as restricted in paragraph (d) of 
this section, SABs may extend into adjacent cellular markets if such 
extensions are de minimis, are demonstrably unavoidable for technical 
reasons of sound engineering design, and do not extend into the CGSA of 
any other licensee's cellular system on the same channel block (unless 
the licensee of such other system consents to the extension) or into any 
adjacent cellular market on a channel block for which the five year 
build-out period has expired.
    (b) Contract extensions. Except as restricted in paragraph (d) of 
this section, licensees of cellular systems on the same channel block in 
adjacent cellular markets may, at any time, enter into contracts with 
applicants or other licensees to allow SAB extensions into their CGSA 
only (not into unserved areas). Except as restricted in paragraph (d) of 
this section, licensees of the first authorized cellular systems on the 
same channel block in adjacent cellular markets may agree to allow SAB 
extensions into their CGSA and/or

[[Page 197]]

unserved areas in their cellular markets during the five year build-out 
period of the market into which the SAB extends.
    (c) Same applicant/licensee. Except as restricted in paragraph (d) 
of this section, licensees of cellular systems that are also an 
applicant or licensee on the same channel block in adjacent cellular 
markets may, at any time, allow or propose SAB extensions from their 
adjacent market system into their CGSH only (not into unserved areas). 
Except as restricted in paragraph (d) of this section, licensees of the 
first authorized cellular systems that are also an applicant or licensee 
on the same channel block in adjacent cellular markets may allow or 
propose SAB extensions from their adjacent market system into their CGSA 
and/or unserved areas in their cellular markets during the five year 
build-out period of the market into which the SAB extends.
    (d) Unserved area systems. Phase I initial cellular applications 
must not propose SAB extensions. Phase I sole major modification 
applications and Phase II applications may propose SAB extensions, 
subject to the conditions in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 22.913  Effective radiated power limits.

    The effective radiated power (ERP) of transmitters in the Cellular 
Radiotelephone Service must not exceed the limits in this section.
    (a) Maximum ERP. The effective radiated power (ERP) of base 
transmitters and cellular repeaters must not exceed 500 Watts. The ERP 
of mobile transmitters and auxiliary test transmitters must not exceed 7 
Watts.
    (b) Height-power limit. The ERP of base transmitters must not exceed 
the amount that would result in an average distance to the service area 
boundary of 79.1 kilometers (49 miles) for cellular systems authorized 
to serve the Gulf of Mexico MSA and 40.2 kilometers (25 miles) for all 
other cellular systems. The average distance to the service area 
boundary is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of the distances 
determined using the procedures specified in Sec. 22.911 for the eight 
cardinal radial directions.
    (c) Coordination exemption. Licensees need not comply with the 
height-power limit in paragraph (b) of this section if the proposed 
operation is coordinated with the licensees of all affected cellular 
systems on the same channel block within 121 kilometers (75 miles) and 
concurrence is obtained.


<R05>
Sec. 22.915  Modulation requirements.

    Cellular systems must be capable of providing service using the 
types of modulation described in the cellular system compatibility 
specification.
    (a) Non-voice modulating signals. Modulating signals other than 
voice signals, such as data signals, may be transmitted, provided the 
resulting modulated emission exhibits spectral characteristics not 
exceeding those resulting from voice modulation.
    (b) Modulation levels. The levels of the modulating signals must be 
set to the values specified in this paragraph, and must be maintained 
within <plus-minus>10% of those values.
    (1) The instantaneous frequency deviation resulting from the main 
modulating signal must be <plus-minus>12 kHz.
    (2) The instantaneous frequency deviation resulting from the 
supervisory audio tones must be <plus-minus>2 kHz.
    (3) The instantaneous frequency deviation resulting from the 
signaling tone must be <plus-minus>8 kHz.
    (4) The instantaneous frequency deviation resulting from wideband 
data signals must be <plus-minus>8 kHz.
    (c) Deviation limitation circuitry. Cellular transmitters must be 
equipped with circuitry that automatically prevents modulation levels 
for voice transmissions from exceeding the limits specified in this 
section.
    (d) Audio filter characteristics. Except as provided in Sec. 22.917, 
radiotelephony signals applied to the modulator from the modulation 
limiter must be attenuated as a function of frequency as specified in 
this paragraph.
    (1) For mobile stations, these signals must be attenuated, relative 
to the level at 1 kHz, as follows:
    (i) In the frequency ranges of 3.0 to 5.9 kHz and 6.1 to 15.0 kHz, 
signals must be attenuated by at least 40 log (f<divide>3) dB, where f 
is the frequency of the signal in kHz.

[[Page 198]]

    (ii) In the frequency range of 5.9 to 6.1 kHz, signals must be 
attenuated at least 35 dB.
    (iii) In the frequency range above 15 kHz, signals must be 
attenuated at least 28 dB.
    (2) For base stations, these signals shall be attenuated, relative 
to the level at 1 kHz, as follows:
    (i) In the frequency range of 3 to 15 kHz, signals must be 
attenuated by at least 40 log (f<divide>3) dB, where f is the frequency 
of the signal in kHz.
    (ii) In the frequency range above 15 kHz, signals must be attenuated 
by at least 28 dB.
    (3) Filtering is not required for the supervisory audio tones, 
signaling tones or wideband data signals.


<R05>
Sec. 22.917  Emission limitations for cellular.

    The rules in this section govern the spectral characteristics of 
emissions in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service.
    (a) Analog radiotelephony emissions. F3E emissions must be used only 
on the communication channels.
    (b) F3E/F3D emission mask for use with audio filter. For F3E and F3D 
emissions, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the mean 
power of emissions must be attenuated below the mean power of the 
unmodulated carrier wave (P) as follows:
    (1) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 
20 kHz but not more than 45 kHz:

at least 26 dB;

    (2) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 
45 kHz, up to the first multiple of the carrier frequency:

at least 60 dB or 43 + 10 log P dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation.

    (c) Alternative F3E/F3D emission mask. For F3E and F3D emissions, 
transmitters may comply with the emission limitations in this paragraph 
in lieu of compliance with paragraph (b) of this section and the audio 
filter requirement of Sec. 22.915.
    (1) The mean power of any emission removed from the carrier 
frequency by a displacement frequency (f<INF>d</INF> in kHz) must be 
attenuated below the mean power of the unmodulated carrier (P) as 
follows:
    (i) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 
12 kHz but not more than 20 kHz:

at least 117 log (f<INF>d</INF><divide>12) dB;

    (ii) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more 
than 20 kHz, up to the first multiple of the carrier frequency:

at least 100 log (f<INF>d</INF><divide>11) dB or 60 dB or 43 + 10 log P 
dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation;

    (2) For mobile stations, modulating signals other than the 
supervisory audio tone in the frequency range of 5.9 to 6.1 kHz must be 
attenuated, relative to the level at 1 kHz, at least 35 dB.
    (d) F1D emission mask. For F1D emissions, the mean power of 
emissions must be attenuated below the mean power of the unmodulated 
carrier (P) as follows:
    (1) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 
20 kHz but not more than 45 kHz:

at least 26 dB;

    (2) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 
45 kHz but not more than 90 kHz:

at least 45 dB;

    (3) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 
90 kHz, up to the first multiple of the carrier frequency:

at least 60 dB or 43+10 log P dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation.

    (e) Out of band emissions. The mean power of emissions must be 
attenuated below the mean power of the unmodulated carrier (P) on any 
frequency twice or more than twice the fundamental frequency by:

at least 43+10 log P dB.

    (f) Mobile emissions in base frequency range. The mean power of any 
emissions appearing in the base station frequency range from cellular 
mobile transmitters operated must be attenuated to a level not to exceed 
-80 dBm at the transmit antenna connector.
    (g) Interference from spurious emissions. If any emission from a 
transmitter operating in this service results in interference to users 
of another radio service, the FCC may require a greater attenuation of 
that emission than specified in this section.

[[Page 199]]

    (h) Measurement procedure. The following spectrum analyzer bandwidth 
settings should be used for measurement of spurious emissions:
    (1) When operating in the radiotelephony mode or the supervisory 
audio tone mode:
    (i) For any emission not more than 45 kHz removed from the carrier 
frequency: 300 Hz;
    (ii) For any emission more than 45 kHz removed from the carrier 
frequency: 30 kHz.
    (2) When operating in the wideband data mode or the signaling tone 
mode:
    (i) For any emission not more than 60 kHz removed from the carrier 
frequency: 300 Hz;
    (ii) For any emission more than 60 kHz removed from the carrier 
frequency: 30 kHz.


<R05>
Sec. 22.919  Electronic serial numbers.

    The Electronic Serial Number (ESN) is a 32 bit binary number that 
uniquely identifies a cellular mobile transmitter to any cellular 
system.
    (a) Each mobile transmitter in service must have a unique ESN.
    (b) The ESN host component must be permanently attached to a main 
circuit board of the mobile transmitter and the integrity of the unit's 
operating software must not be alterable. The ESN must be isolated from 
fraudulent contact and tampering. If the ESN host component does not 
contain other information, that component must not be removable, and its 
electrical connections must not be accessible. If the ESN host component 
contains other information, the ESN must be encoded using one or more of 
the following techniques:
    (1) Multiplication or division by a polynomial;
    (2) Cyclic coding;
    (3) The spreading of ESN bits over various non-sequential memory 
locations.
    (c) The ESN must be factory set and must not be alterable, 
transferable, removable or otherwise able to be manipulated. Cellular 
mobile equipment must be designed such that any attempt to remove, 
tamper with, or change the ESN chip, its logic system, or firmware 
originally programmed by the manufacturer will render the mobile 
transmitter inoperative.


<R05>
Sec. 22.921  911 Call Processing Procedures; 911-Only Calling Mode.

    All mobile phones manufactured after February 13, 2000, and capable 
of operating in an analog mode, i.e., in compliance with ``Cellular 
System Mobile Station--Land Station Compatibility Specification'' (April 
1981 Ed.) Office of Engineering and Technology Bulletin No. 53, 
referenced in Sec. 22.933 must incorporate a special procedure for 
processing ``9-1-1'' calls. Such procedure must recognize when a ``9-1-
1'' call is made and, at such time, must override any programming in the 
mobile unit that determines the handling of a non-911 call and permit 
the call to be handled by other analog carriers. This special procedure 
must incorporate any one or more of the 9-1-1 call system selection 
processes endorsed or approved by the Commission.

[64 FR 34568, June 28, 1999]

    Effective Date Note: At 64 FR 34568, June 28, 1999, Sec. 22.921 was 
added. This section contains information collection and recordkeeping 
requirements and will not become effective until approval has been given 
by the Office of Management and Budget.


<R05>
Sec. 22.923  Cellular system configuration.

    Mobile stations communicate with and through base transmitters only. 
Base transmitters communicate with mobile stations directly or through 
cellular repeaters. Auxiliary test stations may communicate with base or 
mobile stations for the purpose of testing equipment.


<R05>
Sec. 22.925  Prohibition on airborne operation of cellular telephones.

    Cellular telephones installed in or carried aboard airplanes, 
balloons or any other type of aircraft must not be operated while such 
aircraft are airborne (not touching the ground). When any aircraft 
leaves the ground, all cellular telephones on board that aircraft must 
be turned off. The following notice must be posted on or near each 
cellular telephone installed in any aircraft:
    ``The use of cellular telephones while this aircraft is airborne is 
prohibited by FCC rules, and the violation of this

[[Page 200]]

rule could result in suspension of service and/or a fine. The use of 
cellular telephones while this aircraft is on the ground is subject to 
FAA regulations.''


<R05>
Sec. 22.927  Responsibility for mobile stations.

    Mobile stations that are subscribers in good standing to a cellular 
system, when receiving service from that cellular system, are considered 
to be operating under the authorization of that cellular system. 
Cellular system licensees are responsible for exercising effective 
operational control over mobile stations receiving service through their 
cellular systems. Mobile stations that are subscribers in good standing 
to a cellular system, while receiving service from a different cellular 
system, are considered to be operating under the authorization of such 
different system. The licensee of such different system is responsible, 
during such temporary period, for exercising effective operational 
control over such mobile stations as if they were subscribers to it.


<R05>
Sec. 22.929  Application requirements for the Cellular Radiotelephone Service.

    In addition to information required by subparts B and D of this 
part, applications for authorization in the Cellular Radiotelephone 
Service contain required information as described in the instructions to 
the form. Site coordinates must be referenced to NAD83 and be correct to 
<plus-minus>1 second.
    (a) Administrative information. The following information is 
required either by FCC Form 601, or as an exhibit:

<R05>
Sec. 22.933  Cellular system compatibility specification.

    Except as provided in Sec. 22.901(d), equipment used in the Cellular 
Radiotelephone Service must be designed in compliance with the technical 
specifications for compatibility of mobile and base stations in the 
Cellular Radiotelephone Service contained in ``Cellular System Mobile 
Station-Land Station Compatibility Specification'' (April 1981 Ed.), 
Office of Engineering and Technology Bulletin No. 53. This bulletin is

<R05>
Sec. 22.935  Procedures for comparative renewal proceedings.

    The procedures in this section apply to comparative renewal 
proceedings in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service.
    (a) If one or more of the applications competing with an application 
for renewal of a cellular authorization are filed, the renewal applicant 
must file with the Commission its original renewal expectancy showing 
electronically via the ULS. This filing must be submitted no later than 
60 days after the date of the Public Notice listing as acceptable for 
filing the renewal application and the competing applications.
    (b) Interested parties may file petitions to deny any of the 
mutually exclusive applications. Any such petitions to deny must be 
filed no later than 30 days after the date that the renewal applicant 
submitted its renewal expectancy showing. Applicants may file replies to 
any petitions to deny applications that are filed. Any such replies must 
be filed no later than 15 days after the date that the petition(s) to 
deny was filed. No further pleadings will be accepted.
    (c) In most instances, the renewal application and any competing 
applications will be designated for a two-step procedure. An 
Administrative Law Judge (Presiding Judge) will conduct a threshold 
hearing (step one), in which both the licensee and the competing 
applicants will be parties, to determine whether the renewal applicant 
deserves a renewal expectancy. If the order designating the applications 
for hearing specifies any basic qualifying issues against the licensee, 
those issues will be tried in this threshold hearing. If the Presiding 
Judge determines that the renewal applicant is basically qualified and 
due a renewal expectancy, the competing applicants will be found 
ineligible for further consideration and their applications will be 
denied. If the Presiding Judge determines that the renewal applicant 
does not merit a renewal expectancy but is otherwise qualified, then all 
of the applications will be considered in a comparative hearing (step 
two).
    (d) Any competing applicant may request a waiver of the threshold 
hearing (step one), if such applicant demonstrates that its proposal so 
far exceeds the service already being provided that there would be no 
purpose in making a threshold determination as to whether the renewal 
applicant deserved a renewal expectancy vis-a-vis such a competing 
applicant. Any such waiver request must be filed at the time the 
requestor's application is filed. Petitions opposing such waiver 
requests may be filed. Any such petitions must be filed no later than 30 
days after the date that the renewal applicant submitted its renewal 
expectancy showing. Replies to any petitions opposing such waiver 
requests may be filed. Any such replies must be filed no later than 15 
days after the date that the petition(s) were filed. No further 
pleadings will be accepted. Any waiver request submitted pursuant to 
this paragraph will be acted upon prior to designating the applications 
for hearing. If a request to waive the threshold hearing (step one) is 
granted, the renewal expectancy issue will be designated as part of the 
comparative hearing (step two), and will remain the most important 
comparative factor in deciding the case, as provided in Sec. 22.940(a).
    (e) If the Presiding Judge issues a ruling in the threshold (step 
one) that denies the licensee a renewal expectancy, all of the 
applicants involved in the proceeding will be allowed to file direct 
cases no later than 90 days after the release date of the Presiding 
Judge's ruling. Rebuttal cases must be filed no later than 30 days after 
the date that the direct cases were filed.
    (f) The Presiding Judge shall use the expedited hearing procedures 
delineated in this paragraph in both threshold (step one) and 
comparative (step two) hearings conducted in comparative cellular 
renewal proceedings.

[[Page 202]]

    (1) The Presiding Judge will schedule a first hearing session as 
soon as practicable after the date for filing rebuttal evidence. This 
first session will be an evidentiary admission session at which each 
applicant will identify and offer its previously circulated direct and 
rebuttal exhibits, and each party will have an opportunity to lodge 
objections.
    (2) After accepting the exhibits into evidence, the Presiding Judge 
will entertain motions to cross-examine and rule whether any sponsoring 
witness needs to be produced for cross-examination.
    Determination of what, if any, cross-examination is necessary is 
within the sound judicial discretion of the Presiding Judge, the 
prevailing standard being whether the person requesting cross-
examination has persuasively demonstrated that written evidence is 
ineffectual to develop proof. If cross-examination is necessary, the 
Presiding Judge will specify a date for the appearance of all witnesses. 
In addition, if the designation order points out an area where 
additional underlying data is needed, the Presiding Judge will have the 
authority to permit the limited use of discovery procedures. Finally, 
the Presiding Judge may find that certain additional testimony or cross-
examination is needed to provide a complete record for the FCC. If so, 
the Presiding Judge may schedule a further session.
    (3) After the hearing record is closed, the Presiding Judge may 
request Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law to be filed no 
later than 30 days after the final hearing session. Replies are not 
permitted except in unusual cases and then only with respect to the 
specific issues named by the Presiding Judge.
    (4) The Presiding Judge will then issue an Initial Decision, 
preferably within 60 days of receipt of the last pleadings. If mutually 
exclusive applications are before the Presiding Judge, the Presiding 
Judge will determine which applicant is best qualified. The Presiding 
Judge may also rank the applicants in order of merit if there are more 
than two.
    (5) Parties will have 30 days in which to file exceptions to the 
Initial Decision.

Sec. 22.936  Dismissal of applications in cellular renewal proceedings.

    Any applicant that has filed an application in the Cellular 
Radiotelephone Service that is mutually exclusive with an application 
for renewal of a cellular authorization (competing application), and 
seeks to resolve the mutual exclusivity by requesting dismissal of its 
application, must obtain the approval of the FCC.
    (a) If a competing applicant seeks to dismiss its application prior 
to the Initial Decision stage of the hearing on its application, it must 
submit to the Commission a request for approval of the dismissal of its 
application. This request for approval of the dismissal of its 
application must be submitted and must also include a copy of any 
agreement related to the withdrawal or dismissal, and an affidavit 
setting forth:
    (1) A certification that neither the petitioner nor its principals 
has received or will receive any money or other consideration in excess 
of legitimate and prudent expenses in exchange for the withdrawal or 
dismissal of the application, except that this provision does not apply 
to dismissal or withdrawal of applications pursuant to bona fide merger 
agreements;
    (2) The exact nature and amount of any consideration received or 
promised;
    (3) An itemized accounting of the expenses for which it seeks 
reimbursement; and
    (4) The terms of any oral agreement related to the withdrawal or 
dismissal of the application.
    (b) In addition, within 5 days of the filing date of the applicant 
or petitioner's request for approval, each remaining party to any 
written or oral agreement must submit an affidavit setting forth:
    (1) A certification that neither the applicant nor its principals 
has paid or will pay money or other consideration in excess of the 
legitimate and prudent expenses of the petitioner in exchange

[[Page 203]]

for withdrawing or dismissing the application; and
    (2) The terms of any oral agreement relating to the withdrawal or 
dismissal of the application.
    (c) For the purposes of this section:
    (1) Affidavits filed pursuant to this section must be executed by 
the filing party, if an individual, a partner having personal knowledge 
of the facts, if a partnership, or an officer having personal knowledge 
of the facts, if a corporation or association.
    (2) Applications are deemed to be pending before the FCC from the 
time the application is filed with the FCC until such time as an order 
of the FCC granting, denying or dismissing the application is no longer 
subject to reconsideration by the FCC or to review by any court.
    (3) ``Legitimate and prudent expenses'' are those expenses 
reasonably incurred by a party in preparing to file, filing, prosecuting 
and/or settling its application for which reimbursement is sought.
    (4) ``Other consideration'' consists of financial concessions, 
including, but not limited to, the transfer of assets or the provision 
of tangible pecuniary benefit, as well as non-financial concessions that 
confer any type of benefit on the recipient.

Sec. 22.937  Demonstration of financial qualifications.

    Except as provided in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, each 
applicant for a new cellular system must demonstrate that it has, at the 
time the application is filed, either a separate market-specific firm 
financial commitment or available financial resources sufficient to 
construct and operate for one year the proposed cellular system. Each 
application of reassignment of license or consent to transfer of control 
must demonstrate the financial ability of the proposed assignee or 
transferee to acquire and operate the facilities.
    (a) Estimated costs. The demonstration required by this section must 
include a realistic and prudent estimate of the costs of construction, 
operating and other initial expenses for one year.
    (b) Source of financing. The firm financial commitment must be 
obtained from a state or federally chartered bank or savings and loan 
association, another recognized financial institution, or the financial 
arm of a capital equipment supplier. The firm financial commitment may 
be contingent upon the applicant's obtaining an authorization.
    (c) Lender's statement. The firm financial commitment must contain a 
statement that:
    (1) The lender has examined the financial condition of the 
applicant, including audited financial statements if applicable, and has 
determined that the applicant is creditworthy;
    (2) The lender has examined the financial viability of each proposal 
for which the applicant intends to use the commitment;
    (3) The lender is committed to providing a sum certain to the 
particular applicant;
    (4) The lender's willingness to enter into the commitment is based 
solely on its relationship with the applicant; and,
    (5) The commitment is not in any way guaranteed by any entity other 
than the applicant.
    (d) Showings of financial resources. Applicants relying upon 
personal or internal financial resources must submit the following:
    (1) Audited financial statements, certified within one year of the 
date of the cellular application, that show the availability of 
sufficient net current assets to construct and operate for one year the 
proposed cellular system;
    (2) A balance sheet current within 60 days of the date of filing 
that shows the continued availability of sufficient net current assets 
to construct and operate for one year the proposed cellular system; and,
    (3) A certification by the applicant or an officer of the applicant 
organization attesting to the validity of the unaudited balance sheet.
    (e) Parent corporation financing. Applicants relying upon financing 
obtained from parent corporations must submit the showings listed in 
paragraph (d) of this section as the information pertains to the parent 
corporation.

[[Page 204]]

    (f) Notice upon default. In addition to the disclosures required by 
paragraph (c) of this section, any loan or other credit arrangement 
providing for a chattel mortgage or secured interest in any proposed 
cellular system must include a provision for a minimum of ten (10) days 
prior written notification to the licensee, and to the FCC, before any 
such equipment may be repossessed under default provision of the 
agreement.
    (g) Competing applications in cellular renewal proceedings. Initial 
cellular applications that are competing against a cellular renewal 
application are subject to the rules in this paragraph instead of the 
rules in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.
    (1) Any applicant filing a competing application against a cellular 
renewal application must demonstrate, at the time it files its 
application, that it has either:
    (i) A firm financial commitment, an irrevocable letter of credit or 
performance bond in the amount of its realistic and prudent estimated 
costs of construction and any other expenses to be incurred during the 
first year of operating its proposed system (the irrevocable letter of 
credit or performance bond must be from the type of financial 
institution described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section); or,
    (ii) Available resources, as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this 
section, necessary to construct and operate its proposed cellular system 
for one year.
    (2) The firm financial commitment may be contingent on the applicant 
obtaining an authorization. The applicant must also list all of its 
realistic and prudent estimated costs of construction and any other 
expenses to be incurred during the first year of operating its proposed 
system.
    (3) The firm financial commitment required above shall be obtained 
from a state or federally chartered bank or savings and loan 
association, another recognized financial institution, or the financial 
arm of a capital equipment supplier; shall specify the terms of the loan 
or other form of credit arrangement, including the amount to be 
borrowed, the interest to be paid, the amount of the commitment fee and 
the fact that it has been paid, the terms of repayment and any 
collateral required; and shall contain a statement:
    (i) That the lender has examined the financial conditions of the 
applicant, including audited financial statements where applicable, and 
has determined that the applicant is creditworthy;
    (ii) That the lender has examined the financial viability of the 
proposal for which the applicant intends to use the commitment;
    (iii) That the lender is committed to providing a sum certain to the 
particular applicant;
    (iv) That the lender's willingness to enter into the commitment is 
based solely on its relationship with the applicant; and,
    (v) That the commitment is not in any way guaranteed by an entity 
other than the applicant.
    (4) Applicants intended to rely on personal or internal resources 
must submit:
    (i) Audited financial statements certified within one year of the 
date of the cellular application, indicating the availability of 
sufficient net current assets to construct and operate the proposed 
cellular system for one year;
    (ii) A balance sheet current within 60 days of the date of filing 
its application that clearly shows the continued availability of 
sufficient net current assets to construct and operate the proposed 
cellular system for one year; and,
    (iii) A certification by the applicant or an officer of the 
applicant organization attesting to the validity of the unaudited 
balance sheet.
    (5) Applicant intending to rely upon financing obtained through a 
parent corporation must submit the information required by paragraph 
(g)(4) of this section, as the information pertains to the parent 
corporation.
    (6) As an alternative to relying upon a firm financial commitment, 
an irrevocable letter of credit, or a performance bond from a financial 
institution as described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, an 
applicant may state that it has placed in an escrow account sufficient 
cash to meet its construction and first-year operating expenses. Such a 
statement must specify the amount of cash, the escrow account number and 
the financial institution where the escrow account is located.

[[Page 205]]

    (7) Any competing application filed against the renewal application 
of an incumbent cellular licensee that does not demonstrate, at the time 
it is initially filed, that the competing applicant has sufficient funds 
to construct and operate for one year its proposed cellular system will 
be dismissed.
    (h) Exemptions. Any licensee applying for an unserved area adjacent 
to its existing cellular system, to integrate such area into the 
existing system, is exempt from the financial demonstration requirements 
of this section. In addition, modification applications and pro forma 
assignment and transfer of control applications are exempt from the 
financial demonstration requirements of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 22.939  Site availability requirements for applications competing with cellular renewal applications.

    In addition to the other requirements set forth in this part for 
initial cellular applications, any application competing against a 
cellular renewal application must contain, when initially filed, 
appropriate documentation demonstrating that its proposed antenna 
site(s) will be available. Competing applications that do not include 
such documentation will be dismissed. If the competing applicant does 
not own a particular site, it must, at a minimum demonstrate that the 
site is available to it by providing a letter from the owner of the 
proposed antenna site expressing the owner's intent to sell or lease the 
proposed site to the applicant. If any proposed antenna site is under 
U.S. Government control, the applicant must submit written confirmation 
of the site's availability from the appropriate Government agency. 
Applicants which file competing applications against incumbent cellular 
licensees may not rely on the assumption that an incumbent licensee's 
antenna sites are available for their use.


<R05>
Sec. 22.940  Criteria for comparative cellular renewal proceedings.

    This section sets forth criteria to be used in comparative cellular 
renewal proceedings. The ultimate issue in comparative renewal 
proceedings will be to determine, in light of the evidence adduced in 
the proceeding, what disposition of the applications would best serve 
the public interest, convenience and necessity.
    (a) Renewal expectancies. The most important comparative factor to 
be considered in a comparative cellular renewal proceeding is a major 
preference, commonly referred to as a ``renewal expectancy.''
    (1) The cellular renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal 
proceeding will receive a renewal expectancy, if its past record for the 
relevant license period demonstrates that:
    (i) The renewal applicant has provided ``substantial'' service 
during its past license term. ``Substantial'' service is defined as 
service which is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of 
mediocre service which just might minimally warrant renewal; and
    (ii) The renewal applicant has substantially compiled with 
applicable FCC rules, policies and the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended.
    (2) In order to establish its right to a renewal expectancy, a 
cellular renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding 
must submit a showing explaining why it should receive a renewal 
expectancy. At a minimum, this showing must include.
    (i) A description of its current service in terms of geographic 
coverage and population served, as well as the system's ability to 
accommodate the needs of roamers;
    (ii) An explanation of its record of expansion, including a 
timetable of the construction of new cell sites to meet changes in 
demand for cellular service;
    (iii) A description of its investments in its cellular system; and
    (iv) Copies of all FCC orders finding the licensee to have violated 
the Communications Act or any FCC rule or policy; and a list of any 
pending proceedings that relate to any matter described in this 
paragraph.
    (3) In making its showing of entitlement to a renewal expectancy, a 
renewal applicant may claim credit for any system modification 
applications that were pending on the date it filed its renewal 
application. Such credit will not be allowed if the modification 
application is dismissed or denied.
    (b) Additional comparative issues. The following additional 
comparative

[[Page 206]]

issues will be included in comparative cellular renewal proceedings, if 
a full comparative hearing is conducted pursuant to Sec. 22.935(c).
    (1) To determine on a comparative basis the geographic areas and 
population that each applicant proposes to serve; to determine and 
compare the relative demand for the services proposed in said areas; and 
to determine and compare the ability of each applicant's cellular system 
to accommodate the anticipated demand for both local and roamer service;
    (2) To determine on a comparative basis each applicant's proposal 
for expanding its system capacity in a coordinated manner in order to 
meet anticipated increasing demand for both local and roamer service;
    (3) To determine on a comparative basis the nature and extent of the 
service proposed by each applicant, including each applicant's proposed 
rates, charges, maintenance, personnel, practices, classifications, 
regulations and facilities (including switching capabilities); and
    (4) To determine on a comparative basis each applicant's past 
performance in the cellular industry or another business of comparable 
type and size.
    (c) Additional showings for competing applications. With respect to 
evidence introduced pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, any 
applicant filing a competing application against a cellular renewal 
application (competing applicant) who claims a preference for offering 
any service not currently offered by the incumbent licensee must 
demonstrate that there is demand for that new service and also present a 
business plan showing that the competing applicant can operate the 
system economically. Any competing applicant who proposes to replace 
analog technology with digital technology will receive no credit for its 
proposal unless it submits a business plan showing how it will operate 
its system economically and how it will provide more comprehensive 
service than does the incumbent licensee with existing and implemented 
cellular technology.


<R05>
Sec. 22.941  System identification numbers.

    System identification numbers (SIDs) are 15 bit binary numbers 
assigned to cellular systems. SIDs are transmitted by the cellular 
systems so that cellular mobile stations can determine whether the 
system through which they are communicating is a system to which they 
subscribe, or whether they are considered by the system to be roamers.
    (a) The FCC assigns one SID to each cellular system on its initial 
authorization. Cellular systems may transmit only their assigned SID(s) 
and/or the SIDs assigned to other cellular systems. A cellular system 
may transmit the SID assigned to another cellular system only if the 
licensee of that system concurs with such use of its assigned SID.
    (b) Licensees must notify the Commission using FCC Form 601, if 
their cellular systems transmit SIDs assigned to other cellular systems. 
The notification must indicate the concurrence of the licensee(s) of 
such other systems with this use of their assigned SID(s). The 
notification must be mailed or delivered to the filing place (see 
Sec. 22.106) no later than 15 days after the system begins transmitting 
the SID(s).
    (c) Licensees may request that an additional (previously unassigned) 
SID be assigned to their system by filing an application for minor 
modification of station on FCC Form 601.

63 FR 68951, Dec. 14, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 22.942   Limitations on interests in licensees for both channel blocks in an area.

    (a) Controlling interests. A licensee, an individual or entity that 
owns a controlling or otherwise attributable interest in a licensee, or 
an individual or entity that actually controls a licensee for one 
channel block in a CGSA may have an direct or indirect ownership 
interest of 5 percent or less in the licensee, an individual or entity 
that owns a controlling or otherwise attributable interest in a 
licensee, or an individual or entity that actually controls

[[Page 207]]

a licensee for the other channel block in an overlapping CGSA.
    (b) Non-controlling interests. A direct or indirect non-attributable 
interest in both systems is excluded from the general rule prohibiting 
multiple ownership interests.
    (c) Divestiture. Divestiture of interests as a result of a transfer 
of control or assignment of authorization must occur prior to 
consummating the transfer or assignment.
    (d) Ownership attribution. For purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section, ownership and other interests cellular licensees will be 
attributed to their holders pursuant to the following criteria:
    (1) Controlling interest shall be attributable. Controlling interest 
means majority voting equity ownership, any general partnership 
interest, or any means of actual working control (including negative 
control) over the operation of the licensee, in whatever manner 
exercised.
    (2) Partnership and other ownership interests and any stock interest 
amounting to 20 percent or more of the equity, or outstanding stock, or 
outstanding voting stock of a cellular licensee shall be attributed.
    (3) Non-voting stock shall be attributed as an interest in the 
issuing entity if in excess of the amounts set forth in paragraph (d)(2) 
of this section.
    (4) Debt and instruments such as warrants, convertible debentures, 
options, or other interests (except non-voting stock) with rights of 
conversion to voting interests shall not be attributed unless and until 
converted.
    (5) Limited partnership interests shall be attributed to limited 
partners and shall be calculated according to both the percentage of 
equity paid in and the percentage of distribution of profits and losses.
    (6) Officers and directors of a cellular licensee shall be 
considered to have an attributable interest in the entity with which 
they are so associated. The officers and directors of an entity that 
controls a cellular licensee shall be considered to have an attributable 
interest in the cellular licensee.
    (7) Ownership interests that are held indirectly by any party 
through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by 
successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in 
the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution 
benchmark to the resulting product, except that if the ownership 
percentage for an interest in any link in the chain exceeds 50 percent 
or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were a 100 
percent interest. (For example, if A owns 20% of B, and B owns 40% of 
licensee C, then A's interest in licensee C would be 8%. If A owns 20% 
of B, and B owns 51% of licensee C, then A's interest in licensee C 
would be 20% because B's ownership of C exceeds 50%.)
    (8) Any person who manages the operations of a cellular licensee 
pursuant to a management agreement shall be considered to have an 
attributable interest in such licensee if such person, or its affiliate, 
has authority to make decisions or otherwise engage in practices or 
activities that determine, or significantly influence,
    (i) The nature or types of services offered by such licensee;
    (ii) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (iii) The prices charged for such services.
    (9) Any licensee or its affiliate who enters into a joint marketing 
arrangements with a cellular, licensee, or its affiliate shall be 
considered to have an attributable interest, if such licensee, or its 
affiliate, has authority to make decisions or otherwise engage in 
practices or activities that determine, or significantly influence,
    (i) The nature or types of services offered by such licensee;
    (ii) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (iii) The prices charged for such services.

Sec. 22.943  Limitations on assignments and transfers of cellular authorizations.

    The following limitations apply to applications for consent to 
transfer of control or assignment of authorizations in the Cellular 
Radiotelephone Service.

[[Page 208]]

    (a) Trafficking. Applications for consent to transfer of control or 
assignment of authorization in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service are 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 22.139, except for:
    (1) Applications reflecting the trading of an ownership interest in 
an authorized but unconstructed cellular system in one market for a 
commensurate interest in a cellular system in another market; and,
    (2) Applications for consent to transfer of control or assignment of 
a cellular authorization obtained by random selection, after 
commencement of service.
    (b) Unserved area systems. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, the FCC does not accept applications for consent 
to transfer of control or assignment of the authorization of a cellular 
system licensed to serve an unserved area until the system has provided 
service to subscribers for at least one year.
    (1) Licensees must not enter into any agreement (e.g. option 
agreement or management contract) to transfer control of the licensee of 
the system until the system has provided service to subscribers for one 
year.
    (2) The FCC may accept that grant applications for consent to 
transfer of control or for assignment of authorization if the transfer 
or assignment is pro forma and does not involve a change in ownership.
    (3) An applicant seeking approval for a transfer of control or 
assignment (otherwise permitted under the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 
chapter I) of a license within three years of receiving a new license 
through a competitive bidding procedure must, together with its 
application for transfer of control or assignment, file with the 
Commission a statement indicating that its license was obtained through 
competitive bidding. Such applicant must also file with the Commission 
the other documents and information set forth in Sec. 1.2111 of this 
chapter.
    (c) Systems authorized as result of comparative renewal proceeding. 
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2) and (c)(3) of 
this section, the FCC does not accept applications for consent to 
transfer of control or for assignment of the authorization of a cellular 
system that has been acquired by the current licensee for the first time 
as a result of a comparative renewal proceeding until the system has 
provided service to subscribers for at least three years.
    (1) The FCC may accept and grant applications for consent to 
transfer of control or for assignment of the authorization of a cellular 
system that is to be transferred as a part of a bona fide sale of an on-
going business to which the cellular operation is incidental.
    (2) The FCC may accept and grant applications for consent to 
transfer of control or for assignment of the authorization of a cellular 
system that is to be transferred as a result of the death of the 
licensee.
    (3) The FCC may accept and grant applications for consent to 
transfer of control or for assignment of authorization if the transfer 
or assignment is pro forma and does not involve a change in ownership.

[59 FR 59507, Nov. 17, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 58339, Nov. 14, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 22.945  Interests in multiple applications.

    This section governs interests in applicants with mutually exclusive 
applications for a new cellular system. For the purposes of this 
section, ``interest in an application'' means interest in the applicant.
    (a) General. Except as otherwise provided in this section, parties 
must not have any interest, direct or indirect, in more than one 
application for authority to operate a new cellular system in the same 
cellular market.
    (b) Abutting CGSAs. Licensees of existing systems whose cellular 
geographic service area (CGSA) abuts a proposed CGSA may each file one 
application that is mutually exclusive with the applications of other 
such licensees, even though they share common owners, provided that such 
licensees do not thereby acquire a simultaneous interest in applications 
for both channel blocks in any geographical area.
    (c) Publicly traded corporate applicants. Parties must not have any 
interest, direct or indirect, in more than

[[Page 209]]

one mutually exclusive initial application for which the applicant is a 
publicly traded corporation, except that ownership interests of less 
than 5% are not considered. Ownership and other interests in applicants 
are attributed to their holder and deemed cognizable as set forth below.
    (1) Passive investors. Investment companies, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 
80a-3, insurance companies and banks holding stock through their trust 
departments in trust accounts are deemed to have a cognizable interest 
in a publicly traded cellular applicant only if they hold 10% or more of 
the stock of the applicant. This provision applies only if an applicant 
in which such parties hold an interest certifies in its application that 
no such party has exerted or attempted to exert any influence or control 
over the officers of the applicant.
    (2) Multiplier. Attribution of ownership interests in a publicly 
traded cellular applicant that are held indirectly by any party through 
one or more intervening corporations will be determined by successive 
multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in the 
vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution 
benchmark to the resulting product, except that wherever the ownership 
percentage for any link in the chain exceeds 50 percent, it is not 
included in the multiplication.


<R05>
Sec. 22.946  Service commencement and construction periods for cellular systems.

    (a) Commencement of service. New cellular systems must be at least 
partially constructed and begin providing cellular service to 
subscribers within the service commencement periods specified in Table 
H-1 of this section. Service commencement periods begin on the date of 
grant of the initial authorization, and are not extended by the grant of 
subsequent authorizations for the cellular system (such as for major 
modifications). The licensee must notify the FCC (FCC Form 601) after 
the requirements of this section are met (see Sec. 1.946 of this 
chapter).
    (b) To satisfy the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a 
cellular system must be interconnected with the public switched 
telephone network (PSTN) and must be providing service to mobile 
stations operated by its subscribers and roamers. A cellular system is 
not considered to be providing service to subscribers if mobile stations 
can not make telephone calls to landline telephones and receive 
telephone calls from landline telephones through the PSTN, or if the 
system intentionally serves only roamer stations.
    (1) [Reserved]
    (2) The licensee must notify the FCC (FCC Form 489) no later than 15 
days after the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met.
    (b) Construction period for specific facilities. The construction 
period applicable to specific new or modified cellular facilities for 
which an authorization has been granted is one year from the date the 
authorization is granted. Failure to comply with this requirement 
results in termination of the authorization for the specific new or 
modified facility, pursuant to Sec. 22.144(b).

64 FR 53241, Oct. 1, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 22.947  Five year build-out period.

    The licensee of the first cellular system authorized on each channel 
block in each cellular market is afforded a five year period, beginning 
on the date the initial authorization for the system is granted, during 
which it may expand the system within that market.
    (a) Exclusive right to expand within market. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, the FCC does not accept applications for 
authority to operate a new cellular system in any unserved area in a 
market on a channel block during the five year build-out period.
    (b) Partitioned markets. During the five-year build-out period, the 
licensee of the first cellular system on each channel block in each 
market may enter into contracts with eligible parties, allowing such 
parties to apply by using FCC Form 601 for a new cellular system in that 
channel block within the market. The FCC may grant such applications if 
they are in compliance with the rules in this part. Markets with two or 
more authorized cellular

[[Page 210]]

systems on the same channel block during the five year build-out period 
are referred to (with respect to the affected channel block) as 
``partitioned markets''.
    (1) Partitioning contracts must define the CGSA of the subsequent 
cellular system in accordance with Sec. 22.911, including any expansion 
rights ceded. If not exercised, any such expansion rights terminate at 
the end of the five year build-out period.
    (2) The five year build-out period begins on the date the initial 
authorization for the first cellular system is granted, and is not 
extended or affected in any way by the initial authorization of any 
subsequent cellular systems pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
    (c) System information update. Sixty days before the end of the five 
year build-out period, the licensee of each cellular system authorized 
on each channel block in each cellular market must file, in triplicate, 
a system information update (SIU), comprising a full size map, a reduced 
map, and an exhibit showing technical data relevant to determination of 
the system's CGSA. Separate maps must be submitted for each market into 
which the CGSA extends, showing the extension area in the adjacent 
market. Maps showing extension areas must be labeled (i.e. marked with 
the market number and channel block) for the market into which the CGSA 
extends. SIUs must accurately depict the relevant cell locations and 
coverage of the system at the end of the five year build-out period. 
SIUs must be filed at the Mobile Services Division, Common Carrier 
Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554. If any 
changes to the system occur after the filing of the SIU, but before the 
end of the five year build-out period, the licensee must file, in 
triplicate, additional maps and/or data as necessary to insure that the 
cell locations and coverage of the system as of the end of the five year 
build-out period are accurately depicted.
    (1) The scale of the full-size map must be 1:500,000, regardless of 
whether any different scale is used for the reduced map. The map must 
have a legend, a distance scale and correctly labeled latitude and 
longitude lines. The map must be clear and legible. The map must 
accurately show the cell sites (transmitting antenna locations) which 
determine the CGSA, the entire CGSA, any extension of the composite 
service are boundary beyond the CGSA (see Sec. 22.911) and the relevant 
portions of the cellular market boundary. The date on which the map 
depictions are accurate must appear on the map.
    (2) The reduced map must be a proportional reduction, to 8\1/2\ x 11 
inches, of the full-size map required in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, unless it proves to be impractical to depict the entire market 
by reducing the full-size map. In such instance, an 8\1/2\ x 11 inch map 
of a different scale may be substituted, provided that the required 
features of the full-size map are clearly depicted and labeled.

Sec. 22.948  Partitioning and Disaggregation.

    (a) Eligibility. (1) Generally. Parties seeking approval for 
partitioning and disaggregation shall request an authorization for 
partial assignment of a license pursuant to Sec. 1.948 of this chapter. 
Cellular licensees may partition or disaggregate their spectrum to other 
qualified entities.
    (2) Partitioning. During the five year build-out period, as defined 
in Sec. 22.947, cellular licensees may partition any portion of their 
cellular market to other qualified entities. After the five year build-
out period, cellular licensees and unserved area licensees may partition 
any portion of their Cellular Geographic Service Area (CGSA), as defined 
by Sec. 22.911, to other qualified entities but may not partition 
unserved portions of their cellular market.
    (3) Disaggregation. After the five year build-out period, as defined 
in Sec. 22.947, parties obtaining disaggregated spectrum may only use 
such spectrum in that portion of the cellular market encompassed by the 
original licensee's CGSA and may not use such spectrum to provide 
service to unserved portions of the cellular market.
    (b) Disaggregation. Cellular licensees and unserved area licensees 
may disaggregate spectrum in any amount.

[[Page 211]]

    (c) Combined partitioning and disaggregation. The Commission will 
consider requests for partial assignment of cellular licenses that 
propose combinations of partitioning and disaggregation.
    (d) License Term. The license term for the partitioned license area 
and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original 
cellular licensee's or the unserved area licensee's license term 
provided for in Sec. 22.144(a).

<R05>
Sec. 22.949  Unserved area licensing process.

    This section sets forth the process for licensing unserved areas in 
cellular markets on channel blocks for which the five year build-out 
period has expired. This process has two phases: Phase I and Phase II.
    (a) Phase I. Phase I is a one-time process that provides an 
opportunity for eligible parties to file competing applications for 
authority to operate a new cellular system in or to expand an existing 
cellular system into unserved areas (Phase I initial applications) as 
soon as these areas become available. In addition, each licensee whose 
Phase I initial application is granted is afforded one opportunity 
during the Phase I process to file an application proposing major 
modifications to the cellular system authorized by that grant (a Phase I 
major modification application), without being subject to competing 
applications.
    (1) Phase I initial applications must be filed on the 31st day after 
the expiration of the five year build-out period of the authorized 
system(s) on the channel block requested in the market containing the 
unserved area.
    (i) Each Phase I application must request authorization for one and 
only one cellular geographic service area (CGSA) in one and only one 
cellular market.
    (ii) Applicants must not file more than one Phase I initial 
application for any cellular market.
    (iii) Phase I initial applications must not propose any de minimis 
or contract service area boundary (SAB) extensions.
    (2) Only one Phase I initial application is granted on each channel 
block in each market. Consequently, whenever two or more acceptable 
Phase I initial applications are timely filed in the same market on the 
same channel block, such Phase I initial applications are mutually 
exclusive, regardless of any other considerations such as the technical 
proposals. In order to determine which of such mutually exclusive Phase 
I initial applications to grant, the Commission administers competitive 
bidding procedures in accordance with subpart Q of part 1 of this 
chapter. After such procedures, the application of the winning bidder 
may be granted and the applications excluded by that grant may be 
dismissed without prejudice.

    Note: Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 22.949(a)(2), mutually 
exclusive Phase I initial applications that were filed between March 10, 
1993 and July 25, 1993, inclusive, are to be included in a random 
selection process, following which the selected application may be 
granted and the applications excluded by that grant may be dismissed 
without prejudice.

    (3) Phase I major modification applications (applications filed 
during Phase I that propose major modifications to cellular systems 
authorized by the grant of Phase I initial applications) must be filed 
no later than 90 days after the grant of the Phase I initial 
application. Each Phase I licensee may file only one Phase I major 
modification application. The FCC will not accept any competing 
applications in response to a Phase I major modification application. 
Phase I licensees may not sell to a third party any rights to apply for 
unserved area.
    (i) Phase I major modification applications may propose de minimis 
or contract SAB extensions; provided that a contract SAB extension into 
an adjacent market may be proposed only if, at the time the Phase I 
major modification application is filed, the licensee in the adjacent 
market (on the requested channel block) has the right to enter into such 
a contract (see Sec. 22.912(c)).
    (ii) Phase I major modification application may propose a CGSA that 
is not contiguous with the authorized or proposed CGSA, provided that 
the non-contiguous CGSA meets the minimum coverage requirement of 
Sec. 22.951.

[[Page 212]]

    (4) Phase I licensees may also file applications for or 
notifications of minor modifications to its system. However, such minor 
modifications may not reduce the size of the CGSA below the minimum 
coverage requirement of Sec. 22.951.
    (b) Phase II. Phase II is an on-going filing process that allows 
eligible parties to apply for any unserved areas that may remain in a 
market after the Phase I process is complete.
    (1) If a Phase I initial application is granted for a market and 
channel block, Phase II applications (applications for authority to 
operate a cellular system in any remaining unserved area) for that 
market and channel block may be filed on or after the 121st day after 
the Phase I application was granted. If no Phase I initial applications 
are granted for a market and channel block, Phase II applications for 
that market and channel block may be filed on or after the 31st day 
after the FCC dismissed the last pending Phase I application. If no 
Phase I initial applications are received for a market and channel 
block, Phase II applications for that market and channel block may be 
filed on or after the 32nd day after the expiration of the relevant 
five-year build-out period.
    (2) There is no limit to the number of Phase II applications that 
may be granted on each channel block in each market. Consequently, Phase 
II applications are mutually exclusive only if the proposed CGSAs would 
overlap. Mutually exclusive applications are processed using the general 
procedures in Sec. 22.131.
    (3) Phase II applications may propose a CGSA covering more than one 
cellular market. Each Phase II application must request authorization 
for one and only one CGSA. Phase II applications may propose de minimis 
and contract SAB extensions.
    (c) Settlements among some, but not all, applicants with mutually 
exclusive applications for unserved areas (partial settlements) are 
prohibited. Settlements among all applicants with mutually exclusive 
applications (full settlements) are allowed and must be filed no later 
than the date that the FCC Form 175 (short-form) is filed.
    (d) Limitations on amendments. Notwithstanding the provisions of 
Sec. 22.122, Phase I applications are subject to the following 
additional limitations in regard to the filing of amendments.
    (1) The Commission will not accept amendments (of any type) to 
mutually exclusive Phase I applications prior to the conclusion of the 
competitive bidding process.
    (2) The FCC will not accept major amendments to Phase I 
applications.
    (3) Minor amendments required by Sec. 1.65 of this chapter must be 
filed no later than thirty (30) days after public notice announcing the 
results of the competitive bidding process.

<R05>
Sec. 22.951  Minimum coverage requirement.

    Applications for authority to operate a new cellular system in an 
unserved area, other than those filed by the licensee of an existing 
system that abuts the unserved area, must propose a contiguous cellular 
geographical service area (CGSA) of at least 130 square kilometers (50 
square miles). Area within contract SAB extensions counts toward the 
minimum coverage requirement. However, area within de minimis SAB 
extensions does not count toward the minimum coverage requirement. 
Applications for authority to operate a new cellular system in an 
unserved area, other than those filed by the licensee of an existing 
system that abuts the unserved area, must not propose coverage of water 
areas only (or water areas and uninhabited islands or reefs only), 
except for unserved areas in the Gulf of Mexico MSA.


<R05>
Sec. 22.953  Content and form of applications.

    Applications for authority to operate a cellular system in an 
unserved area must comply with the specifications in this section.
    (a) Applications for authority to operate a cellular system in an 
unserved area must include the following information in addition to the 
requirements specified in Secs. 1.919, 1.923 and 1.924. The following 
exhibits must be set off by tabs and numbered as follows:

[[Page 213]]

    (1) Exhibit I--full-size map. The scale of the full-size map must be 
1:500,000, regardless of whether any different scale is used for the 
reduced map required in Exhibit II. The map must have a legend, a 
distance scale and correctly labeled latitude and longitude lines. The 
map must be clear and legible. The map must accurately show the cell 
sites (transmitting antenna locations), the entire CGSA, any extension 
of the composite service area boundary beyond the CGSA (see Sec. 22.911) 
and the relevant portions of the cellular market boundary.
    (2) Exhibit II--reduced map. This map must be a proportional 
reduction, to 8\1/2\  x  11 inches, of the full-size map required for 
Exhibit I, unless it proves to be impractical to depict the entire 
cellular market by reducing the full-size map. In such instance, an 8\1/
2\ x 11 inch map of a different scale may be substituted, provided that 
the required features of the full-size map are clearly depicted and 
labeled.
    (3) Exhibit III--engineering. This exhibit must contain the data and 
methodology used to calculate the CGSA and service area boundary.
    (4) Exhibit IV--channel plan. This exhibit must show which specific 
channels (or groups) are to be used at each cell site. Any necessary 
table for converting channel numbers to center frequencies must be 
provided.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) Exhibit VI--service proposal. This exhibit must describe the 
services proposed for subscribers and roamers, including the proposed 
method for handling complaints.
    (7) Exhibit VII--cellular design. This exhibit must show that the 
proposed system design complies with cellular system design concepts, 
and must describe the method proposed to expand the system in a 
coordinated fashion as necessary to address changing demand for cellular 
service.
    (8) Exhibit VIII--blocking level. This exhibit must disclose the 
blocking probability or other criteria to be used to determine whether 
it is necessary to take measures to increase system capacity to maintain 
service quality.
    (9) Exhibit IX--start-up expenses. This exhibit must disclose in 
detail the projected cost of construction and other initial expenses of 
the proposed system, and how the applicant intends to meet these 
expenses and the costs of operation for the first year.
    (10) Exhibit X--interconnection arrangements. This exhibit is 
required for applicants that provide public landline message telephone 
service in any portion of the proposed CGSA. This exhibit must describe 
exactly how the proposed system would interconnect with the landline 
network. The description must be of sufficient detail to enable a 
competitor to connect with the landline system in exactly the same 
manner, if the competitor so chooses.
    (b) Existing systems--major modifications. Licensees making major 
modifications pursuant to Sec. 1.929(h) must file FCC Form 601 and need 
only contain the exhibits required by paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) 
of this section.
    (c) Existing systems--minor modifications. Licensees making minor 
modifications pursuant to Sec. 1.929(h)--in which the modification 
causes a change in the CGSA boundary (including the removal of a 
transmitter or transmitters)--must notify the FCC (using FCC Form 601) 
and include full-sized maps, reduced maps, and supporting engineering 
exhibits as described in paragraphs (a)(1)-(3) of this section. If the 
modification involves a contract SAB extension, it must include a 
statement as to whether the five-year build-out for the system on the 
relevant channel block in the market into which the SAB extends has 
elapsed, and as to whether the SAB extends into any unserved area in 
that market.

Sec. 22.963  Withdrawal, default and disqualification payments.

    (a) During the course of an auction conducted pursuant to 
Sec. 22.961, the Commission will impose payments on bidders who withdraw 
high bids during the course of an auction, who default on payments due 
after an auction closes, or who are disqualified.
    (b) Bid withdrawal prior to close of auction. A bidder who withdraws 
a high bid

[[Page 215]]

during the course of an auction will be subject to a payment equal to 
the difference between the amount bid and the amount of the winning bid 
the next time the license is offered by the Commission. No withdrawal 
payment would be assessed if the subsequent winning bid exceeds the 
withdrawn bid. This payment amount will be deducted from any upfront 
payments or down payments that the withdrawing bidder has deposited with 
the Commission.
    (c) Default or disqualification after close of auction. If a high 
bidder defaults or is disqualified after the close of such an auction, 
the defaulting bidder will be subject to the payment in paragraph (a) of 
this section plus an additional penalty equal to three (3) percent of 
the subsequent winning bid. If the subsequent winning bid exceeds the 
defaulting bidder's bid amount, the 3 percent payment will be calculated 
based on the defaulting bidder's bid amount. These amounts will be 
deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the defaulting 
or disqualified bidder has deposited with the Commission.

               Subpart I--Offshore Radiotelephone Service


<R05>
Sec. 22.1001  Scope.

    The rules in this subpart govern the licensing and operation of 
offshore radiotelephone stations. The licensing and operation of these 
stations and systems is also subject to rules elsewhere in this part 
that apply generally to the public mobile services. However, in case of 
conflict, the rules in this subpart govern.


<R05>
Sec. 22.1003  Eligibility.

    Offshore central station licenses may be licensed to communications 
common carriers. Offshore subscriber stations may be licensed to common 
carriers or users of the service.


<R05>
Sec. 22.1005  Priority of service.

    Facilities in the Offshore Radiotelephone Service are intended 
primarily for rendition of public message service between offshore 
subscriber and central stations. However, they may also be used to 
render private leased line communication service, provided that such 
usage does not reduce or impair the extent or quality of communication 
service which would be available, in the absence of private leased line 
service, to the general public receiving or subsequently requesting 
public message service from an offshore central station.


<R05>
Sec. 22.1007  Channels for offshore radiotelephone systems.

    The channels listed in this section are allocated for paired 
assignment to transmitters located in the specified geographical zones 
that provide offshore radiotelephone service. All channels have a 
bandwidth of 20 kHz and are designated by their center frequencies in 
MegaHertz.
    (a) Zone A--Southern Louisiana. The geographical area in Zone A is 
bounded as follows:

    From longitude W.87 deg.45' on the East to longitude W.94 deg.00' on 
the West and from the 4.8 kilometer (3 mile) limit along the Gulf of 
Mexico shoreline on the North to the limit of the Outer Continental 
Shelf on the South.

    (1) These channels may be assigned for use by offshore central 
(base/fixed) or subscriber stations (fixed, temporary fixed, surface 
and/or airborne mobile) as indicated, for voice-grade general

    (8) Interstitial channels. Interstitial channels are those with 
center frequencies offset by <plus-minus>12.5 kHz from the listed center 
frequencies. The FCC may assign interstitial channels to offshore 
stations in Zone A subject to the following conditions:
    (i) Offshore stations transmitting on interstitial channels must be 
located east of W.92 deg. longitude.
    (ii) Operations on interstitial channels are considered to be 
secondary to operations on channels with the listed center frequencies.
    (iii) Offshore stations operating on interstitial channels must be 
used only for voice grade general communications or to provide for 
private line service.

    Note to paragraph (a) of Sec. 22.1007: These channels are contained 
in UHF TV Channel 17.

<R05>
Sec. 22.1009  Transmitter locations.

    The rules in this section establish limitations on the locations 
from which stations in the Offshore Radiotelephone Service may transmit.
    (a) All stations. Offshore stations must not transmit from locations 
outside the boundaries of the appropriate zones specified in 
Sec. 22.1007. Offshore stations must not transmit from locations within 
241 kilometers (150 miles) of any full-service television station that

[[Page 219]]

transmits on the TV channel containing the channel on which the offshore 
station transmits.
    (b) Airborne subscriber stations. Airborne subscriber stations must 
not transmit from altitudes exceeding 305 meters (1000 feet) above mean 
sea level. Airborne mobile stations in Zone A must not transmit from 
locations within 129 kilometers (80 miles) of Lake Charles, Louisiana. 
Airborne mobile stations in Zone B must not transmit from locations 
within 129 kilometers (80 miles) of Lafayette, Louisiana. Airborne 
mobile stations in Zone C must not transmit from locations within 129 
kilometers (80 miles) of Corpus Christi or locations within 129 
kilometers (80 miles) of Houston, Texas.


<R05>
Sec. 22.1011  Antenna height limitations.

    The antenna height of offshore stations must not exceed 61 meters 
(200 feet) above mean sea level. The antenna height of offshore surface 
mobile stations must not exceed 10 meters (30 feet) above the waterline.


<R05>
Sec. 22.1013  Effective radiated power limitations.

    The effective radiated power (ERP) of transmitters in the Offshore 
Radiotelephone Service must not exceed the limits in this section.
    (a) Maximum power. The ERP of transmitters in this service must not 
exceed 1000 Watts under any circumstances.
    (b) Mobile transmitters. The ERP of mobile transmitters must not 
exceed 100 Watts. The ERP of mobile transmitters, when located within 32 
kilometers (20 miles) of the 4.8 kilometer (3 mile) limit, must not 
exceed 25 Watts. The ERP of airborne mobile stations must not exceed 1 
Watt.
    (c) Protection for TV Reception. The ERP limitations in this 
paragraph are intended to reduce the likelihood that interference to 
television reception from offshore radiotelephone operations will occur.
    (1) Co-channel protection. The ERP of offshore stations must not 
exceed the limits in Table I-1 of this section. The limits depend upon 
the height above mean sea level of the offshore transmitting antenna and 
the distance between the antenna location of the offshore transmitter 
and the antenna location of the main transmitter of the nearest full-
service television station that transmits on the TV channel containing 
the channel on which the offshore station transmits.
    (2) Adjacent channel protection. The ERP of offshore stations 
located within 128.8 kilometers (80 miles) of the main transmitter 
antenna of a full service TV station that transmits on a TV channel 
adjacent to the TV channel which contains the channel on which the 
offshore station transmits must not exceed the limits in the Table I-2 
of Sec. 22.1015. The limits depend upon the height above mean sea level 
of the offshore transmitting antenna and the distance between the 
location of the offshore transmitter and the 4.8 kilometer (3 mile) 
limit.

<R05>
Sec. 22.1100  Purpose.

    Pursuant to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act 
(CALEA), Public Law 103-414, 108 Stat. 4279 (1994) (codified as amended 
in sections of 18 U.S.C. and 47 U.S.C.), this subpart contains rules 
that require a

[[Page 221]]

cellular telecommunications carrier to implement certain capabilities to 
ensure law enforcement access to authorized communications or call-
identifying information.


<R05>
Sec. 22.1101  Scope.

    The definitions included in this subpart shall be used solely for 
the purpose of implementing CALEA requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 22.1102  Definitions.

    Call identifying information. Call identifying information means 
dialing or signaling information that identifies the origin, direction, 
destination, or termination of each communication generated or received 
by a subscriber by means of any equipment, facility, or service of a 
telecommunications carrier. Call identifying information is ``reasonably 
available'' to a carrier if it is present at an intercept access point 
and can be made available without the carrier being unduly burdened with 
network modifications.
    Collection function. The location where lawfully authorized 
intercepted communications and call-identifying information is collected 
by a law enforcement agency (LEA).
    Content of subject-initiated conference calls. Capability that 
permits a LEA to monitor the content of conversations by all parties 
connected via a conference call when the facilities under surveillance 
maintain a circuit connection to the call.
    Dialed digit extraction. Capability that permits a LEA to receive on 
the call data channel digits dialed by a subject when a call is 
connected to another carrier's service for processing and routing.
    In-band and out-of-band signaling. Capability that permits a LEA to 
be informed when a network message that provides call identifying 
information (e.g., ringing, busy, call waiting signal, message light) is 
generated or sent by the IAP switch to a subject using the facilities 
under surveillance. Excludes signals generated by customer premises 
equipment when no network signal is generated.
    Intercept Access Point (IAP). Intercept access point is a point 
within a carrier's system where some of the communications or call-
identifying information of an intercept subject's equipment, facilities, 
and services are accessed.
    J-STD-025. The interim standard developed by the Telecommunications 
Industry Association and the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry 
Solutions for wireline, cellular, and broadband PCS carriers. This 
standard defines services and features to support lawfully authorized 
electronic surveillance, and specifies interfaces necessary to deliver 
intercepted communications and call-identifying information to a LEA.
    LEA. Law enforcement agency; e.g., the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation or a local police department.
    Party hold, join, drop on conference calls. Capability that permits 
a LEA to identify the parties to a conference call conversation at all 
times.
    Subject-initiated dialing and signaling information. Capability that 
permits a LEA to be informed when a subject using the facilities under 
surveillance uses services that provide call identifying information, 
such as call forwarding, call waiting, call hold, and three-way calling. 
Excludes signals generated by customer premises equipment when no 
network signal is generated.
    Timing information. Capability that permits a LEA to associate call-
identifying information with the content of a call. A call-identifying 
message must be sent from the carrier's IAP to the LEA's Collection 
Function within eight seconds of receipt of that message by the IAP at 
least 95% of the time, and with the call event time-stamped to an 
accuracy of at least 200 milliseconds.


<R05>
Sec. 22.1103  Capabilities that must be provided by a cellular telecommunications carrier.

    (a) Except as provided under paragraph (b) of this section, as of 
June 30, 2000, a cellular telecommunications carrier shall provide to a 
LEA the assistance capability requirements of CALEA, see 47 U.S.C. 1002. 
A carrier may satisfy these requirements by complying with publicly 
available technical requirements or standards adopted by an industry 
association or

[[Page 222]]

standard-setting organization, such as J-STD-025.
    (b) As of September 30, 2001, a cellular telecommunications carrier 
shall provide to a LEA communications and call-identifying information 
transported by packet-mode communications and the following 
capabilities:
    (1) Content of subject-initiated conference calls;
    (2) Party hold, join, drop on conference calls;
    (3) Subject-initiated dialing and signaling information ;
    (4) In-band and out-of-band signaling;
    (5) Timing information;
    (6) Dialed digit extraction.

Sec. 23.17  Frequency measurement.

    Each station shall provide for the measurement of all frequencies 
assigned thereto, and establish a procedure for checking them regularly. 
These measurements shall be made by means independent of the frequency 
control of the transmitter and shall be of accuracy sufficient to detect 
deviation from the assigned frequency within one-half of the allowed 
tolerance. A record shall be kept of the results and dates of all 
frequency measurements.

Sec. 23.18  Authorization of power.

    (a) Authorized power. Power, when designated in the respective 
station license for a particular transmitter or transmitters, is peak 
envelope power for transmitters having full, unkeyed carrier, single 
sideband or independent sideband emissions, and mean power for 
transmitters having other emissions, unless specifically expressed 
otherwise. Designation of effective radiated power may appear in the 
station license in addition to designation of power for a transmitter or 
transmitters, when deemed necessary by the Commission.
    (b) Use of minimum power. In the interest of avoiding interference 
to other operations, all stations shall radiate only as much power as is 
necessary to ensure a satisfactory service.

<R05>
Sec. 23.20  Assignment of frequencies.

    (a) Only those frequencies which are in accordance with Sec. 2.106 
of this chapter may be authorized for use by stations in the Fixed 
Public and Fixed Public Press Services. Selection of specific 
frequencies within such bands shall be made by the applicants therefor. 
After an application has been filed with the Commission for a particular 
frequency, its availability for assignment as requested will be 
determined by a study of the probabilities of interference to and from 
existing services assigned on the same or adjacent frequencies and, if 
necessary, by coordination with other agencies utilizing frequencies in 
these ranges. The applicant will be notified of the results of such 
study and coordination. All new assignments of frequencies may be made 
subject to certain conditions as may be required to minimize the 
possibility of harmful interference to existing services.
    (b) In order to minimize possible harmful interference at the 
National Radio Astronomy Observatory site located at Green Bank, 
Pocahontas County, West Virginia, and at the Naval Radio Research 
Observatory site at Sugar Grove, Pendleton County, West Virginia, any 
applicant for a station authorization other than mobile, temporary base, 
temporary fixed, Personal Radio, Civil Air Patrol, or Amateur seeking a 
station license for a new station, a construction permit to construct a 
new station or to modify an existing station license in a manner which 
would change either the frequency, power, antenna height or directivity, 
or location of such a station within the area bounded by 39 deg.15' N. 
on the north, 78 deg.30' W. on the east, 37 deg.30' N. on the south and 
80 deg.30' W. on the west shall, at the time of filing such application 
with the Commission, simultaneously notify the Director, National Radio 
Astronomy Observatory, P. O. Box No. 2, Green Bank, West Virginia, 
24944, in writing, of the technical particulars of the proposed station. 
Such notification shall include the geographical coordinates of the 
antenna, antenna height, antenna directivity if any, proposed frequency, 
type of emission, and power. In addition, the applicant shall indicate 
in his application to the Commission the date notification was made to 
the Observatory. After receipt of such applications, the Commission will 
allow a period of twenty (20) days for comments or objections in 
response to the notifications indicated. If an objection to the proposed 
operation is received during the twenty day period from the National 
Radio Astronomy Observatory for itself or on behalf of the Naval Radio 
Research Observatory, the Commission will consider all aspects of the 
problem and take whatever action is deemed appropriate.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Protection for Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone, Boulder 
County, Colorado: Applicants for a station authorization to operate in 
the vicinity of Boulder County, Colorado under this part are advised to 
give due consideration, prior to filing applications, to the need to 
protect the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone from harmful 
interference. These are the research laboratories of the Department of 
Commerce, Boulder County, Colorado. To prevent degradation of the 
present ambient radio signal level at the site, the Department of 
Commerce seeks to ensure that the field strengths of any radiated 
signals (excluding reflected signals) received on this 728 hectare site 
(in the vicinity of coordinates 40 deg.07'50" N Latitude, 105 deg.14'40" 
W Longitude) resulting from new assignments (other than mobile stations) 
or from the modification or relocation of existing facilities do not 
exceed the following values:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Equivalent values of power flux density are calculated assuming free
  space characteristic impedance of 376.7=120<greek-p> ohms.
\2\ Space stations shall conform to the power flux density limits at the
  earth's surface specified in appropriate parts of the FCC rules, but
  in no case should exceed the above levels in any 4 kHz band for all
  angles of arrival.

    (1) Advance consultation is recommended particularly for those 
applicants who have no reliable data which indicates whether the field 
strength or

[[Page 227]]

power flux density figures in the above table would be exceeded by their 
proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In such instances, 
the following is a suggested guide for determining whether coordination 
is recommended:
    (i) All stations within 2.4 kilometers;
    (ii) Stations within 4.8 kilometers with 50 watts or more effective 
radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of polarization in the 
azimuthal direction of the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone;
    (iii) Stations within 16.1 kilometers with 1 kW or more ERP in the 
primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of Table 
Mountain Receiving Zone;
    (iv) Stations within 80.5 kilometers with 25 kW or more ERP in the 
primary plane or polarization in the azimuthal direction of Table 
Mountain Receiving Zone.
    (2) Applicants concerned are urged to communicate with the Radio 
Frequency Management Coordinator, Department of Commerce, Research 
Support Services, NOAA R/E5X2, Boulder Laboratories, Boulder, CO 80303; 
telephone (303) 497-6548, in advance of filing their applications with 
the Commission.
    (3) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised 
that such consultation can avoid objections from the Department of 
Commerce or proceedings to modify any authorization which may be granted 
which, in fact, delivers a signal at the site in excess of the field 
strength specified herein.
    (e) Protection for Federal Communications Commission monitoring 
stations:
    (1) Applicants in the vicinity of an FCC monitoring station for a 
radio station authorization to operate new transmitting facilities or 
changed transmitting facilities which would increase the field strength 
produced over the monitoring station over that previously authorized are 
advised to give consideration, prior to filing applications, to the 
possible need to protect the FCC stations from harmful interference. 
Geographical coordinates of the facilities which require protection are 
listed in Sec. 0.121(c) of the Commission's Rules. Applications for 
stations (except mobile stations) which will produce on any frequency a 
direct wave fundamental field strength of greater than 10 mV/m in the 
authorized bandwidth of service (-65.8 dBW/m<SUP>2</SUP> power flux 
density assuming a free space characteristic impedance of 120 ohms) at 
the referenced coordinates, may be examined to determine extent of 
possible interference. Depending on the theoretical field strength value 
and existing root-sum-square or other ambient radio field signal levels 
at the indicated coordinates, a clause protecting the monitoring station 
may be added to the station authorization.
    (2) In the event that calculated value of expected field exceeds 10 
mV/m (-65.8 dBW/m<SUP>2</SUP>) at the reference coordinates, or if there 
is any question whether field strength levels might exceed the threshold 
value, advance consultation with the FCC to discuss any protection 
necessary should be considered. Prospective applicants may communicate 
with: Chief, Compliance and Information Bureau, Federal Communications 
Commission, Washington, DC 20554, Telephone (202) 632-6980.
    (3) Advance consultation is suggested particularly for those 
applicants who have no reliable data which indicates whether the field 
strength or power flux density figure indicated would be exceeded by 
their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In such 
instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining whether an 
applicant should coordinate:
    (i) All stations within 2.4 kilometers (1.5 statute miles);
    (ii) Stations within 4.8 kilometers (3 statute miles) with 50 watts 
or more average effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of 
polarization in the azimuthal direction of the Monitoring Stations.
    (iii) Stations within 16 kilometers (10 statute miles) with 1 kW or 
more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of the Monitoring Station;

[[Page 228]]

    (iv) Stations within 80 kilometers (50 statute miles) with 25 kW or 
more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal 
direction of the Monitoring Station;
    (4) Advance coordination for stations operating above 1000 MHz is 
recommended only where the proposed station is in the vicinity of a 
monitoring station designated as a satellite monitoring facility in 
Sec. 0.121(c) of the Commission's Rules and also meets the criteria 
outlined in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section.
    (5) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised 
that such consultation can avoid objections from the Federal 
Communications Commission or modification of any authorization which 
will cause harmful interference.
    (f) Any applicant for a new permanent base or fixed station to be 
located on the islands of Puerto Rico, Desecheo, Mona, Vieques, and 
Culebra, or for a modification of an existing authorization which would 
change the frequency, power, antenna height, directivity, or location of 
a station on these islands and would increase the likelihood of the 
authorized facility causing interference, shall notify the Interference 
Office, Arecibo Observatory, Post Office Box 995, Arecibo, Puerto Rico 
00613, in writing or electronically, of the technical parameters of the 
proposal. Applicants may wish to consult interference guidelines, which 
will be provided by Cornell University. Applicants who choose to 
transmit information electronically should e-mail to: prcz@naic.edu
    (1) The notification to the Interference Office, Arecibo Observatory 
shall be made prior to, or simultaneously with, the filing of the 
application with the Commission. The notification shall state the 
geographical coordinates of the antenna (NAD-83 datum), antenna height 
above ground, ground elevation at the antenna, antenna directivity and 
gain, proposed frequency and FCC Rule Part, type of emission, effective 
radiated power, and whether the proposed use is itinerant. Generally, 
submission of the information in the technical portion of the FCC 
license application is adequate notification. In addition, the applicant 
shall indicate in its application to the Commission the date 
notification was made to the Arecibo Observatory.
    (2) After receipt of such applications, the Commission will allow 
the Arecibo Observatory a period of 20 days for comments or objections 
in response to the notification indicated. The applicant will be 
required to make reasonable efforts in order to resolve or mitigate any 
potential interference problem with the Arecibo Observatory and to file 
either an amendment to the application or a modification application, as 
appropriate. If the Commission determines that an applicant has 
satisfied its responsibility to make reasonable efforts to protect the 
Observatory from interference, its application may be granted.
    (3) The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to operations that 
transmit on frequencies above 15 GHz.

Sec. 23.37  Station identification.

    (a) General. Every radiotelegraph or radiotelephone station in the 
International Fixed Public or Fixed Public Press Service shall transmit, 
as provided below, the identifying call sign or other approved 
identification signal on each of its assigned frequencies below 30 MHz 
on which energy is being radiated.
    (b) When required. (1) The call sign assigned to each frequency 
shall be transmitted on that frequency at the beginning and end of each 
period of use of the frequency.
    (2) During regular operation on any freuency, the call sign or other 
approved identification signal shall be transmitted at least at hourly 
intervals within the period from 10 minutes before to 10 minutes after 
each hour. If identification during this period would require an 
interruption in the transmission of a radio-photo, a telephone 
conversation, an addressed program or a multiple addressed press 
message, or a break in the continuity of a ``conference'' or ``leased 
line'' type of service, the identifying signal shall be transmitted at 
the first break in, at the conclusion of, or simultaneously with, the 
particular transmission as described below.
    (c) Methods of transmission. (1) All identifying signals shall be 
transmitted in such a manner as to permit identification without special 
equipment other than communication type receivers, except as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section. When emissions are being used which are 
not capable of identification without special equipment, the identifying 
signal shall be transmitted by one of the following methods:
    (i) By interrupting the transmission and transmitting the call sign 
in a manner which can be identified without special equipment.
    (ii) By superimposing the call sign or other approved identification 
signal on the emission being transmitted without interrupting the 
transmission as provided for by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.
    (d) Emissions to be used. (1) Except as otherwise provided, the 
following emissions shall be used for identification:
    (i) Radiotelegraph stations. The identifying call sign shall be 
transmitted by International Morse code at a speed not to exceed 25 
words per minute and shall consist of the signal ``QRA de'' followed by 
the call sign. This transmission shall be made at least three times.
    (ii) Radiotelegraph stations using telephone type emissions. When 
telephone type emissions are being used in accordance with Sec. 23.11, 
identification may be made by voice and shall consist of announcing 
three times in English the call sign of the frequency being used

[[Page 232]]

    (iii) Radiotelephone stations. The identifying transmission may be 
made utilizing either telegraph or telephone type emissions. When 
telegraph emission is used, the transmission shall be made in 
International Morse Code at a speed not to exceed 25 words per minute 
and shall consist of the signal ``QRA de'' followed by the call sign. 
This transmission shall be made at least three times. When telephone 
emission is used, the identification shall consist of announcing three 
times in English the call sign of the frequency being used, provided 
that all privacy or secrecy devices shall be removed from the circuit 
during such transmissions.
    (e) Superimposed identification. Radiotelegraph or radiotelephone 
stations identifying simultaneously with transmission of traffic: call 
signs or the general identification signal described in paragraph (f) of 
this section may be superimposed on the emission being transmitted by 
any method which will make identification possible with communication 
type receivers provided that approval of any such method shall first 
have been obtained from the Federal Communications Commission. (Approval 
by the Federal Communications Commission of any means of identification 
of complex emissions by superimposing identification of regular 
transmissions will be given upon satisfactory completion of coordinated 
tests thereof by the applicant and the Commission's Field Engineering 
Bureau.) Commission approval may be withdrawn if at any subsequent time 
harmful interference to adjacent frequencies is caused by the 
superimposed identification. When superimposed identification by call 
sign is used, the identifying signal shall consist of ``QTT de (call 
sign)'' transmitted at least three times in International Morse Code at 
a speed not to exceed 25 words per minute.
    (f) General identification signal. When an approved method of 
superimposed identification is used, the identification signal shall 
consist of ``QTT de (abbreviated name of company recorded with the 
Commission) (abbreviated name of station recorded with the 
Commission).'' (It is suggested that ``abbreviated company name'' 
consist of two to five letters such as the initials of the company name 
and that ``abbreviated name of station'' consist of two or three letters 
indicating the name of the city where the licensee's message center is 
located. Both of these abbreviations shall be notified to the Commission 
before being used for identification.) This general identification 
signal shall be transmitted in International Morse Code at a speed not 
to exceed 25 words per minute and may be transmitted continuously or 
intermittently as desired provided that it shall be transmitted for at 
least five minutes total time during the period from 10 minutes before 
to 10 minutes after each hour that energy is being radiated on the 
frequency. The same signal may be superimposed on all transmissions 
being made at a particular station: Provided, however, That licensed 
call signs shall be transmitted on the frequencies to which they are 
assigned as often as is practicable and reasonable or at least at the 
beginning and end of each period of use of each frequency.
    (g) Identification by printer. Notwithstanding the other provisions 
of this section with respect to methods of transmission, when single 
channel start-stop 5 unit code printer equipment is being used, the 
identifying call sign may be transmitted by means of printer signals. 
When identification is made by printer signals, it shall consist of the 
call sign for the particular frequency being used and shall be made at 
least three times at a speed of approximately 60 words per minute.

Sec. 23.38  Experimental points of communication, limitations.

    Experimental (Research) or Experimental (Developmental) stations 
licensed to operate as point-to-point telegraph or telephone stations in 
the fixed public service may communicate only with other experimental 
stations located within the continental limits of the United States 
(except Alaska): Provided, however, That upon application the Commission 
may authorize such a station to communicate with one or more specific 
points in Alaska, Hawaii, possessions of the United States, or with a 
specific foreign point. In each such case, the Commission will

[[Page 233]]

determine the nature of the experimental transmissions which may be made 
to such point of communication.


<R05>
Sec. 23.39  Antenna structures.

    (a) FAA notification. Before the construction of new antenna 
structures or alteration in the height of existing antenna structures is 
authorized by the FCC, a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
determination of ``no hazard'' may be required. To apply for this 
determination, the FAA must be notified of the planned construction. 
Criteria used to determine whether FAA notification is required for a 
particular antenna structure are contained in part 17 of this chapter. 
Applications proposing construction of one or more new antenna 
structures or alteration of the overall height of one or more existing 
antenna structures, where FAA notification prior to such construction or 
alteration is not required by part 17 of this chapter, must indicate 
such and, unless the reason is obvious (e.g. structure height is less 
than 6.10 meters AGL) must contain a statement explaining why FAA 
notification is not required.
    (b) Painting and lighting. The owner of each antenna structure 
required to be painted and/or illuminated under the provisions of 
Section 303(q) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, shall 
operate and maintain the antenna structure painting and lighting in 
accordance with part 17 of this chapter. In the event of default by the 
owner, each licensee or permittee shall be individually responsible for 
conforming to the requirements pertaining to antenna structure painting 
and lighting.
    (c) Antenna Structure Registration Number. Applications proposing 
construction of one or more new antenna structures or alteration of the 
overall height of one or more existing structures, where FAA 
notification prior to such construction or alteration is required by 
part 17 of this chapter, must include the FCC Antenna Structure 
Registration Number(s) for the affected structure(s). If no such number 
has been assigned at the time the application is filed, the applicant 
must state in the application whether or not the antenna structure owner 
has notified the FAA of the proposed construction or alteration and 
applied to the FCC for an Antenna Structure Registration Number in 
accordance with part 17 of this chapter for the antenna structure in 
question.

Sec. 24.53  Calculation of height above average terrain (HAAT).

    (a) HAAT is determined by subtracting average terrain elevation from 
antenna height above mean sea level.
    (b) Average terrain elevation shall be calculated using elevation 
data from a 30 arc second or better Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). DEM 
data is available from United States Geological Survey (USGS). The data 
file shall be identified. If 30 arc second data is used, the elevation 
data must be processed for intermediate points using interpolation 
techniques; otherwise, the nearest point may be used. If DEM data is not 
available, elevation data from the Defense Mapping Agency's Digital 
Chart of the World (DCW) may be used.
    (c) Radial average terrain elevation is calculated as the average of 
the elevation along a straight line path from 3 to 16 kilometers 
extending radially from the antenna site. At least 50 evenly spaced data 
points for each radial shall be used in the computation.
    (d) Average terrain elevation is the average of the eight radial 
average terrain elevations (for the eight cardinal radials).
    (e) The position location of the antenna site shall be determined to 
an accuracy of no less than <plus-minus>5 meters in both the horizontal 
(latitude and longitude) and vertical (ground elevation) dimensions with 
respect to the National Geodetic Reference System.

Sec. 24.55  Antenna structures; air navigation safety.

    Licensees that own their antenna structures must not allow these 
antenna structures to become a hazard to air navigation. In general, 
antenna structure owners are responsible for registering antenna 
structures with the FCC if required by part 17 of this chapter, and for 
installing and maintaining any required marking and lighting. However, 
in the event of default of this responsibility by an antenna structure 
owner, each FCC permittee or licensee authorized to use an affected 
antenna structure will be held responsible by the FCC for ensuring that 
the antenna structure continues to meet the requirements of part 17 of 
this chapter. See Sec. 17.6 of this chapter.
    (a) Marking and lighting. Antenna structures must be marked, lighted 
and maintained in accordance with part 17 of this chapter and all 
applicable rules and requirements of the Federal Aviation 
Administration.
    (b) Maintenance contracts. Antenna structure owners (or licensees 
and permittees, in the event of default by an antenna structure owner) 
may enter into contracts with other entities to monitor and carry out 
necessary maintenance of antenna structures. Antenna structure owners 
(or licensees and permittees, in the event of default by an antenna 
structure owner) that

[[Page 246]]

make such contractual arrangements continue to be responsible for the 
maintenance of antenna structures in regard to air navigation safety.

Sec. 24.103  Construction requirements.

    (a) Nationwide narrowband PCS licensees shall construct base 
stations that provide coverage to a composite area of 750,000 square 
kilometers or serve 37.5 percent of the U.S. population within five 
years of initial license grant date; and, shall construct base stations 
that provide coverage to a composite area of 1,500,000 square kilometers 
or serve 75 percent of the U.S. population within ten years of initial 
license grant date. Licensees may, in the alternative, provide 
substantial service to the licensed area as provided in paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (b) Regional narrowband PCS licensees shall construct base stations 
that provide coverage to a composite area of 150,000 square kilometers 
or serve 37.5 percent of the population of the service area within five 
years of initial license grant date; and, shall construct base stations 
that provide coverage to a

[[Page 247]]

composite area of 300,000 square kilometers or serve 75 percent of the 
service area population within ten years of initial license grant date. 
Licensees may, in the alternative, provide substantial service to the 
licensed area as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (c) MTA narrowband PCS licensees shall construct base stations that 
provide coverage to a composite area of 75,000 square kilometers or 25 
percent of the geographic area, or serve 37.5 percent of the population 
of the service area within five years of initial license grant date; 
and, shall construct base stations that provide coverage to a composite 
area of 150,000 square kilometers or 50 percent of the geographic area, 
or serve 75 percent of the population of the service area within ten 
years of initial license grant date. Licensees may, in the alternative, 
provide substantial service to the licensed area as provided in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) As an alternative to the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), 
and (c) of this section, narrowband PCS licensees may demonstrate that, 
no later than ten years after the initial grant of their license, they 
provide substantial service to their licensed area. Licensees choosing 
this option must notify the FCC by filing FCC Form 601, no later than 15 
days after the end of the five year period following the initial grant 
of their license, that they plan to satisfy the alternative requirement 
to provide substantial service. ``Substantial service'' is defined as 
service that is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of 
mediocre service that would barely warrant renewal.
    (e) In demonstrating compliance with the construction requirements 
set forth in this section, licensees must base their calculations on 
signal field strengths that ensure reliable service for the technology 
utilized. Licensees may determine the population of geographic areas 
included within their service contours using either the 1990 census or 
the 2000 census, but not both.
    (1) For the purpose of this section, the service radius of a base 
station may be calculated using the following formula:

d<INF>km</INF> = 2.53  x  h<INF>m</INF>0.34  x  p<SUP>0.17</SUP>

where d<INF>km</INF> is the radial distance in kilometers,
h<INF>m</INF> is the antenna HAAT of the base station in meters, and
p is the e.r.p. of the base station in watts.

    (2) Alternatively, licensees may use any service radius contour 
formula developed or generally used by industry, provided that such 
formula is based on the technical characteristics of their system.
    (f) Upon meeting the five and ten year benchmarks in paragraphs (a), 
(b), and (c) of this section, or upon meeting the substantial service 
alternative in paragraph (d), licensees shall notify the Commission by 
filing FCC Form 601 and including a map and other supporting 
documentation that demonstrate the required geographic area coverage, 
population coverage, or substantial service to the licensed area. The 
notification must be filed with the Commission within 15 days of the 
expiration of the relevant period.
    (g) If the sale of a license is approved, the new licensee is held 
to the original build-out requirement.
    (h) Failure by a licensee to meet the above construction 
requirements shall result in forfeiture of the license and ineligibility 
to regain it.

Sec. 24.104  Partitioning and disaggregation.

    Nationwide, regional, and MTA licensees may apply to partition their 
authorized geographic service area or disaggregate their authorized 
spectrum at any time following grant of their geographic area 
authorizations.
    (a) Application required. Parties seeking approval for partitioning 
and/or disaggregation shall apply for partial assignment of a license 
pursuant to Sec. 1.948 of this chapter.
    (b) Partitioning. In the case of partitioning, applicants and 
licensees must file FCC Form 603 pursuant to Sec. 1.948 of this chapter 
and describe the partitioned service area on a schedule to the 
application. The partitioned service area shall be defined by up to 120 
sets of geographic coordinates at points at every 3 degrees azimuth from 
a point within the partitioned service area

[[Page 248]]

along the partitioned service area boundary unless either an FCC-
recognized service area is used (e.g., MEA or EA) or county lines are 
followed. The geographical coordinates must be specified in degrees, 
minutes, and seconds to the nearest second latitude and longitude, and 
must be based upon the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83). In the case 
where FCC-recognized service areas or county lines are used, applicants 
need only list the specific area(s) through use of FCC designations or 
county names that constitute the partitioned area.
    (c) Disaggregation. Spectrum may be disaggregated in any amount.
    (d) Combined partitioning and disaggregation. Licensees may apply 
for partial assignment of authorizations that propose combinations of 
partitioning and disaggregation.
    (e) License term. The license term for a partitioned license area 
and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original 
licensee's license term as provided for in Sec. 1.955 of this chapter.
    (f) Coverage requirements for partitioning. (1) Parties to a 
partitioning agreement must satisfy at least one of the following 
requirements:
    (i) The partitionee must satisfy the applicable coverage 
requirements set forth in Sec. 24.103 for the partitioned license area; 
or
    (ii) The original licensee must meet the coverage requirements set 
forth in Sec. 24.103 for the entire geographic area. In this case, the 
partitionee must meet only the requirements for renewal of its 
authorization for the partitioned license area.
    (2) Parties seeking authority to partition must submit with their 
partial assignment application a certification signed by both parties 
stating which of the options they select.
    (3) Partitionees must submit supporting documents showing compliance 
with their coverage requirements as set forth in Sec. 24.103.
    (4) Failure by any partitionee to meet its coverage requirements 
will result in automatic cancellation of the partitioned authorization 
without further Commission action.
    (g) Coverage requirements for disaggregation. (1) Parties to a 
disaggregation agreement must satisfy at least one of the following 
requirements:
    (i) Either the disaggregator or disaggregatee must satisfy the 
coverage requirements set forth in Sec. 24.103 for the entire license 
area; or
    (ii) Parties must agree to share responsibility for meeting the 
coverage requirements set forth in Sec. 24.103 for the entire license 
area.
    (2) Parties seeking authority to disaggregate must submit with their 
partial assignment application a certification signed by both parties 
stating which of the requirements they select.
    (3) Disaggregatees must submit supporting documents showing 
compliance with their coverage requirements as set forth in Sec. 24.103.
    (4) Parties that accept responsibility for meeting the coverage 
requirements and later fail to do so will be subject to automatic 
license cancellation without further Commission action.

licensee or when the affected parties have agreed to other co-channel 
separation distances.

Sec. 24.135  Frequency stability.

    (a) The frequency stability of the transmitter shall be maintained 
within <plus-minus> 0.0001 percent (<plus-minus> 1 ppm) of the center 
frequency over a temperature variation of -30 deg. Celsius to +50 deg. 
Celsius at normal supply voltage, and over a variation in the primary 
supply voltage of 85 percent to 115 percent of the rated

[[Page 251]]

supply voltage at a temperature of 20 deg. Celsius.
    (b) For battery operated equipment, the equipment tests shall be 
performed using a new battery without any further requirement to vary 
supply voltage.
    (c) It is acceptable for a transmitter to meet this frequency 
stability requirement over a narrower temperature range provided the 
transmitter ceases to function before it exceeds these frequency 
stability limits.

Sec. 24.232  Power and antenna height limits.

    (a) Base stations are limited to 1640 watts peak equivalent 
isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.) with an antenna height up to 300 
meters HAAT. See Sec. 24.53 for HAAT calculation method. Base station 
antenna heights may exceed 300 meters with a corresponding reduction in 
power; see Table 1 of this section. In no case may the peak output power 
of a base station transmitter exceed 100 watts. The service area 
boundary limit and microwave protection criteria specified in 
Sec. 24.236 and Sec. 24.237 apply.

    (b) Mobile/portable stations are limited to 2 watts e.i.r.p. peak 
power and the equipment must employ means to limit the power to the 
minimum necessary for successful communications.
    (c) Peak transmit power must be measured over any interval of 
continuous transmission using instrumentation calibrated in terms of an 
rms-equivalent voltage. The measurement results shall be properly 
adjusted for any instrument limitations, such as detector response 
times, limited resolution bandwidth capability when compared to the 
emission bandwidth, sensitivity, etc., so as to obtain a true peak 
measurement for the emission in question over the full bandwidth of the 
channel.


<R05>
Sec. 24.235  Frequency stability.

    The frequency stability shall be sufficient to ensure that the 
fundamental emission stays within the authorized frequency block.


<R05>
Sec. 24.236  Field strength limits.

    The predicted or measured median field strength at any location on 
the border of the PCS service area shall not exceed 47 dBuV/m unless the 
parties agree to a higher field strength.


<R05>
Sec. 24.237  Interference protection.

    (a) All licensees are required to coordinate their frequency usage 
with the co-channel or adjacent channel incumbent fixed microwave 
licensees in the 1850-1990 MHz band. Coordination must occur before 
initiating operations from any base station. Problems that arise during 
the coordination process are to be resolved by the parties to the 
coordination. Licensees are required to coordinate with all users 
possibly affected, as determined by Appendix I to this subpart E 
(Appendix E of the Memorandum Opinion and Order, GEN Docket No. 90-314, 
FCC 94-144; TIA Telecommunications Systems Bulletin 10-F, ``Interference 
Criteria for Microwave Systems,'' May 1994, (TSB10-F)); or an 
alternative method agreed to by the parties.
    (b) The results of the coordination process need to be reported to 
the Commission only if the parties fail to agree. Because broadband PCS 
licensees are required to protect fixed microwave licensees in the 1850-
1990 MHz band, the Commission will be involved in the coordination 
process only upon

[[Page 254]]

complaint of interference from a fixed microwave licensee. In such a 
case, the Commission will resolve the issues.
    (c) In all other respects, coordination procedures are to follow the 
requirements of Sec. 101.103(d) of this chapter to the extent that these 
requirements are not inconsistent with those specified in this part.
    (d) The licensee must perform an engineering analysis to assure that 
the proposed facilities will not cause interference to existing OFS 
stations within the coordination distance specified in Table 2 of a 
magnitude greater than that specified in the criteria set forth in 
paragraph (e) and (f) of this section, unless there is prior agreement 
with the affected OFS licensee. Interference calculations shall be based 
on the sum of the power received at the terminals of each microwave 
receiver from all of the applicant's current and proposed PCS 
operations.

determinations shall be based on the C/I criteria set forth in TIA 
Telecommunications Systems Bulletin 10-F, ``Interference Criteria for

    (f) For microwave paths longer than 25 kilometers, the interference 
protection criterion shall be such that the interfering signal will not 
produce more than 1.0 dB degradation of the practical threshold of the 
microwave receiver for analog system, or such that the interfering 
signal will not cause an increase in the bit error rate (BER) from 10E-6 
to 10E-5 for digital systems.
    (g) The development of the C/I ratios and interference criteria 
specified in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section and the methods 
employed to compute the interfering power at the microwave receivers 
shall follow generally acceptable good engineering practices. The 
procedures described for computing interfering signal levels in 
(Appendix I to this subpart E Appendix E of the Memorandum Opinion and 
Order, GEN Docket No. 90-314, FCC 94-144) shall be applied. 
Alternatively, procedures for determining interfering signal levels and 
other criteria as may be developed by the Electronics Industries 
Association (EIA), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
Engineers, Inc. (IEEE), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) 
or any other recognized authority will be acceptable to the Commission.

<R05>
Sec. 24.238  Emission limits.

    (a) On any frequency outside a licensee's frequency block, the power 
of any emission shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) by 
at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB.
    (b) Compliance with these provisions is based on the use of 
measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz or 
greater. However, in the 1 MHz bands immediately

[[Page 255]]

outside and adjacent to the frequency block a resolution bandwidth of at 
least one percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission 
of the transmitter may be employed. The emission bandwidth is defined as 
the width of the signal between two points, one below the carrier center 
frequency and one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which 
all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power.
    (c) When measuring the emission limits, the nominal carrier 
frequency shall be adjusted as close to the licensee's frequency block 
edges, both upper and lower, as the design permits.
    (d) The measurements of emission power can be expressed in peak or 
average values, provided they are expressed in the same parameters as 
the transmitter power.
    (e) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes 
harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require 
greater attenuation than specified in this section.

   Policies Governing Microwave Relocation From the 1850-1990 MHz Band


<R05>
Sec. 24.239  Cost-sharing requirements for broadband PCS.

    Frequencies in the 1850-1990 MHz band listed in Sec. 101.147(c) of 
this chapter have been allocated for use by PCS. In accordance with 
procedures specified in Secs. 101.69 through 101.81 of this chapter, PCS 
entities (both licensed and unlicensed) are required to relocate the 
existing Fixed Microwave Services (FMS) licensees in these bands if 
interference to the existing FMS operations would occur. All PCS 
entities who benefit from spectrum clearance by other PCS entities or a 
voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent, must contribute to such 
relocation costs. PCS entities may satisfy this requirement by entering 
into private cost-sharing agreements or agreeing to terms other than 
those specified in Sec. 24.243. However, PCS entities are required to 
reimburse other PCS entities or voluntarily relocating microwave 
incumbents that incur relocation costs and are not parties to the 
alternative agreement. In addition, parties to a private cost-sharing 
agreement may seek reimbursement through the clearinghouse (as discussed 
in Sec. 24.241) from PCS entities that are not parties to the agreement. 
The cost-sharing plan is in effect during all phases of microwave 
relocation specified in Sec. 101.69 of this chapter.

[62 FR 12757, Mar. 18, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 24.241  Administration of the Cost-Sharing Plan.

    The Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, under delegated authority, 
will select an entity to operate as a neutral, not-for-profit 
clearinghouse. This clearinghouse will administer the cost-sharing plan 
by, inter alia, maintaining all of the cost and payment records related 
to the relocation of each link and determining the cost-sharing 
obligation of subsequent PCS entities. The cost-sharing rules will not 
take effect until an administrator is selected.

[61 FR 29691, June 12, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 24.243  The cost-sharing formula.

    A PCS relocator who relocates an interfering microwave link, i.e. 
one that is in all or part of its market area and in all or part of its 
frequency band or a voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent, is 
entitled to pro rata reimbursement based on the following formula:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12JN96.001

    (a) RN equals the amount of reimbursement.
    (b) C equals the actual cost of relocating the link. Actual 
relocation costs include, but are not limited to, such items as: Radio 
terminal equipment (TX and/or RX--antenna, necessary feed lines, MUX/
Modems); towers and/or modifications; back-up power equipment; 
monitoring or control equipment; engineering costs (design/path survey); 
installation; systems testing; FCC filing costs; site acquisition and 
civil works; zoning costs; training; disposal of old equipment; test 
equipment (vendor required); spare equipment; project management; prior 
coordination notification under Sec. 101.103(d) of this chapter; site 
lease renegotiation;

[[Page 256]]

required antenna upgrades for interference control; power plant upgrade 
(if required); electrical grounding systems; Heating Ventilation and Air 
Conditioning (HVAC) (if required); alternate transport equipment; and 
leased facilities. C also includes voluntarily relocating microwave 
incumbent's independent third party appraisal of its compensable 
relocation costs and incumbent transaction expenses that are directly 
attributable to the relocation, subject to a cap of two percent of the 
``hard'' costs involved. C may not exceed $250,000 per link, with an 
additional $150,000 permitted if a new or modified tower is required.
    (c) N equals the number of PCS entities that would have interfered 
with the link. For the PCS relocator, N=1. For the next PCS entity that 
would have interfered with the link, N=2, and so on. In the case of a 
voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent, N=1 for the first PCS entity 
that would have interfered with the link. For the next PCS entity that 
would have interfered with the link, N=2, and so on.
    (d) Tm equals the number of months that have elapsed between the 
month the PCS relocator or voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent 
obtains reimbursement rights for the link and the month that the 
clearinghouse notifies a later-entrant of its reimbursement obligation 
for the link. A PCS relocator obtains reimbursement rights for the link 
on the date that it signs a relocation agreement with a microwave 
incumbent. A voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent obtains 
reimbursement rights for the link on the date that the incumbent 
notifies the Commission that it intends to discontinue, or has 
discontinued, the use of the link, pursuant to Sec. 101.305 of the 
Commission's rules.

<R05>
Sec. 24.245  Reimbursement under the Cost-Sharing Plan.

    (a) Registration of reimbursement rights. (1) To obtain 
reimbursement, a PCS relocator must submit documentation of the 
relocation agreement to the clearinghouse within ten business days of 
the date a relocation agreement is signed with an incumbent.
    (2) To obtain reimbursement, a voluntarily relocating microwave 
incumbent must submit documentation of the relocation of the link to the 
clearinghouse within ten business days of the date that the incumbent 
notifies the Commission that it intends to discontinue, or has 
discontinued, the use of the link, pursuant to Sec. 101.305 of the 
Commission's rules.
    (b) Documentation of expenses. Once relocation occurs, the PCS 
relocator or the voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent, must submit 
documentation itemizing the amount spent for items listed in 
Sec. 24.243(b). The voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent, must 
also submit an independent third party appraisal of its compensable 
relocation costs. The appraisal should be based on the actual cost of 
replacing the incumbent's system with comparable facilities and should 
exclude the cost of any equipment upgrades or items outside the scope of 
Sec. 24.243(b). The PCS relocator or the voluntarily relocating 
microwave incumbent, must identify the particular link associated with 
appropriate expenses (i.e., costs may not be averaged over numerous 
links). If a PCS relocator pays a microwave incumbent a monetary sum to 
relocate its own facilities, the PCS relocator must estimate the costs 
associated with relocating the incumbent by itemizing the anticipated 
cost for items listed in Sec. 24.243(b). If the sum paid to the 
incumbent cannot be accounted for, the remaining amount is not eligible 
for reimbursement. A PCS relocator may submit receipts or other 
documentation to the clearinghouse for all relocation expenses incurred 
since April 5, 1995.
    (c) Full Reimbursement. A PCS relocator who relocates a microwave 
link that is either fully outside its market area or its licensed 
frequency band may seek full reimbursement through the clearinghouse of 
compensable costs, up to the reimbursement cap as defined in 
Sec. 24.243(b). Such reimbursement will not be subject to depreciation 
under the cost-sharing formula.

[61 FR 29692, June 12, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 12757, Mar. 18, 1997;

[[Page 257]]


<R05>
Sec. 24.247  Triggering a reimbursement obligation.

    (a) Licensed PCS. The clearinghouse will apply the following test to 
determine if a PCS entity preparing to initiate operations must pay a 
PCS relocator or a voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent in 
accordance with the formula detailed in Sec. 24.243:
    (1) All or part of the relocated microwave link was initially co-
channel with the licensed PCS band(s) of the subsequent PCS entity;
    (2) A PCS relocator has paid the relocation costs of the microwave 
incumbent; and
    (3) The subsequent PCS entity is preparing to turn on a fixed base 
station at commercial power and the fixed base station is located within 
a rectangle (Proximity Threshold) described as follows:
    (i) The length of the rectangle shall be x where x is a line 
extending through both nodes of the microwave link to a distance of 48 
kilometers (30 miles) beyond each node. The width of the rectangle shall 
be y where y is a line perpendicular to x and extending for a distance 
of 24 kilometers (15 miles) on both sides of x. Thus, the rectangle is 
represented as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MR91.041

    (ii) If the application of the Proximity Threshold test indicates 
that a reimbursement obligation exists, the clearinghouse will calculate 
the reimbursement amount in accordance with the cost-sharing formula and 
notify the subsequent PCS entity of the total amount of its 
reimbursement obligation.
    (b) Unlicensed PCS. UTAM's reimbursement obligation is triggered 
either:
    (1) When a county is cleared of microwave links in the unlicensed 
allocation, and UTAM invokes a Zone 1 power cap as a result of third 
party relocation activities; or
    (2) A county is cleared of microwave links in the unlicensed 
allocation and UTAM reclassifies a Zone 2 county to Zone 1 status.

<R05>
Sec. 24.249  Payment issues.

    (a) Timing. On the day that a PCS entity files its prior 
coordination notice (PCN) in accordance with Sec. 101.103(d) of this 
chapter, it must file a copy of the PCN with the clearinghouse. The 
clearinghouse will determine if any reimbursement obligation exists and 
notify the PCS entity in writing of its repayment obligation, if any. 
When the PCS entity receives a written copy of such obligation, it must 
pay directly to the PCS relocator or the voluntarily relocating 
microwave incumbent the amount owed within thirty days, with the 
exception of those businesses that

[[Page 258]]

qualify for installment payments. A business that qualifies for an 
installment payment plan must make its first installment payment within 
thirty days of notice from the clearinghouse. UTAM's first payment will 
be due thirty days after its reimbursement obligation is triggered, as 
described in Sec. 24.247(b).
    (b) Eligibility for Installment Payments. PCS licensees that are 
allowed to pay for their licenses in installments under our designated 
entity rules will have identical payment options available to them with 
respect to payments under the cost-sharing plan. The specific terms of 
the installment payment mechanism, including the treatment of principal 
and interest, are the same as those applicable to the licensee's 
installment auction payments. If, for any reason, the entity eligible 
for installment payments is no longer eligible for such installment 
payments on its license, that entity is no longer eligible for 
installment payments under the cost-sharing plan. UTAM may make 
quarterly payments over a five-year period with an interest rate of 
prime plus 2.5 percent. UTAM may also negotiate separate repayment 
arrangements with other parties.

<R05>
Sec. 24.251  Dispute resolution under the Cost-Sharing Plan.

    Disputes arising out of the cost-sharing plan, such as disputes over 
the amount of reimbursement required, must be brought, in the first 
instance, to the clearinghouse for resolution. To the extent that 
disputes cannot be resolved by the clearinghouse, parties are encouraged 
to use expedited ADR procedures, such as binding arbitration, mediation, 
or other ADR techniques.

[61 FR 29693, June 12, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 24.253  Termination of cost-sharing obligations.

    The cost-sharing plan will sunset for all PCS entities on April 4, 
2005, which is ten years after the date that voluntary negotiations 
commenced for A and B block PCS entities. Those PCS entities that are 
paying their portion of relocation costs on an installment basis must 
continue the payments until the obligation is satisfied.

 Appendix I to Subpart E--A Procedure for Calculating PCS Signal Levels 
 at Microwave Receivers (Appendix E of the Memorandum Opinion and Order)

    The new Rules adopted in Part 24 stipulate that estimates of 
interference to fixed microwave operations from a PCS operation will be 
based on the sum of signals received at a microwave receiver from the 
PCS operation. This appendix describes a procedure for computing this 
PCS level.
    In general, the procedure involves four steps:
    1. Determine the geographical coordinates of all microwave receivers 
operating on co-channel and adjacent frequencies within the coordination 
distance of each base station and the characteristics of each receiver, 
i.e., adjacent channel susceptibility, antenna gain, pattern and height, 
and line and other losses.
    2. Determine an equivalent isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.) 
for each base station and equivalent e.i.r.p. values for the mobiles and 
portables associated with each base station. Determine the values of 
pertinent correction and weighting factors based on building heights and 
density and distribution of portables. Close-in situations, prominent 
hills, and extra tall buildings require special treatment.
    3. Based on PCS e.i.r.p. values, correction and weighting factors, 
and microwave receiving system characteristics determined above, 
calculate the total interference power at the input of each microwave 
receiver, using the Longley-Rice propagation model.
    4. Based on the interference power level computed in step 3, 
determine interference to each microwave receiver using criteria 
described in Part 24 and EIA/TIA Bulletin 10-F.
    The interference from each base station and the mobiles and 
portables associated with it is calculated as follows:

P<INF>rbi</INF>=10Log 
(p<INF>tbi</INF>)-L<INF>bi</INF>-UC<INF>i</INF>+G<INF>mwi</INF>-C<INF>i</INF>
-BP<INF>i</INF>
P<INF>rmi</INF>=10Log 
          (n<INF>mi</INF> x p<INF>tmi</INF>)-L<INF>mi</INF>-UC<INF>i</INF>
          +G<INF>mwi</INF>-C<INF>i</INF>
P<INF>rpsi</INF>=10Log 
          (n<INF>psi</INF> x p<INF>tpsi</INF>)-L<INF>psi</INF>-UC<INF>i</INF>
          +G<INF>mwi</INF>-C<INF>i</INF>
P<INF>rpbi</INF>=10Log 
          (n<INF>pbi</INF> x p<INF>tpbi</INF>)-L<INF>pbi</INF>-UC<INF>i</INF>
          -(BP<INF>i</INF>-BH<INF>i</INF>) 
          +G<INF>mwi</INF>-C<INF>i</INF>
P<INF>rpri</INF>=10Log 
          (n<INF>pri</INF> x p<INF>tpri</INF>)-L<INF>pri</INF>-(UC<INF>i</INF>
          -BH<INF>i</INF>)+G<INF>mwi</INF>-C<INF>i</INF>

where:
P refers to Power in dBm
p refers to power in milliwatts
P<INF>rbi</INF>=Power at MW receiver from ith base station in dBm
p<INF>tbi</INF>=e.i.r.p. transmitted from ith base station in 
          milliwatts, which equals average power per channel x number of 
          channels

          x antenna gain with respect to an isotropic antenna--line loss
L<INF>bi</INF>=Path loss between MW and base station site in dB
UC<INF>i</INF>=Urban correction factor in dB
G<INF>mwi</INF>=Gain of MW antenna in pertinent direction (dBi)
C<INF>i</INF>=Channel discrimination of MW system in dB
P<INF>rmi</INF>=Power at MW receiver from mobiles associated with ith 
          base station
p<INF>tmi</INF>=e.i.r.p. transmitted from mobiles associated with ith 
          base station
n<INF>mi</INF>=Number of mobiles associated with ith base station
L<INF>mi</INF>=Path loss between MW and mobile transmitters in dB
P<INF>rpsi</INF>=Power at MW receiver from outdoor portables (s for 
          sidewalk)
p<INF>tpsi</INF>=e.i.r.p. transmitted from outdoor portables associated 
          with ith base station
n<INF>psi</INF>=Number of outdoor portables associated with ith base 
          station
L<INF>psi</INF>=Path loss between MW and outdoor portables in dB
P<INF>rpbi</INF>=Power at MW receiver from indoor portables (b for 
          building)
p<INF>tpbi</INF>=e.i.r.p. transmitted from indoor portables associated 
          with ith base station
n<INF>pbi</INF>=number of indoor portables associated with ith base 
          station
L<INF>pbi</INF>=Path loss in dB between MW and base station site (using 
          average building height divided by 2 as effective antenna 
          height)
P<INF>rpri</INF>=Power at MW receiver from rooftop portables (r for 
          rooftop)
p<INF>tpri</INF>=e.i.r.p. transmitted from rooftop portables associated 
          with ith base station
n<INF>pri</INF>=Number of rooftop portables associated with ith base 
          station
L<INF>pri</INF>=Path loss in dB between MW and base station site (using 
          average building height as effective antenna height)
BP<INF>i</INF>=Building penetration loss at street level in dB
BH<INF>i</INF>=Height gain for portables in buildings dB=2.5 x (nf-1), 
          where nf is number of floors

    Note: where C<INF>i</INF> varies from channel-to-channel, which 
often is the case, the summation process is more complex, requiring 
summation at a channel level first.

    Finally, the total PCS interference power at a given microwave 
receiver from all the base stations in a given frequency band is found 
by summing the contributions from the individual stations. Likewise, the 
total interference power at a given microwave receiver from all mobiles 
and portables operating in a given frequency band is found by summing 
the contributions from the mobiles and portables associated with each 
cell.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR24JN94.017


    Base Stations. Interference from each base station to each microwave 
should normally be considered independently. A group of base stations 
having more or less (within <plus-minus> 50 percent) the same height 
above average terrain, the same e.i.r.p., basically the same path to a 
microwave receiving site, and subtending an angle to that receiving site 
of less than 5 degrees, may be treated as a group, using the total power 
of the group and the average antenna height of the group to calculate 
path loss, L.
    Mobile Stations. The e.i.r.p. from mobile transmitters is weighted 
according to the number of base station channels expected to be devoted 
to mobile operation at any given time. The antenna height of mobiles 
used in calculating path loss, L, is assumed to be 2 meters.
    Portable Stations. The e.i.r.p. from the portable units associated 
with each base station is weighted according to the estimated portion of 
portables associated with that cell expected to be operated inside 
buildings at any given time and the portion which could be expected to 
be operating from elevated locations, such as balconies or building 
rooftops. For example, in the case of service intended for business use 
in an urban area, one might expect that perhaps 85 percent of the 
portables in use at any given time would be operating from within 
buildings and perhaps 5 percent might be operating from rooftops or 
balconies. The remaining 10 percent would be outside at street level.

[[Page 260]]

    Calculation of an equivalent e.i.r.p. for cells in suburban areas 
will involve different weighting criteria.
    Urban Correction Factor. The urban correction factor (UC) depends on 
the height and density of buildings surrounding a base station. For the 
core area of large cities, it is assumed to be 35 dB. For medium size 
cities and fringe areas of large cities (4- to 6-story buildings with 
scattered taller buildings and lower buildings and open spaces) it is 
assumed to be 25 dB; for small cities and towns, 15 dB, and for suburban 
residential areas (one- and two-story, single family houses with 
scattered multiple-story apartment buildings, shopping centers and open 
areas), 10 dB.
    The unadjusted urban correction factor, UC, should not be applied to 
base station antenna heights that are greater than 50 percent of the 
average building height for a cell.
    Building Height and Building Penetration Factors. The building 
height correction, BH, is a function of the average building height 
within the nominal coverage area of the base station. It is used in 
conjunction with the building penetration loss, BP, to adjust the 
expected interference contribution from that portion of the portables 
transmitting from within buildings. The adjustment is given by:

BP=20 dB in urban areas
BP=10 dB in suburban areas
BH=2.5 x (nf-1) dB

where nf is the average height (number of floors) of the buildings in 
the area.
    (Note that this formula implies a net gain when the average building 
height is greater than 8 floors). All buildings more than twice the 
average height should be considered individually. The contribution to BH 
from that portion of portables in the building above the average 
building height should be increased by a factor of 20Log(h) dB, where h 
is the height of the portables above the average building height in 
meters.
    Channel Discrimination Factor. A factor based on the interference 
selectivity of the microwave receiver.
    Propagation Model. The PCS to microwave path loss, L, is calculated 
using the Longley-Rice propagation model, Version 1.2.2., in the point-
to-point mode. The Longley-Rice [1] model was derived from NBS Technical 
Note 101 [2], and updated in 1982 by Hufford [3]. Version 1.2.2 
incorporated modifications described in a letter by Hufford [4] in 1985. 
Terrain elevations used as input to the model should be from the U.S. 
Geological Survey 3-second digitized terrain database.
    Special Situations. If a cell size is large compared to the distance 
between the cell and a microwave receiving site so that it subtends an 
angle greater than 5 degrees, the cell should be subdivided and 
calculations should be based on the expected distribution of mobiles and 
portables within each subdivision.
    If terrain elevations within a cell differ by more than a factor of 
two-to-one, the cell should be subdivided and microwave interference 
calculations should be based on the average terrain elevation for each 
subdivision.
    If a co-channel PCS base station lies within the main beam of a 
microwave antenna (<plus-minus>5 degrees), there is no intervening 
terrain obstructions, and the power at the microwave receiver from that 
base station, assuming free space propagation, would be 3 dB or less 
below the interference threshold, interference will be assumed to exist 
unless the PCS licensee can demonstrate otherwise by specific path loss 
calculations based on terrain and building losses.
    If any part of a cell or cell subdivision lies within the main beam 
of a co-channel microwave antenna, there is no intervening terrain 
obstructions, and the accumulative power of 5 percent or less of the 
mobiles, assuming free space propagation would be 3 dB or less below the 
interference threshold, interference will be assumed to exist unless the 
PCS licensee can demonstrate otherwise by specific path loss 
calculations based on terrain and building losses.
    If a building within a cell or cell subdivision lies within the main 
beam of a co-channel microwave antenna, there is no intervening terrain 
obstructions, and the cumulative power of 5 percent or fewer of the 
portables, assuming free space propagation, would be 3 dB or less below 
the interference threshold, interference will be assumed to exist unless 
the PCS licensee can demonstrate otherwise by specific path loss 
calculations based on terrain and building losses.

<R05>
Sec. 24.321  Designated entities.

    (a) Eligibility for small business provisions. (1) A small business 
is an entity that, together with its controlling interests and 
affiliates, has average gross revenues not exceeding $40 million for the 
preceding three years.
    (2) A very small business is an entity that, together with its 
controlling interests and affiliates, has average gross revenues not 
exceeding $15 million for the preceding three years.
    (3) For purposes of determining whether an entity meets either of 
the definitions set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this 
section, the gross revenues of the entity, its controlling interests and 
affiliates shall be considered on a cumulative basis and aggregated. An 
applicant seeking status as a small business or very small business 
under this section must disclose on its short- and long-form 
applications, separately and in the aggregate, the gross revenues of the 
applicant (or licensee), its controlling interests and affiliates for 
each of the previous three years.
    (4) Persons or entities that hold interests in an applicant (or 
licensee) that are affiliates of each other or have an identity of 
interests identified in Sec. 1.2110(b)(4)(iii) of this chapter will be 
treated as though they were one person or entity and their ownership 
interests aggregated for purposes of determining an applicant's (or 
licensee's) compliance with the requirements of this section.
    (5) Where an applicant (or licensee) cannot identify controlling 
interests under the standards set forth in this section, the gross 
revenues of all interest holders in the applicant, and their affiliates, 
will be attributable.
    (6) A consortium of small businesses (or a consortium of very small 
businesses) is a conglomerate organization formed as a joint venture 
between or among mutually independent business firms, each of which 
individually satisfies the definition in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section (or each of which individually satisfies the definition in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section). Where an applicant or licensee is a 
consortium of small businesses (or very small businesses), the gross 
revenues of each small business (or very small business) shall not be 
aggregated.
    (7) Designated entities must describe on their long-form 
applications how they satisfy the requirements for eligibility for 
designated entity status, and must list and summarize on their long-form 
applications all agreements that affect designated entity status such as 
partnership agreements, shareholder agreements, management agreements 
and other agreements, including oral agreements, establishing, as 
applicable, de facto or de jure control of the entity. Such information 
must be maintained at the licensee's facilities or by its designated 
agent for the term of the license in order to enable the Commission to 
audit designated entity eligibility on an ongoing basis.
    (b) Controlling interest. (1) For purposes of this section, a 
controlling interest includes individuals or entities with either de 
jure or de facto control of the applicant. De jure control is evidenced 
by holdings of greater than 50 percent of the voting stock of a 
corporation, or in the case of a partnership, general partnership 
interests. De facto control is determined on a case-by-case basis. An 
entity must disclose its equity interest and demonstrate at least the 
following indicia of control to establish that it retains de facto 
control of the applicant:
    (i) The entity constitutes or appoints more than 50 percent of the 
board of directors or management committee;
    (ii) The entity has authority to appoint, promote, demote, and fire 
senior

[[Page 262]]

executives that control the day-to-day activities of the licensee; and
    (iii) The entity plays an integral role in management decisions.
    (2) The following rules apply for the calculation of certain 
interests.
    (i) Ownership interests shall be calculated on a fully diluted 
basis; all agreements such as warrants, stock options, and convertible 
debentures will generally be treated as if the rights thereunder already 
have been fully exercised.
    (ii) Partnership and other ownership interests and any stock 
interest equity, or outstanding stock, or outstanding voting stock shall 
be attributed as specified in this paragraph (b).
    (iii) Stock interests held in trust shall be attributed to any 
person who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, to any person 
who has the sole power to sell such stock, and to any person who has the 
right to revoke the trust at will or to replace the trustee at will. If 
the trustee has a familial, personal, or extra-trust business 
relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary, the stock interests held 
in trust will be attributed to the grantor or beneficiary, as 
appropriate.
    (iv) Non-voting stock shall be attributed as an interest in the 
issuing entity.
    (v) Limited partnership interests shall be attributed to limited 
partners and shall be calculated according to both the percentage of 
equity paid in and the percentage of distribution of profits and losses.
    (vi) Officers and directors of an entity shall be considered to have 
a controlling interest in the entity. The officers and directors of an 
entity that controls a licensee or applicant shall be considered to have 
a controlling interest in the licensee or applicant.
    (vii) Ownership interests that are held indirectly by any party 
through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by 
successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in 
the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution 
benchmark to the resulting product, except that if the ownership 
percentage for an interest in any link in the chain exceeds 50 percent 
or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were a 100 
percent interest.
    (viii) Any person who manages the operations of an applicant or 
licensee pursuant to a management agreement shall be considered to have 
a controlling interest in such applicant or licensee if such person, or

    (a) The Commission will consider applications to be mutually 
exclusive if their conflicts are such that the grant of one application

apply unless otherwise provided in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 24.702  Competitive bidding design for Broadband PCS licensing.

    (a) The Commission will employ the following competitive bidding 
designs when choosing from among mutually exclusive initial applications

[[Page 265]]

bidding design to be employed in a particular auction.
    (c) The Commission may use combinatorial bidding, which would allow 
bidders to submit all or nothing bids on combinations of licenses, in 
addition to bids on individual licenses. The Commission may require that 
to be declared the high bid, a combinatorial bid must exceed the sum of 
the individual bids by a specified amount or percentage. Combinatorial 
bidding may be used with any type of auction design.
    (d) The Commission may use single combined auctions, which combine 
bidding for two or more substitutable licenses and award licenses to the 
highest bidders until the available licenses are exhausted. This 
technique may be used in conjunction with any type of auction.

the rights thereunder already have been fully exercised, except that 
such agreements may not be used to appear to terminate or divest

ABC Corp. and have an identity of interest. If A & B invest in DE Corp., 
a broadband PCS applicant for block C, A and B's separate interests in 
DE Corp. must be aggregated because A and B are to be treated as one 
person.
    Example 2 for paragraph (b)(8). ABC Corp. has subsidiary BC Corp., 
of which it holds a controlling 51 percent of the stock. If ABC Corp. 
and BC Corp., both invest in DE Corp., their separate interests in DE 
Corp. must be aggregated because ABC Corp. and BC Corp. are affiliates 
of each other.

    (9) Special rule for licensees disaggregating or returning certain 
spectrum in frequency block C.
    (i) In addition to entities qualifying for closed bidding under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, any entity that was eligible for and

closed bidding in any reauction of frequency block C spectrum that 
begins within two years of March 23, 1999.

of entities, where each of the entities is eligible to bid for C block 
licenses offered in closed bidding in any reauction of C block spectrum 
on the basis of the eligibility exception set forth in paragraph 
(b)(9)(i) of this section, the resulting entity will also be eligible 
for the exception specified in paragraph (b)(9)(i).
    (iii) In cases of merger, acquisition, or other business combination 
of entities, where one or more of the entities are ineligible for the 
exception set forth in paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section, the 
resulting entity will not be eligible pursuant to paragraph (b)(9)(i) 
unless an eligible entity possesses de jure and de facto control over 
the resulting entity.
    (iv) The following restrictions will apply for any reauction of 
frequency block C spectrum conducted after March 24, 1998:
    (A) Applicants that elected to disaggregate and surrender to the 
Commission 15 MHz of spectrum from any

[[Page 269]]

will not be eligible to apply for the licenses that they surrendered to 
the Commission until 2 years from the start of the reauction of those 
licenses if they elected to apply a credit of 70% of the down payment 
they made on those licenses toward the prepayment of licenses they did 
not surrender.

Sec. 24.713  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 24.714   Partitioned licenses and disaggregated spectrum.

    (a) Eligibility. (1) Parties seeking approval for partitioning and 
disaggregation shall request an authorization for partial assignment of 
a license pursuant to Sec. 24.839.
    (2) Broadband PCS licensees in spectrum blocks A, B, D, and E and 
broadband PCS C and F block licenses not subject to the eligibility 
requirements of Sec. 24.709 may apply to partition their licensed 
geographic service area or disaggregate their licensed spectrum at any 
time following the grant of their licenses.
    (3) Broadband PCS licensees that acquired C or F block licenses in 
closed bidding subject to the eligibility requirements of Sec. 24.709 
may partition their licensed geographic service area or disaggregate 
their licensed spectrum at any time to an entity that meets the 
eligibility criteria set forth in Sec. 24.709 at the time the request 
for partial assignment of license is filed or to an entity that holds 
license(s) for frequency blocks C and F that met the eligibility 
criteria set forth in Sec. 24.709 at the time of receipt of such 
license(s). Partial assignment applications seeking partitioning or 
disaggregation of broadband PCS licenses in spectrum blocks C and F must 
include an attachment demonstrating compliance with this section.
    (b) Technical standards--(1) Partitioning. In the case of 
partitioning, applicants and licensees must file FCC Form 603 pursuant 
to Sec. 1.948 of this chapter and list the partitioned service area on a 
schedule to the application. The geographic coordinates must be 
specified in degrees, minutes, and seconds to the nearest second of 
latitude and longitude and must be based upon the 1983 North American 
Datum (NAD83).
    (2) Disaggregation. Spectrum may be disaggregated in any amount.
    (3) Combined partitioning and disaggregation. The Commission will 
consider requests for partial assignment of licenses that propose 
combinations of partitioning and disaggregation.
    (c) Unjust enrichment--(1) Installment payments. Licensees in 
frequency Blocks C and F making installment payments that partition 
their licenses or disaggregate their spectrum to entities not meeting 
the eligibility standards for installment payments, will be subject to 
the provisions concerning unjust enrichment as set forth in Secs. 1.2111 
of this chapter and 24.716(d).
    (2) Bidding credits. Licensees in frequency Blocks C and F that 
received a bidding credit and partition their licenses or disaggregate 
their spectrum to entities not meeting the eligibility standards for 
such a bidding credit, will be subject to the provisions concerning 
unjust enrichment as set forth in Secs. 1.2110(f) of this chapter and 
24.717(c).
    (3) Apportioning unjust enrichment payments. Unjust enrichment 
payments for partitioned license areas shall be calculated based upon 
the ratio of the population of the partitioned license area to the 
overall population of the license area and by utilizing the most recent 
census data. Unjust enrichment payments for disaggregated spectrum shall 
be calculated based upon the ratio of the amount of spectrum

[[Page 274]]

disaggregated to the amount of spectrum held by the licensee.
    (d) Installment payments--(1) Apportioning the balance on 
installment payment plans. When a winning bidder elects to pay for its 
license through an installment payment plan pursuant to Secs. 1.2110(e) 
of this chapter or 24.716, and partitions its licensed area or 
disaggregates spectrum to another party, the outstanding balance owed by 
the licensee on its installment payment plan (including accrued and 
unpaid interest) shall be apportioned between the licensee and 
partitionee or disaggregatee. Both parties will be responsible for 
paying their proportionate share of the outstanding balance to the U.S. 
Treasury. In the case of partitioning, the balance shall be apportioned 
based upon the ratio of the population of the partitioned area to the 
population of the entire original license area calculated based upon the 
most recent census data. In the case of disaggregation, the balance 
shall be apportioned based upon the ratio of the amount of spectrum 
disaggregated to the amount of spectrum allocated to the licensed area.
    (2) Parties not qualified for installment payment plans. (i) When a 
winning bidder elects to pay for its license through an installment 
payment plan, and partitions its license or disaggregates spectrum to 
another party that would not qualify for an installment payment plan or 
elects not to pay for its share of the license through installment 
payments, the outstanding balance owed by the licensee (including 
accrued and unpaid interest) shall be apportioned according to 
Sec. 24.714(d)(1).
    (ii) The partitionee or disaggregatee shall, as a condition of the 
approval of the partial assignment application, pay its entire pro rata 
amount within 30 days of Public Notice conditionally granting the 
partial assignment application. Failure to meet this condition will 
result in a rescission of the grant of the partial assignment 
application.
    (iii) The licensee shall be permitted to continue to pay its pro 
rata share of the outstanding balance and shall receive new financing 
documents (promissory note, security agreement) with a revised payment 
obligation, based on the remaining amount of time on the original 
installment payment schedule. These financing documents will replace the 
licensee's existing financing documents which shall be marked 
``superseded'' and returned to the licensee upon receipt of the new 
financing documents. The original interest rate, established pursuant to 
Sec. 1.2110(e)(3)(i) of this chapter at the time of the grant of the 
initial license in the market, shall continue to be applied to the 
licensee's portion of the remaining government obligation. We will 
require, as a further condition to approval of the partial assignment 
application, that the licensee execute and return to the U.S. Treasury 
the new financing documents within 30 days of the Public Notice 
conditionally granting the partial assignment application. Failure to 
meet this condition will result in the automatic cancellation of the 
grant of the partial assignment application.
    (iv) A default on the licensee's payment obligation will only affect 
the licensee's portion of the market.
    (3) Parties qualified for installment payment plans. (i) Where both 
parties to a partitioning or disaggregation agreement qualify for 
installment payments, the partitionee or disaggregatee will be permitted 
to make installment payments on its portion of the remaining government 
obligation, as calculated according to Sec. 24.714(d)(1).
    (ii) Each party will be required, as a condition to approval of the 
partial assignment application, to execute separate financing documents 
(promissory note, security agreement) agreeing to pay their pro rata 
portion of the balance due (including accrued and unpaid interest) based 
upon the installment payment terms for which they qualify under the 
rules. The financing documents must be returned to the U.S. Treasury 
within thirty (30) days of the Public Notice conditionally granting the 
partial assignment application. Failure by either party to meet this 
condition will result in the automatic cancellation of the grant of the 
partial assignment application. The interest rate, established pursuant 
to Sec. 1.2110(e)(3)(i) of this chapter at the time of the grant of the 
initial license in the market, shall continue to be applied to both 
parties' portion of the balance due. Each party will receive a

[[Page 275]]

license for their portion of the partitioned market or disaggregated 
spectrum.
    (iii) A default on an obligation will only affect that portion of 
the market area held by the defaulting party.
    (iv) Partitionees and disaggregatees that qualify for installment 
payment plans may elect to pay some of their pro rata portion of the 
balance due in a lump sum payment to the U.S. Treasury and to pay the 
remaining portion of the balance due pursuant to an installment payment 
plan.
    (e) License term. The license term for a partitioned license area 
and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original 
licensee's license term as provided for in Sec. 24.15.
    (f) Construction requirements--(1) Requirements for partitioning. 
Parties seeking authority to partition must meet one of the following 
construction requirements:
    (i) The partitionee may certify that it will satisfy the applicable 
construction requirements set forth in Sec. 24.203 for the partitioned 
license area; or
    (ii) The original licensee may certify that it has or will meet its 
five-year construction requirement and will meet the ten-year 
construction requirement, as set forth in Sec. 24.203, for the entire 
license area. In that case, the partitionee must only satisfy the 
requirements for ``substantial service,'' as set forth in Sec. 24.16(a), 
for the partitioned license area by the end of the original ten-year 
license term of the licensee.
    (iii) Applications requesting partial assignments of license for 
partitioning must include a certification by each party as to which of 
the above construction options they select.
    (iv) Partitionees must submit supporting documents showing 
compliance with the respective construction requirements within the 
appropriate five- and ten-year construction benchmarks set forth in 
Sec. 24.203.
    (v) Failure by any partitionee to meet its respective construction 
requirements will result in the automatic cancellation of the 
partitioned or disaggregated license without further Commission action.
    (2) Requirements for disaggregation. Parties seeking authority to 
disaggregate must submit with their partial assignment application a 
certification signed by both parties stating which of the parties will 
be responsible for meeting the five- and ten-year construction 
requirements for the PCS market as set forth in Sec. 24.203. Parties may 
agree to share responsibility for meeting the construction requirements. 
Parties that accept responsibility for meeting the construction 
requirements and later fail to do so will be subject to license 
forfeiture without further Commission action.

    (3) Broadband PCS licensees in spectrum blocks C and F may not 
partition their licensed geographic service area or disaggregate their 
licensed spectrum for the first five years of the license term unless it 
is to an entity that meets the eligibility criteria set forth in 
Sec. 24.709 at the time the request for partial assignment of license is 
filed or to an entity that holds license(s) for frequency blocks C and F 
that met the eligibility criteria set forth in Sec. 24.709 at the time 
of receipt of such license(s). Partial assignment applications seeking 
partitioning or disaggregation of broadband PCS licenses in spectrum 
blocks C and F must include an attachment demonstrating compliance with 
this section.

million for the preceding three years.
    (3) For purposes of determining whether an entity meets the $40 
million average annual gross revenues size standard set forth in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section or the $15 million average annual gross 
revenues size standard set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
the gross revenues of the entity, its affiliates, persons or entities

    (e) Rural Telephone Company. A rural telephone company is a local 
exchange carrier operating entity to the extent that such entity:
    (1) Provides common carrier service to any local exchange carrier 
study area that does not include either;
    (i) Any incorporated place of 10,000 inhabitants or more, or any 
part thereof, based on the most recently available population statistics 
of the Bureau of the Census; or
    (ii) Any territory, incorporated or unincorporated, included in an

    (f) Gross Revenues. Gross revenues shall mean all income received by 
an entity, whether earned or passive, before any deductions are made for 
costs of doing business (e.g., cost of goods sold), as evidenced by 
audited financial statements for the relevant number of most recently 
completed calendar years, or, if audited financial statements were not 
prepared on a calendar-year basis, for the most recently completed 
fiscal years preceding the filing of the applicant's short-form 
application (Form 175). If an entity was not in existence for all or 
part of the relevant period, gross revenues shall be evidenced by the 
audited financial statements of the entity's predecessor-in-interest or, 
if there is no identifiable predecessor-in-interest, unaudited financial 
statements certified by the applicant as accurate. When an applicant 
does not otherwise use audited financial statements, its gross revenues 
may be certified by its chief financial officer or its equivalent.
    (g) Total Assets. Total assets shall mean the book value (except 
where

[[Page 278]]

generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require market 
valuation) of all property owned by an entity, whether real or personal, 
tangible or intangible, as evidenced by the most recent audited 
financial statements or certified by the applicant's chief financial 
officer or its equivalent if the applicant does not otherwise use 
audited financial statements.
    (h) Institutional Investor. An institutional investor is an 
insurance company, a bank holding stock in trust accounts through its 
trust department, or an investment company as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80a-
3(a), including within such definition any entity that would otherwise 
meet the definition of investment company under 15 U.S.C. 80a-3(a) but 
is excluded by the exemptions set forth in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3 (b) and (c), 
without regard to whether such entity is an issuer of securities; 
provided that, if such investment company is owned, in whole or in part, 
by other entities, such investment company, such other entities and the 
affiliates of such other entities, taken as a whole, must be primarily 
engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in 
securities or in distributing or providing investment management 
services for securities.
    (i) Members of Minority Groups. Members of minority groups include 
individuals of African American, Hispanic-surnamed, American Eskimo, 
Aleut, American Indian, and Asian American extraction.
    (j) Nonattributable Equity. (1) Nonattributable equity shall mean:
    (i) For corporations, voting stock or non-voting stock that includes 
no more than twenty-five percent of the total voting equity, including 
the right to vote such stock through a voting trust or other 
arrangement;
    (ii) For partnerships, joint ventures and other non-corporate 
entities, limited partnership interests and similar interests that do 
not afford the power to exercise control of the entity.
    (2) For purposes of assessing compliance with the equity limits in 
Sec. 24.709 (b)(3)(i) and (b)(4)(i), where such interests are not held 
directly in the applicant, the total equity held by a person or entity 
shall be determined by successive multiplication of the ownership 
percentages for each link in the vertical ownership chain.
    (k) Control Group. A control group is an entity, or a group of 
individuals or entities, that possesses de jure control and de facto 
control of an applicant or licensee, and as to which the applicant's or 
licensee's charters, bylaws, agreements and any other relevant documents 
(and amendments thereto) provide:
    (1) That the entity and/or its members own unconditionally at least 
50.1 percent of the total voting interests of a corporation;
    (2) That the entity and/or its members receive at least 50.1 percent 
of the annual distribution or any dividends paid on the voting stock of 
a corporation;
    (3) That, in the event of dissolution or liquidation of a 
corporation, the entity and/or or its members are entitled to receive 
100 percent of the value of each share of stock in its possession and a 
percentage of the retained earnings of the concern that is equivalent to 
the amount of equity held in the corporation; and
    (4) That, for other types of businesses, the entity and/or its 
members have the right to receive dividends, profits and regular and 
liquidating distributions from the business in proportion to the amount 
of equity held in the business.

    Note to paragraph (k):
    Voting control does not always assure de facto control, such as for 
example, when the voting stock of the control group is widely dispersed 
(see e.g., Sec. 24.720(1)(2)(iii).

    (l) Affiliate. (1) Basis for Affiliation. An individual or entity is 
an affiliate of an applicant or of a person holding an attributable 
interest in an applicant (both referred to herein as ``the applicant'') 
if such individual or entity:
    (i) Directly or indirectly controls or has the power to control the 
applicant, or
    (ii) Is directly or indirectly controlled by the applicant, or
    (iii) Is directly or indirectly controlled by a third party or 
parties that also controls or has the power to control the applicant, or
    (iv) Has an ``identity of interest'' with the applicant.

[[Page 279]]

    (2) Nature of control in determining affiliation.
    (i) Every business concern is considered to have one or more parties 
who directly or indirectly control or have the power to control it. 
Control may be affirmative or negative and it is immaterial whether it 
is exercised so long as the power to control exists.

    Example for paragraph (l)(2)(i). An applicant owning 50 percent of 
the voting stock of another concern would have negative power to control 
such concern since such party can block any action of the other 
stockholders. Also, the bylaws of a corporation may permit a stockholder 
with less than 50 percent of the voting to block any actions taken by 
the other stockholders in the other entity. Affiliation exists when the 
applicant has the power to control a concern while at the same time 
another person, or persons, are in control of the concern at the will of 
the party or parties with the power of control.

    (ii) Control can arise through stock ownership; occupancy of 
director, officer or key employee positions; contractual or other 
business relations; or combinations of these and other factors. A key 
employee is an employee who, because of his/her position in the concern, 
has a critical influence in or substantive control over the operations 
or management of the concern.
    (iii) Control can arise through management positions where a 
concern's voting stock is so widely distributed that no effective 
control can be established.

    Example for paragraph (l)(2)(iii). In a corporation where the 
officers and directors own various size blocks of stock totaling 40 
percent of the corporation's voting stock, but no officer or director 
has a block sufficient to give him or her control or the power to 
control and the remaining 60 percent is widely distributed with no 
individual stockholder having a stock interest greater than 10 percent, 
management has the power to control. If persons with such management 
control of the other entity are persons with attributable interests in 
the applicant, the other entity will be deemed an affiliate of the 
applicant.

    (3) Identity of interest between and among persons. Affiliation can 
arise between or among two or more persons with an identity of interest, 
such as members of the same family or persons with common investments. 
In determining if the applicant controls or is controlled by a concern, 
persons with an identity of interest will be treated as though they were 
one person.

    Example 1. Two shareholders in Corporation Y each have attributable 
interests in the same PCS application. While neither shareholder has 
enough shares to individually control Corporation Y, together they have 
the power to control Corporation Y. The two shareholders with these 
common investments (or identity of interest) are treated as though they 
are one person and Corporation Y would be deemed an affiliate of the 
applicant.
    Example 2. One shareholder in Corporation Y, shareholder A, has an 
attributable interest in a PCS application. Another shareholder in 
Corporation Y, shareholder B, has a nonattributable interest in the same 
PCS application. While neither shareholder has enough shares to 
individually control Corporation Y, together they have the power to 
control Corporation Y. Through the common investment of shareholders A 
and B in the PCS application, Corporation Y would still be deemed an 
affiliate of the applicant.

    (i) Spousal Affiliation. Both spouses are deemed to own or control 
or have the power to control interests owned or controlled by either of 
them, unless they are subject to a legal separation recognized by a 
court of competent jurisdiction in the United States.
    (ii) Kinship Affiliation. Immediate family members will be presumed 
to own or control or have the power to control interests owned or 
controlled by other immediate family members. In this context 
``immediate family member'' means father, mother, husband, wife, son, 
daughter, brother, sister, father- or mother-in-law, son- or daughter-
in-law, brother- or sister-in-law, step-father, or -mother, step-
brother, or -sister, step-son, or -daughter, half brother or sister. 
This presumption may be rebutted by showing that
    (A) The family members are estranged,
    (B) The family ties are remote, or
    (C) The family members are not closely involved with each other in 
business matters.

    Example for paragraph (l)(3)(ii). A owns a controlling interest in 
Corporation X. A's sister-in-law, B, has an attributable interest in a 
PCS application. Because A and B have a presumptive kinship affiliation, 
A's interest in Corporation X is attributable to B, and

[[Page 280]]

thus to the applicant, unless B rebuts the presumption with the 
necessary showing.

    (4) Affiliation through stock ownership. (i) An applicant is 
presumed to control or have the power to control a concern if he or she 
owns or controls or has the power to control 50 percent or more of its 
voting stock.
    (ii) An applicant is presumed to control or have the power to 
control a concern even though he or she owns, controls or has the power 
to control less than 50 percent of the concern's voting stock, if the 
block of stock he or she owns, controls or has the power to control is 
large as compared with any other outstanding block of stock.
    (iii) If two or more persons each owns, controls or has the power to 
control less than 50 percent of the voting stock of a concern, such 
minority holdings are equal or approximately equal in size, and the 
aggregate of these minority holdings is large as compared with any other 
stock holding, the presumption arises that each one of these persons 
individually controls or has the power to control the concern; however, 
such presumption may be rebutted by a showing that such control or power 
to control, in fact, does not exist.
    (5) Affiliation arising under stock options, convertible debentures, 
and agreements to merge. Stock options, convertible debentures, and 
agreements to merge (including agreements in principle) are generally 
considered to have a present effect on the power to control the concern. 
Therefore, in making a size determination, such options, debentures, and 
agreements will generally be treated as though the rights held 
thereunder had been exercised. However, neither an affiliate nor an 
applicant can use such options and debentures to appear to terminate its 
control over another concern before it actually does so.

    Example 1 for paragraph (l)(5). If company B holds an option to 
purchase a controlling interest in company A, who holds an attributable 
interest in a PCS application, the situation is treated as though 
company B had exercised its rights and had become owner of a controlling 
interest in company A. The gross revenues of company B must be taken 
into account in determining the size of the applicant.
    Example 2 for paragraph (l)(5). If a large company, BigCo, holds 70% 
(70 of 100 outstanding shares) of the voting stock of company A, who 
holds an attributable interest in a PCS application, and gives a third 
party, SmallCo, an option to purchase 50 of the 70 shares owned by 
BigCo, BigCo will be deemed to be an affiliate of company A, and thus 
the applicant, until SmallCo actually exercises its options to purchase 
such shares. In order to prevent BigCo from circumventing the intent of 
the rule which requires such options to be considered on a fully diluted 
basis, the option is not considered to have present effect in this case.
    Example 3 for paragraph (l)(5). If company A has entered into an 
agreement to merge with company B in the future, the situation is 
treated as though the merger has taken place.

    (6) Affiliation under voting trusts. (i) Stock interests held in 
trust shall be deemed controlled by any person who holds or shares the 
power to vote such stock, to any person who has the sole power to sell 
such stock, and to any person who has the right to revoke the trust at 
will or to replace the trustee at will.
    (ii) If a trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business 
relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary, the stock interests held 
in trust will be deemed controlled by the grantor or beneficiary, as 
appropriate.
    (iii) If the primary purpose of a voting trust, or similar 
agreement, is to separate voting power from beneficial ownership of 
voting stock for the purpose of shifting control of or the power to 
control a concern in order that such concern or another concern may meet 
the Commission's size standards, such voting trust shall not be 
considered valid for this purpose regardless of whether it is or is not 
recognized within the appropriate jurisdiction.
    (7) Affiliation through common management. Affiliation generally 
arises where officers, directors, or key employees serve as the majority 
or otherwise as the controlling element of the board of directors and/or 
the management of another entity.
    (8) Affiliation through common facilities. Affiliation generally 
arises where one concern shares office space and/or employees and/or 
other facilities with another concern, particularly where such concerns 
are in the same or related industry or field of operations, or

[[Page 281]]

where such concerns were formerly affiliated, and through these sharing 
arrangements one concern has control, or potential control, of the other 
concern.
    (9) Affiliation through contractual relationships. Affiliation 
generally arises where one concern is dependent upon another concern for 
contracts and business to such a degree that one concern has control, or 
potential control, of the other concern.
    (10) Affiliation under joint venture arrangements. (i) A joint 
venture for size determination purposes is an association of concerns 
and/or individuals, with interests in any degree or proportion, formed 
by contract, express or implied, to engage in and carry out a single, 
specific business venture for joint profit for which purpose they 
combine their efforts, property, money, skill and knowledge, but not on 
a continuing or permanent basis for conducting business generally. The 
determination whether an entity is a joint venture is based upon the 
facts of the business operation, regardless of how the business 
operation may be designated by the parties involved. An agreement to 
share profits/losses proportionate to each party's contribution to the 
business operation is a significant factor in determining whether the 
business operation is a joint venture.
    (ii) The parties to a joint venture are considered to be affiliated 
with each other
    (11) For purposes of Sec. 24.709(a)(2) and paragraphs (b)(2) and (d) 
of this section, Indian tribes or Alaska Regional or Village 
Corporations organized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement 
Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), or entities owned and controlled by such 
tribes or corporations, are not considered affiliates of an applicant 
(or licensee) that is owned and controlled by such tribes, corporations 
or entities, and that otherwise complies with the requirements of 
Sec. 24.709 (b)(3) and (b)(5) or Sec. 24.709 (b)(4) and (b)(6), except 
that gross revenues derived from gaming activities conducted by 
affiliated entities pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 
U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) will be counted in determining such applicant's (or 
licensee's) compliance with the financial requirements of Sec. 24.709(a) 
and paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, unless such applicant 
establishes that it will not receive a substantial unfair competitive 
advantage because significant legal constraints restrict the applicant's 
ability to access such gross revenues.
    (m) Publicly Traded Corporation with Widely Dispersed Voting Power. 
A publicly traded corporation with widely dispersed voting power is a 
business entity organized under the laws of the United States:
    (1) Whose shares, debt, or other ownership interests are traded on 
an organized securities exchange within the United States;
    (2) In which no person
    (i) Owns more than 15 percent of the equity; or
    (ii) Possesses, directly or indirectly, through the ownership of 
voting securities, by contract or otherwise, the power to control the 
election of more than 15 percent of the members of the board of 
directors or other governing body of such publicly traded corporation; 
and
    (3) Over which no person other than the management and members of 
the board of directors or other governing body of such publicly traded 
corporation, in their capacities as such, has de facto control.
    (4) The term person shall be defined as in section 13(d) of the 
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (15 U.S.C. 78(m)), and 
shall also include investors that are commonly controlled under the 
indicia of control set forth in the definition of affiliate in 
paragraphs (1)(2) through (1) of this section.
    (n) Qualifying Investor; Qualifying Minority and/or Woman Investor.
    (1) A qualifying investor is a person who is (or holds an interest 
in) a member of the applicant's (or licensee's) control group and whose 
gross revenues and total assets, when aggregated with those of all other 
attributable investors and affiliates, do not exceed the gross revenues 
and total assets limits specified in Sec. 24.709(a), or, in the case of 
an applicant (or licensee) that is a small business, do not exceed the 
gross revenues limit specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) A qualifying minority and/or woman investor is a person who is a 
qualifying investor under paragraph (n)(1), who is

[[Page 282]]

(or holds an interest in) a member of the applicant's (or licensee's) 
control group and who is a member of a minority group or a woman and a 
United States citizen.
    (3) For purposes of assessing compliance with the minimum equity 
requirements of Sec. 24.709(b) (5) and (6), where such equity interests 
are not held directly in the applicant, interests held by qualifying 
investors or qualifying minority and/or woman investors shall be 
determined by successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for 
each link in the vertical ownership chain.
    (4) For purposes of Sec. 24.709 (b)(5)(i)(C) and (b)(6)(i)(C), a 
qualifying investor is a person who is (or holds an interest in) a 
member of the applicant's (or licensee's) control group and whose gross 
revenues and total assets do not exceed the gross revenues and total 
assets limits specified in Sec. 24.709(a).
    (o) Preexisting entity; Existing investor. A preexisting entity is 
an entity that was operating and earning revenues for at least two years 
prior to December 31, 1994. An existing investor is a person or entity 
that was an owner of record of a preexisting entity's equity as of 
November 10, 1994, and any person or entity acquiring de minimus equity 
holdings in a preexisting entity after that date.

    Note: In applying the term existing investor to de minimus interests 
in preexisting entities obtained or increased after November 10, 1994, 
the Commission will scrutinize any significant restructuring of the 
preexisting entity that occurs after that date and will presume that any

    Source: 64 FR 51717, Sept. 24, 1999, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 24.900  Purpose.

    Pursuant to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act 
(CALEA), Public Law 103-414, 108 Stat. 4279 (1994) (codified as amended 
in sections of 18 U.S.C. and 47 U.S.C.), this subpart contains rules 
that require a broadband PCS telecommunications carrier to implement 
certain capabilities to ensure law enforcement access to authorized 
communications or call-identifying information.


<R05>
Sec. 24.901  Scope.

    The definitions included in this subpart shall be used solely for 
the purpose of implementing CALEA requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 24.902  Definitions.

    Call identifying information. Call identifying information means 
dialing or signaling information that identifies the origin, direction, 
destination, or termination of each communication generated or received 
by a subscriber by means of any equipment, facility, or service of a 
telecommunications carrier. Call identifying information is ``reasonably 
available'' to a carrier if it is present at an intercept access point 
and can be made available without the carrier being unduly burdened with 
network modifications.
    Collection function. The location where lawfully authorized 
intercepted communications and call-identifying information is collected 
by a law enforcement agency (LEA).
    Content of subject-initiated conference calls. Capability that 
permits a LEA to monitor the content of conversations by all parties 
connected via a conference call when the facilities under

[[Page 286]]

surveillance maintain a circuit connection to the call.
    Dialed digit extraction. Capability that permits a LEA to receive on 
the call data channel a digits dialed by a subject after a call is 
connected to another carrier's service for processing and routing.
    IAP. Intercept access point is a point within a carrier's system 
where some of the communications or call-identifying information of an 
intercept subject's equipment, facilities, and services are accessed.
    In-band and out-of-band signaling. Capability that permits a LEA to 
be informed when a network message that provides call identifying 
information (e.g., ringing, busy, call waiting signal, message light) is 
generated or sent by the IAP switch to a subject using the facilities 
under surveillance. Excludes signals generated by customer premises 
equipment when no network signal is generated.
    J-STD-025. The interim standard developed by the Telecommunications 
Industry Association and the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry 
Solutions for wireline, cellular, and broadband PCS carriers. This 
standard defines services and features to support lawfully authorized 
electronic surveillance, and specifies interfaces necessary to deliver 
intercepted communications and call-identifying information to a LEA.
    LEA. Law enforcement agency; e.g., the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation or a local police department.
    Party hold, join, drop on conference calls. Capability that permits 
a LEA to identify the parties to a conference call conversation at all 
times.
    Subject-initiated dialing and signaling information. Capability that 
permits a LEA to be informed when a subject using the facilities under 
surveillance uses services that provide call identifying information, 
such as call forwarding, call waiting, call hold, and three-way calling. 
Excludes signals generated by customer premises equipment when no 
network signal is generated.
    Timing information. Capability that permits a LEA to associate call-
identifying information with the content of a call. A call-identifying 
message must be sent from the carrier's IAP to the LEA's Collection 
Function within eight seconds of receipt of that message by the IAP at 
least 95% of the time, and with the call event time-stamped to an 
accuracy of at least 200 milliseconds.


<R05>
Sec. 24.903  Capabilities that must be provided by a broadband PCS telecommunications carrier.

    (a) Except as provided under paragraph (b) of this section, as of 
June 30, 2000, a broadband PCS telecommunications carrier shall provide 
to a LEA the assistance capability requirements of CALEA, see 47 U.S.C. 
1002. A carrier may satisfy these requirements by complying with 
publicly available technical requirements or standards adopted by an 
industry association or standard-setting organization, such as J-STD-
025.
    (b) As of September 30, 2001, a broadband PCS telecommunications 
carrier shall provide to a LEA communications and call-identifying 
information transported by packet-mode communications and the following 
capabilities:
    (1) Content of subject-initiated conference calls;
    (2) Party hold, join, drop on conference calls;
    (3) Subject-initiated dialing and signaling information ;
    (4) In-band and out-of-band signaling;
    (5) Timing information;
    (6) Dialed digit extraction.

Sec. 25.103  Definitions.

    (a) Communications common carrier. The term ``communications common 
carrier'' as used in this part means any person (individual, 
partnership, association, joint-stock company, trust, corporation, or 
other entity) engaged as a common carrier for hire, in interstate or 
foreign communication by wire or radio or in interstate or foreign radio 
transmission of energy, including such carriers as are described in 
subsection 2(b) (2) and (3) of the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended, and,

[[Page 289]]

in addition, for purposes of subpart H of this part, includes any 
individual, partnership, association, joint-stock company, trust, 
corporation, or other entity which owns or controls, directly or 
indirectly, or is under direct or indirect common control with, any such 
carrier.
    (b) Authorized carrier. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section, the term ``authorized carrier'' means a communications 
common carrier which is authorized by the Federal Communications 
Commission under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, to provide 
services by means of communications satellites.
    (2) For the purposes of subpart H of this part, the term 
``authorized carrier'' means a communications common carrier which is 
specifically authorized or which is a member of a class of carriers 
authorized by the Commission to own shares of stock in the corporation.
    (c) Communications satellite corporation. (1) The terms 
``communications satellite corporation'' or ``corporation'' as used in 
this part mean the corporation created pursuant to the provisions of 
Title III of the Communications Satellite Act of 1962.
    (2) The corporation shall be deemed to be a common carrier within 
the meaning of section 3(h) of the Communications Satellite Act of 1962.
    (d) Communication-satellite earth station complex. The term 
communication-satellite earth station complex includes transmitters, 
receivers, and communications antennas at the earth station site 
together with the interconnecting terrestrial facilities (cables, lines, 
or microwave facilities) and modulating and demodulating equipment 
necessary for processing of traffic received from the terrestrial 
distribution system(s) prior to transmission via satellite and of 
traffic received from the satellite prior to transfer of channels of 
communication to terrestrial distribution system(s).
    (e) Communication-satellite earth station complex functions. The 
communication-satellite earth station complex interconnects with 
terminal equipment of common carriers or authorized entities at the 
interface; accepts traffic from such entities at the interface, 
processes for transmission via satellite and performs the transmission 
function; receives traffic from a satellite or satellites, processes it 
in a form necessary to deliver channels of communication to terrestrial 
common carriers or such other authorized entities and delivers the 
processed traffic to such entities at the interface.
    (f) Interface. The point of interconnection between two distinct but 
adjacent communications systems having different functions. The 
interface in the communication-satellite service is that point where 
communications terminal equipment of the terrestrial common carriers or 
other authorized entities interconnects with the terminal equipment of 
the communication-satellite earth station complex. The interface in the 
communication-satellite service shall be located at the earth station 
site, or if this is impracticable, as close thereto as possible.

<R05>
Sec. 25.104  Preemption of local zoning of earth stations.

    (a) Any state or local zoning, land-use, building, or similar 
regulation that materially limits transmission or reception by satellite 
earth station antennas, or imposes more than minimal costs on users of 
such antennas, is preempted unless the promulgating authority can 
demonstrate that such regulation is reasonable, except that nonfederal 
regulation of radio frequency emissions is not preempted by this 
section. For purposes of this paragraph (a), reasonable means that the 
local regulation:
    (1) Has a clearly defined health, safety, or aesthetic objective 
that is stated in the text of the regulation itself; and
    (2) Furthers the stated health, safety or aesthetic objective 
without unnecessarily burdening the federal interests in ensuring access 
to satellite services and in promoting fair and effective competition 
among competing communications service providers.
    (b)(1) Any state or local zoning, land-use, building, or similar 
regulation that affects the installation, maintenance, or use of a 
satellite earth station antenna that is two meters or less in diameter 
and is located or proposed

[[Page 290]]

to be located in any area where commercial or industrial uses are 
generally permitted by non-federal land-use regulation shall be presumed 
unreasonable and is therefore preempted subject to paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section. No civil, criminal, administrative, or other legal action 
of any kind shall be taken to enforce any regulation covered by this 
presumption unless the promulgating authority has obtained a waiver from 
the Commission pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, or a final 
declaration from the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction 
that the presumption has been rebutted pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section.
    (2) Any presumption arising from paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
may be rebutted upon a showing that the regulation in question:
    (i) Is necessary to accomplish a clearly defined health or safety 
objective that is stated in the text of the regulation itself;
    (ii) Is no more burdensome to satellite users than is necessary to 
achieve the health or safety objective; and
    (iii) Is specifically applicable on its face to antennas of the 
class described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (c) Any person aggrieved by the application or potential application 
of a state or local zoning or other regulation in violation of paragraph 
(a) of this section may, after exhausting all nonfederal administrative 
remedies, file a petition with the Commission requesting a declaration 
that the state or local regulation in question is preempted by this 
section. Nonfederal administrative remedies, which do not include 
judicial appeals of administrative determinations, shall be deemed 
exhausted when:
    (1) The petitioner's application for a permit or other authorization 
required by the state or local authority has been denied and any 
administrative appeal and variance procedure has been exhausted;
    (2) The petitioner's application for a permit or other authorization 
required by the state or local authority has been on file for ninety 
days without final action;
    (3) The petitioner has received a permit or other authorization 
required by the state or local authority that is conditioned upon the 
petitioner's expenditure of a sum of money, including costs required to 
screen, pole-mount, or otherwise specially install the antenna, greater 
than the aggregate purchase or total lease cost of the equipment as 
normally installed; or
    (4) A state or local authority has notified the petitioner of 
impending civil or criminal action in a court of law and there are no 
more nonfederal administrative steps to be taken.
    (d) Procedures regarding filing of petitions requesting declaratory 
rulings and other related pleadings will be set forth in subsequent 
Public Notices. All allegations of fact contained in petitions and 
related pleadings must be supported by affidavit of a person or persons 
with personal knowledge thereof.
    (e) Any state or local authority that wishes to maintain and enforce 
zoning or other regulations inconsistent with this section may apply to 
the Commission for a full or partial waiver of this section. Such 
waivers may be granted by the Commission in its sole discretion, upon a 
showing by the applicant that local concerns of a highly specialized or 
unusual nature create a necessity for regulation inconsistent with this 
section. No application for waiver shall be considered unless it 
specifically sets forth the particular regulation for which waiver is 
sought. Waivers granted in accordance with this section shall not apply 
to later-enacted or amended regulations by the local authority unless 
the Commission expressly orders otherwise.
    (f) A satellite earth station antenna that is designed to receive 
direct broadcast satellite service, including direct-to-home satellite 
services, that is one meter or less in diameter or is located in Alaska 
is covered by the regulations in Sec. 1.4000 of this chapter.

not specifically required in the prescribed application form or these 
rules, a failure to comply with the request within a specified time 
period will be deemed to render the application defective and will 
subject it to dismissal.


<R05>
Sec. 25.113  Construction permits, station licenses, launch authority.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section or in 
Sec. 25.131, construction permits must be obtained for all fixed, 
temporary fixed or mobile earth stations governed by this part. 
Simultaneous application for a construction permit and station license 
may be made for all earth station facilities governed by this part.
    (b) Construction permits are not required for satellite earth 
stations that operate with U.S.-licensed or non-U.S. licensed space 
stations. Construction of such stations may commence prior to grant of a 
license at the applicant's own risk. Applicants must comply with the 
provisions of 47 CFR 1.1312 relating to environmental processing prior 
to commencing construction.
    (c) FAA notification. Before the construction of new antenna 
structures or alteration in the height of existing antenna structures is 
authorized by the FCC, a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
determination of ``no hazard'' may be required. To apply for this 
determination, the FAA must be notified of the planned construction. 
Criteria used to determine whether FAA notification is required for a 
particular antenna structure are contained in part 17 of this chapter. 
Applications proposing construction of one or more new antenna 
structures or alteration of the overall height of one or more existing 
antenna structures, where FAA notification prior to such construction or 
alteration is not required by part 17 of this chapter, must indicate 
such and, unless the reason is obvious (e.g. structure height is less 
than 6.10 meters AGL) must contain a statement explaining why FAA 
notification is not required.
    (d) Painting and lighting. The owner of each antenna structure 
required to be painted and/or illuminated under the provisions of 
Section 303(q) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, shall 
operate and maintain the antenna structure painting and lighting in 
accordance with part 17 of this chapter. In the event of default by the 
owner, each licensee or permittee shall be individually responsible for 
conforming to the requirements pertaining to antenna structure painting 
and lighting.
    (e) Antenna Structure Registration Number. Applications proposing 
construction of one or more new antenna structures or alteration of the 
overall height of one or more existing structures, where FAA 
notification prior to such construction or alteration is required by 
part 17 of this chapter, must include the FCC Antenna Structure 
Registration Number(s) for the affected structure(s). If no such number 
has been assigned at the time the application is filed, the applicant 
must state in the application whether or not the antenna structure owner 
has notified the FAA of the proposed construction or alteration and 
applied to the FCC for an Antenna Structure Registration Number in 
accordance with part 17 of this chapter for the antenna structure in 
question.
    (f) Construction permits are not required for U.S.-licensed space 
stations. Construction of such stations may commence, at the applicant's 
own risk, prior to grant of a license. Prior to

[[Page 293]]

commencing construction, however, applicants must notify the Commission 
in writing they plan to begin construction at their own risk.
    (g) A launch authorization and station license (i.e., operating 
authoirty) must be applied for and granted before a space station may be 
launched and operated in orbit. Request for launch authorization may be 
included in an application for space station license. However, an 
application for authority to launch and operate an on-ground spare 
satellite will be considered to be a newly filed application for cut-off 
purposes, except where the space station to be launched is determined to 
be an emergency replacement for a previously authorized space station 
that has been lost as a result of a launch failure or a catastrophic in-
orbit failure.

that a substantive disposition of the application is to be considered at 
a forthcoming Commission meeting, or a final order disposing of the 
matter is adopted by the Commission.
    (b) Major amendments submitted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section are subject to the public notice requirements of Sec. 25.151. An 
amendment will be deemed to be a major amendment under the following 
circumstances:
    (1) If the amendment increases the potential for interference, or 
changes the proposed frequencies or orbital locations to be used.
    (2) If the amendment would convert the proposal into an action that 
may have a significant environmental effect under Sec. 1.1307 of this 
chapter.
    (3) If the amendment specifies a substantial change in beneficial 
ownership or control (de jure or de facto) of an applicant such that the 
change would require, in the case of an authorized station, the filing 
of a prior assignment or transfer of control application under section 
310(d) of the Communications Act, provided however, that the change 
would not be considered major where it merely amends an application to 
reflect a change in ownership or control of the station that had been 
previously approved by the Commission.
    (4) If the amendment, or the cumulative effect of the amendment, is 
determined by the Commission otherwise to be substantial pursuant to 
section 309 of the Communications Act.
    (c) Any application will be considered to be a newly filed 
application if it is amended by a major amendment (as defined by 
paragraph (b) of this section)

[[Page 296]]

after a ``cut-off'' date applicable to the application, except under the 
following circumstances:
    (1) The amendment resolves frequency conflicts with authorized 
stations or other pending applications but does not create new or 
increased frequency conflicts;
    (2) The amendment reflects only a change in ownership or control 
found by the Commission to be in the public interest and, for which a 
requested exemption from a ``cut-off'' date is granted;
    (3) The amendment corrects typographical, transcription, or similar 
clerical errors which are clearly demonstrated to be mistakes by 
reference to other parts of the application, and whose discovery does 
not create new or increased frequency conflicts; or
    (4) The amendment does not create new or increased frequency 
conflicts, and is demonstrably necessitated by events which the 
applicant could not have reasonably foreseen at the time of filing.
    (d) Any amendment to an application shall be signed and submitted in 
the same manner, and with the same number of copies, as was the original 
application.

Sec. 25.117  Modification of station license.

    (a) Except as provided for in Sec. 25.118 (Modifications not 
requiring prior authorization), no modification of a radio station 
governed by this part which affects the parameters or terms and 
conditions of the station authorization shall be made except upon 
application to and grant of such application by the Commission. No 
license modification will be required if the licensee seeks to access 
another U.S.-licensed fixed satellite provided:
    (1) Consultations pursuant to Article XIV(d) of the INTELSAT 
Agreement have been completed for the satellites, services and countries 
involved; and
    (2) The operators of the U.S.-licensed systems have received 
specific authorization to provide the services to the proposed 
locations.
    (b) Applications for modification of an earth station license to 
add, change or replace transmitters or antenna facilities conforming to 
Sec. 25.209 will be considered to be minor modifications if the 
particulars of operations remain unchanged and frequency coordination is 
not required, provided however, that the maximum power and power density 
delivered into any antenna at the earth station site shall not exceed 
the values calculated by subtracting the maximum antenna gain specified 
in the license from the maximum authorized e.i.r.p. and e.i.r.p. density 
values.
    (c) Applications for modification of earth station authorizations 
shall be submitted on FCC Form 493 except as set forth in paragraph (e) 
of this section.
    (d) Applications for modifications of space station authorizations 
shall be filed in accordance with Sec. 25.114, but only those items of 
information listed in Sec. 25.114(c) that change need to be submitted 
provided the applicant certifies that the remaining information has not 
changed.
    (e) Any application for modification of authorization to extend a 
required date of completion (e.g., begin construction, complete 
construction, launch, bring into operation) shall be filed on FCC Form 
701 (Application for Additional Time to Construct). The application must 
include a verified statement from the applicant:
    (1) That states the additional time is required due to unforeseeable 
circumstances beyond the applicant's control, describes these 
circumstances with specificity, and justifies the precise extension 
period requested; or
    (2) That states there are unique and overriding public interest 
concerns that justify an extension, identifies these interests and 
justifies a precise extension period.

Sec. 25.119  Assignment or transfer of control of station authorization.

    (a) No station license, nor any rights thereunder, shall be 
transferred, assigned, or disposed of in any manner, voluntarily or 
involuntarily, directly or indirectly, or by transfer of control of any 
corporation or any other entity holding such license, to any person 
except upon application to the Commission and upon finding by the 
Commission that the pubic interest, convenience and necessity will be 
served thereby.
    (b) For purposes of this section, transfers of control requiring 
Commission approval shall include any and all transactions that:
    (1) Change the party controlling the affairs of the licensee, or
    (2) Affect any change in a controlling interest in the ownership of 
the licensee, including changes in legal or equitable ownership.
    (c) Assignment of license. FCC Form 312, Main Form and Schedule A, 
shall be submitted to assign voluntarily (as by, for example, contract 
or other agreement) or involuntarily (as by, for example, death, 
bankruptcy, or legal disability) the station authorization. In the case 
of involuntary assignment, the application should be filed within 10 
days of the event causing the assignment. FCC Form 312, Main Form, and 
Schedule A shall also be used for non-substantial ( pro forma) 
assignments.
    (d) Transfer of control of corporation holding license. FCC Form 
312, Main Form and Schedule A, shall be submitted in order to transfer 
voluntarily or involuntarily (de jure or de facto) control of a 
corporation holding any licenses. In the case of involuntary transfer of 
control, the applications should be filed within 10 days of the event 
causing the transfer of control. FCC Form 312, Main Form and Schedule A 
shall also be used for non-substantial (pro forma) transfers of control.
    (e) Whenever a group of station licenses in the same radio service 
for the same class of facility licensed to the same entity is to be 
assigned or transferred to a single assignee or transferee, a single 
application may be filed to cover the entire group, if the application 
identifies in an exhibit each station by call sign, station location and 
expiration date of license.
    (f) Assignments and transfers of control shall be completed within 
60 days from the date of authorization. Within 30 days of consumation, 
the Commission shall be notified by letter of the date of consummation

Sec. 25.120  Application for special temporary authorization.

    (a) In circumstances requiring immediate or temporary use of 
facilities, request may be made for special temporary authority to 
install and/or operate new or modified equipment. The request must 
contain the full particulars of the proposed operation including all

[[Page 298]]

facts sufficient to justify the temporary authority sought and the 
public interest therein. No request for temporary authority will be 
considered unless it is received by the Commission at least 3 working 
days prior to the date of proposed construction or operation or, where 
an extension is sought, the expiration date of the existing temporary 
authorization. A request received within less than 3 working days may be 
accepted only upon due showing of extraordinary reasons for the delay in 
submitting the request which could not have been earlier foreseen by the 
applicant. A copy of the request for special temporary authority also 
shall be forwarded to the Commission's Columbia Operations Center in 
Columbia, Maryland.
    (b) The Commission may grant a temporary authorization for a period 
not to exceed 180 days, with additional periods not exceeding 180 days, 
upon a finding that there are extraordinary circumstances requiring 
temporary operations in the public interest and that delay in the 
institution of these temporary operations would seriously prejudice the 
public interest. Convenience to the applicant, such as marketing 
considerations of meeting scheduled customer in-service dates, will not 
be deemed sufficient for this purpose.
    (c) Each application proposing construction of one or more earth 
station antennas or alteration of the overall height of one or more 
existing earth station antenna structures, where FAA notification prior 
to such construction or alteration is required by part 17 of this 
chapter, must include the FCC Antenna Structure Registration Number(s) 
for the affected satellite earth station antenna(s). If no such number 
has been assigned at the time the application(s) is filed, the applicant 
must state in the application whether the satellite earth station 
antenna owner has notified the FAA of the proposed construction or 
alteration and applied to the FCC for an Antenna Structure Registration 
Number in accordance with part 17 of this chapter. Applications 
proposing construction of one or more earth station antennas or 
alteration of the overall height of one or more existing earth station 
antennas, where FAA notification prior to such construction or 
alteration is not required by part 17 of this chapter, must indicate 
such and, unless the satellite earth station antenna is 6.10 meters or 
less above ground level (AGL), must contain a statement explaining why 
FAA notification is not required.

notice for 30 days and automatically granted if no objection is 
submitted to the Commission and served on the applicant. Additional 
pleadings are authorized in accordance with Sec. 1.45 of this chapter.
    (f) The registration of a receive-only earth station results in the 
listing of an authorized frequency band at the location specified in the 
registration. Interference protection levels are those agreed to during 
coordination.
    (g) Reception of signals or programming from non-U.S. satellites may 
be subject to restrictions as a result of international agreements or 
treaties. The Commission will maintain public information on the status 
of any such agreements.
    (h) Registration term: Registrations for receive-only earth stations 
governed by this section will be issued for a period of 10 years from 
the date on which the application was filed. Applications for renewals

Sec. 25.132  Verification of earth station antenna performance standards.

    (a) All applications for transmitting earth stations in the C and 
Ku-bands must be accompanied by a certificate pursuant to Sec. 2.902 of 
the chapter from the manufacturer of each antenna that the results of a 
series of radiation pattern tests performed on representative equipment 
in representative configurations by the manufacturer which demonstrates 
that the equipment complies with the performance standards set forth in 
Sec. 25.209. The licensee must be prepared to demonstrate the 
measurements to the Commission on request in the course of an 
investigation of a harmful interference incident.
    (b)(1) In order to demonstrate compliance with Sec. 25.209 (a) and 
(b), the following measurements on a production antenna performed on 
calibrated antenna range, as a minimum, shall be made at the bottom, 
middle and top of each allocated frequency band and submitted to the 
Commission:
    (i) Co-polarized patterns for each of two orthogonal senses of 
polarizations in two orthogonal cuts of the antenna.
    (A) In the azimuth plane, plus and minus 7 degrees and plus and 
minus 180 degrees.
    (B) In the elevation plane, zero to forty-five degrees.
    (ii) Cross-polarization patterns in the E- and H-planes, plus and 
minus 9 degrees.
    (iii) Main beam gain.
    (2) The FCC envelope specified in Sec. 25.209 shall be superimposed 
on each pattern. The minimum tests specified above are recognized as 
representative of the performance of the antenna in most planes although 
some increase in sidelobe levels should be expected in the spar planes 
and orthogonal spar planes.

[[Page 301]]

    (c) The tests specified in paragraph (b) of this section are 
normally performed at the manufacturer's facility; but for those 
antennas that are very large and only assembled on-site, on-site 
measurements may be used for product qualification data. If on-site data 
is to be used for qualification, the test frequencies and number of 
patterns should follow, where possible, the recommendations in paragraph 
(b) of this section, and the test data is to be submitted in the same 
manner as described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) For each new or modified transmitting antenna over 3 meters in 
diameter, the following on-site verification measurements must be 
completed at one frequency on an available transponder in each frequency 
band of interest and submitted to the Commission.
    (1) Co-polarized patterns in the elevation plane, plus and minus 7 
degrees, in the transmit band.
    (2) Co-polarized patterns in the azimuth and elevation planes, plus 
and minus 7 degrees, in the receive band.
    (3) System cross-polarization discrimination on-axis. The FCC 
envelope specified in Sec. 25.209 shall be superimposed on each pattern. 
The transmit patterns are to be measured with the aid of a co-operating 
earth station in coordination with the satellite system control center 
under the provisions of Sec. 25.272.
    (e) Certification that the tests required by paragraph (c) of this 
section have been satisfactorily performed shall be provided to the 
Commission in notification that construction of the facilities has been 
completed as required by Sec. 25.133.
    (f) Antennas less than 3 meters in diameter and antennas on simple 
(manual) drive mounts that are operated at a fixed site are exempt from 
the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section provided that 
a detailed technical showing is made that confirms proper installation, 
pointing procedures, and polarization alignment and manufacturing 
quality control. These showing must also include a plan for periodic 
testing and field installation procedures and precautions.
    (g) Records of the results of the tests required by this section 
must be maintained at the antenna site or the earth station operator's 
control center and be available for inspection.

they are to operate in accordance with Sec. 25.142(b). This 
demonstration shall include a showing as to all the technical 
parameters, including duty cycle and power limits,

[[Page 303]]

under which the individual user transceivers will operate.
    (b) Transceiver units associated with the non-voice, non-
geostationary mobile-satellite service may not be operated on civil 
aircraft. All portable or hand-held transceiver units (including 
transceiver units installed in other devices that are themselves 
portable or hand-held) having a receiver operating in the 137-138 MHz 
band shall bear the following statement in a conspicuous location on the 
device: ``This device may not be operated while on board a civil 
aircraft. It must be turned off at all times while on board such an 
aircraft.'' This subsection shall not apply to transceiver units whose 
receivers are incapable of radiating in the 108-137 MHz frequency bands.
    (c) Transceiver units in this service are authorized to communicate 
with and through U.S. authorized space stations only. No person shall 
transmit to a space station unless the specific transmission is first 
authorized by the space station licensee or by a service vendor 
authorized by that licensee.
    (d) Any transceiver unit associated with this service will be 
deemed, when communicating with a particular non-voice, non-
geostationary mobile-satellite service system pursuant to paragraph (c) 
of this section, to be temporarily associated with and licensed to the 
system operator or service vendor holding the blanket earth station 
license awarded pursuant to Sec. 25.115(d). The domestic earth station 
licensee shall, for such temporary period, assume the same licensee 
responsibility for such transceiver as if such transceiver were

interference is based on either the antenna performance specified in 
Sec. 25.209 (a) and (b), or the actual receiving earth station antenna 
performance, if actual performance provides greater isolation from 
adjacent satellite interference. For purposes of insuring the correct 
level of protection, the applicant shall provide, for each earth station 
antenna type, the antenna performance plots for the 20 GHz band, 
including the format specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (f) The earth station licensee shall not transmit towards a GSO FSS 
satellite unless it has prior authorization from the satellite operator 
or a space segment vendor authorized by the satellite operator. The 
specific transmission shall be conducted in accordance with the 
operating protocol specified by the satellite operator.

day cut-off period shall also be established for the filing of 
applications to be considered in conjunction with an original 
application.
    (c) User transceivers. Individual user transceivers will not be 
licensed. Service vendors may file blanket applications for transceiver 
units using FCC Form 312, Main Form and Schedule B, and specifying the 
number of units to be covered by the blanket license. Each application 
must demonstrate that transceiver operations will not cause interference 
to other users of the spectrum.
    (d) Permissible communications. Stations in this service are 
authorized to render radiodetermination service, and may not render 
other services except as ancillary to the radiodetermination service.
    (e) Frequency allocation policies. Each radiodetermination satellite 
service licensee will be assigned the entire allocated frequency bands 
on a non-exclusive basis. Coding techniques and power limits as set 
forth in paragraph (f) of this section and orbital spacing shall be 
employed to avoid harmful interference with other radiodetermination 
satellite service systems.
    (f) Radiodetermination satellite service. Licenses shall coordinate 
with radiodetermination satellite system licensees to avoid harmful 
interference to other radiodetermination satellite systems through:
    (1) Power flux density limits;
    (2) Use of pseudorandom-noise codes (for both the satellite-to-user 
link and for the user-to-satellite link); and
    (3) Random access, time division multiplex techniques.

Licensees shall coordinate with 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile-Satellite Service 
system licensees to avoid interference to 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile-Satellite 
Service systems.

Sec. 25.142  Licensing provisions for the non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service.

    (a) Space station application requirements. (1) Each application for 
a space station system authorization in the non-voice, non-geostationary 
mobile-satellite service shall describe in detail

[[Page 309]]

the proposed non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite system, 
setting forth all pertinent technical and operational aspects of the 
system, and the technical, legal, and financial qualifications of the 
applicant. In particular, each application shall include the information 
specified in Sec. 25.114, except that in lieu of the information 
concerning orbital locations requested in Sec. 25.114(c)(6), the 
applicant shall specify the number of space stations and applicable 
information relating to the altitude(s), argument(s) of perigee, service 
arc(s), right ascension of ascending node(s), eccentricity, and 
inclination of the space stations (all referenced to the same time) that 
will comprise its system. Applicants must also file information 
demonstrating compliance with all requirements of this section, and 
showing, based on existing system information publicly available at the 
Commission at the time of filing, that they will not cause unacceptable 
interference to any non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite 
service system authorized to construct or operate.
    (2) Applicants for a non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite 
must identify the power flux density produced at the Earth's surface by 
each space station of their system in the frequency bands 137-138 MHz 
and 400.15-401 MHz, to allow determination of whether coordination with 
terrestrial services is required under international footnotes 599A and 
647B of Sec. 2.106 of the Commission's Rules. In addition, applicants 
must identify the measures they would employ to protect the radio 
astronomy service in the 150.05-153 MHz and 406.1-410 MHz bands from 
harmful interference from unwanted emissions.
    (3) Emission limitations. (i) Applicants in the non-voice, non-
geostationary mobile-satellite service shall show that their space 
stations will not exceed the emission limitations of Sec. 25.202(f) (1), 
(2) and (3), as calculated for a fixed point on the Earth's surface in 
the plane of the space station's orbit, considering the worst-case 
frequency tolerance of all frequency determining components, and maximum 
positive and negative Doppler shift of both the uplink and downlink 
signals, taking into account the system design.
    (ii) Applicants in the non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite 
service shall show that no signal received by their satellites from 
sources outside of their system shall be retransmitted with a power flux 
density level, in the worst 4 kHz, higher than the level described by 
the applicants in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (4) Financial qualifications. Each applicant for space station 
system authorization in the non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-
satellite service must demonstrate, on the basis of the documentation 
contained in its application, that it is financially qualified to 
proceed expeditiously with the construction, launch and operation for 
one year of the first two space stations of its proposed system 
immediately upon grant of the requested authorization. Failure to make 
such a showing will result in the dismissal of the application. This 
showing shall include all information described in Sec. 25.140 (c), (d) 
and (e).
    (5) Replacement of space stations within the system license term. 
The licensee need not file separate applications to construct, launch 
and operate technically identical replacement satellites within the term 
of the system authorization. However, the licensee shall certify to the 
Commission, at least thirty days prior to launch of such replacement(s) 
that:
    (i) The licensee intends to launch a space station that is 
technically identical to those authorized in its system license, and
    (ii) Launch of this space station will not cause the licensee to 
exceed the total number of operating space stations authorized by the 
Commission.
    (b) Operating conditions. In order to ensure compatible operations 
with authorized users in the frequency bands to be utilized for 
operations in the non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service, 
non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service systems must 
operate in accordance with the conditions specified in this section.
    (1) Service limitation. Voice services may not be provided.
    (2) Coordination requirements with Federal government users.

[[Page 310]]

    (i) The frequency bands allocated for use by the non-voice, non-
geostationary mobile-satellite service are also authorized for use by 
agencies of the Federal government. The Federal use of frequencies in 
the non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service frequency 
bands is under the regulatory jurisdiction of the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).
    (ii) The Commission will use its existing procedures for liaison 
with NTIA to reach agreement with respect to achieving compatible 
operations between Federal government users under the jurisdiction of 
NTIA and non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service systems 
(including user transceivers subject to blanket licensing under 
Sec. 25.115(d)) through the frequency assignment and coordination 
practices established by NTIA and the Interdepartment Radio Advisory 
Committee (IRAC). In order to facilitate such frequency assignment and 
coordination, applicants shall provide the Commission with sufficient 
information to evaluate electromagnetic compatibility with the Federal 
government use of the spectrum, and any additional information requested 
by the Commission. As part of the coordination process, applicants shall 
show that they will not cause unacceptable interference to authorized 
Federal government users, based upon existing system information 
provided by the Government. The frequency assignment and coordination of 
the satellite system with Federal government users shall be completed 
prior to grant of construction authorization.
    (iii) The Commission shall also coordinate with NTIA/IRAC with 
regard to the frequencies to be shared by those earth stations of non-
voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service systems that are not 
subject to blanket licensing under Sec. 25.115(d), and authorized 
Federal government stations in the fixed and mobile services, through 
the exchange of appropriate systems information.
    (3) Coordination among non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite 
service systems. Applicants for authority to establish non-voice, non-
geostationary mobile-satellite service systems are encouraged to 
coordinate their proposed frequency usage with existing permittees and 
licensees in the non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service 
whose facilities could be affected by the new proposal in terms of 
frequency interference or restricted system capacity. All affected 
applicants, permittees, and licensees shall, at the direction of the 
Commission, cooperate fully and make every reasonable effort to resolve 
technical problems and conflicts that may inhibit effective and 
efficient use of the radio spectrum; however, the permittee or licensee 
being coordinated with is not obligated to suggest changes or re-
engineer an applicant's proposal in cases involving conflicts.
    (4) Safety and distress communications. Stations operating in the 
non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service that are used to 
comply with any statutory or regulatory equipment carriage requirements 
may also be subject to the provisions of sections 321(b) and 359 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Licensees are advised that these 
provisions give priority to radio communications or signals relating to 
ships in distress and prohibit a charge for the transmission of maritime 
distress calls and related traffic.
    (c) Reporting requirements. All operators of non-voice, non-
geostationary mobile-satellite service systems shall, on June 30 of each 
year, file a report with the International Bureau and the Commission's 
Columbia Operations Center in Columbia, Maryland, containing the 
following information current as of May 31st of that year:
    (1) A listing of any non-scheduled space station outages for more 
than thirty minutes and the cause(s) of such outages;
    (2) A detailed description of the utilization made of the in-orbit 
satellite system. That description should identify the percentage of 
time that the system is actually used for domestic transmission, the 
amount of capacity (if any) sold but not in service, and the amount of 
unused system capacity; and
    (3) Identification of any space stations not available for service 
or otherwise not performing to specifications, the cause(s) of these 
difficulties, and

[[Page 311]]

the date any space station was taken out of service or the malfunction 
identified.
    (d) Prohibition of certain agreements. No license shall be granted 
to any applicant for a non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite 
service system if that applicant, or any companies controlling or 
controlled by the applicant, shall acquire or enjoy any right, for the 
purpose of handling traffic to or from the United States, its 
territories or possessions, to construct or operate space segment or 
earth stations in the non-voice, non-geosynchronous mobile-satellite 
service, or to interchange traffic, which is denied to any other United 
States company by reason of any concession, contract, understanding, or 
working arrangement to which the licensee or any persons or companies 
controlling or controlled by the licensee are parties.
    (e) Spectrum priority. (1) The non-voice, non-geosynchronous mobile-
satellite service system that is authorized in the second application 
processing round to operate in the 148-148.25 MHz, 148.75-148.855 MHz, 
148.905-149.81 MHz and 150-150.05 MHz uplink frequency bands and the 
400.505-400.5517 MHz, 400.5983-400.645 MHz, 137.025-137.175 MHz, 
137.333-137.4125 MHz, 137.475-137.525 MHz, 137.595-137.645 MHz, 137.753-
137.787 MHz and 137.825-138 MHz downlink frequency bands (the ``System 2 
licensee'') will have a first priority to apply for and use a limited 
amount of downlink spectrum duly allocated worldwide and domestically to 
the non-voice, non-geosynchronous mobile-satellite service by the ITU, 
at WRC-97 or a subsequent World Radiocommunication Conference, and by 
the Commission, respectively (the ``Future Spectrum''). The System 2 
licensee will be eligible to apply for and use the first 210 kHz of 
Future Spectrum plus spectrum sufficient to account for Doppler 
frequency shift in the Future Spectrum (the ``Supplemental Spectrum'') 
to implement its non-voice, non-geosynchronous mobile-satellite service 
system. The System 2 licensee's application for and use of the 
Supplemental Spectrum is subject to the Commission's Rules and policies, 
such reasonable operating conditions as may be imposed by the 
Commission, and international spectrum coordination requirements. For so 
long as the System 2 licensee is permitted by the Government of France 
to operate in the 400.5517-400.5983 MHz band coordinated with the French 
system S80-1, the Supplemental Spectrum shall be reduced to an amount 
equivalent to 150 kHz of Future Spectrum plus spectrum sufficient to 
account for Doppler frequency shift in the Future Spectrum.
    (2) The System 2 licensee's priority to apply for and use the 
Supplemental Spectrum is conditioned on the System 2 licensee's 
compliance with the terms and conditions of its second processing round 
authorization, including, but not limited to, its system construction, 
launch and operation milestones, and any modifications thereto, and the 
Commission's Rules. The System 2 licensee's priority to apply for and 
use the Supplemental Spectrum shall automatically terminate upon the 
occurrence of any of the following events:
    (i) The System 2 licensee being permitted to operate in the 
Supplemental Spectrum;
    (ii) The expiration or revocation of the System 2 licensee's second 
processing round authorization;
    (iii) The discontinuance of use of the spectrum assigned to the 
System 2 licensee under its second processing round authorization; or
    (iv) The surrender of the System 2 licensee's second processing 
round authorization to the Commission.

parts 21, 74, 78, and 101 of this chapter have been reallocated for 
primary use by the Fixed-Satellite Service, subject to various 
provisions for the existing terrestrial licenses. In accordance with 
procedures specified in Secs. 101.85 through 101.97 of this chapter, 
Fixed-Satellite Service licensees are required to relocate the existing 
co-primary terrestrial licensees in these bands if interference to those 
operations would occur during the period that the terrestrial stations 
remain co-primary and the terrestrial antenna is pointing within 2 
degrees of the GSO satellite. Additionally, Fixed-Satellite Service 
operations are not entitled to protection from the co-primary operations 
until after that period has expired. (see Secs. 21.901(e), 74.502(c), 
74.602(g), 78.18(a)(4), and 101.147(r) of this chapter.
    (i) Protection of fixed services receivers in the 18.3-19.3 GHz 
band. For purposes of this section, FSS space stations operating in 
accordance with the power flux-density limits of Sec. 25.208 are 
considered not to cause unacceptable interference to fixed service 
receivers that are pointed more than 2 degrees from the FSS space 
station.
    (1) 18.3-18.58 GHz. FSS space stations transmitting in the 18.3-
18.58 GHz band may not cause unacceptable interference to fixed service 
receive stations that were licensed or for which an application was 
pending prior to June 8, 2000.
    (2) 18.58-18.8 GHz. FSS space stations transmitting in the 18.58-
18.8 GHz band may not cause unacceptable interference to fixed service 
receive stations that were licensed or for which an application was 
pending prior to September 18, 1998. After June 8, 2010, such fixed 
station receivers are no longer afforded protection from FSS space 
stations operating in accordance with Sec. 25.208 and the fixed station 
transmitters shall not cause harmful interference to the GSO FSS 
receiving earth stations.
    (3) 18.8-19.3 GHz. FSS space stations transmitting in the 18.8-19.3 
GHz band may not cause unacceptable interference to fixed service 
receive stations that were licensed or for which an application was 
pending prior to June 8, 2000. After June 8, 2010, such fixed station 
receivers (except those operating in 19.26-19.3 GHz) are no longer 
afforded protection from FSS space stations operating in accordance with 
Sec. 25.208.

interference, an appropriately scaled plot of the elevation of the local 
horizon as a function of azimuth, and the electrical characteristics of 
the earth station antenna(s), shall be submitted by the applicant in a 
single exhibit to the application. The coordination distance contour 
plot(s), horizon elevation plot, and antenna horizon gain plot(s) 
required by this section may also be submitted in tabular numerical 
format at 5 deg. azimuthal increments instead of graphical format. At a 
minimum, this exhibit shall include the information listed in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section. An earth station applicant shall also include in 
the application relevant technical details (both theoretical 
calculations and/or actual measurements) of any special techniques, such 
as the use of artificial site shielding, or operating procedures or 
restrictions at the proposed earth station which are to be employed to 
reduce the likelihood of interference, or of any particular 
characteristics of the earth station site which could have an effect on 
the calculation of the coordination distance.
    (c) Prior to the filing of his application, an earth station 
applicant shall coordinate the proposed frequency usage with existing 
terrestrial users and with applicants for terrestrial station 
authorizations with previously filed applications in accordance with the 
following procedure:
    (1) An applicant for an earth station authorization shall perform an 
interference analysis in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
Sec. 25.255 for each terrestrial station, for which a license or 
construction permit has been granted or for which an application has 
been accepted for filing, which is or is to be operated in a shared 
frequency band to be used by the proposed earth station and which is 
located within the great circle coordination distance contour(s) of the 
proposed earth station.
    (2) The earth station applicant shall provide each such terrestrial 
station licensee, permittee, and prior filed applicant with the 
technical details of the proposed earth station and the relevant 
interference analyses that were made. At a minimum, the earth station 
applicant shall provide the terrestrial user with the following 
technical information:
    (i) The geographical coordinates of the proposed earth station 
antenna(s),

[[Page 325]]

    (ii) Proposed operating frequency band(s) and emission(s),
    (iii) Antenna center height above ground and ground elevation above 
mean sea level,
    (iv) Antenna gain pattern(s) in the plane of the main beam,
    (v) Longitude range of geostationary satellites at which antenna may 
be pointed,
    (vi) Horizon elevation plot,
    (vii) Antenna horizon gain plot(s) determined in accordance with 
Sec. 25.253(b) for satellite longitude range specified in paragraph 
(c)(2)(v) of this section, taking into account the provisions of 
Sec. 25.253(a)(2) for earth stations operating with non-geostationary 
satellites.
    (viii) Minimum elevation angle,
    (ix) Maximum effective isotropically radiated power (EIRP) in any 4 
kHz band in the main beam, (dBW/4 kHz),
    (x) Maximum available RF transmit power in any 1 MHz band and in any 
4 kHz band at the input terminals of the antenna(s),
    (xi) Maximum permissible RF interference power level as determined 
in accordance with Sec. 25.252 for all applicable percentages of time, 
and
    (xii) A plot of great circle coordination distance contour(s) and 
rain scatter coordination distance contour(s) as determined by 
Secs. 25.253 and 25.254.
    (3) The coordination procedure specified in Sec. 101.103(d) of this 
chapter shall be applicable except that the information to be provided 
shall be that set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and that 
the 30-day period allowed for response to a request for coordination may 
be increased to a maximum of 45 days by mutual consent of the parties.
    (4) Where technical problems are resolved by an agreement or 
operating arrangement between the parties that would require special 
procedures be taken to reduce the likelihood of harmful interference 
(such as the use of artificial site shielding) or would result in 
lessened quality or capacity of either system, the details thereof shall 
be contained in the application.
    (5) The Commission may, in the course of examining any application, 
require the submission of additional showings, complete with pertinent 
data and calculations in accordance with Sec. Sec. 251.251 through 
25.256, showing that harmful interference is not likely to result from 
the proposed operation.
    (d) An applicant for an earth station authorization shall also 
ascertain whether the great circle coordination distance contours and 
rain scatter coordination distance contours, computed for those values 
of parameters indicated in table 1 of Sec. 25.252 for international 
coordination, cross the boundaries of another administration. In this 
case, the applicant shall furnish the Commission copies of these 
contours on maps drawn to appropriate scale for use by the Commission in 
effecting coordination of the proposed earth station with the 
administration(s) affected.
    (e) Protection for Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone, Boulder 
County, Colorado.
    (1) Applicants for a station authorization to operate in the 
vicinity of Boulder County, Colorado under this part are advised to give 
due consideration, prior to filing applications, to the need to protect 
the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone from harmful interference. These 
are the research laboratories of the Department of Commerce, Boulder 
County, Colorado. To prevent degradation of the present ambient radio 
signal level at the site, the Department of Commerce seeks to ensure 
that the field strengths of any radiated signals (excluding reflected 
signals) received on this 1800 acre site (in the vicinity of coordinates 
40 deg. 07' 50" N Latitude, 105 deg. 14' 40" W Longitude) resulting from 
new assignments (other than mobile stations) or from the modification or 
relocation of existing facilities do not exceed the following values:

\1\ Equivalent values of power flux density are calculated assuming free
  space characteristic impedance of 376.7=120<greek-p> ohms.

[[Page 326]]

 
\2\ Space stations shall conform to the power flux density limits at the
  earth's surface specified in appropriate parts of the FCC rules, but
  in no case should exceed the above levels in any 4 kHz band for all
  angles of arrival.

    (2) Advance consultation is recommended particularly for those 
applicants who have no reliable data which indicates whether the field 
strength or power flux density figures in the above table would be 
exceeded by their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In 
such instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining 
whether coordination is recommended:
    (i) All stations within 2.5 kilometers;
    (ii) Stations within 5 kilometers with 50 watts or more average 
effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of polarization in 
the azimuthal direction of the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone;
    (iii) Stations within 15 kilometers with 1 kW or more average ERP in 
the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of Table 
Mountain Receiving Zone;
    (iv) Stations within 80 kilometers with 25 kW or more average ERP in 
the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of Table 
Mountain Receiving Zone.
    (3) Applicants concerned are urged to communicate with the Radio 
Frequency Management Coordinator, Department of Commerce, Research 
Support Services, NOAA R/E5X2, Boulder Laboratories, Boulder, CO 80303; 
telephone (303) 497-6548, in advance of filing their applications with 
the Commission.
    (4) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised 
that such consultation can avoid objections from the Department of 
Commerce or proceedings to modify any authorization which may be granted 
which, in fact, delivers a signal at the site in excess of the field 
strength specified herein.
    (f) Notification to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory: In 
order to minimize possible harmful interference at the National Radio 
Astronomy Observatory site located at Green Bank, Pocahontas County, W. 
Va., and at the Naval Radio Research Observatory site at Sugar Grove, 
Pendleton County, W. Va. any applicant for a station authorization other 
than mobile, temporary base, temporary fixed, Personal Radio, Civil Air 
Patrol, or amateur seeking a station license for a new station, a 
construction permit to construct a new station or to modify an existing 
station license in a manner which would change either the frequency, 
power, antenna height or directivity, or location of such a station 
within the area bounded by 39 deg.15' N. on the north, 78 deg.30' W. on 
the east, 37 deg.30' N. on the south and 80 deg.30' W. on the west 
shall, at the time of filing such application with the Commission, 
simultaneously notify the Director, National Radio Astronomy 
Observatory, P.O. Box No. 2, Green Bank, W. Va. 24944, in writing, of 
the technical particulars of the proposed station. Such notification 
shall include the geographical coordinates of the antenna, antenna 
height, antenna directivity if any, proposed frequency, type of 
emission, and power. In addition, the applicant shall indicate in his 
application to the Commission the date notification was made to the 
observatory. After receipt of such applications, the Commission will 
allow a period of 20 days for comments or objections in response to the 
notifications indicated. If an objection to the proposed operation is 
received during the 20-day period from the National Radio Astronomy 
Observatory for itself or on behalf of the Naval Radio Research 
Observatory, the Commission will consider all aspects of the problem and 
take whatever action is deemed appropriate.
    (g) Protection for Federal Communications Commission monitoring 
stations:
    (1) Applicants in the vicinity of an FCC monitoring station for a 
radio station authorization to operate new transmitting facilities or 
changed transmitting facilities which would increase the field strength 
produced over the monitoring station over that previously authorized are 
advised to give consideration, prior to filing applications, to the 
possible need to protect the FCC stations from harmful interference. 
Geographical coordinates of the facilities which require protection are 
listed in Sec. 0.121(c) of the Commission's Rules. Applications for 
stations (except mobile stations) which will

[[Page 327]]

produce on any frequency a direct wave fundamental field strength of 
greater than 10 mV/m in the authorized bandwidth of service (-65.8 dBW/
m<SUP>2</SUP> power flux density assuming a free space characteristic 
impedance of 120 ohms) at the referenced coordinates, may be examined to 
determine extent of possible interference. Depending on the theoretical 
field strength value and existing root-sum-square or other ambient radio 
field signal levels at the indicated coordinates, a clause protecting 
the monitoring station may be added to the station authorization.
    (2) In the event that calculated value of expected field exceeds 10 
mV/m (-65.8 dBW/m<SUP>2</SUP>) at the reference coordinates, or if there 
is any question whether field strength levels might exceed the threshold 
value, advance consultation with the FCC to discuss any protection 
necessary should be considered. Prospective applicants may communicate 
with: Chief, Compliance and Information Bureau, Federal Communications 
Commission, Washington, DC 20554, Telephone (202) 632-6980.
    (3) Advance consultation is suggested particularly for those 
applicants who have no reliable data which indicates whether the field 
strength or power flux density figure indicated would be exceeded by 
their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In such 
instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining whether an 
applicant should coordinate:
    (i) All stations within 2.5 kilometers;
    (ii) Stations within 5 kilometers with 50 watts or more average 
effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of polarization in 
the azimuthal direction of the Monitoring Station;
    (iii) Stations within 15 kilometers with 1 kW or more average ERP in 
the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the 
Monitoring Station;
    (iv) Stations within 80 kilometers with 25 kW or more average ERP in 
the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the 
Monitoring Station.
    (4) Advance coordination for stations operating above 1000 MHz is 
recommended only where the proposed station is in the vicinity of a 
monitoring station designated as a satellite monitoring facility in 
Sec. 0.121(c) of the Commission's Rules and also meets the criteria 
outlined in paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section.
    (5) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised 
that such consultation can avoid objections from the Federal 
Communications Commission or modification of any authorization which 
will cause harmful interference.
    (h) Sites and frequencies for GSO and NGSO earth stations, operating 
in a frequency band where both have a co-primary allocation, shall be 
selected to avoid earth station antenna mainlobe-to-satellite antenna 
mainlobe coupling, between NGSO systems and between NGSO and GSO 
systems, in order to minimize the possibility of harmful interference 
between these services. Prior to filing an earth station application, in 
bands with co-primary allocations to NGSO and GSO earth stations, the 
applicant shall coordinate the proposed site and frequency usage with 
existing earth station licensees and with current earth station 
authorization applicants.
    (i) Any applicant for a new permanent transmitting fixed earth 
station authorization to be located on the islands of Puerto Rico, 
Desecheo, Mona, Vieques, and Culebra, or for a modification of an 
existing authorization which would change the frequency, power, antenna 
height, directivity, or location of such station on these islands and 
would increase the likelihood of the authorized facility causing 
interference, shall notify the Interference Office, Arecibo Observatory, 
Post Office Box 995, Arecibo, Puerto Rico 00613, in writing or 
electronically, of the technical parameters of the proposal. Applicants 
may wish to consult interference guidelines, which will be provided by 
Cornell University. Applicants who choose to transmit information 
electronically should e-mail to: prcz@naic.edu
    (1) The notification to the Interference Office, Arecibo Observatory

[[Page 328]]

shall be made prior to, or simultaneously with, the filing of the 
application with the Commission. The notification shall state the 
geographical coordinates of the antenna (NAD-83 datum), antenna height 
above ground, ground elevation at the antenna, antenna directivity and 
gain, proposed frequency and FCC Rule Part, type of emission, effective 
radiated power, and whether the proposed use is itinerant. Generally, 
submission of the information in the technical portion of the FCC 
license application is adequate notification. In addition, the applicant 
shall indicate in its application to the Commission the date 
notification was made to the Arecibo Observatory.
    (2) After receipt of such applications, the Commission will allow 
the Arecibo Observatory a period of 20 days for comments or objections 
in response to the notification indicated. The applicant will be 
required to make reasonable efforts in order to resolve or mitigate any 
potential interference problem with the Arecibo Observatory and to file 
either an amendment to the application or a modification application, as 
appropriate. If the Commission determines that an applicant has 
satisfied its responsibility to make reasonable efforts to protect the 
Observatory from interference, its application may be granted.

Sec. 25.204  Power limits.

    (a) In bands shared coequally with terrestrial radio communication 
services, the equivalent isotropically radiated power transmitted in any 
direction towards the horizon by an earth station operating in frequency 
bands between 1 and 15 GHz, shall not exceed the following limits except 
as provided for in paragraph (c) of this section:

+40 dBW in any 4 KHz band for <greek-th<INF>:</INF>0 deg.
+40+3 <greek-th dBW in any 4 KHz band for 
<greek-th0 deg.<ls-thn-eq>05 deg.


where <greek-th is the angle of elevation of the horizon viewed from the 
center of radiation of the antenna of the earth station and measured in 
degrees as positive above the horizontal plane and negative below it.
    (b) In bands shared coequally with terrestrial radio-communication 
services, the equivalent isotropically radiated power transmitted in any 
direction towards the horizon by an earth station operating in frequency 
bands above 15 GHz shall not exceed the following limits except as 
provided for in paragraph (c) of this section:

+64 dBW in any 1 MHz band for <greek-th0 deg.
+64+3 <greek-th dBW in any 1 MHz band for 0 deg.<<greek-a><5 deg.


where <greek-th is as defined in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) For angles of elevation of the horizon greater than 5 deg. there 
shall be no restriction as to the equivalent

[[Page 329]]

isotropically radiated power transmitted by an earth station towards the 
horizon.
    (d) Notwithstanding the e.i.r.p. and e.i.r.p. density limits 
specified in the station authorization, each earth station transmission 
shall be conducted at the lowest power level that will provide the 
required signal quality as indicated in the application and further 
amended by coordination agreements.
    (e) For operations at frequencies above 10 GHz, earth station 
operators may exceed the uplink e.i.r.p. and e.i.r.p. density limits 
specified in the station authorization under the conditions of uplink 
fading due to precipitation by an amount not to exceed 1 dB above the 
actual amount of monitored excess attenuation over clear sky propagation 
conditions. The e.i.r.p. levels shall be returned to normal as soon as 
the attenuating weather pattern subsides. The maximum power level for 
power control purposes shall be coordinated between and among adjacent 
satellite operators.
    (f) The e.i.r.p. of any emission from an earth station operating in 
the frequency band 13.75-14.0 GHz shall be at least 68 dBW and shall not 
exceed 85 dBW, with a minimum antenna diameter of 4.5 meters; except in 
the frequency band 13.772-13.778 GHz, where the e.i.r.p. shall be at 
least 68 dBW and shall not exceed 71 dBW per 6 MHz, with a minimum 
antenna diameter of 4.5 meters. Automatic power control may be used to 
increase the e.i.r.p. density above 71 dBW per 6 MHz to compensate for 
rain attenuation to the extent that the power flux density at the fixed-
satellite space station does not exceed the value resulting from use of 
71 dBW per 6 MHz e.i.r.p. in clear sky conditions.
    (g) All earth stations in the Fixed Satellite Service in the 20/30 
GHz band shall employ uplink adaptive power control or other methods of 
fade compensation such that the earth station transmissions shall be 
conducted at the power level required to meet the desired link 
performance while reducing the level of mutual interference between 
networks.

Sec. 25.205  Minimum angle of antenna elevation.

    Earth station antennas shall not normally be authorized for 
transmission at angles less than 5 deg. measured from the horizontal 
plane to the direction of maximum radiation. However, upon a showing 
that the transmission path will be seaward and away from land masses or 
upon special showing of need for lower angles by the applicant, the 
Commission will consider authorizing transmissions at angles between 
3 deg. and 5 deg. in the pertinent directions. In certain instances, it 
may be necessary to specify minimum angles greater than 5 deg. because 
of interference considerations.

Sec. 25.209  Antenna performance standards.

    (a) The gain of any antenna to be employed in transmission from an 
earth station in the fixed-satellite service shall lie below the 
envelope defined below:
    (1) In the plane of the geostationary satellite orbit as it appears 
at the particular earth station location:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC13NO91.008


where Theta is the angle in degrees from the axis of the main lobe, and 
dBi refers to dB relative to an isotropic radiator. For the purposes of 
this section, the peak gain of an individual sidelobe may not exceed the 
envelope defined above for Theta between 1.0 and 7.0 degrees. For Theta 
greater than 7.0 degrees, the envelope may be exceeded by no more than 
10% of the sidelobes, provided no individual sidelobe exceeds the gain 
envelope given above by more than 3 dB.
    (2) In all other directions, or in the plane of the horizon 
including any out-of-plane potential terrestrial interference paths:
    Outside the main beam, the gain of the antenna shall lie below the 
envelope defined by:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC13NO91.009


where Theta and dBi are defined above. For the purposes of this section, 
the envelope may be exceeded by no more than 10% of the sidelobes 
provided no individual sidelobe exceeds the gain envelope given above by 
more than 6 dB. The region of the main reflector spillover energy is to 
be interpreted as a single lobe and shall not exceed the envelope by 
more than 6 dB.
    (b) The off-axis cross-polarization gain of any antenna to be 
employed in transmission from an earth station to a space station in the 
domestic fixed-satellite service shall be defined by:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC13NO91.010

    (c) Earth station antennas licensed for reception of radio 
transmissions from a space station in the fixed-satellite service are 
protected from radio interference caused by other space stations only to 
the degree to which harmful interference would not be expected to be 
caused to an earth station employing an antenna conforming to the 
referenced patterns defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, 
and protected from radio interference caused by terrestrial radio 
transmitters identified by the frequency coordination process only to 
the degree to which harmful interference would not be expected to be 
caused to an earth station conforming to the reference pattern defined 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (d) The patterns specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
shall apply to all new earth station antennas initially authorized after 
February 15, 1985 and shall apply to all earth station antennas after 
March 11, 1994.
    (e) The operations of any earth station with an antenna not 
conforming to the standards of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
shall impose no limitations upon the operation, location or design of 
any terrestrial station, any other earth station, or any space station 
beyond those limitations that would be expected to be imposed by an 
earth station employing an antenna conforming to the reference patterns 
defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (f) An earth station with an antenna not conforming to the standards 
of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will be routinely authorized 
after February 15, 1985 upon a finding by the Commission that 
unacceptable levels of interference will not be caused under conditions 
of uniform 2 deg. orbital spacings. An earth station antenna initially 
authorized on or before Feburary

[[Page 332]]

15, 1985 will be authorized by the Commission to continue to operate as 
long as such operations are found not to cause any unacceptable levels 
of adjacent satellite interference. In either case, the Commission will 
impose appropriate terms and conditions in its authorization of such 
facilities and operations.
    (g) The antenna performance standards of small antennas operating in 
the 12/14 GHz band with diameters as small as 1.2 meters starts at 
1.25 deg. instead of 1 deg. as stipulated in paragraph (a) of this 
section.

domestic service in the 4/6 GHz frequency band shall:
    (1) Use orthogonal linear polarization with one of the planes 
defined by the equatorial plane;
    (2) Be designed so that the polarization sense of uplink 
transmissions is opposite to that of downlink transmissions on the same 
transponder; and
    (3) Shall be capable of switching polarization sense upon ground 
command.
    (b) All space stations in the Fixed-Satellite Service in the 20/30 
GHz band shall use either orthogonal linear or orthogonal circular 
polarization. Those space stations utilizing orthogonal linear 
polarization shall also comply with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) All space stations in the Fixed-Satellite Service shall have a 
minimum capability to change transponder saturation flux densities by 
ground command in 4 dB steps over a range of 12 dB.
    (d) All space stations in the Fixed Satellite Service in the 20/30 
GHz band shall employ state-of-the-art full frequency reuse either 
through the use of orthogonal polarizations within the same beam and/or 
through the use of spatially independent beams.
    (e) All space stations in the Fixed-Satellite Service shall be 
designed to derive the maximum capacity feasible from the assigned 
orbital location. In particular, space stations in the Fixed-Satellite 
Service are required to employ state-of-the-art full frequency re-use 
using both horizontal and vertical polarization.
    (f) For fixed-satellite space stations providing domestic service, 
full frequency re-use is defined as re-use of the frequency bands by 
polarization discrimination in both the uplink and downlink directions 
using state-of-the-art equipment and techniques.
    (g) For fixed-satellite space stations providing international 
service, full frequency re-use is defined as follows:
    (1) Satellites must employ polarization discrimination so that, 
through the use of dual polarization, they shall be able to reuse both 
the uplink and downlink frequency band assignments.
    (2) Satellites must be configured so that all assigned frequencies 
(in both polarizations) could be reused in beams serving widely separate 
areas.
    (h)  [Reserved]
    (i) Space station antennas in the Fixed-Satellite Service must be 
designed to provide a cross-polarization isolation such that the ratio 
of the on axis co-polar gain to the cross-polar gain of the antenna in 
the assigned frequency band shall be at least 30 dB within its primary 
coverage area.
    (j) Space stations to be operated in the geostationary satellite 
orbit must be:
    (1) Designed with the capability of being maintained in orbit within 
0.05 deg. of their assigned orbital longitude,
    (2) Maintained in orbit at their assigned orbital longitude within 
the longitudinal tolerance specified by the Commission, and
    (3) The Commission may authorize operations at assigned orbital 
longitudes offset by 0.05 deg. or multiples thereof from the nominal 
orbital location specified in the station authorizations.
    (k) Antenna measurements of both co-polarized and cross-polarized 
performance must be made on all antennas employed by space stations both 
within the primary coverage area to facilitate coordination with other 
Commission space station licensees and outside the primary coverage area 
to facilitate international frequency coordination with other 
Administrations.

[[Page 333]]

The results of such measurements shall be submitted to the Commission 
within thirty days after preliminary in-orbit testing is completed.
    (l) All operators of space stations shall, on June 30 of each year, 
file a report with the International Bureau and the Commission's 
Columbia Operations Center in Columbia, Maryland, containing the 
following information current as of May 31 of that year:
    (1) Status of satellite construction and anticipated launch dates, 
including any major problems or delays encountered;
    (2) A listing of any non-scheduled transponder outages for more than 
thirty minutes and the cause(s) of such outages;
    (3) A detailed description of the utilization made of each 
transponder on each of the in-orbit satellites. This description should 
identify the total capacity or the percentage of time each transponder 
is actually used for transmission, and the amount of unused system 
capacity in the transponder. This information is not required for those 
transponders that are sold on a non-common carrier basis. In that case, 
operators should indicate the number of transponders sold on each in-
satellite orbit.
    (4) Identification of any transponders not available for service or 
otherwise not performing to specifications, the cause of these 
difficulties, and the date any transponder was taken out of service or 
the malfunction identified.

Sec. 25.211  Video transmissions in the Fixed-Satellite Service.

    (a) Downlink analog video transmissions in the band 3700-4200 MHz 
shall be transmitted only on a center frequency of 3700+20N MHz, where 
N=1 to 24. The corresponding uplink frequency shall be 2225 MHz higher.
    (b) All 4/6 GHz analog video transmissions shall contain an energy 
dispersal signal at all times with a minimum peak-to-peak bandwidth set 
at whatever value is necessary to meet the power flux density limits 
specified in Sec. 25.208(a) and successfully coordinated internationally 
and accepted by adjacent U.S. satellite operators based on the use of 
state of the art space and earth station facilities. Further, all 
transmissions operating in frequency bands described in Sec. 25.208 (b) 
and (c) shall also contain an energy dispersal signal at all times with 
a minimum peak-to-peak bandwidth set at whatever value is necessary to 
meet the power flux density limits specified in Sec. 25.208(b) and (c) 
and successfully coordinated internationally and accepted by adjacent 
U.S. satellite operators based on the use of state of the art space and 
earth station facilities. The transmission of an unmodulated carrier at 
a power level sufficient to saturate a transponder is prohibited, except 
by the space station licensee to determine transponder performance 
characteristics. All 12/14 GHz video transmissions for TV/FM shall 
identify the particular carrier frequencies for necessary coordination 
with adjacent U.S. satellite systems and affected satellite systems of 
other administrations.
    (c) All initial analog video transmissions shall be preceded by a 
video test transmission at an uplink e.i.r.p. at least 10 dB below the 
normal operating level. The earth station operator shall not increase 
power until receiving notification from the satellite network control 
center that the frequency and polarization alignment are satisfactory 
pursuant to the procedures specified in Sec. 25.272. The stationary 
earth station operator that has successfully transmitted an initial 
video test signal to a satellite pursuant to this paragraph is not 
required to make subsequent video test transmissions if subsequent 
transmissions are conducted using exactly the same parameters as the 
initial transmission.
    (d) In the 6 GHz band, an earth station with an equivalent diameter 
of 9 meters or smaller may be routinely licensed for transmission to 
full transponder services if the maximum power into the antenna does not 
exceed 450 watts (26.5 dBW). In the 14 GHz band, an earth station with 
an equivalent diameter of 5 meters or smaller may be routinely licensed 
for transmission of

full transponder services if the maximum power into the antenna does not 
exceed 500 watts (27 dBW).

    (a) Except as otherwise provided by this part, criteria for 
unacceptable levels of interference caused by other satellite networks 
shall be established on the basis of nominal operating conditions and 
with the objective of minimizing orbital separations between satellites.
    (b) Emissions with an occupied bandwidth of less than 2 MHz are not 
protected from interference from wider bandwidth transmissions if the 
r.f. carrier frequency of the narrowband signal is within <plus-minus>1 
MHz of one of the frequencies specified in Sec. 25.211(a).
    (c) In the 14 GHz band, an earth station with an equivalent diameter 
of 1.2 meters or greater may be routinely licensed for transmission of 
narrowband analog services with bandwidths up to 200 kHz if the maximum 
input power density into the antenna does not exceed -8 dBW/4 kHz and 
the maximum transmitted satellite carrier EIRP density does not exceed 
13 dBW/4 kHz, and for transmission of narrowband and/or wideband digital 
services, if the maximum input power density into the antenna does not 
exceed -14 dBW/4 kHz and the maximum transmitted satellite carrier EIRP 
density does not exceed +6.0 dBW/4 kHz.
    (d) In the 6 GHz band, an earth station with an equivalent diameter 
of 4.5 meters or greater may be routinely licensed for transmission of 
SCPC services if the maximum power densities into the antenna do not

MHz band against interference from 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile-Satellite Service 
systems.
    (1) Protection zones. All 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile Satellite Service 
systems shall be capable of determining the position of the user 
transceivers accessing the space segment through either internal 
radiodetermination calculations or external sources such as LORAN-C or 
the Global Positioning System. During periods of radio astronomy 
observations, land mobile earth stations shall not operate when located 
within geographic protection zones defined by the radio observatory 
coordinates and separation distances as follows:
    (i) In the band 1610.6-1613.8 MHz, within a 160 km radius of the

    (iii) Out-of-band emissions of a mobile earth station licensed to 
operate within the 1610.0-1626.5 MHz band shall be attenuated so that 
the power flux density it produces in the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz band at any 
radio astronomy site listed in paragraph (a)(1) (i) or (ii) of this 
section shall not exceed the emissions of a mobile earth station 
operating within the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz band

[[Page 335]]

at the edge of the protection zone applicable for that site. As an 
alternative, a mobile earth station shall not operate during radio 
astronomy observations within the 1613.8-1615.8 MHz band within 100 km 
of the radio astronomy sites listed in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this 
section, and within 30 km of the sites listed in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of 
this section, there being no restriction on a mobile earth station 
operating within the 1615.8-1626.5 MHz band.
    (iv) For airborne mobile earth stations operating in the 1610.0-
1626.5 MHz band, the separation distance shall be the larger of the 
distances specified in paragraph (a)(1) (i), (ii) or (iii) of this 
section, as applicable, or the distance, d, as given by the formula:

  d (km) = 4.1 square root of (h)

where h is the altitude of the aircraft in meters above ground level.
    (v) Smaller geographic protection zones may be used in lieu of the 
areas specified in paragraphs (a)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this 
section if agreed to by the Mobile-Satellite Service licensee and the 
Electromagnetic Spectrum Management Unit (ESMU), National Science 
Foundation, Washington, D.C. upon a showing by the Mobile-Satellite 
Service licensee that the operation of a mobile earth station will not 
cause harmful interference to a radio astronomy observatory during 
periods of observation.
    (vi) The ESMU shall notify Mobile-Satellite Service space station 
licensees authorized to operate mobile earth terminals in the 1610.0-
1626.5 MHz band of periods of radio astronomy observations. The mobile-
satellite systems shall be capable of terminating operations within the 
frequency bands and protection zones specified in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) 
through (iv) of this section, as applicable, after the first position 
fix of the mobile earth terminal either prior to transmission or, based 
upon its location within the protection zone at the time of initial 
transmission of the mobile earth terminal. Once the mobile-satellite 
system determines that a mobile earth terminal is located within an RAS 
protection zone, the mobile-satellite system shall immediately initiate 
procedures to relocate the mobile earth terminal operations to a non-RAS 
frequency.
    (vii) A beacon-actuated protection zone may be used in lieu of fixed 
protection zones in the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz band if a coordination 
agreement is reached between a mobile-satellite system licensee and the 
ESMU on the specifics of beacon operations.
    (viii) Additional radio astronomy sites, not located within 100 
miles of the 100 most populous urbanized areas as defined by the United 
States Census Bureau at the time, may be afforded similar protection one 
year after notice to the mobile-satellite system licensees by issuance 
of a public notice by the Commission.
    (2) Mobile-Satellite Service space stations transmitting in the 
1613.8-1626.5 MHz band shall take whatever steps necessary to avoid 
causing harmful interference to the radio astronomy facilities listed in 
paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section during periods of 
observation.
    (3) Mobile-Satellite Service space stations operating in the 2483.5-
2500 MHz frequency band shall limit spurious emission levels in the 
4990-5000 MHz band so as not to exceed -241 dB (W/m<SUP>2</SUP>/Hz) at 
the surface of the Earth.
    (4) The Radioastronomy Service shall avoid scheduling radio 
astronomy observations during peak MSS/RDSS traffic periods to the 
greatest extent practicable.
    (b) Protection of the radionavigation-satellite service. Mobile 
earth stations operating in the 1610-1626.5 MHz band shall limit out-of-
band emissions in the 1574.397-1576.443 MHz band so as not to exceed an 
e.i.r.p. density level of -70 dB (W/MHz) averaged over any 20 ms period. 
The e.i.r.p. of any discrete spurious emission (i.e., bandwidth less 
than 600 Hz) in the 1574.397-1576.443 MHz band shall not exceed -80 dBW.

    (a) Definitions.
    (1) Allocated bandwidth. The term ``allocated bandwidth'' refers to 
the entry in the Table of Frequency Allocations

[[Page 336]]

of a given frequency band for the purpose of its use by one or more 
terrestrial or space radiocommunication services under specified 
conditions. This term shall be applied to the 2310-2360 MHz band for 
satellite DARS.
    (2) Frequency Assignment. The term ``frequency assignment'' refers 
to the authorization given by the Commission for a radio station to use 
a radio frequency or radio frequency channel under specified conditions. 
This term shall be applied to the two frequency bands (A) 2320.0-2332.5 
MHz and (B) 2332.5-2340.0 MHz for satellite DARS.
    (b) Each system authorized under this section will be conditioned 
upon construction, launch and operation milestones as outlined in 
Sec. 25.144(b). The failure to meet any of the milestones contained in 
an authorization will result in its cancellation, unless such failure is 
due to circumstances beyond the licensee's control or unless otherwise 
determined by the Commission upon proper showing by the licensee in any 
particular case.
    (c) Frequency assignments will be made for each satellite DARS 
system as follows:
    (1) Exclusive satellite DARS licenses are limited to the 2320-2345 
MHz band segment of the allocated bandwidth for satellite DARS;
    (2) Two, 12.5 MHz frequency assignments are available for satellite 
DARS: 2320.0-2332.5 MHz and 2332.5-2345.0 MHz;
    (3) Satellite DARS licensees may reduce their assigned bandwidth 
occupancy to provide telemetry beacons in their exclusive frequency 
assignments;
    (4) Each licensee may employ cross polarization within its exclusive 
frequency assignment and/or may employ cross polarized transmissions in 
frequency assignments of other satellite DARS licensees under mutual 
agreement with those licensees. Licensees who come to mutual agreement 
to use cross-polarized transmissions shall apply to the Commission for 
approval of the agreement before coordination is initiated with other 
administrations by the licensee of the exclusive frequency assignment; 
and
    (5) Feeder uplink networks are permitted in the following Fixed-
Satellite Service frequency bands: 7025-7075 MHz and 6725-7025 MHz 
(101 deg. W.L. orbital location only).

Sec. 25.259  Time sharing between NOAA meteorological satellite systems and non-voice, non-geostationary satellite systems in the 137-138 MHz band.

    (a) A non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service system 
licensee (``NVNG licensee'') time-sharing spectrum in the 137-138 MHz 
frequency band shall not transmit signals into the ``protection areas'' 
of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

[[Page 338]]

(``NOAA'') satellite systems. When calculating the protection areas for 
a NOAA satellite in the 137.333-137.367 MHz, 137.485-137.515 MHz, 
137.605-137.635 MHz and 137.753-137.787 MHz bands, a NVNG licensee shall 
use an earth station elevation angle of five degrees towards the NOAA 
satellite and will cease its transmissions prior to the NVNG licensee's 
service area, based on an elevation angle of zero degrees towards the 
NVNG licensee's satellite, overlapping the NOAA protection area. When 
calculating the protection areas for a NOAA satellite in the 137.025-
137.175 MHz and 137.825-138 MHz bands, a NVNG licensee shall use an 
earth station elevation angle of zero degrees, or less if reasonably 
necessary, towards the NOAA satellite and will cease its transmissions 
prior to the NVNG licensee's service area, based on an elevation angle 
of zero degrees towards the NVNG licensee's satellite, overlapping the 
NOAA protection area. A NVNG licensee is responsible for obtaining the 
necessary ephemeris data. This information shall be updated system-wide 
on at least a weekly basis. A NVNG licensee shall use an orbital 
propagator algorithm with an accuracy equal to or greater than the NORAD 
propagator used by NOAA.
    (b) A NVNG licensee time sharing spectrum in the 137-138 MHz band 
shall establish a 24-hour per day contact person and telephone number so 
that claims of harmful interference into NOAA earth station users and 
other operational issues can be reported and resolved expeditiously. 
This contact information shall be made available to NOAA or its 
designee. If the National Telecommunications and Information 
Administration (``NTIA'') notifies the Commission that NOAA is receiving 
unacceptable interference from a NVNG licensee, the Commission will 
require such NVNG licensee to terminate its interfering operations 
immediately unless it demonstrates to the Commission's reasonable 
satisfaction, and that of NTIA, that it is not responsible for causing 
harmful interference into the worldwide NOAA system. A NVNG licensee 
assumes the risk of any liability or damage that it and its directors, 
officers, employees, affiliates, agents and subcontractors may incur or 
suffer in connection with an interruption of its non-voice, non-
geostationary mobile-satellite service, in whole or in part, arising 
from or relating to its compliance or noncompliance with the 
requirements of this paragraph (b). The Commission will not hesitate to 
impose sanctions on a NVNG licensee time-sharing spectrum in the 137-138 
MHz band with NOAA, including monetary forfeitures and license 
revocations, when appropriate.
    (c) Each satellite in a NVNG licensee's system time-sharing spectrum 
with NOAA in the 137-138 MHz band shall automatically turn off and cease 
satellite transmissions if, after 72 consecutive hours, no reset signal 
is received from the NVNG licensee's gateway earth station and verified 
by the satellite. All satellites in such NVNG licensee's system shall be 
capable of instantaneous shutdown on any sub-band upon command from such 
NVNG licensee's gateway earth station.

Sec. 25.260  Time sharing between DoD meteorological satellite systems and non-voice, non-geostationary satellite systems in the 400.15-401 MHz band.

    (a) A non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service system 
licensee (``NVNG licensee'') time-sharing spectrum in the 400.15-401.0 
MHz band shall not transmit signals into the ``protection areas'' of 
Department of Defense (``DoD''). When calculating the protection areas 
for a DoD satellite in the 400.15-401 MHz band, a NVNG licensee shall 
use an earth station elevation angle of five degrees towards the DoD 
satellite and will shut off its transmissions prior to the NVNG 
licensee's service area, based on an elevation angle of zero degrees 
towards the NVNG licensee's satellite, overlapping the DoD protection 
area. A NVNG licensee is responsible for obtaining the necessary 
ephemeris data. This information shall be updated system-wide at least 
once per week. A NVNG licensee shall use an orbital propagator algorithm 
with an accuracy equal to or greater than the NORAD propagator used by 
DoD.
    (b) A NVNG licensee time sharing spectrum in the 400.15-401 MHz band

[[Page 339]]

shall establish a 24-hour per day contact person and telephone number so 
that claims of harmful interference into DoD earth station users and 
other operational issues can be reported and resolved expeditiously. 
This contact information shall be made available to DoD or its designee. 
If the National Telecommunications and Information Administration 
(``NTIA'') notifies the Commission that DoD is receiving unacceptable 
interference from a NVNG licensee, the Commission will require such NVNG 
licensee to terminate its interfering operations immediately unless it 
demonstrates to the Commission's reasonable satisfaction, and that of 
NTIA, that it is not responsible for causing harmful interference into 
the worldwide DoD system. A NVNG licensee assumes the risk of any 
liability or damage that it and its directors, officers, employees, 
affiliates, agents and subcontractors may incur or suffer in connection 
with an interruption of its non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-
satellite service, in whole or in part, arising from or relating to its 
compliance or noncompliance with the requirements of this paragraph (b). 
The Commission will not hesitate to impose sanctions on a NVNG licensee 
time-sharing spectrum in the 400.15-401 MHz band with DoD, including 
monetary forfeitures and license revocations, when appropriate.
    (c) Each satellite in a NVNG licensee's system time-sharing spectrum 
with DoD in the 400.15-401 MHz band shall automatically turn off and 
cease satellite transmissions if, after 72 consecutive hours, no reset 
signal is received from the NVNG licensee's gateway earth station and 
verified by the satellite. All satellites in such NVNG licensee's system 
shall be capable of instantaneous shutdown on any sub-band upon command 
from such NVNG licensee's gateway earth station.
    (d) Initially, a NVNG licensee time-sharing spectrum with DoD in the 
400.15-401 MHz band shall be able to change the frequency on which its 
system satellites are operating within 125 minutes of receiving 
notification from a DoD required frequency change in the 400.15-401 MHz 
band. Thereafter, when a NVNG licensee constructs additional gateway 
earth stations located outside of North and South America, it shall use 
its best efforts to decrease to 90 minutes the time required to 
implement a DoD required frequency change. A NVNG licensee promptly 
shall notify the Commission and NTIA of any decrease in the time it 
requires to implement a DoD required frequency change.
    (e) Once a NVNG licensee time-sharing spectrum with DoD in the 
400.15-401 MHz band demonstrates to DoD that it is capable of 
implementing a DoD required frequency change within the time required 
under paragraph (d) of this section, thereafter, such NVNG licensee 
shall demonstrate its capability to implement a DoD required frequency 
change only once per year at the instruction of DoD. Such demonstrations 
shall occur during off-peak hours, as determined by the NVNG licensee, 
unless otherwise agreed by the NVNG licensee and DoD. Such NVNG licensee 
will coordinate with DoD in establishing a plan for such a 
demonstration. In the event that a NVNG licensee fails to demonstrate to 
DoD that it is capable of implementing a DoD required frequency change 
in accordance with a demonstration plan established by DoD and the NVNG 
licensee, upon the Commission's receipt of a written notification from 
NTIA describing such failure, the Commission shall impose additional 
conditions or requirements on the NVNG licensee's authorization as may 
be necessary to protect DoD operations in the 400.15-401 MHz downlink 
band until the Commission is notified by NTIA that the NVNG licensee has 
successfully demonstrated its ability to implement a DoD required 
frequency change. Such additional conditions or requirements may 
include, but are not limited to, requiring such NVNG licensee 
immediately to terminate its operations interfering with the DoD system.

Sec. 25.271  Control of transmitting stations.

    (a) The licensee of a facility licensed under this part is 
responsible for the proper operation and maintenance of the station.
    (b) The licensee of a transmitting earth station licensed under this 
part shall ensure that a trained operator is present on the earth 
station site, or at a designated remote control point for the earth 
station, at all times that transmissions are being conducted. No 
operator's license is required for a person to operate or perform 
maintenance on facilities authorized under this part.
    (c) Authority will be granted to operate a transmitting earth 
station by remote control only on the conditions that:
    (1) The parameters of the transmissions of the remote station 
monitored at the control point, and the operational functions of the 
remote earth stations that can be controlled by the operator at the 
control point, are sufficient to insure that the operations of the 
remote station(s) are at times in full compliance with the remote 
station authorization(s);
    (2) The earth station facilities are protected by appropriate 
security measures to prevent unauthorized entry or operations;
    (3) Upon detection by the license, or upon notification from the 
Commission of a deviation or upon notification by another licensee of 
harmful interference, the operation of the remote station shall be 
immediately suspended by the operator at the control point until the 
deviation or interference is corrected, except that transmissions 
concerning the immediate safety of life or property may be conducted for 
the duration of the emergency; and
    (4) The licensee shall have available at all times the technical 
personnel necessary to perform expeditiously the technical servicing and 
maintenance of the remote stations.
    (d) The licensee shall insure that the licensed facilities are 
properly secured against unauthorized access or use whenever an operator 
is not present at the transmitter.


<R05>
Sec. 25.272  General inter-system coordination procedures.

    (a) Each space station licensee in the Fixed-Satellite Service shall 
establish a satellite network control center which will have the 
responsibility to monitor space-to-Earth transmissions in its system. 
This would indirectly monitor uplink earth station transmissions in its 
system and to coordinate transmissions in its satellite system with 
those of other systems to prevent harmful interference incidents or, in 
the event of a harmful interference incident, to identify the source of 
the interference and correct the problem promptly.
    (b) Each space station licensee shall maintain on file with the 
Commission and with its Columbia Operations Center in Columbia, 
Maryland, a current listing of the names, titles, addresses and 
telephone numbers of the points of contact for resolution of 
interference problems. Contact personnel should include those 
responsible for resolution of short term, immediate interference 
problems at the system control center, and those responsible for long 
term engineering and technical design issues.
    (c) The transmitting earth station licensee shall provide the 
operator(s) of the satellites, on which the licensee is authorized to 
transmit, contact telephone numbers for the control center of the earth 
station and emergency telephone numbers for key personnel; a current 
file of these contacts shall be maintained at each satellite system

<R05>
Sec. 25.273  Duties regarding space communications transmissions.

    (a) No person shall:
    (1) Transmit to a satellite unless the specific transmission is 
first authorized by the satellite network control center;
    (2) Conduct transmissions over a transponder unless the operator is 
authorized by the satellite licensee or the satellite licensee's 
successor in interest to transmit at that time; or
    (3) Transmit in any manner that causes unacceptable interference to 
the authorized transmission of another licensee.
    (b) Satellite operators shall provide upon request by the Commission 
and by earth station licensees authorized to transmit on their 
satellites relevant information needed to avoid unacceptable 
interference to other users, including the polarization angles for 
proper illumination of a given transponder.
    (c) Space station licensees are responsible for maintaining complete 
and accurate technical details of current and planned transmissions over 
their satellites, and shall require that authorized users of 
transponders on their satellites, whether by tariff or contract, provide 
any necessary technical information in this regard including that 
required by Sec. 25.272. Based on this information, space station 
licensees shall exchange among themselves general technical information 
concerning current and planned transmission parameters as needed to 
identify and promptly resolve any potential cases of unacceptable 
interference between their satellite systems.
    (d) Space stations authorized after May 10, 1993 which do not 
satisfy the requirements of Sec. 25.210 may be required to accept 
greater constraints in resolving interference problems than complying 
ones. The extent of these constraints shall be determined on a case-by-
case basis.


<R05>
Sec. 25.274  Procedures to be followed in the event of harmful interference.

    (a) The earth station operator whose transmission is suffering 
harmful interference shall first check the earth station equipment to 
ensure that the equipment is functioning properly.
    (b) The earth station operator shall then check all other earth 
stations in the licensee's network that could be causing the harmful 
interference to ensure that none of the licensee's earth stations are 
the source of the interference and to verify that the source of 
interference is not from a local terrestrial source.
    (c) After the earth station operator has determined that the source 
of the interference is not another earth station operating in the same 
network or from a terrestrial source, the earth station operator shall 
contact the satellite system control center and advise the satellite 
operator of the problem. The control center operator shall observe the 
interference incident and make reasonable efforts to determine the 
source of the problem. A record shall be maintained by the control 
center operator and the earth station operator of all harmful 
interference incidents and their resolution. These records shall be made 
available to an FCC representative on request.
    (d) Where the suspected source of the interference incident is the 
operation of an earth station licensed to operate on one or more of the 
satellites in the satellite operator's system, the control center 
operator shall advise the offending earth station of the harmful 
interference incident and assist in the resolution of the problem where 
reasonably possible.
    (e) The earth station licensee whose operations are suspected of 
causing

[[Page 342]]

harmful interference to the operations of another earth station shall 
take reasonable measures to determine whether its operations are the 
source of the harmful interference problem. Where the operations of the 
suspect earth station are the source of the interference, the licensee 
of that earth station shall take all measures necessary to eliminate the 
interference.
    (f) At any point, the system control center operator may contact the 
Commission's Columbia Operations Center in Columbia, Maryland, to assist 
in resolving the matter. This office specializes in the resolution of 
satellite interference problems. All licensees are required to cooperate 
fully with the Commission in any investigation of interference problems.
    (g) Where the earth station suspected of causing interference to the 
operations of another earth station cannot be identified or is 
identified as an earth station operating on a satellite system other 
than the one on which the earth station suffering undue interference is 
operating, it is the responsibility of a representative of the earth 
station suffering harmful interference to contact the control center of 
other satellite systems.

authorization, the licensee is authorized to transmit any number of r.f. 
carriers on any discrete frequencies within an authorized frequency band 
in accordance with the other terms and conditions of the authorization 
and the requirements of this part. Specific r.f. carrier frequencies 
within the authorized frequency band shall be selected by the licensee 
to avoid unacceptable levels of interference being caused to other 
earth, space or terrestrial stations. Any coordination agreements, both 
domestic and international, concerning specific frequency usage 
constraints, including non-use of any particular frequencies within the 
frequency bands listed in the station authorization, are considered to 
be conditions of the station authorization.
    (c) A license for a transmitting earth station will normally specify 
only the r.f. carriers having the highest e.i.r.p. density, the 
narrowest bandwidth, and the largest bandwidth authorized for 
transmission from that station. Unless otherwise specified in the 
station authorization, the licensee is authorized to transmit any other 
type of carrier not specifically listed which does not exceed the 
highest e.i.r.p., e.i.r.p. density and bandwidth prescribed for any 
listed emission.
    (d) Only the most sensitive emission(s) for which protection is 
being afforded from interference in the authorized receive frequency 
band(s) will be specified in the station authorization.


<R05>
Sec. 25.276  Points of communication.

    (a) Unless otherwise specified in the station authorization, an 
earth station is authorized to transmit to any space station in the same 
radio service provided that permission has been received from the space 
station operator to access that space station.
    (b) Space stations licensed under this part are authorized to 
provide service to earth stations located within the specified service 
area. Coastal waters within the outer continental shelf shall be 
considered to be included within the service area specified by the named 
land mass.
    (c) Transmission to or from foreign points over space stations in 
the Fixed-Satellite Service, other than those operated by the 
International Telecommunications Satellite Organization and Inmarsat, 
are subject to the policies set forth in the Report and Order, adopted 
January 19, 1996 in IB Docket No. 95-41.

Sec. 25.277  Temporary fixed earth station operations.

    (a) When an earth station in the Fixed-Satellite Service is to 
remain at a single location for fewer than 6 months, the location may be 
considered to be temporary fixed. Services provided at a single location 
which are

[[Page 343]]

initially known to be of longer than six months' duration shall not be 
provided under a temporary fixed authorization.
    (b) When a station, authorized as a temporary fixed earth station, 
is to remain at a single location for more than six months, application 
for a regular station authorization at that location shall be filed at 
least 30 days prior to the expiration of the six-month period.
    (c) The licensee of an earth station which is authorized to conduct 
temporary fixed operations in bands shared co-equally with terrestrial 
fixed stations shall provide the following information to the Director 
of the Columbia Operations Center at 9200 Farmhouse Lane, Columbia, 
Maryland 21046, and to the licensees of all terrestrial facilities lying 
within the coordination contour of the proposed temporary fixed earth 
station site before beginning transmissions:
    (1) The name of the person operating the station and the telephone 
number at which the operator can be reached directly;
    (2) The exact frequency or frequencies used and the type of 
emissions and power levels to be transmitted; and
    (3) The commencement and anticipated termination dates of operation 
from each location.
    (d) Transmissions may not be commenced until all affected 
terrestrial licensees have been notified and the earth station operator 
has confirmed that unacceptable interference will not be caused to such 
terrestrial stations.
    (e) Operations of temporary fixed earth stations shall cease 
immediately upon notice of harmful interference from the Commission or 
the affected licensee.

<R05>
Sec. 25.279  Inter-satellite service.

    (a) Any non-geostationary satellite communicating with other space 
stations may use frequencies in the inter-satellite service as indicated 
in Sec. 2.106. This does not preclude the use of other frequencies for 
such purposes as provided for in several service definitions, e.g., FSS. 
The technical details of the proposed inter-satellite link shall be 
provided in accordance with Sec. 25.114(c).
    (b) Operating conditions. In order to ensure compatible operations 
with authorized users in the frequency bands to be utilized for 
operations in the inter-satellite service, these inter-satellite service 
systems must operate in accordance with the conditions specified in this 
section.
    (1) Coordination requirements with federal government users. (i) In 
frequency bands allocated for use by the inter-satellite service that 
are also authorized for use by agencies of the federal government, the 
federal use of frequencies in the inter-satellite service frequency 
bands is under the regulatory jurisdiction of the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).
    (ii) The Commission will use its existing procedures to reach 
agreement with NTIA to achieve compatible operations between federal 
government users under the jurisdiction of NTIA and inter-satellite 
service systems through frequency assignment and coordination practice 
established by NTIA and the Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee 
(IRAC). In order to facilitate such frequency assignment and 
coordination, applicants shall provide the Commission with sufficient 
information to evaluate electromagnetic compatibility with the federal 
government users of the spectrum, and any additional information 
requested by the Commission. As part of

[[Page 344]]

the coordination process, applicants shall show that they will not cause 
interference to authorized federal government users, based upon existing 
system information provided by the government. The frequency assignment 
and coordination of the satellite system shall be completed prior to 
grant of construction authorization.
    (2) Coordination among inter-satellite service systems. Applicants 
for authority to establish inter-satellite service are encouraged to 
coordinate their proposed frequency usage with existing permittees and 
licensees in the inter-satellite service whose facilities could be 
affected by the new proposal in terms of frequency interference or 
restricted system capacity. All affected applicants, permittees, and 
licensees, shall at the direction of the Commission, cooperate fully and 
make every reasonable effort to resolve technical problems and conflicts 
that may inhibit effective and efficient use of the radio spectrum; 
however, the permittee or licensee being coordinated with is not 
obligated to suggest changes or re-engineer an applicant's proposal in 
cases involving conflicts.

conditioned on full and timely payment of the winning bid.
    (b) If a winning bidder withdraws its bid after the Commission has 
declared competitive bidding closed or fails to remit the required down 
payment within ten (10) business days after the Commission has declared 
competitive bidding closed, the bidder will be deemed to have defaulted, 
its application will be dismissed, and it will be liable for the default 
payment specified in Sec. 1.2104(g)(2). In such event, the Commission 
may either re-auction the license to existing or new applicants or offer 
it to the other highest bidders (in descending order) at their final 
bids. The down payment obligations set forth in Sec. 25.404(b) will 
apply.
    (c) A winning bidder who is found unqualified to be a licensee, 
fails to remit the balance of its winning bid in a timely manner, or 
defaults or is disqualified for any reason after having made the

permitted to be used by a station. This is normally considered to be the 
necessary or occupied bandwidth, whichever is greater.
    Average terrain. The average elevation of terrain between 3 and 16 
kilometers from the antenna site.
    Controlling interest. (a) For purposes of this section, controlling 
interest includes individuals or entities with both De jure and De facto 
control of the applicant. De jure control is greater than 50 percent of 
the voting stock of a corporation, or in the case of a partnership, the 
general partner. De facto control is determined on a case-by-case basis. 
An entity must disclose its equity interest and demonstrate at least the 
following indicia of control to establish that it retains De facto 
control of the applicant:
    (1) The entity constitutes or appoints more than 50 percent of the 
board of directors or management committee;
    (2) The entity has authority to appoint, promote, demote, and fire 
senior executives that control the day-to-day activities of the 
licensee; and
    (3) The entity plays an integral role in management decisions.
    (b) Calculation of certain interests.
    (1) Ownership interests shall be calculated on a fully diluted 
basis; all agreements such as warrants, stock options and convertible 
debentures will generally be treated as if the rights thereunder already 
have been fully exercised.
    (2) Partnership and other ownership interests and any stock interest 
equity, or outstanding stock, or outstanding voting stock shall be 
attributed as specified below.
    (3) Stock interests held in trust shall be attributed to any person 
who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, to any person who has 
the sole power to sell such stock, and, to any person who has the right 
to revoke the trust at will or to replace the trustee at will. If the 
trustee has a familial, personal, or extra-trust business relationship 
to the grantor or the beneficiary, the grantor or beneficiary, as 
appropriate, will be attributed with the stock interests held in trust.
    (4) Non-voting stock shall be attributed as an interest in the 
issuing entity.
    (5) Limited partnership interests shall be attributed to limited 
partners and shall be calculated according to both the percentage of 
equity paid in and the percentage of distribution of profits and losses.
    (6) Officers and directors of an entity shall be considered to have 
an attributable interest in the entity. The officers and directors of an 
entity that controls a licensee or applicant shall be considered to have 
an attributable interest in the licensee or applicant.
    (7) Ownership interests that are held indirectly by any party 
through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by 
successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in 
the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution 
benchmark to the resulting product, except that if the ownership 
percentage for an interest in any link in the chain exceeds 50 percent 
or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were a 100 
percent interest.
    (8) Any person who manages the operations of an applicant or 
licensee pursuant to a management agreement shall be considered to have 
an attributable interest in such applicant or licensee if such person or 
its affiliate pursuant to Sec. 1.2110(b)(4), has authority to make 
decisions or otherwise engages in practices or activities that 
determine, or significantly influence:
    (i) The nature or types of services offered by such an applicant or 
licensee;
    (ii) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (iii) The prices charged for such services.
    (9) Any licensee or its affiliate who enters into a joint marketing 
arrangement with an applicant or licensee, or its affiliate, shall be 
considered to have an attributable interest, if such applicant or 
licensee, or its affiliate, has authority to make decisions or otherwise 
engage in practices or activities that determine, or significantly 
influence:

[[Page 352]]

    (i) The nature or types of services offered by such an applicant or 
licensee;
    (ii) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (iii) The prices charged for such services.

is an entity that, together with its affiliates and entities holding 
controlling interests in the entity, has average annual gross revenues 
that are not more than $40 million for the preceding three years.
    (b) A small business consortium is a conglomerate organization 
formed as a joint venture between or among mutually independent business 
firms, each of which individually satisfies the definition of a small 
business. Where an applicant (or licensee) is a consortium of small 
businesses, the gross revenues of each business shall not be aggregated.
    (c) Applicants without identifiable controlling interests. Where an 
applicant (or licensee) cannot identify controlling interests under the 
standards set forth in this section, the gross revenues of all interest 
holders in the applicant, and their affiliates, will be attributable.
    Total assets. Total assets shall mean the book value (except where 
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require market 
valuation) of all property owned by an entity, whether real or personal, 
tangible or intangible, as evidenced by the most recent audited 
financial statements.

<R05>
Sec. 26.12  Eligibility.

    Any entity, other than those precluded by section 310 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. Sec. 310, is eligible 
to hold a license under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 26.13  License period.

    Licenses for service areas will be granted for ten year terms from 
the date of original issuance or renewal.


<R05>
Sec. 26.14  Criteria for comparative renewal proceedings.

    A renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding 
shall receive a preference, commonly referred to as a renewal 
expectancy, which is the most important comparative factor to be 
considered in the proceeding, if its past record for the relevant 
license period demonstrates that the renewal applicant:
    (a) Has provided ``substantial'' service during its past license 
term. ``Substantial'' service is defined as service which is sound, 
favorable, and substantially above a level of mediocre service which 
might just minimally warrant renewal; and
    (b) Has substantially complied with applicable Commission rules, 
policies and the Communications Act.


<R04>
                     Subpart C--Technical Standards


<R05>
Sec. 26.51  Equipment authorization.

    (a) Each transmitter utilized for operation under this part and each 
transmitter marketed, as set forth in Sec. 2.803 of this chapter, must 
be of a type that has been authorized by the Commission under its type 
certification procedure.
    (b) Any manufacturer of radio transmitting equipment to be used in 
these services may request equipment authorization following the 
procedures set forth in Subpart J of part 2 of this chapter. Equipment 
authorization for an individual transmitter may be requested by an 
applicant for a station authorization by following the procedures set 
forth in part 2 of this chapter.

[63 FR 36604, July 7, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 26.52  RF safety.

    Licensees and manufacturers are subject to the radiofrequency 
radiation exposure requirements specified in Sec. 1.1307(b), Sec. 2.1091 
and Sec. 2.1093 of this chapter, as appropriate. Applications for 
equipment authorization of mobile or portable devices operating under 
this section must contain a statement confirming compliance with these 
requirements for both fundamental emmissions and unwanted emissions. 
Technical information showing the basis for this statement must be 
submitted to the Commission upon request.

[62 FR 47968, Sept. 12, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 26.53  Emission limits.

    (a) The power of any emission at the edges of the 4660-4685 MHz band 
shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) by at least 43 + 10 
log<INF>10</INF>(P) or 80 decibels, whichever is less.
    (b) Compliance with these provisions is based on the use of 
measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz or 
greater. However, in the 1 MHz bands immediately outside and adjacent to 
the frequency block a resolution bandwidth of at least one percent of 
the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the transmitter 
may be employed. The emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the 
signal between two points, one below the carrier center frequency

[[Page 354]]

and one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which all 
emission are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power.
    (c) When measuring the emission limits, the nominal carrier 
frequency shall be adjusted as close to the license's frequency block 
edges, both upper and lower, as the design permits.
    (d) The measurements of emission power can be expressed in peak or 
average values, provided that they are expressed in the same parameters 
as the transmission power.
    (e) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes 
harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require 
greater attenuation than specified in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 26.54  Frequency stability.

    The frequency stability shall be sufficient to ensure that the 
fundamental emission stays within the authorized frequency block.


<R05>
Sec. 26.55  Field strength limits.

    The predicted or measured median field strength at any location on 
the border of the GWCS service area shall not exceed 55 dBu unless 
licensees operating in adjacent areas agree to higher field strength 
along their mutual borders.


<R05>
Sec. 26.56  Antenna structures; air navigation safety.

    Licensees that own their antenna structures must not allow these 
antenna structures to become a hazard to air navigation. In general, 
antenna structure owners are responsible for registering antenna 
structures with the FCC if required by part 17 of this chapter, and for 
installing and maintaining any required marking and lighting. However, 
in the event of default of this responsibility by an antenna structure 
owner, each FCC permittee or licensee authorized to use an affected 
antenna structure will be held responsible by the FCC for ensuring that 
the antenna structure continues to meet the requirements of part 17 of 
this chapter. See Sec. 17.6 of this chapter.
    (a) Marking and lighting. Antenna structures must be marked, lighted 
and maintained in accordance with part 17 of this chapter and all 
applicable rules and requirements of the Federal Aviation 
Administration.
    (b) Maintenance contracts. Antenna structure owners (or licensees 
and permittees, in the event of default by an antenna structure owner) 
may enter into contracts with other entities to monitor and carry out 
necessary maintenance of antenna structures. Antenna structure owners 
(or licensees and permittees, in the event of default by an antenna 
structure owner) that make such contractual arrangements continue to be 
responsible for the maintenance of antenna structures in regard to air 
navigation safety.

[63 FR 71041, Dec. 23, 1998]


<R04>
                        Subpart D--Miscellaneous


<R05>
Sec. 26.101  Multiple ownership restrictions.

    (a) GWCS licensees shall not have an ownership interest in more than 
three of the five, 5 megahertz wide channels available in any geographic 
area. For purposes of this restriction, a GWCS licensee is:
    (1) Any institutional investor, as defined in Sec. 26.4, with an 
ownership interest of ten or more percent in a GWCS license; and
    (2) Any other person or entity with an ownership interest of five or 
more percent in a GWCS license.
    (b) In cases where a party had indirect ownership, through an 
interest in an intervening entity (or entities) that has ownership in 
the GWCS license, that indirect ownership shall be attributable if the 
percentages of ownership at each level, multiplied together, equal five 
or more percent ownership of the GWCS license, except that if the 
ownership percentage for an interest in any link in the chain exceeds 50 
percent or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were 
a 100 percent interest.

    Example. Party X has a non-controlling ownership interest of 25 
percent in Company Y, which in turn has a non-controlling ownership 
interest of 10 percent in Company Z, the GWCS licensee. Party X's 
effective ownership interest in Company Z is Party X's ownership 
interest in Company Y (25 percent) times Company Y's ownership interest 
in Company Z (10 percent). Therefore, Party

[[Page 355]]

X's effective ownership interest in Company Z is 2.5 percent, and is not 
attributable.

    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, the following 
interests shall not constitute attributable ownership interests for 
purposes of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (1) A limited partnership interest held by an institutional investor 
(as defined Sec. 26.4) where the limited partner is not materially 
involved, directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of the 
GWCS holdings of the partnership, and the licensee so certifies. The 
criteria which would assure adequate insulation for the purposes of this 
certification require:
    (i) Prohibiting limited partners from acting as employees of the 
limited partnership if responsibilities relate to the carrier activities 
of the licensee;
    (ii) Barring the limited partners from serving as independent 
contractors;
    (iii) Restricting communication among limited partners and the 
general partner regarding day-to-day activities of the licensee;
    (iv) Empowering the general partner to veto admissions of new 
general partners;
    (v) Restricting the circumstances in which the limited partners can 
remove the general partner;
    (vi) Prohibiting the limited partners from providing services to the 
partnership relating to the GWCS holdings of the licensee; and
    (vii) Stating that the limited partners may not become involved in 
the management or operation of the licensee.


<R05>
Sec. 26.102  Service areas.

    GWCS service areas are based on Economic Areas developed by the 
Bureau of Economic Analysis, Department of Commerce, referred to as 
``EAs'' and three additional EA-like service areas: Guam and the 
Northern Mariana Islands (combined as one service area), Puerto Rico and 
the United States Virgin Islands (combined as one service area), and

    (a) Economic Areas. Codes from 001 to 172 are assigned to the EAs in 
approximate geographic order, beginning with 001 in northern Maine, 
continuing south to Florida, then north to the Great Lakes, and 
continuing in a serpentine pattern to the West Coast. Except for the 
Western Oklahoma EA (126), the Northern Michigan EA (058), and the 17 
EAs that mainly correspond to consolidated metropolitan statistical 
areas (CMSAs), each EA is named for the metropolitan area or city that 
is the node of its largest component economic area (CEA) and that is 
usually, but not always, the largest metropolitan area or city in the 
EA. Each CEA consists of a single economic node and the surrounding 
counties that are economically related to the node. The following list 
provides EA codes and names.

Sec. 26.104  Construction requirements.

    (a) GWCS licensees shall within five years of initial license grant 
date offer service to one-third of the population in the area in which 
they are licensed. Licensees shall serve two-thirds of the population in 
the area in which they are licensed within ten years of initial license 
grant date.
    (b) In demonstrating compliance with the above construction 
requirements, licensees must base their calculations on signal field 
strengths that ensure reliable service for the technology utilized. 
Licensees may use any service radius contour formula developed or 
generally used by industry, provided that such formula is based on the 
technical characteristics of their system.
    (c) Upon meeting the five and ten year benchmarks in paragraph (a) 
of this section, licensees shall file a map and other supporting 
documentation that demonstrates compliance with the geographic area or 
population coverage requirement. Licensees shall file a statement 
indicating commencement of service. The filing must be received at the 
Commission on or before expiration of the relevant period.
    (d) If the sale of a license is approved, the new licensee is held 
to the original build-out requirement.
    (e) The licensee must notify the FCC electronically by using FCC 
Form 601 via the ULS, no later than by the end of the five-and ten-year 
periods, respectively, that it has met the applicable service 
requirements. If the licensee fails to respond within the allotted time, 
then the authorization will automatically terminate.

    Note to Sec. 26.104: Population-based construction requirements 
contained in this section shall be based on the 1990 census.

Sec. 26.105  Notification to the Arecibo Observatory.

    (a) The requirements in this section are intended to minimize 
possible interference at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. 
Licensees must make reasonable efforts to protect the Observatory from 
interference. Licensees planning to construct and operate a new station 
at a permanent fixed location on the islands of Puerto Rico, Desecheo, 
Mona, Vieques or Culebra in services in which individual station 
licenses are issued by the FCC; planning

[[Page 358]]

to construct and operate a new station at a permanent fixed location on 
these islands that may cause interference to the operations of the 
Arecibo Observatory in services in which individual station licenses are 
not issued by the FCC; or planning a modification of any existing 
station at a permanent fixed location on these islands that would 
increase the likelihood of causing interference to the operations of the 
Arecibo Observatory must notify the Interference Office, Arecibo 
Observatory, Post Office Box 995, Arecibo, Puerto Rico 00613, in writing 
or electronically (e-mail address: prcz@naic.edu), of the technical 
parameters of the planned operation. Carriers may wish to use the 
interference guidelines provided by Cornell University as guidance in 
designing facilities to avoid interference to the Observatory. The 
notification must include identification of the geographical coordinates 
of the antenna location (NAD-83 datum), the antenna height, antenna 
directivity (if any), proposed channel and FCC rule part, type of 
emission, and effective isotropic radiated power.
    (b) In services in which individual station licenses are issued by 
the FCC, the notification required in paragraph (a) of this section 
should be sent at the same time the application is filed with the FCC, 
and at least 20 days in advance of the applicant's planned operation. 
The application must state the date that notification in accordance with 
paragraph (a) was made. In services in which individual station licenses 
are not issued by the FCC, the notification required in paragraph (a) of 
this section should be sent at least 45 days in advance of the 
applicant's planned operation. In the latter services, the Interference 
Office must inform the FCC of a notification by an applicant within 20 
days if the Office plans to file comments or objections to the 
notification. After the FCC receives an application from a service 
applicant or is informed by the Interference Office of a notification 
from a service applicant, the FCC will allow the Interference Office a 
period of 20 days for comments or objections in response to the 
application or notification.
    (c) If an objection to any planned service operation is received 
during the 20-day period from the Interference Office, the FCC will take 
whatever action is deemed appropriate.

Sec. 26.209  Eligibility for partitioned licenses.

    (a) Notwithstanding Sec. 26.102, an applicant that is a rural 
telephone company, as defined in Sec. 26.4, may be granted a GWCS 
license that is geographically partitioned from a separately licensed 
EA, so long as the EA applicant or licensee has voluntarily agreed (in 
writing) to partition a portion of the license to the rural telephone 
company.
    (b) If partitioned licenses are being applied for in conjunction 
with a license(s) to be awarded through competitive biding procedures--
    (1) The applicable procedures for filing short-form applications and 
for submitting upfront payments and down payments contained in this part 
and part 1 of this chapter shall be followed by the applicant, who must 
disclose as part of its short-form application all parties to 
agreement(s) with or among rural telephone companies to partition the 
license pursuant to this section, if won at auction (see 
Sec. 1.2105(a)(2)(viii));
    (2) Each rural telephone company that is a party to an agreement to 
partition the license shall file, either electronically via the ULS or 
with a paper form, a long-form application for its respective, mutually 
agreed-upon geographic area together with the application for the 
remainder of the Economic Area filed by the auction winner.
    (c) If the partitioned license is being applied for as a partial 
assignment of the EA license following grant of the initial license, 
request for authorization for partial assignment of a license shall be 
made pursuant to Sec. 26.324.
    (d) Each application for a partitioned area (long-form initial 
application or partial assignment application) shall contain a 
partitioning plan that must propose to establish a partitioned area to 
be licensed that meets the following criteria:
    (1) Conforms to established geopolitical boundaries (such as county 
lines);
    (2) Includes the wireline service area of the rural telephone 
company applicant; and
    (3) Is reasonably related to the rural telephone company's wireline 
service area.

    Note to paragraph (d)(3):
    A partitioned service area will be presumed to be reasonably related 
to the rural telephone company's wireline service area if the 
partitioned service area contains no more than twice the population 
overlap between the rural telephone company's wireline service area and 
the partitioned area.

    (e) Each licensee in each partitioned area will be responsible for 
meeting the construction requirements in its area (see Sec. 26.104).

<R05>
Sec. 26.321  Mutually exclusive applications.

    (a) The Commission will consider applications to be mutually 
exclusive if their conflicts are such that the grant of one application 
would effectively preclude by reason of harmful electrical interference, 
or other practical reason, the grant of one or more of the other 
applications. The Commission will presume ``harmful electrical 
interference'' to mean interference which would result in a material 
impairment to service rendered to the public despite full cooperation in 
good faith by all applicants or parties to achieve reasonable technical 
adjustments which would avoid electrical conflict.
    (b) Mutually exclusive applications filed on Form 175 for the 
initial provision of GWCS service are subject to competitive bidding in 
accordance with the procedures in subpart F of this part and in part 1, 
subpart Q of this chapter.

Sec. 26.323  Post-action divestitures.

    Any parties sharing a common non-controlling ownership interests who 
aggregate more GWCS spectrum among them than a single entity is entitled 
to hold will be permitted to divest sufficient properties within 90 days 
of the license grant to come into compliance with the spectrum 
aggregation limits as follows:

[[Page 361]]

    (a) The GWCS applicant shall submit electronically via the ULS, a 
signed statement with its long-form application (FCC Form 601) stating 
that sufficient properties will be divested within ninety days of the 
license grant. If the licensee is otherwise qualified, the Commission 
will grant the applications subject to a condition that the licensee 
come into compliance with the GWCS spectrum aggregation limits within 90 
days of grant of the license.
    (b) Within 90 days of license grant, the licensee must certify that 
the applicant and all parties to the application have come into 
compliance with the GWCS spectrum aggregation limits. If the licensee 
fails to submit the certification within 90 days, the Commission will 
immediately cancel all broadband GWCS licenses won by the applicant, 
impose the default payment and, based on the facts presented, take any 
other action it deems appropriate. Divestiture may be an interim trustee 
if a buyer has not been secured in the required time frame, as long as 
the applicant has no interest in or control of the trustee, and the 
trustee may dispose of the property as it sees fit. In no event may the 
trustee retain the property for longer than six months from grant of 
license.

<R05>
Sec. 27.1  Basis and purpose.

    This section contains the statutory basis for this part of the rules 
and provides the purpose for which this part is issued.
    (a) Basis. The rules for miscellaneous wireless communications 
services (WCS) in this part are promulgated under the provisions of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, that vest authority in the 
Federal Communications Commission to regulate radio transmission and to 
issue licenses for radio stations.
    (b) Purpose. This part states the conditions under which spectrum is 
made available and licensed for the provision of wireless communications 
services in the following bands.
    (1) 2305-2320 MHz and 2345-2360 MHz.
    (2) 746-764 MHz and 776-794 MHz.
    (c) Scope. The rules in this part apply only to stations authorized 
under this part.

FR 17601, Apr. 4, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 27.2  Permissible communications.

    (a) Miscellaneous wireless communications services. Except as 
provided in paragraph (b) of this section and subject to technical and 
other rules contained in this part, a licensee in the frequency bands 
specified in Sec. 27.5 may provide any services for which its frequency 
bands are allocated, as set forth in the non-Federal Government column 
of the Table of Allocations in Sec. 2.106 of this chapter (column 5).
    (b) 746-747 MHz, 776-777 MHz, 762-764 MHz and 792-794 MHz bands. 
Operators in the 746-747 MHz, 776-777 MHz, 762-764 MHz and 792-794 MHz 
bands may not employ a cellular system architecture. A cellular system 
architecture is defined, for purposes of this part, as one that consists 
of many small areas or cells (segmented from a larger geographic service 
area), each of which uses its own base station, to enable frequencies to 
be reused at relatively short distances.
    (c) Satellite DARS. Satellite digital audio radio service (DARS) may 
be provided using the 2310-2320 and 2345-2360 MHz bands. Satellite DARS 
service shall be provided in a manner consistent with part 25 of this 
chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 27.14  Construction requirements; Criteria for comparative renewal proceedings.

    (a) WCS licensees must make a showing of ``substantial service'' in 
their license area within the prescribed license term set forth in 
Sec. 27.13.. ``Substantial'' service is defined as service which is 
sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of mediocre service 
which just might minimally warrant renewal. Failure by any licensee to 
meet this requirement will result in forfeiture of the license and the 
licensee will be ineligible to regain it.
    (b) A renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding 
shall receive a preference, commonly referred to as a renewal 
expectancy, which is the most important comparative factor to be 
considered in the proceeding, if its past record for the relevant 
license period demonstrates that:
    (1) The renewal applicant has provided ``substantial'' service 
during its past license term; and
    (2) The renewal applicant has substantially complied with applicable 
FCC rules, policies and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
    (c) In order to establish its right to a renewal expectancy, a WCS 
renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding must 
submit a showing explaining why it should receive a renewal expectancy. 
At a minimum, this showing must include:
    (1) A description of its current service in terms of geographic 
coverage and population served;
    (2) An explanation of its record of expansion, including a timetable 
of new construction to meet changes in demand for service;
    (3) A description of its investments in its WCS system; and
    (4) Copies of all FCC orders finding the licensee to have violated 
the Communications Act or any FCC rule or policy; and a list of any 
pending proceedings that relate to any matter described in this 
paragraph.
    (d) In making its showing of entitlement to a renewal expectancy, a 
renewal applicant may claim credit for any system modification 
applications that were pending on the date it filed its renewal 
application. Such credit will not be allowed if the modification 
application is dismissed or denied.

<R05>
Sec. 27.15  Geographic partitioning and spectrum disaggregation.

    (a) Eligibility. (1) Parties seeking approval for partitioning and 
disaggregation shall request from the Commission an authorization for 
partial assignment of a license pursuant to Sec. 1.948.
    (2) WCS licensees may apply to partition their licensed geographic 
service area or disaggregate their licensed spectrum at any time 
following the grant of their licenses.
    (b) Technical Standards--(1) Partitioning. In the case of 
partitioning, applicants and licensees must file FCC Form 603 pursuant 
to section 1.948 and list the partitioned service area on a schedule to 
the application. The geographic coordinates must be specified in 
degrees, minutes, and seconds to the nearest second of latitude and 
longitude and must be based upon the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83).
    (2) Disaggregation. Spectrum may be disaggregated in any amount.
    (3) Combined partitioning and disaggregation. The Commission will 
consider requests for partial assignment of licenses that propose 
combinations of partitioning and disaggregation.

[[Page 369]]

    (4) Signal levels. For purposes of partitioning and disaggregation, 
part 27 systems must be designed so as not to exceed the signal level 
specified for the particular spectrum block in Sec. 27.55 at the 
licensee's service area boundary, unless the affected adjacent service 
area licensees have agreed to a different signal level.
    (c) Unjust Enrichment.--(1) Bidding credits. Licensees that received 
a bidding credit and partition their licenses or disaggregate their 
spectrum to entities not meeting the eligibility standards for such a 
bidding credit, will be subject to the provisions concerning unjust 
enrichment as set forth in section 27.209(c).
    (2) Apportioning unjust enrichment payments. Unjust enrichment 
payments for partitioned license areas shall be calculated based upon 
the ratio of the population of the partitioned license area to the 
overall population of the license area and by utilizing the most recent 
census data. Unjust enrichment payments for disaggregated spectrum shall 
be calculated based upon the ratio of the amount of spectrum 
disaggregated to the amount of spectrum held by the licensee.
    (d) License term. The license term for a partitioned license area 
and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original 
licensee's license term as provided for in Sec. 27.13.
    (e) Compliance with construction requirements. The following rules 
apply for purposes of implementing the construction requirements set 
forth in Sec. 27.14.
    (1) Partitioning. Parties to partitioning agreements have two 
options for satisfying the construction requirements set forth in 
Sec. 27.14. Under the first option, the partitioner and partitionee each 
certifies that it will independently satisfy the substantial service 
requirement for its respective partitioned area. If a licensee 
subsequently fails to meet its substantial service requirement, its 
license will be subject to automatic cancellation without further 
Commission action. Under the second option, the partitioner certifies 
that it has met or will meet the substantial service requirement for the 
entire, pre-partitioned geographic service area. If the partitioner 
subsequently fails to meet its substantial service requirement, only its 
license will be subject to automatic cancellation without further 
Commission action.
    (2) Disaggregation. Parties to disaggregation agreements have two 
options for satisfying the construction requirements set forth in 
Sec. 27.14. Under the first option, the disaggregator and disaggregatee 
each certifies that it will share responsibility for meeting the 
substantial service requirement for the geographic service area. If the 
parties choose this option and either party subsequently fails to 
satisfy its substantial service responsibility, both parties' licenses 
will be subject to forfeiture without further Commission action. Under 
the second option, both parties certify either that the disaggregator or 
the disaggregatee will meet the substantial service requirement for the 
geographic service area. If the parties choose this option, and the 
party responsible subsequently fails to meet the substantial service 
requirement, only that party's license will be subject to forfeiture 
without further Commission action.

average values, provided they are expressed in the same parameters as 
the transmitter power;
    (8) Waiver requests of any of the out-of-band emission limits in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section shall be entertained 
only if interference protection equivalent to that afforded by the 
limits is shown;
    (9) In the 2305-2315 MHz band, if portable devices comply with all 
of the following requirements, then paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
shall not apply to portable devices, which instead shall attenuate all 
emissions into the 2320-2345 MHz band by a factor of not less than 93 + 
10 log (p) dB:
    (i) The portable device has a duty cycle of 12.5% or less, with at 
most a 312.5 microsecond pulse every 2.5 milliseconds;
    (ii) The portable device must employ time division multiple access 
(TDMA) technology;
    (iii) The nominal peak transmit output power of the portable device 
is no more than 200 milliwatts (25 milliwatts average power);
    (iv) The portable device operates with the minimum power necessary 
for successful communications;
    (v) The nominal average base station transmit output power is no 
more than 800 milliwatts when the base station antennas is located at a 
height of at least 8 meters (26.25 feet) above the ground;
    (vi) Only fixed and portable devices and services may be provided: 
vehicle-mounted units are not permitted; and
    (vii) Transmitting antennas shall employ linear polarization or 
another polarization that provides equivalent of better discrimination 
with respect to a DARS antenna;
    (10) The out-of-band emissions limits in paragraphs (a)(1) through 
(a)(9) of this section may be modified by the private contractual 
agreement of all affected licensees, who shall maintain a copy of the 
agreement in their station files and disclose it to prospective 
assignees or transferees and, upon request, to the Commission.
    (b) For WCS Satellite DARS operations: The limits set forth in 
Sec. 25.202(f) of this chapter shall apply, except that Satellite DARS 
operations shall be limited to a maximum power flux density of -197 dBW/
m<SUP>2</SUP>/4 kHz in the 2370-2390 MHz band at Arecibo, Puerto Rico.
    (c) For operations in the 747 to 762 MHz band and the 777 to 792 MHz 
band, the power of any emission outside the licensee's frequency band(s) 
of operation shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) within 
the licensed band(s) of operation, measured in watts, in accordance with 
the following:
    (1) On any frequency outside the 747 to 762 MHz band, the power of 
any emission shall be attenuated outside the band below the transmitter 
power (P) by at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB;
    (2) On any frequency outside the 777 to 792 MHz band, the power of 
any emission shall be attenuated outside the band below the transmitter

not less than 65 + 10 log (P) dB in a 6.25 kHz band segment, for mobile 
and portable stations;
    (5) Compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) 
of this section is based on the use of measurement instrumentation 
employing a resolution bandwidth of 100 kHz or greater. However, in the 
100 kHz bands immediately outside and adjacent to the frequency block, a 
resolution bandwidth of at least 30 kHz may be employed;
    (6) Compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) 
of this section is based on the use of measurement instrumentation such 
that the reading taken with any resolution bandwidth setting should be 
adjusted to indicate spectral energy in a 6.25 kHz segment.
    (d) For operations in the 746-747 MHz, 762-764 MHz, 776-777 MHz, and 
792-794 MHz bands, transmitters must meet the following emission 
limitations:
    (1) The adjacent channel coupled power (ACCP) requirements for 
transmitters designed for various channel sizes are shown in the 
following tables. Mobile station requirements apply to handheld, car 
mounted and control station units. The tables specify a maximum value 
for the ACCP relative to maximum output power as a function of the 
displacement from the channel center frequency. In addition, the ACCP 
for a mobile station transmitter at the specified frequency displacement 
must not exceed the value shown in the tables. For transmitters that 
have power control, the latter ACCP requirement can be met at maximum 
power reduction. In the following charts, ``(s)'' means that a swept 
measurement is to be used.

    (2) ACCP measurement procedure. The following procedures are to be 
followed for making ACCP transmitter measurements. For time division 
multiple access (TDMA) systems, the measurements are to be made under 
TDMA operation only during time slots when the transmitter is on. All 
measurements must be made at the input to the transmitter's antenna. 
Measurement bandwidth used below implies an instrument that measures the 
power in many narrow bandwidths (e.g. 300 Hz) and integrates these 
powers across a larger band to determine power in the measurement 
bandwidth.
    (i) Setting reference level: Using a spectrum analyzer capable of 
ACCP measurements, set the measurement bandwidth to the channel size. 
For example, for a 6.25 kHz transmitter, set the measurement bandwidth 
to 6.25 kHz; for a 150 kHz transmitter, set the measurement bandwidth to 
150 kHz. Set the frequency offset of the measurement bandwidth to zero 
and adjust the center frequency of the spectrum analyzer to give the 
power level in the measurement bandwidth. Record this power level in dBm 
as the ``reference power level''.
    (ii) Measuring the power level at frequency offsets 600kHz: Using a 
spectrum analyzer capable of ACCP measurements, set the measurement 
bandwidth as shown in the tables above. Measure the ACCP in dBm. These 
measurements should be made at maximum power. Calculate the coupled 
power by subtracting the measurements made in this step from the 
reference power measured in the previous step. The absolute ACCP values 
must be less than the values given in the table for each condition 
above.
    (iii) Measuring the power level at frequency offsets >600kHz: Set a 
spectrum analyzer to 30 kHz resolution bandwidth, 1 MHz video bandwidth 
and sample mode detection. Sweep <plus-minus>6 MHz from the carrier 
frequency. Set the reference level to the RMS value of the transmitter 
power and note the absolute power. The response at frequencies greater 
than 600 kHz must be less than the values in the tables above.
    (iv) Upper Power Limit Measurement: The absolute coupled power in 
dBm measured above must be compared to the table entry for each given 
frequency offset. For those mobile stations with power control, these 
measurements should be repeated with power control at maximum power 
reduction. The absolute ACCP at maximum power reduction must be less 
than the values in the tables above.
    (3) Out-of-band emission limit. On any frequency outside of the 
frequency ranges covered by the ACCP tables in

[[Page 375]]

this section, the power of any emission must be reduced below the 
unmodulated carrier power (P) by at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB.
    (4) Authorized bandwidth. Provided that the ACCP requirements of 
this section are met, applicants may request any authorized bandwidth 
that does not exceed the channel size.
    (e) For operations in the 746-764 MHz and 776-794 MHz bands, 
emissions in the band 1559-1610 MHz shall be limited to -70 dBW/MHz 
equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) for wideband signals, and 
-80 dBW EIRP for discrete emissions of less than 700 Hz bandwidth. For 
the purpose of equipment authorization, a transmitter shall be tested 
with an antenna that is representative of the type that will be used 
with the equipment in normal operation.
    (f) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes 
harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require 
greater attenuation than specified in this section.

Sec. 27.56  Antenna structures; air navigation safety.

    A licensee that owns its antenna structure(s) must not allow such 
antenna structure(s) to become a hazard to air navigation. In general, 
antenna structure owners are responsible for registering antenna 
structures with the FCC if required by part 17 of this chapter, and for 
installing and maintaining any required marking and lighting. However, 
in the event of default of this responsibility by an antenna structure 
owner, the FCC permittee or licensee authorized to use an affected 
antenna structure will be held responsible by the FCC for ensuring that 
the antenna structure continues to meet the requirements of part 17 of 
this chapter. See Sec. 17.6 of this chapter.
    (a) Marking and lighting. Antenna structures must be marked, lighted 
and maintained in accordance with part 17 of this chapter and all 
applicable rules and requirements of the Federal Aviation 
Administration. For any construction or alteration that would exceed the 
requirements of section 17.7 of this chapter, licensees must notify the 
appropriate Regional Office of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA 
Form 7460-1) and file a request for antenna height clearance and 
obstruction marking and lighting specifications (FCC Form 854) with the 
FCC, WTB, 1270 Fairfield Road, Gettysburg, PA 17325.
    (b) Maintenance contracts. Antenna structure owners (or licensees 
and permittees, in the event of default by an antenna structure owner) 
may enter into contracts with other entities to monitor and carry out 
necessary maintenance of antenna structures. Antenna structure owners 
(or licensees and permittees, in the event of default by an antenna 
structure owner) that make such contractual arrangements continue to be 
responsible for the maintenance of antenna structures in regard to air 
navigation safety.

Sec. 27.57  International coordination.

    WCS operations in the border areas shall be subject to coordination 
with those countries and provide protection to non-U.S. operations in 
the 2305-2320

and 2345-2360 MHz bands as appropriate. In addition, satellite DARS 
operations in WCS spectrum shall be subject to international satellite 
coordination procedures.

Sec. 27.58  Interference to MDS/ITFS receivers.

    (a) WCS licensees shall bear full financial obligation to remedy 
interference to MDS/ITFS block downconverters if all of the following 
conditions are met:
    (1) The complaint is received by the WCS licensee prior to February 
20, 2002;
    (2) The MDS.ITFS downconverter was installed prior to August 20, 
1998;
    (3) The WCS fixed or land station transmits at 50 or more watts peak 
EIRP;
    (4) The MDS/ITFS downconverter is located within a WCS transmitter's 
free space power flux density contour of -34 dBW/m<SUP>2</SUP>; and
    (5) The MDS/ITFS customer or licensee has informed the WCS licensee 
of the interference within one year from the initial operation of the 
WCS transmitter or within one year from any subsequent power increases 
at the WCS station.
    (b) Resolution of the complaint shall be at no cost to the 
complainant.
    (c) Two or more WCS licensees collocating their antennas on the same 
tower shall assume shared responsibility for remedying interference 
complaints within the area determined by paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section unless an offending station can be readily determined and then 
that station shall assume full financial responsibility.
    (d) If the WCS licensee cannot otherwise eliminate interference 
caused to MDS/ITFS reception, then that licensee must cease operations 
from the offending WCS facility.
    (e) At least 30 days prior to commencing operations from any new WCS 
transmission site or with increased power from any existing WCS 
transmission site, a WCS licensee shall notify all MDS/ITFS licensees in 
or through whose licensed service area they intend to operate of the 
technical parameters of the WCS transmission facility. WCS and MDS/ITFS 
licensees are expected to coordinate voluntarily and in good faith to 
avoid interference problems and to allow the greates operational 
flexibility in each other's operations.

Sec. 27.60  TV/DTV interference protection criteria.

    Base, fixed, control, and mobile transmitters in the 746-764 MHz and 
776-794 MHz frequency bands must be operated only in accordance with the 
rules in this section to reduce the potential for interference to public 
reception of the signals of existing TV and DTV broadcast stations 
transmitting on TV Channels 59 through 68.
    (a) D/U ratios. Licensees must choose site locations that are a 
sufficient distance from co-channel and adjacent channel TV and DTV 
stations, and/or must use reduced transmitting power or transmitting 
antenna height such that the following minimum desired signal-to-
undesired signal ratios (D/U ratios) are met.
    (1) The minimum D/U ratio for co-channel stations is 40 dB at the 
hypothetical Grade B contour (64 dB<greek-m>V/m) (88.5 kilometers (55 
miles)) of the TV station or 17 dB at the equivalent Grade B contour (41 
dB<greek-m>V/m) (88.5 kilometers (55 miles)) of the DTV station.
    (2) The minimum D/U ratio for adjacent channel stations is 0 dB at 
the hypothetical Grade B contour (64 dB<greek-m>V/m) (88.5 kilometers 
(55 miles)) of the TV station or -23 dB at the equivalent Grade B 
contour (41 dB<greek-m>V/m) (88.5 kilometers (55 miles)) of the DTV 
station.
    (b) TV stations and calculation of contours. The methods used to 
calculate TV contours and antenna heights above average terrain are 
given in Secs. 73.683 and 73.684 of this chapter. Tables to determine 
the necessary minimum distance from the 746-764 MHz or 776-794 MHz 
station to the TV/DTV station, assuming that the TV/DTV station has a 
hypothetical or equivalent Grade B contour of 88.5 kilometers (55 
miles), are located in Sec. 90.309 of this chapter and labeled as Tables 
B, D, and E. Values between those given in the tables may be determined 
by linear interpolation. The locations of existing and proposed TV/DTV 
stations during the period of transition from analog to

    Note: DTV stations on Channel 59 must be considered even though they 
are not indicated in the above table. The transition period is scheduled 
to end on December 31, 2006. After that time, unless otherwise directed 
by the Commission, 746-764 MHz and 776-794 MHz stations will no longer 
be required to protect reception of co-channel or adjacent channel TV/
DTV stations.

    (1) Licensees of stations operating within the ERP and HAAT limits 
of Sec. 27.50 must select one of three methods to meet the TV/DTV 
protection requirements, subject to Commission approval:
    (i) Utilize the geographic separation specified in the tables 
referenced below;
    (ii) Submit an engineering study justifying the proposed separations 
based on the actual parameters of the land mobile station and the actual 
parameters of the TV/DTV station(s) it is trying to protect; or,
    (iii) Obtain written concurrence from the applicable TV/DTV 
station(s). If this method is chosen, a copy of the agreement must be 
submitted with the application.
    (2) The following is the method for geographic separations.
    (i) Base and fixed stations that operate in the 746-764 MHz and 777-
792 MHz bands having an antenna height (HAAT) less than 152 m. (500 ft.) 
shall afford protection to co-channel and adjacent channel TV/DTV 
stations in accordance with the values specified in Table B (co-channel 
frequencies based on 40 dB protection) and Table E (adjacent channel 
frequencies based on 0 dB protection) in Sec. 90.309 of this chapter. 
For base and fixed stations having an antenna height (HAAT) between 152-
914 meters (500-3,000 ft.) the effective radiated power must be reduced 
below 1 kilowatt in accordance with the values shown in the power 
reduction graph in Figure B in Sec. 90.309 of this chapter. For heights 
of more than 152 m. (500 ft.) above average terrain, the distance to the 
radio path horizon will be calculated assuming smooth earth. If the 
distance so determined equals or exceeds the distance to the 
hypothetical or equivalent Grade B contour of a co-channel TV/DTV 
station (i.e., it exceeds the distance from the appropriate Table in 
Sec. 90.309 of this chapter to the relevant TV/DTV station), an 
authorization will not be granted unless it can be shown in an 
engineering study (see paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section) that actual 
terrain considerations are such as to provide the desired protection at 
the actual Grade B contour (64 dB<greek-m>V/m for TV and 41 
dB<greek-m>V/m for DTV stations) or unless the effective radiated power 
will be further reduced so

[[Page 378]]

that, assuming free space attenuation, the desired protection at the 
actual Grade B contour (64 dB<greek-m>V/m for TV and 41 dB<greek-m>V/m 
coverage contour for DTV stations) will be achieved. Directions for 
calculating powers, heights, and reduction curves are listed in 
Sec. 90.309 of this chapter for land mobile stations. Directions for 
calculating coverage contours are listed in Secs. 73.683-685 of this 
chapter for TV stations and in Sec. 73.625 of this chapter for DTV 
stations.
    (ii) Control, fixed, and mobile stations (including portables) that 
operate in the 776-777 MHz and 792-794 MHz bands and control and mobile 
stations (including portables) that operate in the 747-762 MHz and 777-
792 MHz bands are limited in height and power and therefore shall afford 
protection to co-channel and adjacent channel TV/DTV stations in 
accordance with the values specified in Table D (co-channel frequencies 
based on 40 dB protection for TV stations and 17 dB for DTV stations) in 
Sec. 90.309 of this chapter and a minimum distance of 8 kilometers (5 
miles) from all adjacent channel TV/DTV station hypothetical or 
equivalent Grade B contours (adjacent channel frequencies based on 0 dB 
protection for TV stations and -23 dB for DTV stations). Since control, 
fixed, and mobile stations may affect different TV/DTV stations than the 
associated base or fixed station, particular care must be taken by 
applicants/licensees to ensure that all appropriate TV/DTV stations are 
considered (e.g. a base station may be operating within TV Channel 62 
and the mobiles within TV Channel 67, in which case TV Channels 61, 62, 
63, 66, 67 and 68 must be protected). Control, fixed, and mobile 
stations shall keep a minimum distance of 96.5 kilometers (60 miles) 
from all adjacent channel TV/DTV stations. Since mobiles and portables 
are able to move and communicate with each other, licensees must 
determine the areas where the mobiles can and cannot roam in order to 
protect the TV/DTV stations.
    (iii) In order to protect certain TV/DTV stations and to ensure 
protection from these stations which may have extremely large contours 
due to unusual height situations, an additional distance factor must be 
used by all base, fixed, control, and mobile stations. For all co-
channel and adjacent channel TV/DTV stations which have an HAAT between 
350 and 600 meters, licensees must add the following DISTANCE FACTOR to 
the value obtained from the referenced Tables in Sec. 90.309 of this 
chapter and to the distance for control, fixed, and mobile stations on 
adjacent TV/DTV channels (96.5 km).
    DISTANCE FACTOR = (TV/DTV HAAT - 350) <divide> 14 in kilometers, 
where HAAT is the TV or DTV station antenna height above average terrain 
obtained from its authorized or proposed facilities, whichever is 
greater.
    (iv) For all co-channel and adjacent channel TV/DTV stations which 
have an antenna height above average terrain greater than 600 meters, 
licensees must add 18 kilometers as the DISTANCE FACTOR to the value 
obtained from the referenced Tables in Sec. 90.309 of this chapter and 
to the distance for control, fixed, and mobile stations on adjacent TV/
DTV channels (96.5 km).

    Note to Sec. 27.60: The 88.5 km (55 mi) Grade B service contour (64 
dB<greek-m>V/m) is based on a hypothetical TV station operating at an 
effective radiated power of one megawatt, a transmitting antenna height 
above average terrain of 610 meters (2000 feet) and the Commission's R-
6602 F(50,50) curves. See Sec. 73.699 of this chapter. Maximum 
facilities for TV stations operating in the UHF band are 5 megawatts 
effective radiated power at an antenna HAAT of 610 meters (2,000 feet). 
See Sec. 73.614 of this chapter. The equivalent contour for DTV stations 
is based on a 41 dB<greek-m>V/m signal strength and the distance to the 
F (50,90) curve. See Sec. 73.625 of this chapter.

Secs. 27.61-27.62  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 27.63  Disturbance of AM broadcast station antenna patterns.

    WCS licensees that construct or modify towers in the immediate 
vicinity of AM broadcast stations are responsible for measures necessary 
to correct disturbance of the AM station antenna pattern which causes 
operation outside of the radiation parameters specified by the FCC for 
the AM station, if the disturbance occurred as a result of such 
construction or modification.

[[Page 379]]

    (a) Non-directional AM stations. If tower construction or 
modification is planned within 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) of a non-
directional AM broadcast station tower, the WCS licensee must notify the 
licensee of the AM broadcast station in advance of the planned 
construction or modification. Measurements must be made to determine 
whether the construction or modification would affect the AM station 
antenna pattern. The WCS licensee is responsible for the installation 
and continued maintenance of any detuning apparatus necessary to restore 
proper non-directional performance of the AM station tower.
    (b) Directional AM stations. If tower construction or modification 
is planned within 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) of a directional AM broadcast 
station array, the WCS licensee must notify the licensee of the AM 
broadcast station in advance of the planned construction or 
modification. Measurements must be made to determine whether the 
construction or modification would affect the AM station antenna 
pattern. The WCS licensee is responsible for the installation and 
continued maintenance of any detuning apparatus necessary to restore 
proper performance of the AM station array.


<R05>
Sec. 27.64  Protection from interference.

    Wireless Communications Service (WCS) stations operating in full 
accordance with applicable FCC rules and the terms and conditions of 
their authorizations are normally considered to be non-interfering. If 
the FCC determines, however, that interference which significantly 
interrupts or degrades a radio service is being caused, it may, after 
notice and an opportunity for a hearing, require modifications to any 
WCS station as necessary to eliminate such interference.
    (a) Failure to operate as authorized. Any licensee causing 
interference to the service of other stations by failing to operate its 
station in full accordance with its authorization and applicable FCC 
rules shall discontinue all transmissions, except those necessary for 
the immediate safety of life or property, until it can bring its station 
into full compliance with the authorization and rules.
    (b) Intermodulation interference. Licensees should attempt to 
resolve such interference by technical means.
    (c) Situations in which no protection is afforded. Except as 
provided elsewhere in this part, no protection from interference is 
afforded in the following situations:
    (1) Interference to base receivers from base or fixed transmitters. 
Licensees should attempt to resolve such interference by technical means 
or operating arrangements.
    (2) Interference to mobile receivers from mobile transmitters. No 
protection is provided against mobile-to-mobile interference.
    (3) Interference to base receivers from mobile transmitters. No 
protection is provided against mobile-to-base interference.
    (4) Interference to fixed stations. Licensees should attempt to 
resolve such interference by technical means or operating arrangements.
    (5) Anomalous or infrequent propagation modes. No protection is 
provided against interference caused by tropospheric and ionospheric 
propagation of signals.


<R05>
Sec. 27.66  Discontinuance, reduction, or impairment of service.

    (a) Involuntary act. If the service provided by a fixed common 
carrier licensee, or a fixed common carrier operating on spectrum 
licensed to a Guard Band Manager, is involuntarily discontinued, 
reduced, or impaired for a period exceeding 48 hours, the licensee must 
promptly notify the Commission, in writing, as to the reasons for 
discontinuance, reduction, or impairment of service, including a 
statement when normal service is to be resumed. When normal service is 
resumed, the licensee must promptly notify the Commission.
    (b) Voluntary act by common carrier. If a fixed common carrier 
licensee, or a fixed common carrier operating on spectrum licensed to a 
Guard Band Manager, voluntarily discontinues, reduces, or impairs 
service to a community or part of a community, it must obtain prior 
authorization as provided under Sec. 63.71 of this chapter. An 
application will be granted within 31 days after filing if no objections 
have been received.

[[Page 380]]

    (c) Voluntary act by non-common carrier. If a fixed non-common 
carrier licensee, or a fixed non-common carrier operating on spectrum 
licensed to a Guard Band Manager, voluntarily discontinues, reduces, or 
impairs service to a community or part of a community, it must given 
written notice to the Commission within seven days.
    (d) Notifications and requests. Notifications and requests 
identified in paragraphs(a) through (c) of this section should be sent 
to: Federal Communications Commission, Common Carrier Radio Services, 
1270 Fairfield Road, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, 17325.

<R05>
Sec. 27.202  Competitive bidding mechanisms.

    In addition to the provisions of Sec. 1.2104(a) through (f), (h) and 
(i) of this chapter, the following provision will apply to WCS in the 
2305-2320 and 2345-2360 bands: Where a tie bid occurs, the high bidder 
will be determined by the order in which the bids were received by the 
Commission.

<R05>
Sec. 27.203  Withdrawal, default and disqualification payments.

    When the Commission conducts a simultaneous multiple round auction 
pursuant to Sec. 27.202, the Commission will impose payments on bidders 
who withdraw high bids during the course of an auction, or who default 
on payments due after an auction closes or who are disqualified. When 
the amount of such a payment cannot be determined, a deposit of up to 20 
percent of the amount bid on the license will be required.
    (a) Bid withdrawal prior to close of auction. A bidder who withdraws 
a high bid during the course of an auction will be subject to a payment 
equal to the difference between the amount bid and the amount of the 
winning bid the next time the license is offered by the Commission. No 
withdrawal payment would be assessed if the subsequent winning bid 
exceeds the withdrawn bid. This payment amount will be deducted from any 
upfront payments or down payments that the withdrawing bidder has 
deposited with the Commission.
    (b) Default or disqualification after close of auction. See 
Sec. 1.2104(g)(2) of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 27.204  Bidding application and certification procedures; prohibition of collusion.

    (a) Submission of Short-Form Application (FCC Form 175). In order to 
be eligible to bid, an applicant must timely submit, by means of 
electronic filing, a short-form application (FCC Form 175). Unless 
otherwise provided by public notice, the Form 175 need not be 
accompanied by an upfront payment (see Sec. 27.205).
    (1) All Form 175s will be due on the date specified by public 
notice.
    (2) The Form 175 must contain the following information:
    (i) Identification of each license on which the applicant wishes to 
bid;
    (ii) The applicant's name, if the applicant is an individual. If the 
applicant is a corporation, then the short-form application will require 
the name and address of the corporate office and the name and title of 
an officer or director. If the applicant is a partnership, then the 
application will require the names, citizenship and addresses of all 
partners, and, if a partner is not a natural person, then the name and 
title

[[Page 381]]

of a responsible person should be included as well. If the applicant is 
a trust, then the name and address of the trustee will be required. If 
the applicant is none of the above, then it must identify and describe 
itself and its principals or other responsible persons;
    (iii) The identity of the person(s) authorized to make or withdraw a 
bid;
    (iv) If the applicant applies as a designated entity pursuant to 
section 27.210(b), a statement to that effect and a declaration, under 
penalty of perjury, that the applicant is qualified as a designated 
entity under Sec. 27.210(b).
    (v) Certification that the applicant is legally, technically, 
financially and otherwise qualified pursuant to section 308(b) of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended. The Commission will accept 
applications certifying that a request for waiver or other relief from 
the requirements of section 310 is pending;
    (vi) Certification that the applicant is in compliance with the 
foreign ownership provisions of section 310 of the Communications Act of 
1934, as amended;
    (vii) Certification that the applicant is and will, during the 
pendency of its application(s), remain in compliance with any service-
specific qualifications applicable to the licenses on which the 
applicant intends to bid including, but not limited to, financial 
qualifications. The Commission may require certification in certain 
services that the applicant will, following grant of a license, come 
into compliance with certain service-specific rules, including, but not 
limited to, ownership eligibility limitations;
    (viii) An exhibit, certified as truthful under penalty of perjury, 
identifying all parties with whom the applicant has entered into 
partnerships, joint ventures, consortia or other agreements, 
arrangements or understandings of any kind relating to the licenses 
being auctioned, including any such agreements relating to the post-
auction market structure;
    (ix) Certification under penalty of perjury that it has not entered 
and will not enter into any explicit or implicit agreements, 
arrangements or understandings of any kind with any parties other than 
those identified pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(viii) of this section 
regarding the amount of their bids, bidding strategies or the particular 
licenses on which they will or will not bid; and
    (x) Certification under penalty of perjury that it is not in default 
on any Commission licenses and that it is not delinquent on any 
extension of credit from any federal agency.

    Note to paragraph (a):
    The Commission may also request applicants to submit additional 
information for informational purposes to aid in its preparation of 
required reports to Congress.

    (b) Modification and Amendment of Application. Applicants will be 
permitted to amend their Form 175 applications to make minor amendments 
to correct minor errors or defects such as typographical errors. 
Applicants will also be permitted to amend FCC Form 175 to make changes 
to the information required by Sec. 27.204(a) (such as ownership changes 
or changes in the identification of parties to bidding consortia), 
provided such changes do not result in a change in control of the 
applicant and do not involve another applicant (or parties in interest 
to an applicant) who has applied for licenses in any of the same 
geographic license areas as the applicant. Amendments which change 
control of the applicant will be considered major amendments. An FCC 
Form 175 which is amended by a major amendment will be considered to be 
newly filed and cannot be resubmitted after applicable filing deadlines. 
See also Sec. 1.2105 of this chapter.
    (c) Prohibition of collusion. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs 
(c)(2), (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section, after the filing of short-
form applications, all applicants are prohibited from cooperating, 
collaborating, discussing or disclosing in any manner the substance of 
their bids or bidding strategies, or discussing or negotiating 
settlement agreements, with other applicants until after the high bidder 
makes the required down payment, unless such applicants are members of a 
bidding consortium or other joint bidding arrangement identified on the 
bidder's short-form application pursuant to Sec. 27.204(a)(2)(viii).

[[Page 382]]

    (2) Applicants may modify their short-form applications to reflect 
formation of consortia or changes in ownership at any time before or 
during an auction, provided such changes do not result in a change in 
control of the applicant, and provided that the parties forming 
consortia or entering into ownership agreements have not applied for 
licenses in any of the same geographic license areas. Such changes will 
not be considered major modifications of the application.
    (3) After the filing of short-form applications, applicants may make 
agreements to bid jointly for licenses, provided the parties to the 
agreement have not applied for licenses in any of the same geographic 
license areas.
    (4) After the filing of short-form applications, a holder of a non-
controlling attributable interest in an entity submitting a short-form 
application may acquire an ownership interest in, form a consortium 
with, or enter into a joint bidding arrangement with, other applicants 
for licenses in the same geographic license area, provided that:
    (i) The attributable interest holder certifies to the Commission 
that it has not communicated and will not communicate with any party 
concerning the bids or bidding strategies of more than one of the 
applicants in which it holds an attributable interest, or with which it 
has a consortium or joint bidding arrangement, and which have applied 
for licenses in the same geographic license area(s); and
    (ii) The arrangements do not result in any change in control of an 
applicant.
    (5) Applicants must modify their short-form applications to reflect 
any changes in ownership or in the membership of consortia or joint 
bidding arrangements.
    (6) For purposes of this paragraph:
    (i) The term ``applicant'' shall include the entity submitting a 
short-form application to participate in an auction (FCC Form 175), as 
well as all holders of partnership and other ownership interests and any 
stock interest amounting to 5 percent or more of the entity, or 
outstanding stock, or outstanding voting stock of the entity submitting 
a short-form application, and all officers and directors of that entity; 
and
    (ii) The term ``bids or bidding strategies'' shall include capital 
calls or requests for additional funds in support of bids or bidding 
strategies.


<R05>
Sec. 27.205  Submission of upfront payments.

    (a) Each eligible bidder for WCS in the 2305-2320 and 2345-2360 
bands licenses subject to auction shall pay an upfront payment pursuant 
to this chapter and procedures specified by public notice. No interest 
will be paid on upfront payments.
    (b) Upfront payments must be made by wire transfer.
    (c) If the applicant does not submit at least the minimum upfront 
payment, it will be ineligible to bid, its application will be dismissed 
and any upfront payment it has made will be returned.
    (d) The upfront payment(s) of a bidder will be credited toward any 
down payment required for licenses on which the bidder is the high 
bidder. Where the upfront payment amount exceeds the required deposit of 
a winning bidder, the Commission will refund the excess amount after 
determining that no bid withdrawal payments are owed by that bidder.
    (e) In accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this 
section, in the event a payment is assessed pursuant to Sec. 27.203 for 
bid withdrawal or default, upfront payments or down payments on deposit 
with the Commission will be used to satisfy the bid withdrawal or 
default payment before being applied toward any additional payment 
obligations that the high bidder may have.

Sec. 27.206  Submission of down payment and filing of long-form applications.

    (a) After bidding has ended, the Commission will identify and notify 
the high bidder and declare the bidding closed.
    (b) Within ten (10) business days after being notified that it is a 
high bidder on a particular license(s), a high bidder must submit to the 
Commission's lockbox bank such additional funds (the ``down payment'') 
as are necessary

[[Page 383]]

to bring its total deposits (not including upfront payments applied to 
satisfy bid withdrawal or default payments) up to twenty (20) percent of 
its high bid(s). This down payment must be made by wire transfer or 
cashier's check drawn in U.S. dollars from a financial institution whose 
deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and 
must be made payable to the Federal Communications Commission. Down 
payments will be held by the Commission until the high bidder has been 
awarded the license and has paid the remaining balance due on the 
license, in which case it will not be returned, or until the winning 
bidder is found unqualified to be a licensee or has defaulted, in which 
case it will be returned, less applicable payments. No interest will be 
paid on any down payment.
    (c) A high bidder that meets its down payment obligations in a 
timely manner must, within ten (10) business days after being notified 
that it is a high bidder, submit an additional application (the ``long-
form application'') pursuant to the rules governing the service in which 
the applicant is the high bidder. Notwithstanding any other provision in 
title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations to the contrary, high 
bidders need not submit an additional application filing fee with their 
long-form applications. Notwithstanding any other provision in Title 47 
of the Code of Federal Regulations to the contrary, the high bidder's 
long-form application must be mailed or otherwise delivered to: Office 
of the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Attention: Auction 
Application Processing Section, 1919 M Street, NW, Room 222, Washington, 
DC 20554. An applicant that fails to submit the required long-form 
application as required under this section, and fails to establish good 
cause for any late-filed submission, shall be deemed to have defaulted 
and will be subject to the payments set forth in section 27.203.
    (d) As an exhibit to its long-form application, the applicant must 
provide a detailed explanation of the terms and conditions and parties 
involved in any bidding consortia, joint venture, partnership or other 
agreement or arrangement it had entered into relating to the competitive 
bidding process prior to the time bidding was completed. Such agreements 
must have been entered into prior to the filing of short-form 
applications pursuant to Sec. 27.204.


<R05>
Sec. 27.207  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 27.208  License grant, denial, default, and disqualification.

    (a) Unless otherwise specified in these rules, auction winners are 
required to pay the balance of their winning bids in a lump sum within 
ten (10) business days following award of the license. Grant of the 
license will be conditioned on full and timely payment of the winning 
bid.
    (b) If a winning bidder withdraws its bid after the Commission has 
declared competitive bidding closed or fails to remit the required down 
payment within ten (10) business days after the Commission has declared 
competitive bidding closed, the bidder will be deemed to have defaulted, 
its application will be dismissed, and it will be liable for the default 
penalty specified in Sec. 27.203. In such event, the Commission may 
either re-auction the license to existing or new applicants or offer it 
to the other highest bidders (in descending order) at their final bids. 
The down payment obligations set forth in Sec. 27.206(b) will apply.
    (c) A winning bidder who is found unqualified to be a licensee, 
fails to remit the balance of its winning bid in a timely manner, or 
defaults or is disqualified for any reason after having made the 
required down payment, will be deemed to have defaulted and will be 
liable for the payment set forth in Sec. 27.203. In such event, the 
Commission will conduct another auction for the license, affording new 
parties an opportunity to file applications for the license.
    (d) Bidders who are found to have violated the antitrust laws or the 
Commission's rules in connection with their participation in the 
competitive bidding process may be subject, in addition to any other 
applicable sanctions, to forfeiture of their upfront payment, down 
payment or full bid amount, and may be prohibited from participating in 
future auctions.

[62 FR 9658, Mar. 3, 1997, as amended at 63 FR 2349, Jan. 15, 1998; 65 
FR 57268, Sept. 21, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 27.210  Definitions.

    (a) Scope. The definitions in this section apply to Sec. 27.209, 
unless otherwise specified in those sections.
    (b) Small Business; Very Small Business; Consortia.
    (1) A small business is an entity that, together with its affiliates 
and controlling principals, has average annual gross revenues that are 
not more than $40 million for the preceding three years.
    (2) A very small business is an entity that, together with its 
affiliates and controlling principals, has average annual gross revenues 
that are not more than $15 million for the preceding three years.
    (3) For purposes of determining whether an entity meets the $40 
million average annual gross revenues size standard set forth in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section or the $15 million average annual gross 
revenues size standard set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
the gross revenues of the applicant and its affiliates shall be 
considered on a cumulative basis and aggregated subject to the following 
exceptions:
    (i) For purposes of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, 
the personal net worth of an applicant and its affiliates is not 
included in the applicant's gross revenues; and
    (ii) For purposes of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, 
Indian tribes or Alaska Regional or Village Corporations organized 
pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et 
seq.), or entities owned and controlled by such tribes or corporations, 
are not considered affiliates of an applicant (or licensee) that is 
owned and controlled by such tribes, corporations or entities, and that 
otherwise complies with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) 
of this section, except that gross revenues derived from gaming 
activities conducted by affiliated entities pursuant to the Indian 
Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) will be counted in 
determining such applicant's (or licensee's) compliance with the 
financial requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, 
unless such applicant establishes that it will not receive a substantial 
unfair competitive advantage because significant legal constraints 
restrict the applicant's ability to access such gross revenues.
    (4) A consortium of small businesses (or a consortium of very small 
businesses) is a conglomerate organization formed as a joint venture 
between or among mutually independent business firms, each of which 
individually satisfies the definition in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section or each of which satisfies the definition in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section. Where an applicant (or licensee) is a consortium of small 
businesses, the gross revenues of each small business shall not be 
aggregated.
    (c) Gross Revenues. Gross revenues shall mean all income received by 
an entity, whether earned or passive, before any deductions are made for 
costs of doing business (e.g., cost of goods sold), as evidenced by 
audited financial statements for the relevant number of most recently 
completed calendar years, or, if audited financial statements were not 
prepared on a calendar-year basis, for the most recently completed 
fiscal years preceding the filing of the applicant's short-form 
application (Form 175). If an entity was not in existence for all or 
part of the relevant period, gross revenues shall be evidenced by the 
audited financial statements of the entity's predecessor-in-interest or, 
if there is no identifiable

[[Page 385]]

predecessor-in-interest, unaudited financial statements certified by the 
applicant as accurate. When an applicant does not otherwise use audited 
financial statements, its gross revenues may be certified by its chief 
financial officer or its equivalent.
    (d) Affiliate.--(1) Basis for affiliation. An individual or entity 
is an affiliate of an applicant if such individual or entity:
    (i) Directly or indirectly controls or has the power to control the 
applicant;
    (ii) Is directly or indirectly controlled by the applicant;
    (iii) Is directly or indirectly controlled by a third party or 
parties who also control or have the power to control the applicant; or
    (iv) Has an ``identity of interest'' with the applicant.
    (2) Nature of control in determining affiliation. (i) Every business 
concern is considered to have one or more parties who directly or 
indirectly control or have the power to control it. Control may be 
affirmative or negative and it is immaterial whether it is exercised so 
long as the power to control exists.

    Example for paragraph (d)(2)(i). An applicant owning 50 percent of 
the voting stock of another concern would have negative power to control 
such concern since such party can block any action of the other 
stockholders. Also, the bylaws of a corporation may permit a stockholder 
with less than 50 percent of the voting stock to block any actions taken 
by the other stockholders in the other entity. Affiliation exists when 
the applicant has the power to control a concern while at the same time 
another person, or persons, are in control of the concern at the will of 
the party or parties with the power of control.

    (ii) Control can arise through stock ownership; occupancy of 
director, officer, or key employee positions; contractual or other 
business relations; or combinations of these and other factors. A key 
employee is an employee who, because of his/her position in the concern, 
has a critical influence in or substantive control over the operations 
or management of the concern.
    (iii) Control can arise through management positions if the voting 
stock is so widely distributed that no effective control can be 
established.

    Example for paragraph (d)(2)(iii). In a corporation where the 
officers and directors own various size blocks of stock totaling 40 
percent of the corporation's voting stock, but no officer or director 
has a block sufficient to give him/her control or the power to control 
and the remaining 60 percent is widely distributed with no individual 
stockholder having a stock interest greater than 10 percent, management 
has the power to control. If persons with such management control of the 
other entity are controlling principals of the applicant, the other 
entity will be deemed an affiliate of the applicant.

    (3) Identity of interest between and among persons. Affiliation can 
arise between or among two or more persons with an identity of interest, 
such as members of the same family or persons with common investments. 
In determining if the applicant controls or is controlled by a concern, 
persons with an identity of interest will be treated as though they were 
one person.
    (i) Spousal affiliation. Both spouses are deemed to own or control 
or have the power to control interests owned or controlled by either of 
them, unless they are subject to a legal separation recognized by a 
court of competent jurisdiction in the United States.
    (ii) Kinship affiliation. Immediate family members will be presumed 
to own or control or have the power to control interests owned or 
controlled by other immediate family members. In this context 
``immediate family member'' means father, mother, husband, wife, son, 
daughter, brother, sister, father- or mother-in-law, son- or daughter-
in-law, brother- or sister-in-law, step-father or -mother, step-brother 
or -sister, step-son or -daughter, half-brother or -sister. This 
presumption may be rebutted by showing that:
    (A) The family members are estranged;
    (B) The family ties are remote;
    (C) The family members are not closely involved with each other in 
business matters.

    Example for paragraph (d)(3)(ii). A owns a controlling interest in 
Corporation X. A's sister-in-law, B, has a controlling interest in a WCS 
in the 2305-2320 and 2345-2360 bands geographic area license 
application. Because A and B have a presumptive kinship affiliation, A's 
interest in Corporation X is attributable to B, and thus to the 
applicant, unless B rebuts the presumption with the necessary showing.


[[Page 386]]


    (4) Affiliation through stock ownership. (i) An applicant is 
presumed to control or have the power to control a concern if he/she 
owns or controls or has the power to control 50 percent or more of its 
voting stock.
    (ii) An applicant is presumed to control or have the power to 
control a concern even though he/she owns, controls, or has the power to 
control less than 50 percent of the concern's voting stock, if the block 
of stock he/she owns, controls, or has the power to control is large as 
compared with any other outstanding block of stock.
    (iii) If two or more persons each owns, controls or has the power to 
control less than 50 percent of the voting stock of a concern, such 
minority holdings are equal or approximately equal in size, and the 
aggregate of these minority holdings is large as compared with any other 
stock holding, the presumption arises that each one of these persons 
individually controls or has the power to control the concern; however, 
such presumption may be rebutted by a showing that such control or power 
to control, in fact, does not exist.
    (5) Affiliation arising under stock options, convertible debentures, 
and agreements to merge. Stock options, convertible debentures, and 
agreements to merge (including agreements in principle) are generally 
considered to have a present effect on the power to control the concern. 
Therefore, in making a size determination, such options, debentures, and 
agreements will generally be treated as though the rights held 
thereunder had been exercised. However, neither an affiliate nor an 
applicant can use such options and debentures to appear to terminate its 
control over another concern before it actually does so.

    Example 1 for paragraph (d)(5). If company B holds an option to 
purchase a controlling interest in company A, who holds a controlling 
interest in a WCS in the 2305-2320 and 2345-2360 bands geographic area 
license application, the situation is treated as though company B had 
exercised its rights and had become owner of a controlling interest in 
company A. The gross revenues of company B must be taken into account in 
determining the size of the applicant.
    Example 2 for paragraph (d)(5). If a large company, BigCo, holds 70% 
(70 of 100 outstanding shares) of the voting stock of company A, who 
holds a controlling interest in a WCS in the 2305-2320 MHz and 2345-2360 
MHz bands geographic area license application, and gives a third party, 
SmallCo, an option to purchase 50 of the 70 shares owned by BigCo, BigCo 
will be deemed to be an affiliate of company A, and thus the applicant, 
until SmallCo actually exercises its options to purchase such shares. In 
order to prevent BigCo from circumventing the intent of the rule, which 
requires such options to be considered on a fully diluted basis, the 
option is not considered to have present effect in this case.
    Example 3 for paragraph (d)(5). If company A has entered into an 
agreement to merge with company B in the future, the situation is 
treated as though the merger has taken place.

    (6) Affiliation under voting trusts. (i) Stock interests held in 
trust shall be deemed controlled by any person who holds or shares the 
power to vote such stock, to any person who has the sole power to sell 
such stock, and to any person who has the right to revoke the trust at 
will or to replace the trustee at will.
    (ii) If a trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business 
relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary, the stock interests held 
in trust will be deemed controlled by the grantor or beneficiary, as 
appropriate.
    (iii) If the primary purpose of a voting trust, or similar 
agreement, is to separate voting power from beneficial ownership of 
voting stock for the purpose of shifting control of or the power to 
control a concern in order that such concern or another concern may meet 
the Commission's size standards, such voting trust shall not be 
considered valid for this purpose regardless of whether it is or is not 
recognized within the appropriate jurisdiction.
    (7) Affiliation through common management. Affiliation generally 
arises where officers, directors, or key employees serve as the majority 
or otherwise as the controlling element of the board of directors and/or 
the management of another entity.
    (8) Affiliation through common facilities. Affiliation generally 
arises where one concern shares office space and/or employees and/or 
other facilities with another concern, particularly where such concerns 
are in the same or related industry or field of operations, or

[[Page 387]]

where such concerns were formerly affiliated, and through these sharing 
arrangements one concern has control, or potential control, of the other 
concern.
    (9) Affiliation through contractual relationships. Affiliation 
generally arises where one concern is dependent upon another concern for 
contracts and business to such a degree that one concern has control, or 
potential control, of the other concern.
    (10) Affiliation under joint venture arrangements. (i) A joint 
venture for size determination purposes is an association of concerns 
and/or individuals, with interests in any degree or proportion, formed 
by contract, express or implied, to engage in and carry out a single, 
specific business venture for joint profit for which purpose they 
combine their efforts, property, money, skill and knowledge, but not on 
a continuing or permanent basis for conducting business generally. The 
determination whether an entity is a joint venture is based upon the 
facts of the business operation, regardless of how the business 
operation may be designated by the parties involved. An agreement to 
share profits/losses proportionate to each party's contribution to the 
business operation is a significant factor in determining whether the 
business operation is a joint venture.
    (ii) The parties to a joint venture are considered to be affiliated 
with each other.

<R05>
Sec. 27.502  Designated entities.

    (a) Eligibility for small business provisions. (1) A small business 
is an entity that, together with its controlling interests and 
affiliates, has average gross revenues not exceeding $40 million for the 
preceding three years.
    (2) A very small business is an entity that, together with its 
controlling interests and affiliates, has average gross revenues not 
exceeding $15 million for the preceding three years.
    (3) For purposes of determining whether an entity meets either of 
the definitions set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this 
section, the gross revenues of the entity, its controlling interests and 
affiliates shall be considered on a cumulative basis and aggregated. An 
applicant seeking status as a small business or very small business 
under this section must disclose on its short-and long-form 
applications, separately and in the aggregate, the gross revenues of the 
applicant (or licensee), its controlling interests and affiliates for 
each of the previous three years.
    (4) Persons or entities that hold interests in an applicant (or 
licensee) that are affiliates of each other or have an identity of 
interests identified in Sec. 1.2110(b)(4)(iii) of this chapter will be 
treated as though they were one person or entity and their ownership 
interests aggregated for purposes of determining an applicant's (or 
licensee's) compliance with the requirements of this section.
    (5) Where an applicant (or licensee) cannot identify controlling 
interests under the standards set forth in this section, the gross 
revenues of all interest holders in the applicant, and their affiliates, 
will be attributable.
    (6) A consortium of small businesses (or a consortium of very small 
businesses) is a conglomerate organization formed as a joint venture 
between or among mutually independent business firms, each of which 
individually satisfies the definition in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section (or each of which individually satisfies the definition in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section). Where an applicant or licensee is a 
consortium of small businesses (or very small businesses), the gross 
revenues of each small business (or very small business) shall not be 
aggregated.
    (7) Designated entities must describe on their long-form 
applications how they satisfy the requirements for eligibility for 
designated entity status, and must list and summarize on their long-form 
applications all agreements that affect designated entity status such as 
partnership agreements, shareholder agreements, management agreements 
and other agreements, including oral agreements, establishing, as 
applicable, de facto or de jure control of the entity. Such information 
must be maintained at the licensee's facilities or by its designated 
agent for the term of the license in order to enable the Commission to 
audit designated entity eligibility on an ongoing basis.
    (b) Controlling interest. (1) For purposes of this section, a 
controlling interest includes individuals or entities with either de 
jure or de facto control of the applicant. De jure control is evidenced 
by holdings of greater than 50 percent of the voting stock of a 
corporation, or in the case of a partnership, general partnership 
interests. De facto control is determined on a case-by-case basis. An 
entity must disclose its equity interest and demonstrate at least the 
following indicia of control to establish that it retains de facto 
control of the applicant:
    (i) The entity constitutes or appoints more than 50 percent of the 
board of directors or management committee;
    (ii) The entity has authority to appoint, promote, demote, and fire 
senior executives that control the day-to-day activities of the 
licensee; and
    (iii) The entity plays an integral role in management decisions.
    (2) The following rules apply for the calculation of certain 
interests. (i) Ownership interests shall be calculated on a fully 
diluted basis; all agreements such as warrants, stock options, and 
convertible debentures will generally be treated as if the rights 
thereunder already have been fully exercised.

[[Page 389]]

    (ii) Partnership and other ownership interests and any stock 
interest equity, or outstanding stock or outstanding voting stock shall 
be attributed as specified below.
    (iii) Stock interests held in trust shall be attributed to any 
person who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, to any person 
who has the sole power to sell such stock, and to any person who has the 
right to revoke the trust at will or to replace the trustee at will. If 
the trustee has a familial, personal, or extra-trust business 
relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary, the stock interests held 
in trust will be attributed to the grantor or beneficiary, as 
appropriate.
    (iv) Non-voting stock shall be attributed as an interest in the 
issuing entity.
    (v) Limited partnership interests shall be attributed to limited 
partners and shall be calculated according to both the percentage of 
equity paid in and the percentage of distribution of profits and losses.
    (vi) Officers and directors of an entity shall be considered to have 
an attributable interest in the entity. The officers and directors of an 
entity that controls a licensee or applicant shall be considered to have 
an attributable interest in the licensee or applicant.
    (vii) Ownership interests that are held indirectly by any party 
through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by 
successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in 
the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution 
benchmark to the resulting product, except that if the ownership 
percentage for an interest in any link in the chain exceeds 50 percent 
or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were a 100 
percent interest.
    (viii) Any person who manages the operations of an applicant or 
licensee pursuant to a management agreement shall be considered to have 
a controlling interest in such applicant or licensee if such person, or 
its affiliate, has authority to make decisions or otherwise engage in 
practices or activities that determine, or significantly influence:
    (A) The nature or types of services offered by such an applicant or 
licensee;
    (B) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (C) The prices charged for such services.
    (ix) Any licensee or its affiliate who enters into a joint marketing 
arrangement with an applicant or licensee, or its affiliate, shall be 
considered to have a controlling interest, if such applicant or 
licensee, or its affiliate, has authority to make decisions or otherwise 
engage in practices or activities that determine, or significantly 
influence:
    (A) The nature or types of services offered by such an applicant or 
licensee;
    (B) The terms upon which such services are offered; or the prices 
charged for such services.
    (c) Bidding credits. A winning bidder that qualifies as a small 
business or a consortium of small businesses as defined in this section 
may use the bidding credit specified in Sec. 1.2110(e)(2)(iii) of this 
chapter. A winning bidder that qualifies as a very small business or a 
consortium of very small businesses as defined in this section may use 
the bidding credit specified in Sec. 1.2110(e)(2)(ii) of this chapter.

[[Page 390]]

move or change the operating parameters of any of the user's stations 
that are covered under the Guard Band Manager's license without prior 
Commission approval, provided such stations comply with Commission Rules 
and coordination requirements.
    (c)(1) A Guard Band Manager must file a separate station application 
and obtain all appropriate Commission approvals or authorizations prior 
to construction of stations that--
    (i) Require submission of an Environmental Assessment under 
Sec. 1.1307 of this chapter;
    (ii) Require international coordination; or
    (iii) Would affect the radio frequency quiet zones described in 
Sec. 90.177 of this chapter.
    (2) Prior to construction of a station, a Guard Band Manager must 
register with the Commission any station antenna structure for which 
notification to the Federal Aviation Administration is required by part 
17 of this chapter.

    (i) Coordinated a new station or modification of an existing 
station; or
    (ii) Filed an application for an individual station license with the 
Commission.
    (2) The notification required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
must include, at a minimum--
    (i) The frequency or frequencies coordinated;

disaggregates its spectrum, it is required to submit the notification 
required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to other Guard Band 
Managers in the same geographic area.
    (4) Entities coordinated by a Guard Band Manager must wait at least 
10 business days after the notification required in paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section before operating under the Guard Band Manager's license;
    (5) If, in the event of harmful interference, the Guard Band Manager 
is unable to resolve the problem by mutually satisfactory arrangements, 
the Commission may impose restrictions on the operations of any of the 
parties involved.
    (e) Where a deletion, move or change authorized under paragraph (b) 
of this section constitutes a discontinuance, reduction, or impairment 
of service under Sec. 27.66 or where discontinuance, reduction or 
impairment of service results from an involuntary act subject to 
Sec. 27.66(a), the Guard Band Manager must comply with the notification 
and authorization requirements set forth in that section.


<R05>
Sec. 27.602  Guard Band Manager agreements.

    Guard Band Managers are required to enter into written agreements 
regarding the use of their licensed spectrum by others, subject to the 
following conditions:
    (a) The duration of spectrum user agreements may not extend beyond 
the term of the Guard Band Manager's FCC license.
    (b) The spectrum user agreement must specify in detail the operating 
parameters of the spectrum user's system, including power, maximum 
antenna heights, frequencies of operation, base station location(s), 
area(s) of operation, and other parameters specified in Commission rules 
for the use of spectrum identified in Sec. 27.5(b)(1) and (b)(2).
    (c) The spectrum user agreement must require the spectrum user to 
use Commission-approved equipment where appropriate and to complete 
post-construction proofs of system performance prior to system 
activation.
    (d) The spectrum user must agree to operate its system in compliance 
with

[[Page 391]]

all technical specifications for the system contained in the agreement 
and agree to cooperate fully with any investigation or inquiry conducted 
by either the Commission or the Guard Band Manager.
    (e) The spectrum user must agree to comply with all applicable 
Commission rules, and the spectrum user must accept Commission oversight 
and enforcement.
    (f) The spectrum user agreement must stipulate that if the Guard 
Band Manager determines that there is an ongoing violation of the 
Commission's rules or that the spectrum user's system is causing harmful 
interference, the Guard Band Manager shall have the right to suspend or 
terminate operation of the spectrum user's system. The spectrum user 
agreement must stipulate that if the spectrum user refuses to comply 
with a suspension or termination order, the Guard Band Manager will be 
free to use all legal means necessary to enforce the order.
    (g) The spectrum user agreement may not impose unduly restrictive 
requirements on use of the licensed frequencies, including any 
requirement that is not reasonably related to the efficient management 
of the spectrum licensed to the Guard Band Manager.
    (h) Guard Band Managers shall maintain their written agreements with 
spectrum users at their principal place of business, and retain such 
records for at least two years after the date such agreements expire. 
Such records shall be kept current and be made available upon request 
for inspection by the Commission or its representatives.


<R05>
Sec. 27.603  Access to the Guard Band Manager's spectrum.

    (a) A Guard Band Manager may not engage in unjust or unreasonable 
discrimination among spectrum users and may not unreasonably deny 
prospective spectrum users access to the Guard Band Manager's licensed 
spectrum.
    (b) A Guard Band Manager may not impose unduly restrictive 
requirements on use of its licensed frequencies, including any 
requirement that is not reasonably related to the efficient management 
of the spectrum licensed to the Guard Band Manager.
    (c) A Guard Band Manager may lease a reasonable amount of its 
spectrum to an affiliate for the affiliate's own internal use or for the 
affiliate's provision of commercial or private radio services. However, 
a Guard Band Manager must lease the predominant amount of its spectrum 
to non-affiliates.


<R05>
Sec. 27.604  Limitation on licenses won at auction.

    (a) For the first auction of licenses in Blocks A and B, as defined 
in Sec. 27.5, no applicant may be deemed the winning bidder of both a 
Block A and a Block B license in a single geographic service area.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, licenses will be 
deemed to be won by the same bidder if an entity that wins one license 
at the auction is an affiliate of any other entity that wins a license 
at the auction.


<R05>
Sec. 27.605  Geographic partitioning and spectrum disaggregation.

    An entity that acquires a portion of a Guard Band Manager's 
geographic area or spectrum subject to a geographic partitioning or 
spectrum disaggregation agreement under Sec. 27.15 must function as a 
Guard Band Manager and is subject to the obligations and restrictions on 
Guard Band Manager licenses set forth in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 27.606  Complaints against Guard Band Managers.

    Guard Band Managers are expected to resolve disputes with their 
customers or disputes between multiple customers of the Guard Band 
Manager in the same manner that the parties would resolve other 
commercial disputes arising out of the spectrum user agreement. The 
Commission will also consider complaints filed against a Guard Band 
Manager for violating the Communications Act or the Commission's 
regulations or policies. When there is a dispute between a Guard Band 
Manager, or its spectrum user, and a non-contracting party, and the 
Guard Band Manager is unable or unwilling to resolve such dispute in a 
timely fashion, the non-contracting party may file a complaint with the

[[Page 392]]

Commission pursuant to Sec. 1.41 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 27.607  Performance requirements and annual reporting requirement.

    (a) Guard Band Managers are subject to the performance requirements 
specified in Sec. 27.14(a).
    (b) Guard Band Managers are required to file an annual report 
providing the Commission with information about the manner in which 
their spectrum is being utilized. Such reports shall be filed with the 
Commission on a calendar year basis, no later than the March 1 following 
the close of each calendar year, unless another filing date is specified 
by Public Notice.
    (c) Guard Band Managers must, at a minimum, include the following 
information in their annual reports:
    (1) The total number of spectrum users and the number of those users 
that are affiliates of the Guard Band Manager;
    (2) The amount of the Guard Band Manager's spectrum being used by 
the Guard Band Manager's affiliates in any part of the licensed service 
area;
    (3) The amount of Guard Band Manager's spectrum being used pursuant 
to agreements with unaffiliated third parties;
    (4) The nature of the spectrum use of the Guard Band Manager's 
customers; and
    (5) The length of the term of each spectrum user agreement.
    (d) The specific information that Guard Band Managers will provide 
and the procedures that they will follow in submitting their annual 
reports will be announced in a Public Notice issued by the Wireless 
Telecommunications Bureau.

                           Subpart A--Preface


<R05>
Sec. 32.1  Background.

    The revised Uniform System of Accounts (USOA) is a historical 
financial accounting system which reports the results of operational and 
financial events in a manner which enables both management and 
regulators to assess these results within a specified accounting period. 
The USOA also provides the financial community and others with financial 
performance results. In order for an accounting system to fulfill these 
purposes, it must exhibit consistency and stability in financial 
reporting (including the results published for regulatory purposes). 
Accordingly, the USOA has been designed to reflect stable, recurring 
financial data based to the extent regulatory considerations permit upon 
the consistency of the well established body of accounting theories and 
principles commonly referred to as generally accepted accounting 
principles.


<R05>
Sec. 32.2  Basis of the accounts.

    (a) The financial accounts of a company are used to record, in 
monetary terms, the basic transactions which occur. Certain natural 
groupings of these transactions are called (in different contexts) 
transaction cycles, business processes, functions or activities. The 
concept, however, is the same in each case; i.e., the natural groupings 
represent what happens within the company on a consistent and continuing 
basis. This repetitive nature of the natural groupings, over long 
periods of time, lends an element of stability to the financial account 
structure.
    (b) Within the telecommunications industry companies, certain 
recurring functions (natural groupings) do take place in the course of 
providing products and services to customers. These accounts reflect, to 
the extent feasible, those functions. For example, the primary bases of 
the accounts containing the investment in telecommunications plant are 
the functions performed by the assets. In addition, because of the 
anticipated effects of future innovations,

[[Page 396]]

the telecommunications plant accounts are intended to permit 
technological distinctions. Similarly, the primary bases of plant 
operations, customer operations and corporate operations expense 
accounts are the functions performed by individuals. The revenue 
accounts, on the other hand, reflect a market perspective of natural 
groupings based primarily upon the products and services purchased by 
customers.
    (c) In the course of developing the bases for this account 
structure, several other alternatives were explored. It was, for 
example, determined that, because of the variety and continual changing 
of various cost allocation mechanisms, the financial accounts of a 
company should not reflect an a priori allocation of revenues, 
investments or expenses to products or services, jurisdictions or 
organizational structures. (Note also Sec. 32.14 (c) and (d) of subpart 
B.) It was also determined that costs (in the case of assets) should not 
be recorded based solely upon physical attributes such as location, 
description or size.
    (d) Care has been taken in this account structure to avoid confusing 
a function with an organizational responsibility, particularly as it 
relates to the expense accounts. Whereas in the past, specific 
organizations may have performed specific functions, the future 
environment with its increasing mechanization and other changes will 
result in entirely new or restructured organizations. Thus, any 
relationships drawn between organizations and accounts would become 
increasingly meaningless with the passage of time.
    (e) These accounts, then, are intended to reflect a functional and 
technological view of the telecommunications industry. This view will 
provide a stable and consistent foundation for the recording of 
financial data.
    (f) The financial data contained in the accounts, together with the 
detailed information contained in the underlying financial and other 
subsidiary records required by this Commission, will provide the 
information necessary to support separations, cost of service and 
management reporting requirements. The basic account structure has been 
designed to remain stable as reporting requirements change.

<R05>
Sec. 32.12  Records.

    (a) The company's financial records shall be kept in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles to the extent permitted by this 
system of accounts.
    (b) The company's financial records shall be kept with sufficient 
particularity to show fully the facts pertaining to all entries in these 
accounts. The detail records shall be filed in such manner as to be 
readily accessible for examination by representatives of this 
Commission.
    (c) The Commission shall require a company to maintain financial and 
other subsidiary records in such a manner that specific information, of 
a type not warranting disclosure as an account or subaccount, will be 
readily available. When this occurs, or where the full information is 
not otherwise recorded in the general books, the subsidiary records 
shall be maintained in sufficient detail to facilitate the reporting of 
the required specific information. The subsidiary records, in which the 
full details are shown, shall be sufficiently referenced to permit ready 
identification and examination by representatives of this Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 32.13  Accounts--general.

    (a) As a general rule, all accounts kept by reporting companies 
shall conform in numbers and titles to those prescribed herein. However, 
reporting companies may use different numbers for internal purposes when 
separate accounts (or subaccounts) maintained are consistent with the 
title and content of accounts and subaccounts prescribed in this system.
    (1) For Class A reporting companies, accounts which are clearly 
summaries of other accounts or subaccounts are to be used for reporting 
purposes and are not otherwise required to be maintained.
    (2) A company may subdivide any of the accounts prescribed. The 
titles of all such subaccounts shall refer by number or title to the 
controlling account.
    (3) A company may establish temporary or experimental accounts 
without prior notice to the Commission.
    (b) Exercise of the preceding options shall be allowed only if the 
integrity of the prescribed accounts is not impaired.
    (c) As of the date a company becomes subject to the system of 
accounts, the company is authorized to make any such subdivisions, 
reclassifications or consolidations of existing balances as are 
necessary to meet the requirements of this system of accounts.

[[Page 398]]

    (d) Nothing contained in this part shall prohibit or excuse any 
company, receiver, or operating trustee of any carrier from subdividing 
the accounts hereby prescribed for the purpose of:
    (1) Complying with the requirements of the state commission(s) 
having jurisdiction; or
    (2) Securing the information required in the prescribed reports to 
such commission(s).
    (e) Where the use of subsidiary records is considered necessary in 
order to secure the information required in reports to any state 
commission, the company shall incorporate the following controls into 
their accounting system with respect to such subsidiary records:
    (1) Subsidiary records shall be reconciled to the company's general 
ledger or books of original entry, as appropriate.
    (2) The company shall adequately document the accounting procedures 
related to subsidiary records.
    (3) The subsidiary records shall be maintained at an adequate level 
of detail to satisfy state regulators.

<R05>
Sec. 32.14  Regulated accounts.

    (a) In the context of this part, the regulated accounts shall be 
interpreted to include the investments, revenues and expenses associated 
with those telecommunications products and services to which the tariff 
filing requirements contained in Title II of the Communications Act of 
1934, as amended, are applied, except as may be otherwise provided by 
the Commission. Regulated telecommunications products and services are 
thereby fully subject to the accounting requirements as specified in 
Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and as detailed 
in subparts A through F of this part of the Commission's Rules and 
Regulations.
    (b) In addition to those amounts considered to be regulated by the 
provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, those telecommunications 
products and services to which the tariff filing requirements of the 
several state jurisdictions are applied shall be accounted for as 
regulated, except where such treatment is proscribed or otherwise 
excluded from the requirements pertaining to regulated 
telecommunications products and services by this Commission.
    (c) In the application of detailed accounting requirements contained 
in this part, when a regulated activity involves the common or joint use 
of assets and resources in the provision of regulated and nonregulated 
products and services, companies shall account for these activities 
within the accounts prescribed in this system for telephone company 
operations. Assets and expenses shall be subdivided in subsidiary 
records among amounts solely assignable to nonregulated activities, 
amounts solely assignable to regulated activities, and amounts related 
to assets used and expenses incurred jointly or in common, which will be 
allocated between regulated and nonregulated activities. Companies shall 
submit reports identifying regulated and nonregulated amounts in the 
manner and at the times prescribed by this Commission. Nonregulated 
revenue items not qualifying for incidental treatment, as provided in 
Sec. 32.4999(l), shall be recorded in Account 5280, Nonregulated 
operating revenue.
    (d) Other income items which are incidental to the provision of 
regulated products and services shall be accounted for as regulated 
activities.
    (e) All costs and revenues related to the offering of regulated 
products and services which result from arrangements for joint 
participation or apportionment between two or more telephone companies 
(e.g., joint operating agreements, settlement agreements, cost-pooling 
agreements) shall be recorded within the detailed accounts. Under joint 
operating agreements, the creditor will initially charge the entire 
expenses to the appropriate primary accounts. The proportion of such 
expenses borne by the debtor shall be credited by the creditor and 
charged by the debtor to the account initially charge. Any allowances 
for return on property used will be accounted for as provided in Account 
5240, Rent Revenue.
    (f) All items of nonregulated revenue, investment and expense that 
are not

[[Page 399]]

properly includible in the detailed, regulated accounts prescribed in 
subparts A through F of this part, as determined by paragraphs (a) 
through (e) of this section shall be accounted for and included in 
reports to this Commission as specified in Sec. 32.23 of this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 32.15  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 32.16  Changes in accounting standards.

    (a) The company's records and accounts shall be adjusted to apply 
new accounting standards prescribed by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board or successor authoritative accounting standard-setting 
groups, in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting 
principles. The change in an accounting standard will automatically take 
effect 90 days after the company informs this Commission of its 
intention to follow the new standard, unless the Commission notifies the 
company to the contrary. Concurrent with informing this Commission of 
its intent to adopt an accounting standards change, the company shall 
also file a revenue requirement study for the current year analyzing the 
effects of the accounting standards change. Furthermore, any change 
subsequently adopted shall be disclosed in annual reports to this 
Commission.
    (b) The changes in accounting standards which this Commission 
approves will not necessarily be binding on the ratemaking practices of 
the various state commissions.

<R05>
Sec. 32.17  Interpretation of accounts.

    To the end that uniform accounting shall be maintained within the 
prescribed system, questions involving matters of significant which are 
not clearly provided for shall be submitted to the Chief, Common Carrier 
Bureau, for explanation, interpretation, or resolution. Questions and 
answers thereto with respect to this system of accounts will be 
maintained by the Common Carrier Bureau.


<R05>
Sec. 32.18  Waivers.

    A waiver from any provision of this system of accounts shall be made 
by the Federal Communications Commission upon its own initiative or upon 
the submission of written request therefor from any telecommunications 
company, or group of telecommunications companies, provided that such a 
waiver is in the public interest and each request for waiver expressly 
demonstrates that: existing peculiarities or unusual circumstances 
warrant a departure from a prescribed procedure or technique; a 
specifically defined alternative procedure or technique will result in a 
substantially equivalent or more accurate portrayal of operating results 
or financial condition, consistent with the principles embodied in the 
provisions of this system of accounts; and the application of such 
alternative procedure will maintain or improve uniformity in substantive 
results as among telecommunications companies.


<R05>
Sec. 32.19  Address for reports and correspondence.

    Reports, statements, and correspondence submitted to the Federal 
Communications Commission in accordance with or relating to instructions 
and requirements contained herein shall be addressed to the Common 
Carrier Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554.


<R05>
Sec. 32.20  Numbering convention.

    (a) The number ``32'' (appearing to the left of the first decimal 
point) indicates the part number.
    (b) The numbers immediately following to the right of the decimal 
point indicate, respectively, the section or account. All Part 32 
Account numbers contain 4 digits to-the-right-of the decimal point.
    (c) Cross references to accounts are made by citing the account 
numbers to the right of the decimal point; e.g., Account 2232 rather 
than the corresponding complete part 32 reference number 32.2232.


<R05>
Sec. 32.21  Sequence of accounts.

    The order in which the accounts are presented in this system of 
accounts is

[[Page 400]]

not to be considered as necessarily indicative of the order in which 
they will be scheduled at all times in reports to this Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 32.22  Comprehensive interperiod tax allocation.

    (a) Companies shall apply interperiod tax allocation (tax 
normalization) to all book/tax temporary differences which would be 
considered material for published financial report purposes. 
Furthermore, companies shall also apply interperiod tax allocation if 
any item or group of similar items when aggregated would yield debit or 
credit entries which exceed or would exceed 5 percent of the gross 
deferred income tax expense debits or credits during any calendar year 
over the life of the temporary difference. The tax effects of book/tax 
temporary differences shall be normalized and the deferrals shall be 
included in the following accounts:

4100, Net Current Deferred Operating Income Taxes;
4110, Net Current Deferred Nonoperating Income Taxes;
4340, Net Noncurrent Deferred Operating Income Taxes;
4350, Net Noncurrent Deferred Nonoperating Income Taxes.

    In lieu of the accounting prescribed herein, any company shall treat 
the increase or reduction in current income taxes payable resulting from 
the use of flow through accounting in prior years as an increase or 
reduction in current tax expense.
    (b) Supporting documentation shall be maintained so as to separately 
identify the amount of deferred taxes which arise from the use of an 
accelerated method of depreciation.
    (c) Subsidiary records shall be used to reduce the deferred tax 
assets contained in the accounts specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section when it is likely that some portion or all of the deferred tax 
asset will not be realized. The amount recorded in the subsidiary record 
should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that 
is likely to be realized.
    (d) The records supporting the activity in the deferred income tax 
accounts shall be maintained in sufficient detail to identify the nature 
of the specific temporary differences giving rise to both the debits and 
credits to the individual accounts.
    (e) Any company that uses accelerated depreciation (or recognizes 
taxable income or losses upon the retirement of property) for income tax 
purposes shall normalize the tax differentials occasioned thereby as 
indicated in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.
    (1) With respect to the retirement of property the book/tax 
difference between (i) the recognition of proceeds as income and the 
accrual for salvage value and (ii) the book and tax capital recovery, 
shall be normalized.
    (2) Records shall be maintained so as to show the deferred tax 
amounts by vintage year separately for each class or subclass of 
eligible depreciable telephone plant for which an accelerated method of 
depreciation has been used for income tax purposes. When property is 
transferred to nonregulated activities, the associated deferred income 
taxes and unamortized investment tax credits shall also be identified 
and transferred to the appropriate nonregulated accounts.
    (f) The tax differentials to be normalized as specified in this 
section shall also encompass the additional effect of state and local 
income tax changes on Federal income taxes produced by the provision for 
deferred state and local income taxes for book/tax temporary differences 
related to such income taxes.
    (g) Companies that receive the tax benefits from the filing of a 
consolidated income tax return by the parent company, (pursuant to 
closing agreements with the Internal Revenue Service, effective January 
1, 1966) representing the deferred income taxes from the elimination of 
intercompany profits for income tax purposes on sales of regulated 
equipment, may credit such deferred taxes directly to the plant account 
which contains such intercompany profit rather than crediting such 
deferred taxes to the applicable accounts in paragraph (a) of this 
section. If the deferred income taxes are recorded as a reduction of the 
appropriate plant accounts, such reduction shall be treated as reducing 
the

[[Page 401]]

original cost of the plant and accounted for as such.

[51 FR 43499, Dec. 2, 1986, as amended at 59 FR 9418, Feb. 28, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 32.23  Nonregulated activities.

    (a) This section describes the accounting treatment of activities 
classified for accounting purposes as ``nonregulated.'' Preemptively 
deregulated activities and activities (other than incidental activities) 
never subject to regulation will be classified for accounting purposes 
as ``nonregulated.'' Activities that qualify for incidental treatment 
under the policies of this Commission will be classified for accounting 
purposes as regulated activities. Activities that have been deregulated 
by a state will be classified for accounting purposes as regulated 
activities. Activities that have been deregulated at the interstate 
level, but not preemptively deregulated, will be classified for 
accounting purposes as regulated activities until such time as this 
Commission decides otherwise. The treatment of nonregulated activities 
shall differ depending on the extent of the common or joint use of 
assets and resources in the provision of both regulated and nonregulated 
products and services.
    (b) When a nonregulated activity does not involve the joint or 
common use of assets and resources in the provision of both regulated 
and nonregulated products and services, carriers shall account for these 
activities on a separate set of books consistent with instructions set 
forth in Secs. 32.1406 and 32.7990. Transfers of assets, and sales of 
products and services between the regulated activity and a nonregulated 
activity for which a separate set of books is maintained, shall be 
accounted for in accordance with the rules presented in Sec. 32.27, 
Transactions with Affiliates. In the separate set of books, carriers may 
establish whatever detail they deem appropriate beyond what is necessary 
to provide this Commission with the information required in 
Secs. 32.1406 and 32.7990.
    (c) When a nonregulated activity does involve the joint or common 
use of assets and resources in the provision of regulated and 
nonregulated products and services, carriers shall account for these 
activities within accounts prescribed in this system for telephone 
company operations. Assets and expenses shall be subdivided in 
subsidiary records among amounts solely assignable to nonregulated 
activities, amounts solely assignable to regulated activities, and 
amounts related to assets and expenses incurred jointly or in common, 
which will be allocated between regulated and nonregulated activities. 
Carriers shall submit reports identifying regulated and nonregulated 
amounts in the manner and at the times prescribed by this Commission. 
Nonregulated revenue items not qualifying for incidental treatment as 
provided in Sec. 32.4999(l) of this part, shall be recorded in separate 
subsidiary record categories of Account 5280, Nonregulated operating 
revenue. Amounts assigned or allocated to regulated products or services 
shall be subject to part 36 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 32.24  Compensated absences.

    (a) Companies shall record a liability and charge the appropriate 
expense accounts for compensated absences (vacations, sick leave, etc.) 
in the year in which these benefits are earned by employees.
    (b) With respect to the liability that exists for compensated 
absences which is not yet recorded on the books as of the effective date 
of this part, the liability shall be recorded in Account 4120, Other 
Accrued Liabilities, with a corresponding entry to Account 1439, 
Deferred Charges. This deferred charge shall be amortized on a straight 
line basis over a period of ten years.
    (c) Records shall be maintained so as to show that no more than ten 
percent of the deferred charge is being amortized each year.


<R05>
Sec. 32.25  Unusual items and contingent liabilities.

    Extraordinary items, prior period adjustments, and contingent 
liabilities may be recorded in the company's books of account without 
prior Commission approval.

<R05>
Sec. 32.26  Materiality.

    Companies shall follow this system of accounts in recording all 
financial and statistical data irrespective of an individual item's 
materiality under GAAP, unless a waiver has been granted under the 
provisions of Sec. 32.18 of this subpart to do otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 32.27  Transactions with affiliates.

    (a) Unless otherwise approved by the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, 
transactions with affiliates involving asset transfers into or out of 
the regulated accounts shall be recorded by the carrier in its regulated 
accounts as provided in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.
    (b) Assets sold or transferred between a carrier and its affiliate 
pursuant to a tariff, including a tariff filed with a state commission, 
shall be recorded in the appropriate revenue accounts at the tariffed 
rate. Non-tariffed assets sold or transferred between a carrier and its 
affiliate that qualify for prevailing price valuation, as defined in 
paragraph (d) of this section, shall be recorded at the prevailing 
price. For all other assets sold by or transferred from a carrier to its 
affiliate, the assets shall be recorded at the higher of fair market 
value and net book cost. For all other assets purchased by or transfered 
to a carrier from its affiliate, the assets shall be recorded at the 
lower of fair market value and net book cost. For purposes of this 
section carriers are required to make a good faith determination of fair 
market value.
    (c) Services provided between a carrier and its affiliate pursuant 
to a tariff, including a tariff filed with a state commission, shall be 
recorded in the appropriate revenue accounts at the tariffed rate. Non-
tariffed services provided between a carrier and its affiliate pursuant 
to publicly-filed agreements submitted to a state commission pursuant to 
section 252(e) of the Communications Act of 1934 or statements of 
generally available terms pursuant to section 252(f) shall be recorded 
using the charges appearing in such publicly-filed agreements or 
statements. Non-tariffed services provided between a carrier and its 
affiliate that qualify for prevailing price valuation, as defined in 
paragraph (d) of this section, shall be recorded at the prevailing 
price. For all other services provided by a carrier to its affiliate, 
the services shall be recorded at the higher of fair market value and 
fully distributed cost. For all other services received by a carrier 
from its affiliate, the service shall be recorded at the lower of fair 
market value and fully distributed cost. For purposes of this section, 
carriers are required to make a good faith determination of fair market 
value for a service when the total aggregate annual value of that 
service reaches or exceeds $500,000. When a carrier reaches or exceeds 
the $500,000 threshold for a particular service for the first time, the 
carrier must perform the market valuation and value the transaction in 
accordance with the affiliate transactions rules on a going-forward 
basis. All services received by a carrier from its affiliate(s) that 
exist solely to provide services to members of the carrier's corporate 
family shall be recorded at fully distributed cost.
    (d) In order to qualify for prevailing price valuation in paragraphs 
(b) and (c) of this section, sales of a particular asset or service to 
third parties must encompass greater than 50 percent of the total 
quantity of such product or service sold by an entity. Carriers shall 
apply this 50 percent threshold on a asset-by-asset and service-by-
service basis, rather than on a product line or service line basis. In 
the case of transactions for assets and services subject to section 272, 
a BOC may record such transactions at prevailing price regardless of 
whether the 50 percent threshold has been satisfied.
    (e) Income taxes shall be allocated among the regulated activities 
of the carrier, its nonregulated divisions, and members of an affiliated 
group. Under circumstances in which income taxes are determined on a 
consolidated basis by the carrier and other members of the affiliated 
group, the income tax expense to be recorded by the carrier shall be the 
same as would result if determined for the carrier separately for all 
time periods, except that the tax effect of carry-back and carry-forward 
operating losses, investment tax credits, or other tax credits generated 
by

[[Page 403]]

operations of the carrier shall be recorded by the carrier during the 
period in which applied in settlement of the taxes otherwise 
attributable to any member, or combination of members, of the affiliated 
group.
    (f) Companies that employ average schedules in lieu of actual costs 
are exempt from the provisions of this section. For other organizations, 
the principles set forth in this section shall apply equally to 
corporations, proprietorships, partnerships and other forms of business 
organizations.

accounts charged with the cost of such construction. Amounts of non-
recurring reimbursements based on the cost of plant or equipment 
furnished in rendering service to a customer shall be credited to the 
accounts charged with the cost of the plant or equipment. Amounts 
received for construction which are ultimately to be repaid wholly or in 
part, shall be credited to Account 4360, Other Deferred Credits; when 
final determination has been made as to the amount to be returned, any 
unrefunded amounts shall be credited to the accounts charged with the 
cost of such construction. Amounts received for the construction of 
plant, the ownership of which rests with or will revert to others, shall 
be credited to the accounts charged with the cost of such construction. 
(Note also Account 7110, Income from Custom Work.)
    (3) When telecommunications plant ordinarily having a service life 
of more than one year is installed for temporary use in providing 
telecommunications service, it shall be accounted for in the same manner 
as plant having a service life of more than one year. This includes 
temporary installations of plant (such as poles, wire and cable) 
installed to maintain service during the progress of highway 
reconstruction or during interruptions due to storms or other 
casualties, equipment used for the training of operators, equipment used 
to provide intercepting positions in central offices to handle traffic 
for a short period following extensive system changes and similar 
installations of property used to provide telecommunications service.
    (4) The cost of the individual items of equipment, classifiable to 
Accounts 2112, Motor vehicles; 2113, Aircraft; 2114, Special purpose 
vehicles; 2115, Garage work equipment; 2116, Other work equipment; 2122, 
Furniture; 2123, Office equipment; 2124, General purpose computers, 
costing $2,000 or less or having a life of less than one year shall be 
charged to the applicable expense accounts, except for personal 
computers falling within Account 2124. Personal computers classifiable 
to Account 2124, with a total cost for all components of $500 or less, 
shall be charged to the applicable Plant Specific Operations Expense 
accounts. If the aggregate investment in the items is relatively large 
at the time of acquisition, such amounts shall be maintained in an 
applicable material and supplies account until items are used.
    (b) Telecommunications plant acquired. (1) Property, plant and 
equipment acquired from an entity, whether or not affiliated with the 
accounting company, shall be accounted for at original cost, except that 
property, plant and equipment acquired from a nonaffiliated entity shall 
be accounted for at acquisition cost if the purchase price is less than 
$100,000 for Class A companies or $25,000 for Class B companies.
    (2) The accounting for property, plant and equipment to be recorded 
at original cost shall be as follows:
    (i) The amount of money paid (or current money value of any 
consideration other than money exchanged) for the property (together 
with preliminary expenses incurred in connection with

[[Page 411]]

the acquisition) shall be charged to Account 1439, Deferred Charges.
    (ii) The original cost, estimated if not known, of 
telecommunications plant, governmental franchises and other similar 
rights acquired shall be charged to the applicable telecommunications 
plant accounts, Telecommunications Plant Under Construction, and 
Property Held For Future Telecommunications Use, as appropriate, and 
credited to Account 1439. When the actual original cost cannot be 
determined and estimates are used, the company shall be prepared to 
furnish the Commission with the particulars of such estimates.
    (iii) Depreciation and amortization of plant acquired shall be 
credited to Account 3100, Accumulated Depreciation, or Account 3200, 
Accumulated Depreciation--Held for Future Telecommunications Use, 3400, 
Accumulated Amortization--Tangible, 3410, Accumulated Amortization--
Capitalized Leases, 3420, Accumulated Amortization--Leasehold 
Improvements, 3500, Accumulated Amortization--Intangibles, and 3600, 
Accumulated Amortization--Other, and debited to Account 1439.
    (iv) Any amount remaining in Account 1439, applicable to the plant 
acquired, shall, upon completion of the entries provided in paragraphs 
(b)(2) (i), (ii) and (iii) of this section, be debited or credited, as 
applicable, to Account 2007, Goodwill, or to Account 2005, 
Telecommunications Plant Adjustment, as appropriate.
    (3) A memorandum record shall be kept showing the amount of 
contributions in aid of construction applicable to the property acquired 
as shown by the accounts of the previous owner.
    (c) Cost of construction. (1) Telecommunications plant represents an 
economic resource which will be used to provide future services, the 
cost of which will be allocated in a rational and systematic manner to 
the future periods in which it provides benefits. In accounting for 
construction costs, the utility shall charge to the telecommunications 
plant accounts, where applicable, all direct and indirect costs.
    (2) Direct and indirect costs shall include, but not be limited to:
    (i) ``Labor'' includes the wages and expenses of employees directly 
engaged in or in direct charge of construction work. It includes 
expenses directly related to an employee's wages, such as worker's 
compensation insurance, payroll taxes, benefits and other similar items 
of expense.
    (ii) ``Engineering'' includes the portion of the wages and expenses 
of engineers, draftsmen, inspectors, and their direct supervision 
applicable to construction work. It includes expenses directly related 
to an employee's wages, such as worker's compensation insurance, payroll 
taxes, benefits and other similar items of expense.
    (iii) ``Material and supplies'' includes the purchase price of 
material used at the point of free delivery plus the costs of 
inspection, loading and transportation, and an equitable portion of 
provisioning expense. In determining the cost of material used, proper 
allowance shall be made for unused material, for material recovered from 
temporary structures used in performing the work involved, and for 
discounts allowed and realized in the purchase of material. This item 
does not include construction material that is stolen or rendered 
unusable due to vandalism. Such material should be charged to the 
applicable plant specific operations expense accounts.
    (iv) ``Transportation'' includes the cost of transporting employees, 
material and supplies, tools and other work equipment to and from the 
physical construction location. It includes amounts paid therefor to 
other companies or individuals and the cost of using the company's own 
motor vehicles or other transportation equipment.
    (v) ``Contract work'' includes amounts paid for work performed under 
contract or other agreement by other companies, firms or individuals; 
engineering and supervision applicable to such work; cost incident to 
the award of contracts; and the inspection of such work. The cost of 
construction work performed by affiliated companies and other details 
relating thereto shall be available from the work in progress and 
supporting records.
    (vi) ``Protection'' includes the cost of protecting the company's 
property

[[Page 412]]

from fire or other casualties and the cost of preventing damages to 
others or the property of others.
    (vii) ``Privileges, Permits, and Rights of way'' includes such costs 
incurred in obtaining these privileges, permits, or rights of way in 
connection with construction work, such as for use of private property, 
streets or highways. The cost of such privileges and permits shall be 
included in the cost of the work for which the privileges or permits are 
obtained, except for costs includable in Account 2111, Land, and Account 
2690, Intangibles.
    (viii) ``Taxes'' includes taxes properly includable in construction 
costs before the facilities are completed for service, which taxes are 
assessed separately from taxes on operating property or under conditions 
that permit separate identification of the amount chargeable to 
construction.
    (ix) ``Special machine service'' includes the cost of labor 
expended, materials and supplies consumed and other expenses incurred in 
the maintenance, operation and use of special and other labor saving 
machines (other than transportation equipment (such as trenching 
equipment, cable plows and pole setting trucks. Also included are 
expenditures for rental, maintenance and operation of such machines 
owned by others. When a construction job requires the purchase of 
special machines, the cost thereof, less the appraised or salvage value 
at the time of release from the job, shall be included in the cost of 
construction.
    (x) Allowance for funds used during construction (``AFUDC'') 
provides for the cost of financing the construction of 
telecommunications plant. AFUDC shall be charged to Account 2003, 
Telecommunications Plant Under Construction, and credited to Account 
7340. The rate for calculating AFUDC shall be determined as follows: If 
financing plans associate a specific new borrowing with an asset, the 
rate on that borrowing may be used for the asset; if no specific new 
borrowing is associated with an asset or if the average accumulated 
expenditures for the asset exceed the amounts of specific new borrowing 
associated with it, the capitalization rate to be applied to such excess 
shall be weighted average of the rates applicable to other borrowing of 
the enterprise. The amount of interest cost capitalized in an accounting 
period shall not exceed the total amount of interest cost incurred by 
the company in that period.
    (xi) ``Insurance'' includes premiums paid specifically for 
protection against loss and damage in connection with the construction 
of telecommunications plant due to fire or other casualty, injury to or 
death of employees or others, damages to property of others, 
defalcations of employees and agents and the non-performance of 
contractual obligations of others.
    (xii) ``Construction services'' include the cost of telephone, 
electricity, power, construction quarters, office space and equipment 
directly related to the construction project.
    (xiii) ``Indirect construction costs'' shall include indirect costs 
such as general engineering, supervision and support. Such costs, in 
addition to direct supervision, shall include indirect plant operations 
and engineering supervision up to, but not including, supervision by 
executive officers whose pay and expenses are chargeable to Account 
6711, Executive. The records supporting the entries for indirect 
construction costs shall be kept so as to show the nature of the 
expenditures, the individual jobs and accounts charged, and the bases of 
the distribution. The amounts charged to each plant account for indirect 
costs shall be readily determinable. The instructions contained herein 
shall not be interpreted as permitting the addition to plant of amounts 
to cover indirect costs based on arbitrary allocations.
    (xiv) The cost of construction shall not include any amounts 
classifiable as Corporate Operations Expense.
    (d) Telecommunications plant retired. (1) Telecommunications plant 
accounts shall at all times disclose the original cost of all property 
in service. When any item of property subject to plant retirement 
accounting is worn out, lost, sold, destroyed, abandoned, surrendered 
upon lapse of title, becomes permanently unserviceable, is withdrawn or 
for any other reason is retired from service, the plant accounts 
applicable to that item shall be credited

[[Page 413]]

with the original cost of the plant retired whether replaced or not 
(except as provided for minor items in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this 
section). Normally, these retirement credits with respect to such plant 
as entire buildings, entire central offices, all plant abandoned and any 
large sections of plant withdrawn from service, shall be entered in the 
accounts for the month in which use of the property ceased. For any 
other plant withdrawn from service, the retirement credits shall be 
entered no later than the next succeeding month. Literal compliance with 
the provision for timing of entries with respect to property amounting 
to less than $50,000 retired under any one project is not required if an 
unreasonable amount of recordkeeping and estimating of quantities, 
original costs and salvage is necessary. The retirement entry shall 
refer to the continuing property record, or records supplemental 
thereto, from which the cost was obtained (note also paragraph (d)(3) of 
this section). Every company shall establish procedures which will 
ensure compliance with these requirements.
    (2) To avoid undue refinement, depreciable telecommunications plant 
shall be accounted for as follows:
    (i) Retirement units: This group includes major items of property, a 
representative list of which shall be prescribed by this Commission. In 
lieu of the retirement units prescribed with respect to a particular 
account, a company may, after obtaining specific approval by this 
Commission, establish and maintain its own list of retirement units for 
a portion or all of the plant in any such account. For items included on 
the retirement units list, the original cost of any such items retired 
shall be credited to the plant account and charged to Account 3100, 
Accumulated Depreciation, whether or not replaced. The original cost of 
retirement units installed in place of property retired shall be charged 
to the applicable telecommunications plant account.
    (ii) Minor items: This group includes any part or element of plant 
which is not designated as a retirement unit. The original cost of a 
minor item of property when included in the specific or average cost for 
a retirement unit or units requires no separate credit to the 
telecommunications plant account when such a minor item is retired. The 
cost of replacement shall be charged to the account applicable for the 
cost of repairs of the property. However, if the replacement effects a 
substantial betterment (the primary aim of which is to make the property 
affected more useful, of greater durability, of greater capacity or more 
economical in operation), the excess cost of such a replacement, over 
the estimated cost at the then current prices of replacement without 
betterment of the minor items being retired, shall be charged to the 
applicable telecommunications plant account.
    (3) The cost of property to be retired shall be the amount at which 
property is included in the telecommunications plant accounts. However, 
when it is impracticable to determine the cost of each item due to the 
relatively large number or small cost of such items, the average cost of 
all the items covered by an appropriate subdivision of the account shall 
be used in determining the cost to be assigned to such items when 
retired. The method used in determining average cost must give due 
regard to the quantity, vintage, size and kind of items, the area in 
which they were installed and their classification in other respects. 
Average cost may be applied in retirement of such items as poles, wire, 
cable, cable terminals, conduit and booths. Any company may use average 
cost of property installed in a year or band of years as approved by the 
Commission. It should be understood, however, that the use of average 
costs shall not relieve the company of the requirement for maintaining 
its continuing property records to show, where practicable, dates of 
installation and removal for purposes of mortality studies. (See 
Sec. 32.2000(f) of this subpart, Standard Practices for Establishing and 
Maintaining Continuing Property Records.)
    (4) The accounting for the retirement of property, plant and 
equipment shall be as provided above except:
    (i) Amounts included in Account 2005, Telecommunications Plant 
Adjustment; Account 2680, Amortizable Tangible Assets; Account 2681, 
Capital

[[Page 414]]

Leases; Account 2682, Leasehold Improvements; Account 2690, Intangibles; 
and any amounts associated with amortizable leaseholds, easements, and 
similar rights in land included in Account 2111, Land, shall be debited, 
as appropriate, to Account 3400, 3410, 3420, 3500, or 3600, and credited 
to the applicable accounts.
    (ii) Amounts in Account 2111, Land, and amounts for works of art 
recorded in Account 2122, Furniture, shall be treated at disposition as 
a gain or loss and shall be credited or debited to Account 7150, Gains 
and Losses from Disposition of Land and Artwork, as applicable. If land 
or artwork is retained by the company and held for sale, the cost shall 
be charged to Account 2006, Nonoperating Plant.
    (5) When the telecommunications plant is sold together with traffic 
associated therewith, the original cost of the property shall be 
credited to the applicable plant accounts and the estimated amounts 
carried with respect thereto in the accumulated depreciation and 
amortization accounts shall be charged to such accumulated accounts. The 
difference, if any, between the net amount of such debit and credit 
items and the consideration received (less commissions and other 
expenses of making the sale) for the property shall be included in 
Account 7350, Gains and Losses from Disposition of Certain Property. The 
accounting for depreciable telecommunications plant sold without the 
traffic associated therewith shall be in accordance with the accounting 
provided in Sec. 32.3100(c) of this subpart.
    (e) Basic property records. (1) The basic property records are that 
portion of the total property accounting system which preserves the 
following detailed information:
    (i) The identity, vintage, location and original cost of units of 
property;
    (ii) Original and ongoing transactional data (plant account 
activity) in terms of such units; and
    (iii) Any other specific financial and cost accounting information 
not properly warranting separate disclosure as an account or subaccount 
but which is needed to support regulatory, cost, tax, management and 
other specific accounting information needs and requirements.
    (2) The basic property records must be: (i) Subject to internal 
accounting controls, (ii) auditable, (iii) equal in the aggregate to the 
total investment reflected in the financial property control accounts as 
well as the total of the cost allocations supporting the determination 
of cost-of-service at any particular point in time, and (iv) maintained 
throughout the life of the property.
    (3) The basic property records shall consist of (i) continuing 
property records and (ii) records supplemental thereto which together 
reveal clearly, by accounting area, the detailed and systematically 
summarized information necessary to meet fully the requirements of 
paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.
    (4) Companies shall establish and maintain basic property records 
for each class of property recorded in the several plant accounts which 
comprise the balance sheet Account 2001, Telecommunications Plant In 
Service, Account 2002, Property Held for Future Telecommunications Use, 
and Account 2006, Nonoperating Plant.
    (5) The company shall notify the Commission of a plan for the basic 
property record as follows:
    (i) Not later than June 30 of the year following that in which it 
becomes subject to this system of accounts, the company shall file with 
the Commission two (2) copies of a complete plan of the method to be 
used in the compilation of a basic property record with respect to each 
class of property. The plan shall include a list of proposed accounting 
areas accompanied by description of the boundaries of each area as 
defined in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 32.2000(f)(1) (i) 
and (ii) of this subpart. The plan shall also include a list of property 
record units proposed for use under each regulated plant account. These 
property record units shall be selected such that the requirements of 
Sec. 32.2000(f)(2) (i), (ii) and (iii) of this subpart can be satisfied.
    (ii) The company shall submit to the Commission one copy of any 
major proposed changes in its basic property record plan at least 30 
days before the effective date of the proposed changes.

[[Page 415]]

    (6) The company shall prepare and maintain the basic property record 
as follows:
    (i) Not later than June 30 of the year following that in which the 
company becomes subject to this system of accounts, begin the 
preparation of a basic property record.
    (ii) Complete within two years of the prescribed beginning date, 
basic property records for all property as of the end of the preceding 
calendar year.
    (iii) Promptly process in the basic property records all property 
changes affecting periods subsequent to initial establishment of the 
basic property record.
    (7) The basic property record components (see paragraph (c) of this 
section) shall be arranged in conformity with the regulated plant 
accounts prescribed in this section of accounts as follows:
    (i) The continuing property records shall be compiled on the basis 
of original cost (or other book cost consistent with this system of 
accounts). The continuing property records shall be maintained as 
prescribed in Sec. 32.2000(f)(2)(iii) of this subpart in such manner as 
will meet the following basic objectives:
    (A) Provide for the verification of property record units by 
physical examination.
    (B) Provide for accurate accounting for retirements.
    (C) Provide data for use in connection with depreciation studies.
    (ii) The records supplemental to the continuing property records 
shall disclose such service designations, usage measurement criteria, 
apportionment factors, or other data as may be prescribed by the 
Commission in this part or other parts of its Rules and Regulations. 
Such data are subject to the same general controls and standards for 
auditability and support as are all other elements of the basic property 
records.
    (f) Standard practices for establishing and maintaining continuing 
property records--(1) Accounting area. (i) The continuing property 
record, as related to each primary plant account, shall be established 
and maintained by subaccounts for each accounting area. An accounting 
area is the smallest territory of the company for which accounting 
records of investment are maintained for all plant accounts within the 
area. Areas already established for administrative, accounting, 
valuation, or other purposes may be adopted for this purpose when 
appropriate. In no case shall the boundaries of accounting areas cross 
either State lines or boundaries prescribed by the Commission.
    (ii) In determining the limit of each area, consideration shall be 
given to the quantities of property, construction conditions, operating 
districts, county and township lines, taxing district boundaries, city 
limits, and other political or geographical limits, in order that the 
area adopted may have maximum adaptability, within the confines of 
practicability, for both the company's purpose and those of Federal, 
State, and municipal authorities.
    (2) Property record units. (i) In each of the established accounting 
areas, the ``property record units'' which are to be maintained in the 
continuing property record shall be set forth separately, classified by 
size and type with the amount of original cost (or other appropriate 
book cost) associated with such units. When a list of property record 
units has been accepted by the Commission, they shall become the units 
referred to in this statement of standard practices. Such units shall 
apply to only the regulated portion of this system of accounts.
    (ii) When it is found necessary to revise this list because of the 
addition of units used in providing new types of service, or new units 
resulting from improvements in technology, or because of the grouping or 
elimination of units which no longer merit separate recognition as 
property record units, one copy of such changes shall be submitted to 
the Commission. Upon appropriate showing by the company, the Commission 
may specifically exempt the company from these filing requirements.
    (iii) The continuing property record shall reveal the description, 
location, date of placement, the essential details of construction, and 
the original cost (note also Sec. 32.2000(f)(3) of this subpart) of the 
property record units. The continuing property record and other 
underlying records of construction costs shall be so maintained that, 
upon retirement of one or more retirement

[[Page 416]]

units or of minor items without replacement when not included in the 
costs of retirement units, the actual cost or a reasonably accurate 
estimate of the cost of the plant retired can be determined.
    (3) Methods of determining original cost of property record units. 
The original cost of the property record units shall be determined by 
analyses of the construction costs incurred as shown by completion 
reports and other data, accumulated in the respective construction work 
orders or authorizations. Costs shall be allocated to and associated 
with the property record units to facilitate accounting for retirements. 
The original cost of property record units shall be determined by unit 
identification or averaging as described in paragraphs (f)(3) (i) and 
(ii) of this section.
    (i) Unit identification. Cost shall be identified and maintained by 
specific location for property record units contained within certain 
regulated plant accounts or account groupings such as Land, Buildings, 
Central Office Assets, Motor Vehicles, Garage Work Equipment, and 
Furniture. In addition, units involved in any unusual or special type of 
construction shall be recorded by their specific location costs (note 
also Sec. 32.2000(f)(3)(ii)(B) of this subpart.
    (ii) Averaging. (A) Average costs may be developed for plant 
consisting of a large number of similar units such as terminal 
equipment, poles, wire, cable, cable terminals, conduit, furniture, and 
work equipment. Units of similar size and type within each specified 
accounting area and regulated plant account may be grouped. Each such 
average cost shall be set forth in the continuing property record of the 
units with which it is associated.
    (B) The averaging of costs permitted under the provisions of the 
foregoing paragraph is restricted to plant installed in a particular 
vintage or band of years incurred within an accounting area. This 
paragraph does not permit the inclusion of the cost of units involved in 
any unusual or special type of construction. The units involved in such 
unusual or special type of construction shall be recorded at cost by 
location.
    (4) Estimates. In cases where the actual original cost of property 
cannot be ascertained, such as pricing an inventory for the initial 
entry of a continuing property record or the pricing of an acquisition 
for which a continuing property record has not been maintained, the 
original cost may be estimated. Any estimated original cost shall be 
consistent with the accounting practices in effect at the time the 
property was constructed.
    (5) Identification of property record units. There shall be shown in 
the continuing property record or in record supplements thereof, a 
complete description of the property records units in such detail as to 
identify such units. The description shall include the identification of 
the work order under which constructed, the year of installation (unless 
not determinable per Sec. 32.2000(f)(4) of this subpart, specific 
location of the property within each accounting area in such manner that 
it can be readily spot-checked for proof of physical existence, the 
accounting company's number or designation, and any other description 
used in connection with the determination of the original cost. 
Descriptions of units of similar size and type shall follow prescribed 
groupings.
    (6) Reinstalled units. When units to which average costs are not 
applied, i.e., specific and fixed location units, are removed or retired 
and subsequently reinstalled, the date when the unit was first charged 
to the appropriate plant account shall, when required for adequate 
service life studies and reasonably accurate retirement accounting, be 
shown in addition to the date of reinstallation.
    (7) Age and service life of property. The continuing property record 
shall disclose the age of existing property and the supporting records 
shall disclose the service life of property retired. Exceptions from 
this requirement for any property record unit shall be submitted to the 
Commission for approval.
    (8) Reference to sources of information. There shall be shown by 
appropriate reference the source of all entries. All drawings, 
computations, and other detailed records which support quantities and 
costs or estimated costs shall be

[[Page 417]]

retained as a part of or in support of the continuing property record.
    (9) Jointly owned property. (i) With respect to jointly owned 
property, there shall be shown in the continuing property record or 
records supplemental thereto:
    (A) The identity of all joint owners.
    (B) The percentage owned by the accounting company.
    (ii) When regulated plant is constructed under arrangements for 
joint ownership, the amount received by the constructing company from 
the other joint owner or owners shall be credited as a reduction of the 
gross cost of the plant in place.
    (iii) When a sale of a part interest in regulated plant is made, the 
fractional interest sold shall be treated as a retirement and the amount 
received shall be treated as salvage. The continuing property record or 
records supplemental thereto shall be so maintained as to identify 
separately retirements of this nature from physical retirements of 
jointly owned plant.
    (iv) If jointly owned regulated property is substantial in relation 
to the total of the same kind of regulated property owned wholly by the 
company, such jointly owned regulated property shall be appropriately 
segregated in the continuing property record.
    (g) Depreciation accounting--(1) Computation of depreciation rates. 
(i) Unless otherwise provided by the Commission, either through prior 
approval or upon prescription by the Commission, depreciation percentage 
rates shall be computed in conformity with a group plan of accounting 
for depreciation and shall be such that the loss in service value of the 
property, except for losses excluded under the definition of 
depreciation, may be distributed under the straight-line method during 
the service life of the property.
    (ii) In the event any composite percentage rate becomes no longer 
applicable, revised composite percentage rates shall be computed in 
accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section.
    (iii) The company shall keep such records of property and property 
retirements as will allow the determination of the service life of 
property which has been retired, or facilitate the determination of 
service life indications by mortality, turnover, or other appropriate 
methods. Such records will also allow the determination of the 
percentage of salvage value and cost of removal for property retired 
from each class of depreciable plant.
    (2) Depreciation charges. (i) A separate annual percentage rate for 
each depreciation category of telecommunications plant shall be used in 
computing depreciation charges.
    (ii) Companies, upon receiving prior approval from this Commission, 
or, upon prescription by this Commission, shall apply such depreciation 
rate, except where provisions of paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section 
apply, as will ratably distribute on a straight line basis the 
difference between the net book cost of a class or subclass of plant and 
its estimated net salvage during the known or estimated remaining 
service life of the plant.
    (iii) Charges for currently accruing depreciation shall be made 
monthly to the appropriate depreciation accounts, and corresponding 
credits shall be made to the appropriate depreciation reserve accounts. 
Current monthly charges shall normally be computed by the application of 
one-twelfth of the annual depreciation rate to the monthly average 
balance of the associated category of plant. The average monthly balance 
shall be computed using the balance as of the first and last days of the 
current month.
    (iv) In certain circumstances and upon prior approval of this 
Commission, monthly charges may be determined in total or in part 
through the use of other methods whereby selected plant balances or 
portions thereof are ratably distributed over periods prescribed by this 
Commission. Such circumstances could include but not be limited to 
factors such as the existence of reserve deficiencies or surpluses, 
types of plant that will be completely retired in the near future, and 
changes in the accounting for plant. Where alternative methods have been 
used in accordance with this subparagraph, such amounts shall be applied 
separately or in combination with rates determined in accordance with 
paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section.

[[Page 418]]

    (3) Acquired depreciable plant. When acquired depreciable plant 
carried in Account 1439, Deferred Charges, is distributed to the 
appropriate plant accounts, adjusting entries shall be made covering the 
depreciation charges applicable to such plant for the period during 
which it was carried in Account 1439.
    (4) Plant Retired for Nonrecurring Factors not Recognized in 
Depreciation Rates.
    (i) A retirement will be considered as nonrecurring (extraordinary) 
only if the following criteria are met:
    (A) The impending retirement was not adequately considered in 
setting past depreciation rates.
    (B) The charging of the retirement against the reserve will unduly 
deplete that reserve.
    (C) The retirement is unusual such that similar retirements are not 
likely to recur in the future.

or approve.
    (h) Amortization accounting. (1) Unless otherwise provided by this 
Commission, either through approval, or upon prescription by this 
Commission, amortization shall be computed on the straight-line method, 
i.e., equal annual amounts shall be applied. The cost of each type asset 
shall be amortized on the basis the estimated life of that asset and 
shall not be written off in the accounting period in which the asset is 
acquired. A reasonable estimate of the useful life may be based on the 
upper or lower limits even though a fixed existence is not determinable. 
However, the period of amortization shall not exceed forty years.
    (2) In the event any estimated useful life becomes no longer 
applicable, a revised estimated useful life shall be determined in 
accordance with paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
    (3) Amortization charges shall be made monthly to the appropriate 
amortization expense accounts and corresponding credits shall be made to 
the appropriate amortization reserve accounts. Monthly charges shall be 
computed by the application of one-twelfth to the annual amortization 
amount.
    (4) The company shall keep such records as will allow the 
determination of the useful life of the asset.
    (i) Accounting for software. The original cost of initial operating 
system software for computers shall be classified to the same account as

              Subpart D--Instructions For Revenue Accounts


<R05>
Sec. 32.4999  General.

    (a) Purpose of revenue accounts. The revenue accounts are intended 
to include the actual cash inflows (or equivalents) that have or will 
occur as a result of the company's ongoing major or central operations 
during the period. They will include the revenues which arise from 
furnishing regulated telecommunications services to others, from 
directory advertising, rentals of telecommunications assets and from 
providing other services which are directly associated with the 
provision of regulated telecommunications services.
    (b) Deductions from revenue. Corrections of overcharges, authorized 
refunds of overcollections previously credited to revenue, authorized 
refunds and adjustments on account of failure in service, and other 
corrections shall be charged to the revenue account previously credited 
with the amounts involved.
    (c) Commissions. Commissions paid to others or employees in place of 
compensation or salaries for services rendered, such as public telephone 
commissions, shall be charged to Account 6623, Customer Services, and 
not to the revenue accounts. Other commissions shall be charged to the 
appropriate expense accounts.
    (d) Revenue recognition. Credits shall be made to the appropriate 
revenue accounts when such revenue is actually earned. When the billing 
cycle encompasses more than one accounting period, adjustments are 
necessary to properly recognize the revenue applicable to the current

of the construction of the system.
    (3) Summary accounts within revenue groups shall be used to describe 
aggregations of two or more accounts having a certain commonality. 
Summary accounts are assigned numbers so that they may be used by Class 
A telephone companies to aggregate accounts for reporting purposes; and, 
as specifically directed, so that they may be used as accounts by Class 
B telephone companies.
    (4) Accounts shall be maintained as prescribed in this Section 
subject to the conditions described in section 32.13 of subpart B. In

    (h) Local Network Services revenues. Local Network Services revenues 
(Accounts 5000-5069) shall include revenues derived from the provision 
of service and equipment entirely within the basic service area. That

public network services as well as from customer premises facilities 
services. Local revenues include associated charges such as one-time 
service connection or termination charges and secondary features such as 
call waiting.

including public network switching as well as private.
    (k) Miscellaneous revenues. Miscellaneous revenues are those 
revenues derived from the provision of regulated products and services 
provided under tariff or contract but not contained elsewhere. They 
shall also include operating revenue derived from activities performed 
incident to the company's tariffed telecommunications operations which, 
though non-tariffed, are included in the regulatory process.
    (l) Nonregulated revenues. The nonregulated revenue account shall be 
used for nonregulated operating revenues when a nonregulated activity 
involves the common or joint use of assets or resources in the provision 
of regulated and nonregulated products or services as required in 
Sec. 32.23(c) of this subpart. Revenues from nontariffed activities 
offered incidental to tariffed services may be accounted for as 
regulated revenues, provided the activities are outgrowths of regulated 
operations and the revenues do not exceed, in the aggregate, one percent 
of total revenues for three consecutive years. Such activities must be 
listed in the Commission-approved Cost Allocation Manual for any company 
required to file a Cost Allocation Manual.

              Subpart E--Instructions for Expense Accounts


<R05>
Sec. 32.5999  General.

    (a) Structure of the expense accounts. (1) The expense section of 
the system of accounts shall be organized by expense group summary 
account, and subsidiary record category (if required).
    (2) The expense section of this system of accounts shall be 
comprised of four major expense groups--Plant Specific Operations, Plant 
Nonspecific Operations, Customer Operations and Corporate Operations. 
Expenses to be recorded in Plant Specific and Plant Nonspecific 
Operations Expense Groups generally reflect cost associated with the 
various kinds of equipment identified in the plant asset accounts. 
Expenses to be recorded in the Customer Operations and Corporate 
Operations accounts reflect the costs of, or are associated with, 
functions performed by people, irrespective of the organization in which 
any particular function is performed.
    (3) Summary accounts within expense groups shall be used to describe 
aggregations of two or more accounts having a certain commonality. 
Summary accounts are assigned numbers so that they may be used by Class 
A telephone companies to aggregate accounts for reporting purposes; and 
as specifically directed, so that they may be used as accounts by Class 
B telephone companies.
    (4) Accounts shall be maintained as prescribed in this section 
subject to the conditions described in Sec. 32.13 in subpart B. 
Subsidiary record categories may be required below the account level by 
this system of accounts or by Commission order.
    (b) Plant Specific Operations Expense. (1) The Plant Specific 
Operations Expense Accounts, 6110 through 6441, are

[[Page 447]]

used to record costs related to specific kinds of telecommunications 
plant.
    (2) The Plant Specific Operations Expense accounts predominantly 
mirror the telecommunications plant in service detail accounts and are 
numbered consistently with them; the first digit of the expense account 
being six (6) and the remaining digits being the same as the last three 
numbers of the related plant account. In classifying Plant Specific 
Operations expenses, the text of the corresponding plant account should 
be consulted to ensure appropriateness.
    (3) The Plant Specific Operations Expense accounts shall include the 
costs of inspecting, testing (except as specified in Account 6533, 
Testing Expense) and reporting on the condition of telecommunications 
plant to determine the need for repairs, replacements, rearrangements 
and changes; performing routine work to prevent trouble (except as 
specified in Account 6533), replacing items of plant other than 
retirement units; rearranging and changing the location of plant not 
retired; repairing material for reuse; restoring the condition of plant 
damaged by storms, floods, fire or other casualties (other than the cost 
of replacing retirement units); inspecting after repairs have been made; 
and receiving training to perform these kinds of work. Also included are 
the costs of direct supervision (immediate of first-level) and office 
support of this work.
    (4) In addition to the activities specified in paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section, the appropriate Plant Specific Operations Expense accounts 
shall include the cost of personnel whose principal job is the operation 
of plant equipment, such as general purpose computer operators, aircraft 
pilots, chauffeurs and shuttle bus drivers. However, when the operation 
of equipment is performed as part of other identifiable functions (such 
as the use of office equipment, capital tools or motor vehicles) the 
operators' cost shall be charged to accounts appropriate for those 
functions. (For costs of operator services personnel, see Accounts 6621, 
Call Completion Services, and 6622, Number Services, and for costs of 
test board personnel see Account 6533.)
    (c) Plant Nonspecific Operations Expense. The Plant Nonspecific 
Operations Expense accounts shall include expenses related to property 
held for future telecommunications use, provisioning expenses, network 
operations expenses, and depreciation and amortization expenses. 
Accounts in this group (except for Account 6540, Access Expense, and 
Accounts 6560 through 6565) shall include the costs of performing 
activities described in narratives for individual accounts. These costs 
shall also include the costs of supervision and office support of these 
activities.
    (d) Customer Operations Expense. The Customer Operations Expense 
accounts shall include the cost of performing customer related marketing 
and services activities described in narratives for individual accounts. 
These costs shall also include the costs of supervision, office support 
and training for these activities.
    (e) Corporate Operations Expense. The Corporate Operations Expense 
accounts shall include the costs of performing executive and planning 
activities and general and administrative activities described in 
narratives for individual accounts. These costs shall also include the 
costs of supervision, office support and training for these activities.
    (f) Reimbursements. Reimbursements of actual costs incurred in 
connection with joint operations or projects repairing plant due to 
damages by others, and obligations to make changes in telecommunications 
plant (such as highway relocations), shall be credited to the accounts 
originally charged.
    (g) Expense accounts to be maintained.

given year shall be determined by multiplying $100 million by the ratio 
of the annual value of the GDP-CPI for the given year to the estimated 
seasonally adjusted GDP-CPI on October 19, 1992. The indexed revenue

[[Page 465]]

carriers would be eligible for Class B accounting, except as noted in 
Sec. 32.11(b) and (d), even if the annual operating revenue of any 
individual local exchange carrier exceeds the indexed revenue threshold 
(see definition for indexed revenue threshold in this section).

                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 36.1  General.

    (a) This part contains an outline of separations procedures for 
telecommunications companies on the station-to-station basis. These 
procedures are applicable either to property costs, revenues, expenses, 
taxes, and reserves as recorded on the books of the company or to 
estimated amounts.
    (1) Where a value basis is used instead of book costs, the ``costs'' 
referred to are the ``values'' of the property derived from the 
valuation.
    (b) The separations procedures set forth in this part are designed 
primarily for the allocation of property costs, revenues, expenses, 
taxes and reserves between state and interstate jurisdictions. For 
separations, where required, of the state portion between exchange and 
toll or for separations of individual exchanges or special services, 
further analyses and studies may be required to adapt the procedures to 
such additional separations.
    (c) The fundamental basis on which separations are made is the use 
of telecommunications plant in each of the operations. The first step is 
the assignment of the cost of the plant to categories. The basis for 
making this assignment is the identification of the plant assignable to 
each category and the determination of the cost of the plant so 
identified. The second step is the apportionment of the cost of the 
plant in each category among the operations by direct assignment where 
possible, and all remaining costs are assigned by the application of 
appropriate use factors.
    (d) In assigning book costs to categories, the costs used for 
certain plant classes are average unit costs which equate to all book 
costs of a particular account or subaccount; for other plant classes, 
the costs used are those which either directly approximate book cost 
levels or which are equated to match total book costs at a given 
location.
    (e) The procedures outlined herein reflect ``short-cuts'' where 
practicable and where their application produces substantially the same 
separations results as would be obtained by the use of more detailed 
procedures, and they assume the use of records generally maintained by 
Telecommunications Companies.
    (f) The classification to accounts of telecommunications property, 
revenues, expenses, etc., set forth in this manual is that prescribed by 
the Federal Communications Commission's Uniform System of Accounts for 
Telecommunications Companies.
    (g) In the assignment of property costs to categories and in the 
apportionment of such costs among the operations, each amount so 
assigned and apportioned is identified as to the account classification 
in which the property is included. Thus, the separated results are 
identified by property accounts and apportionment bases are provided for 
those expenses which are separated on the basis of the apportionment of 
property costs. Similarly, amounts of revenues and expenses assigned 
each of the operations are identified as to account classification.
    (h) The separations procedures described in this part are not to be 
interpreted as indicating what property, revenues, expenses and taxes, 
or what items carried in the income, reserve and retained earnings 
accounts, should or should not be considered in any investigation or 
rate proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 36.2  Fundamental principles underlying procedures.

    (a) The following general principles underlie the procedures 
outlined in this part:

[[Page 469]]

    (1) Separations are intended to apportion costs among categories or 
jurisdictions by actual use or by direct assignment.
    (2) Separations are made on the ``actual use'' basis, which gives 
consideration to relative occupancy and relative time measurements.
    (3) In the development of ``actual use'' measurements, measurements 
of use are (i) determined for telecommunications plant or for work 
performed by operating forces on a unit basis (e.g., conversation-
minute-kilometers per message, weighted standard work seconds per call) 
in studies of traffic handled or work performed during a representative 
period for all traffic and (ii) applied to overall traffic volumes, 
i.e., 24-hour rather than busy-hour volumes.
    (b) Underlying the procedures included in this manual for the 
separation of plant costs is an over-all concept which may be described 
as follows:
    (1) Telecommunications plant, in general, is segregable into two 
broad classifications, namely, (i) interexchange plant, which is plant 
used primarily to furnish toll services, and (ii) exchange plant, which 
is plant used primarily to furnish local services.
    (2) Within the interexchange classification, there are three broad 
types of plant, i.e., operator systems, switching plant, and trunk 
transmission equipment. Within the exchange classification there are 
four board types of plant, i.e., operator systems, switching plant, 
truck equipment and subscriber plant. Subscriber plant comprises lines 
to the subscriber.
    (3) In general, the basis for apportioning telecommunications plant 
used jointly for state and interstate operations are:
    (i) Operator work time expressed in weighted standard work seconds 
is the basis for measuring the use of operator systems.
    (ii) Holding-time-minutes is the basis for measuring the use of toll 
switching plant.
    (iii) Conversation-minute-kilometers or conversation minutes is the 
basis for measuring the use of interexchange circuit plant and holding-
time minutes is the basis for measuring the use of exchange trunk plant. 
While the use of holding-time-minute-kilometers is the basic fundamental 
allocation factor for interexchange circuit plant and exchange trunk 
plant, the use of conversation-minute-kilometers or conversation-minutes 
for the allocation of interexchange circuit plant and holding-time 
minutes for the allocation of exchange trunk plant are considered 
practical approximations for separations between state and interstate 
operations when related to the broad types of plant classifications used 
herein.
    (iv) A subscriber plant factor is the basis of apportioning the cost 
of message telecommunications subscriber plant and local switching plant 
between State and interstate operations. The subscriber plant factor is 
developed and used according to the procedures set forth in 
Secs. 36.154(c) through 36.154(f).
    (c) Property rented to affiliates, if not substantial in amount, is 
included as used property of the owning company with the associated 
revenues and expenses treated consistently: Also such property rented 
from affiliates is not included with the used property of the company 
making the separations; the rent paid is included in its expenses. If 
substantial in amount, the following treatment is applied:
    (1) In the case of property rented to affiliates, the property and 
related expenses and rent revenues are excluded from the telephone 
operations of the owning company, and
    (2) In the case of property rented from affiliates, the property and 
related expenses are included with, and the rent expenses are excluded 
from, the telephone operations of the company making the separation.
    (d) Property rented to or from non-affiliates is usually to be 
included as used property of the owning company with the associated 
revenues and expenses treated consistently. In the event the amount is 
substantial, the property involved and the revenues and expenses 
associated therewith may be excluded from or included in the 
telecommunications operations of the company. When required, the cost of 
property rented to or from non-affiliates is determined using procedures 
that are consistent with the procedures

[[Page 470]]

for the allocation of costs among the operations.
    (e) Costs associated with services or plant billed to another 
company which have once been separated under procedures consistent with 
general principles set forth in this part, and are thus identifiable as 
entirely interstate or State in nature, shall be directly assigned to 
the appropriate operation and jurisdiction.

    (c) The amount of depreciation deductible from the book cost or 
``value'' is apportioned among the operations in proportion to the 
separation of the cost of the related plant accounts.

                       General Support Facilities


<R05>
Sec. 36.111  General.

    (a) The costs of the general support facilities are contained in

[52 FR 17229, May 6, 1987, as amended at 53 FR 33012, Aug. 29, 1988]

[[Page 471]]

                        Central Office Equipment


<R05>
Sec. 36.121  General.

    (a) The costs of central office equipment are carried in the 
following accounts:

Central Office Switching...............  Account 2210
  Analog Electronic Switching..........  Account 2211
  Digital Electronic Switching.........  Account 2212
  Electro-Mechanical Switching.........  Account 2215
Operator Systems.......................  Account 2220
Central Office--Transmission...........  Account 2230
  Radio Systems........................  Account 2231
  Circuit Equipment....................  Account 2232
 

    (b) Records of the cost of central office equipment are usually 
maintained for each study area separately by accounts. However, each 
account frequently includes equipment having more than one use. Also, 
equipment in one account frequently is associated closely with equipment 
in the same building in another account. Therefore, the separations 
procedures for central office equipment have been designed to deal with 
categories of plant rather than with equipment in an account.
    (c) In the separation of the cost of central office equipment among 
the operations, the first step is the assignment of the equipment in 
each study area to categories. The basic method of making this 
assignment is the identification of the equipment assignable to each 
category, and the determination of the cost of the identified equipment 
by analysis of accounting, engineering and other records.
    (1) The cost of common equipment not assigned to a specific 
category, e.g., common power equipment, including emergency power 
equipment, aisle lighting and framework, including distributing frames, 
is distributed among the categories in proportion to the cost of 
equipment, (excluding power equipment not dependent upon common power 
equipment) directly assigned to categories.
    (i) The cost of power equipment used by one category is assigned 
directly to that category, e.g., 130 volt power supply provided for 
circuit equipment. The cost of emergency power equipment protecting only 
power equipment used by one category is also assigned directly to that 
category.
    (ii) Where appropriate, a weighting factor is applied to the cost of 
circuit equipment in distributing the power plant costs not directly 
assigned, in order to reflect the generally greater power use per dollar 
of cost of this equipment.
    (d) The second step is the apportionment of the cost of the 
equipment in each category among the operations through the application 
of appropriate use factors or by direct assignment.


<R05>
Sec. 36.122  Categories and apportionment procedures.

    (a) The following categories of central office equipment and 
apportionment procedures therefore are set forth in Secs. 36.123 through 
36.126.

Operator Systems Equipment.............  Category 1.
Tandem Switching Equipment.............  Category 2.
Local Switching Equipment..............  Category 3.
Circuit Equipment......................  Category 4.
 


<R05>
Sec. 36.123  Operator systems equipment--Category 1.

    (a) Operator systems equipment is contained in Account 2220. It 
includes all types of manual telephone switchboards except tandem 
switchboards and those used solely for recording of calling telephone 
numbers in connection with customer dialed charge traffic. It includes 
all face equipment, terminating relay circuits of trunk and toll line 
circuits, cord circuits, cable turning sections, subscriber line 
equipment, associated toll connecting trunk equipment, number checking 
facilities, ticket distributing systems, calculagraphs, chief operator 
and other desks, operator chairs, and other such equipment.
    (1) Operator systems equipment is generally classified according to 
operating arrangements of which the following are typical:

(i) Separate toll boards
(ii) Separate local manual boards
(iii) Combined local manual and toll boards
(iv) Combined toll and DSA boards
(v) Separate DSA and DSB boards
(vi) Service observing boards
(vii) Auxiliary service boards
(viii) Traffic service positions


[[Page 472]]


    (2) If switchboards as set forth in Sec. 36.123(a) are of the key 
pulsing type, the cost of the key pulsing senders, link and trunk finder 
equipment is included with the switchboards.
    (3) DSB boards include the associated DSB dial equipment, such as 
link and sender equipment.
    (4) Traffic service position systems include the common control and 
trunk equipment in addition to the associated groups of positions 
wherever located.
    (b) The cost of the following operator systems equipment is 
apportioned among the operations on the basis of the relative number of 
weighted standard work seconds handled at the switchboards under 
consideration.
    (1) The following types of switchboards at toll centers are 
generally apportioned individually:
    (i) Separate toll boards. These usually include outward, through and 
inward positions in separate lines and associated inward toll 
switchboard positions in line.
    (ii) Switchboards handling both local and toll, either combined or 
having segregated local and toll positions in the same line.
    (iii) Switchboards handling both toll and DSA, either combined or 
having segregated toll and DSA positions in the same line.
    (iv) Traffic service positions, including separately located groups 
of these positions when associated with a common basic control unit.
    (2) The following types of switchboards at toll centers are 
apportioned individually, or by groups of comparable types of boards for 
each exchange:
    (i) Separate local manual boards. This includes the local positions 
of manual boards where inward toll positions are in the same line.
    (ii) Separate DSA boards.
    (iii) Separate DSB boards.
    (3) Tributary boards may be treated individually if warranted or 
they may be treated on a group basis.
    (c) Auxiliary service boards generally handle rate and route, 
information, and intercept service at individual or joint positions. The 
cost of these boards is apportioned as follows:
    (1) The cost of separate directory assistance boards is apportioned 
among the operations on the basis of the relative number of weighted 
standard work seconds handled at the boards under consideration. 
Directory assistance weighted standard work seconds are apportioned 
among the operations on the basis of the classification of these 
weighted standard work seconds as follows:
    (i) Directory assistance weighted standard work seconds first are 
classified between calls received over toll directory assistance trunks 
from operators or customers and all other directory assistance calls.
    (ii) The directory assistance weighted standard work seconds of each 
type further are classified separately among the operations on the basis 
of an analysis of a representative sample of directory assistance calls 
of each type with reference to the locations of the calling and called 
stations for each call.
    (2) The cost of separate intercept boards and automated intercept 
systems in the study area is appportioned among the operations on the 
basis of the relative number of subscriber line minutes of use.
    (3) The cost of separate rate and route boards is generally included 
with the cost of the toll boards served and is apportioned with those 
boards.
    (4) Where more than one auxiliary service is handled at an auxiliary 
board, the cost of the board is apportioned among the auxiliary services 
on the basis of the relative number of weighted standard work seconds 
for each service. The cost of that part of the board allocated to each 
auxiliary service is apportioned among the operations in the same manner 
as for a separate auxiliary board.
    (d) The cost of joint exchange and toll service observing boards is 
first apportioned between exchange and toll use on the basis of the 
relative number of exchange and toll service observing units at these 
boards. The cost of separate toll service observing boards and the toll 
portion of joint service observing boards is apportioned between state 
and interstate operations on the basis of the relative number of toll 
minutes

[[Page 473]]

of use associated with the toll messages originating in the offices 
observed.
    (e) Traffic Service Position System (TSPS) investments are 
apportioned as follows:
    (1) Operator position investments are apportioned on the basis of 
the relative weighted standard work seconds for the entire TSPS complex.
    (2) Remote trunk arrangement (RTA) investments are apportioned on 
the basis of the relative processor real time (i.e., actual seconds) 
required to process TSPS traffic originating from the end offices served 
by each RTA.
    (3) The remaining investments at the central control location, such 
as the stored program control and memory, is apportioned on the basis of 
the relative processor real time (i.e., actual seconds) for the entire 
TSPS complex.

toll switching trunks, operator trunks, information trunks, testing 
trunks, etc. Equipment associated with the local office end of such 
trunks is included with local switching equipment or switchboard 
categories as appropriate.
    (2) At tributary offices, this category includes intertoll switching 
equipment similar to that at toll center toll offices if it is used in 
the interconnection of: Tributary to tributary circuits; tributary to 
subtributary circuits; subtributary to subtributary circuits; toll 
center to subtributary circuits; or if it is used jointly in the 
interconnection of any of the aforementioned types of circuits and in 
the interconnection of such toll circuits with trunk circuits for the 
handling of traffic terminating in the tributary office. Where 
comparable equipment has no joint use but is used only for the handling 
of traffic terminating in the tributary office, it is included in the 
local switching equipment category.
    (3) At all switching entities, this category includes intertoll 
switching equipment similar to that at toll center toll offices if it is 
used in the interconnection of switched private line trunks or TWX 
switching plant trunks when these functions are in addition to the 
message telephone switching function. Switching entities wholly 
dedicated to switching of special services are assigned to Category 3--
Local Switching Equipment.

(e.g. transmitters, recorders, call identity indexers, perforators, 
ticketers, detectors, mastertimes) switchboards used solely for 
recording of calling telephone numbers in connection with customer 
dialed charge traffic, or switched private line traffic (or both) is 
included in this local switching category. Equipment provided and used 
primarily for operator dialed toll or customer dialed charge traffic 
except such equipment included in Category 2 Tandem Switching Equipment 
is also included in this local switching category. This includes such 
items as directors translators, sender registers, out trunk selectors 
and facilites for toll intercepting and digit absorption. Special 
services switching equipment which primarily performs the switching 
function for special services (e.g. switching equipment, TWX 
concentrators and switchboards) is also included in this local switching 
category.
    (1) Local office, as used in Sec. 36.125, comprises one or more 
local switching entities of the same equipment type (e.g., step-by-step, 
No. 5 Crossbar) in an individual location. A local switching entity 
comprises that local central office equipment of the same type which has 
a common intermediate distributing frame, market group or other 
separately identifiable switching unit serving one or more prefixes (NNX 
codes).
    (2) A host/remote local switching complex is composed of an 
electronic analog or digital host office and all of its remote 
locations. A host/remote local switching complex is treated as one local 
office. The current jurisdictional definition of an exchange will apply.
    (3) Dial equipment minutes of use (DEM) is defined as the minutes of 
holding time of the originating and terminating local switching 
equipment. Holding time is defined in the Glossary.
    (4) The interstate allocation factor is the percentage of local 
switching investment apportioned to the interstate jurisdiction.
    (5) The interstate DEM factor is the ratio of the interstate DEM to 
the total DEM. A weighted interstate DEM factor is the product of 
multiplying a weighting factor, as defined in paragraph (f) of this 
section, to the interstate DEM factor. The state DEM factor is the ratio 
of the state DEM to the total DEM.
    (b) Beginning January 1, 1993, Category 3 investment for study areas 
with 50,000 or more access lines is apportioned to the interstate 
jurisdiction on the basis of the interstate DEM factor. Category 3 
investment for study areas with 50,000 or more access lines is 
apportioned to the state jurisdiction on the basis of the state DEM 
factor.
    (c)-(e) [Reserved]
    (f) Beginning January 1, 1993 and ending December 31, 1997, for 
study areas with fewer than 50,000 access lines, Category 3 investment 
is apportioned to the interstate jurisdiction by the application of an 
interstate allocation factor that is the lesser of either .85 or the 
product of the interstate DEM factor specified in paragraph (a)(5) of 
this section multiplied by a weighting factor, as determined by the 
table below. Beginning January 1, 1998, for study areas with fewer than 
50,000 access lines, Category 3 investment is apportioned to the 
interstate jurisdiction by the application of an interstate allocation 
factor that is the lesser of either .85 or the sum of the interstate DEM 
factor specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section and the difference 
between the 1996 weighted interstated DEM factor and the 1996 interstate 
DEM factor. The Category 3 investment that is not assigned to the 
interstate jurisdiction pursuant to this paragraph is assigned to the 
state jurisdiction.

    (4) In addition, for the purpose of identifying and separating 
property associated with special services, circuit equipment included in 
Categories 4.12 (other than wideband equipment) 4.13 and 4.23 is 
identified as either basic circuit equipment, i.e., equipment that 
performs functions necessary to provide and operate channels suitable 
for voice transmission (telephone grade channels), or special circuit 
equipment, i.e., equipment that is peculiar to special service circuits. 
Carrier telephone terminals and carrier telephone repeaters are examples 
of basic circuit equipment is general use, while audio program 
transmission amplifiers, bridges, monitoring devices and volume 
indicators, telegraph carrier terminals and telegraph repeaters are 
examples of special circuit equipment in general use. Cost of exchange 
circuit equipment included in Categories 4.12 and 4.13 and the 
interexchange circuit equipment in Categories 4.21, 4.22 and 4.23 are 
segregated between basic circuit equipment and special circuit equipment 
only at those locations where amounts of interexchange and exchange 
special circuit equipment are significant. Where such segregation is not 
made, the total costs in these categories are classified as basic 
circuit equipment.
    (c) Apportionment of Exchange Circuit Equipment Among the 
Operations:

[[Page 476]]

    (1) Wideband Exchange Line Circuit Equipment--Category 4.11--The 
cost of exchange circuit equipment in this category is determined 
separately for each wideband facility. The respective costs are 
allocated to the appropriate operation in the same manner as the related 
exchange line cable and wire facilities described in Sec. 36.155.
    (2) Exchange Trunk Circuit Equipment (Wideband and Non-Wideband)--
Category 4.12--The cost of exchange circuit equipment associated with 
this category for the study area is allocated to the appropriate

    (3) Exchange Line Circuit Equipment Excluding Wideband--Category 
4.13--The cost of Circuit Equipment associated with exchange line plant 
excluding wideband for the study area is assigned to subcategories and 
is allocated to the appropriate operation in the same manner as the 
related exchange line cable and wire facilities for non-wideband service 
as described in Sec. 36.154.
    (d) Apportionment of Interexchange Circuit Equipment among the 
Operations: Procedures to be Used by Interexchange Carriers.
    (1) Interexchange Circuit Equipment Furnished to Another Company for 
Interstate Use--Category 4.21--This category comprises that circuit 
equipment provided for the use of another company as an integral part of 
its interexchange circuit facilities used wholly for interstate 
services. This category includes such circuit equipment as telephone 
carrier, terminals telegraph carrier terminals, and microwave systems 
used wholly for interstate services. The total cost of the circuit 
equipment in this category for the study area is assigned to the 
interstate operation.
    (2) Interexchange Circuit Equipment Used for Wideband Service--
Category 4.22--This category includes the circuit equipment portion of 
interexchange channels used for wideband services. The cost of 
interexchange circuit equipment in this category is determined 
separately for each wideband channel and is segregated between message 
and private line services on the basis of the use of the channels 
provided. The respective costs are allocated to the appropriate 
operation in the same manner as the related interexchange cable and wire 
facilities as described in Sec. 36.156.
    (3) All Other Interexchange Circuit Equipment--Category 4.23--This 
category includes the cost of all interexchange circuit equipment not 
assigned to Categories 4.21 and 4.22. Interexchange carriers shall 
freeze the allocation factors for Category 4.23 investment at levels 
reached on December 31, 1985, derived by using the procedures in effect 
at that time. On January 1, 1988, and thereafter, that frozen allocation 
factor shall be applied to each interexchange carrier's Category 4.23 
investment to derive the interstate allocation. On January 1, 1988, and 
thereafter, the amount of investment allocated to the interstate 
jurisdiction will vary but the relative proportion of the total 
investment that is allocated to the interstate jurisdiction will remain 
frozen at 1985 levels.
    (e) Apportionment of Interexchange Circuit Equipment among the 
Operations: Procedures To Be Used by Exchange Carriers.
    (1) Interexchange Circuit Equipment Furnished to Another Company for 
Interstate Use--Category 4.21--This category comprises that circuit 
equipment provided for the use of another company as an integral part of 
its interexchange circuit facilities used wholly for interstate

equipment in this category for the study area is assigned to the 
interstate operation.
    (2) Interexchange Circuit Equipment Used for Wideband Service--
Category 4.22--This category includes the circuit equipment portion of 
interexchange channels used for wideband services. The cost of 
interexchange circuit equipment in this category is determined 
separately for each wideband channel and is segregated between message 
and private line services on the

[[Page 477]]

basis of the use of the channels provided. The respective costs are 
allocated to the appropriate operation in the same manner as the related 
interexchange cable and wire facilities described in Sec. 36.156.
    (3) All Other Interexchange Circuit Equipment--Category 4.23--This 
category includes the cost of all interexchange circuit equipment not 
assigned to Categories 4.21 and 4.22. The cost of interexchange basic 
circuit equipment used for the following classes of circuits is included 
in this category: Jointly used message circuits, i.e., message switching 
plant circuits carrying messages from the state and interstate 
operations; circuits used exclusively for TWX service; circuits uses for 
interstate private line service; and circuits used for state private 
line services.
    (i) An average interexchange circuit equipment cost per equivalent 
interexchange telephone termination for all circuits is determined and 
applied to the equivalent interexchange telephone termination counts of 
each of the following classes of circuits: Interstate Private Line, 
State Private Line, Message, and TWX. The cost of interstate private 
line circuits is assigned directly to the interstate operation. The cost 
of state private line circuits is assigned directly to the state 
operation. The cost of message circuits is apportioned between the state 
and interstate operations on the basis of the relative number of study 
area conversation-minutes applicable to such facilities.
    (ii) The cost on interexchange circuit equipment assigned TWX 
circuits is apportioned between state and interstate toll in accordance 
with Sec. 36.126(e)(3)(i) and pursuant to the following procedures. The 
cost of circuit equipment associated with the TWX intertoll circuits 
used jointly for state and interstate operations is apportioned between 
the operations on the basis of the relative number of study area TWX 
connection-minutes applicable to such facilities. The cost of circuit 
equipment associated with the interexchange portion of the TWX remote 
access lines is apportioned between state and interstate operation on 
the basis of the relative number of study area TWX connection-minutes 
applicable to those facilities.
    (iii) The cost of special circuit equipment is segregated among TWX 
service, telegraph grade private line services and other private line 
services based on an analysis of the use of the equipment and in 
accordance with Sec. 36.126(b)(4). The cost of TWX special circuit 
equipment is apportioned on the same basis as that used for intertoll 
TWX circuits. The special circuit equipment cost assigned to telegraph 
grade and other private line services is directly assigned to the 
appropriate operation.
    (f) Apportionment of Host/Remote Message Circuit Equipment Among the 
Operations.
    (1) Host/Remote Message Circuit Equipment--Category 4.3. This 
category includes message host/remote location circuit equipment for

<R05>
Sec. 36.141  General.

    (a) Information Origination/Termination Equipment is maintained in 
Account 2310 and includes station apparatus, embedded customer premises 
wiring, large private branch exchanges, public telephone terminal 
equipment, and other terminal equipment.
    (b) The costs in Account 2310 shall be segregated between Other 
Information Origination/Termination Equipment--Category 1, and New 
Customer Premises Equipment--Category 2 by an analysis of accounting, 
engineering and other records.

[[Page 478]]


<R05>
Sec. 36.142  Categories and apportionment procedures.

    (a) Other Information Origination/Termination Equipment--Category 1. 
This category includes the cost of other information origination/
termination equipment not assigned to Category 2. The costs of other 
information origination/termination equipment are allocated pursuant to 
the factor that is used to allocate subcategory 1.3 Exchange Line C&WF. 
If amounts of coinless pay telephone equipment are substantial, the cost 
of such equipment should be separately identified and allocated on the 
basis of relative toll minutes-of-use for interexchange carriers and 
minutes-of-use for exchange carriers.
    (b) Customer Premises Equipment--Category 2. This category includes 
the cost of Customer Premises Equipment that was detariffed pursuant to 
the Second Computer Inquiry decision. It shall be assigned to the state 
operations.

                        Cable and Wire Facilities


<R05>
Sec. 36.151  General.

    (a) Cable and Wire Facilities, Account 2410, includes the following 
types of communications plant in service: Poles and antenna supporting 
structures, aerial cable, underground cable, buried cable, submarine 
cable, deep sea cable, intrabuilding network cable, aerial wire and 
conduit systems.
    (b) For separations purposes, it is necessary to analyze the cable 
and wire facilities classified in subordinate records in order to 
determine their assignment to the categories listed in the following 
paragraphs.
    (c) In the separation of the cost of cable and wire facilities among 
the operations, the first step is the assignment of the facilities to 
certain categories. The basic method of making this assignment is the 
identification of the facilities assignable to each category and the 
determination of the cost of the facilities so identified. Because of 
variations among companies in the character of the facilities and 
operating conditions, and in the accounting and engineering records 
maintained, the detailed methods followed, of necessity, will vary among 
the companies. The general principles to be followed, however, will be 
the same for all companies.
    (d) The second step is the apportionment of the cost of the 
facilities in each category among the operations through the application 
of appropriate factors or by direct assignment.


<R05>
Sec. 36.152  Categories of Cable and Wire Facilities (C&WF).

    (a) C&WF are basically divided between exchange and interexchange. 
Exchange C&WF consists of the following categories:
    (1) Exchange Line C&WF Excluding Wideband--Category 1--This category 
includes C&W facilities between local central offices and subscriber 
premises used for message telephone, TWX subscriber lines, private line, 
local channels, and for circuits between control terminals and radio 
stations providing very high frequency maritime service or urban or 
highway mobile service.
    (2) Wideband and Exchange Trunk C&WF--Category 2--This category 
includes all wideband, including Exchange Line Wideband and C&WF between 
local central offices and Wideband facilities. It also includes C&WF 
between central offices or other switching points used by any common 
carrier for interlocal trunks wholly within an exchange or metropolitan 
service area, interlocal trunks with one or both terminals outside a 
metropolitan service area carrying some exchange traffic, toll 
connecting trunks, tandem trunks principally carrying exchange traffic, 
the exchange trunk portion of TWX and WATS access lines the exchange 
trunk portion of private line local channels, and the exchange trunk 
portion of circuits between control terminals and radio stations 
providing very high frequency maritime service or urban or highway 
mobile service.
    (3) The procedures for apportioning the cost of exchange cable and 
wire facilites among the operations are set forth in Secs. 36.154 and 
36.155.
    (b) Interexchange C&WF--Category 3--This category includes the C&WF 
used for message toll and toll private line services. It includes cable 
and wire facilities carrying intertoll circuits, tributary circuits, the 
interexchange

[[Page 479]]

channel portion of special service circuits, circuits between control 
terminals and radio stations used for overseas or coastal harbor 
service, interlocal trunks between offices in the different exchange or 
metropolitan service areas carrying only message toll traffic and 
certain tandem trunks which carry principally message toll traffic.
    (1) The procedures for apportioning the cost of interexchange cable 
and wire facilities among the operations are set forth in Sec. 36.156.
    (c) Host/Remote Message C&WF--Category 4--This category includes the 
cost of message host/remote location C&WF for which a message circuit 
switching function is performed at the host central office. It applies 
to C&WF between host offices and all remote locations. The procedures 
for apportioning the cost of these facilities among the operations are 
set forth in Sec. 36.157.


<R05>
Sec. 36.153  Assignment of Cable and Wire Facilities (C&WF) to categories.

    (a) Cable consists of: Aerial cable, underground cable, buried 
cable, submarine cable, deep sea cable and intrabuilding network cable. 
Where an entire cable or aerial wire is assignable to one category, its 
cost and quantity are, where practicable, directly assigned.
    (1) Cable. (i) There are two basic methods for assigning the cost of 
cable to the various categories. Both of them are on the basis of 
conductor cross section. The methods are as follows:
    (A) By section of cable, uniform as to makeup and relative use by 
categories. From an analysis of cable engineering and assignment 
records, determine in terms of equivalent gauge the number of pairs in 
use or reserved, for each category. The corresponding percentages of 
use, or reservation, are applied to the cost of the section of cable, 
i.e., sheath meters times unit cost per meter, to obtain the cost 
assignable to each category.
    (B) By using equivalent pair kilometers, i.e., pair kilometers 
expressed in terms of equivalent gauge. From an analysis of cable 
engineering and assignment records, determine the equivalent pair 
kilometers in use for each category by type of facility, e.g., quadded, 
paired. The equivalent pair kilometers are then divided by a cable fill 
factor to obtain the equivalent pair kilometers in plant. The total 
equivalent pair kilometers in plant assigned to each category is 
summarized by type of facility, e.g., quadded and paired, and priced at 
appropriate average unit costs per equivalent pair kilometer in plant. 
If desired, this study may be made in terms of circuit kilometers rather 
than physical pair kilometers, with average cost and fill data 
consistent with the basis of the facilities kilometer count.
    (ii) In the assignment of the cost of cable under the two basic 
methods described in Sec. 36.153(a)(1)(i) consideration is given to the 
following:
    (A) Method (A) described in Sec. 36.153(a)(1)(i)(A) will probably be 
found more desirable where there is a relatively small amount of cable 
of variable make-up and use by categories. Conversely, method (B) 
described in Sec. 36.153(a)(1)(i)(B) will probably be more desirable 
where there is a large amount of cable of variable make-up and use by 
categories. However, in some cases a combination of both methods may be 
desirable.
    (B) It will be desirable in some cases to determine the amount 
assignable to a particular category by deducting from the total the sum 
of the amounts assigned to all other categories.
    (C) For use in the assignment of poles to categories, the equivalent 
sheath kilometers of aerial cable assigned to each category are 
determined. For convenience, these quantities are determined in 
connection with assignment of cable costs.
    (D) Where an entire cable is assignable to one category, its costs 
and quantity are, where practicable, directly assigned.
    (iii) For cables especially arranged for high-frequency transmission 
such as shielded, disc-insulated and coaxial, recognition is given to 
the additional costs which are charged to the high-frequency complement.
    (2) Cable Loading. (i) Methods for assigning the cost of loading 
coils, cases, etc., to categories are comparable with those used in 
assigning the associated cable to categories. Loading associated

[[Page 480]]

with cable which is directly assigned to a given category is also 
directly assigned. The remaining loading is assigned to categories in 
either of the following bases:
    (A) By an analysis of the use made of the loading facilities where a 
loading coil case includes coils assignable to more than one category, 
e.g., in the case of a single gauge uniformly loaded section, the 
percentage used in the related cable assignment are applicable, or
    (B) By pricing out each category by determining the pair meters of 
loaded pairs assigned to each category and multiplying by the unit cost 
per pair meter of loading by type.
    (3) Other Cable Plant. (i) In view of the small amounts involved, 
the cost of all protected terminals and gas pressure contactor terminals 
in the toll cable subaccounts is assigned to the appropriate 
Interexchange Cable & Wire Facilities categories. The cost of all other 
terminals in the exchange and toll cable subaccounts is assigned to 
Exchange Cable and Wire Facilities.
    (b) Aerial Wire. (1) The cost of wire accounted for as exchange is 
assigned to the appropriate Exchange Cable & Wire Facilities categories. 
The cost of wire accounted for as toll, which is used for exchange, is 
also assigned to the appropriate Exchange Cable & Wire Facilities 
categories. The cost of the remaining wire accounted for as toll is 
assigned to the appropriate Interexchange Cable & Wire Facilities 
categories as described in Sec. 36.156. For companies not maintaining 
exchange and toll subaccounts, it is necessary to review the plant 
records and identify wire plant by use. The cost of wire used for 
providing circuits directly assignable to a category is assigned to that 
category. The cost of wire used for providing circuit facilities jointly 
used for exchange and interexchange lines is assigned to categories on 
the basis of the relative number of circuit kilometers involved.
    (c) Poles and Antenna Supporting Structures. (1) In the assignment 
of these costs, anchors, guys, crossarms, antenna supporting structure, 
and right-of-way are included with the poles.
    (2) Poles. (i) The cost of poles is assigned to categories based on 
the ratio of the cost of poles to the total cost of aerial wire and 
aerial cable.
    (d) Conduit Systems. (1) The cost of conduit systems is assigned to 
categories on the basis of the assignment of the cost of underground 
cable.

Sec. 36.154  Exchange Line Cable and Wire Facilities (C&WF)--Category 1--apportionment procedures.

    (a) Exchange Line C&WF--Category 1. The first step in apportioning 
the cost of exchange line cable and wire facilities among the operations 
is the determination of an average cost per working loop. This average 
cost per working loop is determined by dividing the total cost of 
exchange line cable and wire Category 1 in the study area by the sum of 
the working loops described in subcategories listed below. The 
subcategories are:
    Subcategory 1.1--State private lines and state WATS lines. This 
subcategory shall include all private lines and WATS lines carring 
exclusively state traffic as well as private lines and WATS lines 
carrying exclusively interstate traffic as well as private lines and 
WATS lines carrying both state and interstate traffic if the interstate 
traffic on the line involved constitutes ten percent or less of the 
total traffic on the line.
    Subcategory 1.2--Interstate private lines and interstate WATS lines. 
This subcategory shall include all private lines and WATS lines that 
carry exclusively interstate traffic as well as private lines and WATS 
lines carrying both state and interstate traffic if the interstate 
traffic on the line involved constitutes more than ten percent of the 
total traffic on the line.
    Subcategory 1.3--Subscriber or common lines that are jointly used 
for local exchange service and exchange access for state and interstate 
interexchange services.
    (b) The costs assigned to subcategories 1.1 and 1.2 shall be 
directly assigned to the appropriate jurisdication.
    (c) Except as provided in Sec. 36.154 (d) through (f), effective 
January 1, 1986, 25

[[Page 481]]

percent of the costs assigned to subcategory 1.3 shall be allocated to 
the interstate jurisdiction.
    (d) Except as provided in Sec. 36.154(f), the interstate allocation 
of subcategory 1.3 costs for the years 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992 
will be as follows:
    (1) 1988--The Sec. 36.154(e) allocation factor multiplied by .625 
plus .09375.
    (2) 1989--The Sec. 36.154(e) allocation factor multiplied by .5 plus 
.125.
    (3) 1990--The Sec. 36.154(e) allocation factor multiplied by .375 
plus .15625.
    (4) 1991--The Sec. 36.154(e) allocation factor multiplied by .25 
plus .1875.
    (5) 1992--The Sec. 36.154(e) allocation factor multiplied by .125 
plus .21875.
    (e) For purposes of the transitional allocations described in 
Sec. 36.154 (d) and (f) an allocation factor known as the subscriber 
plant factor or SPF that is the sum of the following shall be computed:
    (1) Annual average interstate subscriber line use (SLU), for the 
calendar year 1981.\2\ representing the interstate use of the subscriber 
plant as measured by the ratio of interstate holding time minutes of use 
to total holding time minutes of use applicable to traffic originating 
and terminating in the study area, multiplied by .85, the nationwide 
ratio of subscriber plant costs assignable to the exchange operation per 
minute of exchange use to total subscriber plant cost per total minute 
of use of subscriber plant, plus
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ In the case of a company that cannot calculate the average 
interstate subscriber line usage (SLU) ratio for the calendar year 1981, 
the average interstate SLU for the customarily used 12-month study 
period ending in 1981 may be utilized. In the case of a company for 
which no such 1981 annual average SLU exists, the annual average 
interstate SLU for the initial study period will be utilized.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Twice the annual average interstate subscriber line use ratio 
for the study area for the calendar year 1981, multiplied by the annual 
average composite station rate ratio used for the calendar year 1981 
(ratio of the nationwide, industry-wide average interstate initial 3-
minute station charge at the study area average interstate length of 
haul to the nationwide, industry-wide average total toll initial 3-
minute station charge at the nationwide average length of haul for all 
toll traffic for the total telephone industry).
    (f) Limit on Change in Interstate Allocation. (1) No study area's 
percentage interstate allocation for Subcategory 1.3 Exchange Line C&WF 
and COE, Exchange Line Circuit Equipment Excluding Wideband--Category 
4.13 investment as well as associated maintenance and depreciation shall 
decrease by a total of more than five percentage points from one 
calendar year to the next as a result of the combined operations of 
Secs. 36.154(d) and 36.641 (a) and (b).
    (2) The determination of whether the decrease in the interstate 
allocation for a given study area resulting from the operation of 
Secs. 36.154(d) and 36.641(a) through 36.641(b) exceeds five percentage 
points shall be made by calculating a percentage interstate allocation 
for both of the years involved. This shall be done by dividing the 
interstate allocation of subcategory 1.3 Exchange Line C&WF and COE 
exchange Line circuit Equipment Excluding Wideband Category 4.13 and 
associated expenses for each year as calculated pursuant to 
Sec. 36.154(f)(4) by the total unseparated investment in Exchange Line 
C&WF subcategory 1.3 and COE Category 4.13 and associated expenses for 
the corresponding year as calculated pursuant to Sec. 36.154(f)(5).
    (3) If the resulting percentage for the more recent of the two years 
is more than five percentage points less than the percentage for the 
earlier year, the decrease in the interstate allocations shall be 
reduced pro rata for plant investment, maintenance and depreciation so 
that the difference between the two percentages does not equal more than 
five percentage points.
    (4) The sum of the following:
    (i) The net interstate allocation of Exchange Line C&WF--subcategory 
1.3 investment calculated pursuant to Sec. 36.154(d) and (e) multiplied 
by the authorized interstate rate of return.
    (ii) The net interstate allocation of COE Exchange Line Circuit 
Equipment--Category 4.13 investment calculated purusant to Sec. 36.154 
(d) and (e) multiplied by the authorized interstate rate of return.

[[Page 482]]

    (iii) The interstate allocation of maintenance and depreciation 
attributable to Exchange Line C&WF subcategory 1.3 customer premises 
wire and COE Exhange Line Circuit Equipment--Category 4.13 calculated 
pursuant to Sec. 36.154 (d) and (e).
    (iv) The amount of the additional interstate expense allocation 
calculated pursuant to Sec. 36.641.
    (5) The sum of the following:
    (i) The net unseparated Exchange Line C&WF subcategory 1.3 
investment multiplied by the authorized interstate rate of return.
    (ii) The net unseparated COE Exchange Line Circuit--Category 4.13 
investment multiplied by the authorized interstate rate of return.
    (iii) The unseparated maintenance and depreciation attributable to 
Exchange Line C&WF subcategory 1.3 investment, customer premises wiring 
investment and COE Exhange Line Circuit Equipment--Category 4.13 
investment.

<R05>
Sec. 36.412  Apportionment procedures.

    (a) For apportionment purposes, the expenses in this account are 
segregated into two groups as follows: (1) Operating Federal, State and 
local income taxes and (2) all other operating taxes.
    (b) Operating Federal, State and local income taxes are apportioned 
among the operations on the basis of the approximate net taxable income 
(positive or negative) applicable to each of the operations. The 
approximate net taxable income from each of the operations is the 
summation of the following amounts apportioned to each operation by 
means of the procedures set forth in this Manual:
    (1) Operating revenues,
    (2) Less operating expenses,
    (3) Less operating taxes except the net income tax being apportioned 
and except any other tax not treated as a deductible item in the 
determination of taxable net income for this purpose.
    (4) Less operating fixed charges.
    (i) The amount of fixed charges attributable to the operations is 
obtained by subtracting the tax component (positive or negative) 
attributable to other than the operating fixed charges, i.e., fixed 
charges on non-operating investments are that proportion of total fixed 
charges which non-operating net investments are of total operating and 
non-operating net investments.
    (ii) Operating fixed charges including interest on Rural Telephone 
Bank Stock are apportioned among the operations on the basis of the 
separation of the cost of telephone plant less appropriate reserves.
    (c) Other operating taxes should be directly assigned to the 
appropriate jurisdiction where possible, e.g., Local Gross Receipts may 
be directly identified as applicable to one jurisdiction. Where direct 
assignment is not feasible, these expenses should be apportioned among 
the operations on the basis of the separation of the cost of 
Telecommunications Plant in Service--Account 2001.

converting central offices that serve competitive interexchange carriers 
or where there has been a bona fide request for conversion to equal 
access.
    (b) Equal access expenses are apportioned between the jurisdictions 
by first segregating them from all other expenses in the primary 
accounts and then allocating them on the same basis as equal access 
investment.

                    Subpart F--Universal Service Fund

                                 General


<R05>
Sec. 36.601  General.

    (a) The term Universal Service Fund in this subpart refers only to 
the support for loop-related costs included in Sec. 36.621. The term 
Universal Service in part 54 of this chapter refers to the comprehensive 
discussion of the Commission's rules implementing section 254 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 254, which addresses 
universal service support for rural, insular, and high cost areas, low-
income consumers, schools and libraries, and heath care providers. The 
expense adjustment calculated pursuant to this subpart F shall be added 
to interstate expenses and deducted from state expenses after expenses 
and taxes have been apportioned pursuant to subpart D of this part. 
Beginning January 1, 1998, the expense adjustment calculated pursuant to 
this subpart will be administered and funded through the new universal 
service system discussed in part 54 of this chapter.
    (b) The expense adjustment will be computed on the basis of data for 
a preceding calendar year which may be updated at the option of the 
carrier pursuant to Sec. 36.612(a).
    (c) The annual amount of the total nationwide expense adjustment 
shall consist of the amounts calculated pursuant to Sec. 54.309 of this 
chapter and the amounts calculated pursuant to this subpart F. The 
annual amount of the total nationwide loop cost expense adjustment 
calculated pursuant to this subpart F shall not exceed the amount of the 
total loop cost expense adjustment for the immediately preceding 
calendar year, increased by a rate equal to the rate of increase in the 
total number of working loops during the calendar year preceding the 
July 31st filing. The total loop cost expense adjustment shall consist 
of the loop cost expense adjustments, including amounts calculated 
pursuant to Sec. 36.612(a) and Sec. 36.631. The rate of increase in 
total working loops shall be based upon the difference between the 
number of total working loops on December 31 of the calendar year 
preceding the July 31st filing and the number of total working loops on 
December 31 of the second calendar year preceding that filing, both 
determined by the company's submissions pursuant to Sec. 36.611. 
Beginning January 1, 2000, non-rural incumbent local exchange carriers 
and, eligible telecommunications carriers serving lines in the service 
area of non-rural incumbent local exchange carriers, shall only receive 
support pursuant to this subpart F to the extent that they qualify

            Calculation of Loop Costs for Expense Adjustment


<R05>
Sec. 36.621  Study area total unseparated loop cost.

    (a) For the purpose of calculating the expense adjustment, the study 
area total unseparated loop cost equals the sum of the following:
    (1) Return component for net unseparated Exchange Line C&WF 
subcategory 1.3 investment and Exchange Line CO Circuit Equipment 
Category 4.13 investment. This amount is calculated by deducting the 
accumulated depreciation and noncurrent deferred Federal income taxes 
attributable to C&WF subcategory 1.3 investment and Exchange Line 
Category 4.13 circuit investment reported pursuant to Sec. 36.611(b) 
from the gross investment in Exchange Line C&WF subcategory 1.3 and CO 
Category 4.13 reported pursuant to Sec. 36.611(a) to obtain the net 
unseparated C&WF subcategory 1.3 investment, and CO Category 4.13 
investment. The net unseparated C&WF subcategory 1.3 investment and CO 
Category 4.13investment is multiplied by the study area's authorized 
interstate rate of return.
    (2) Depreciation expense attributable to C&WF subcategory 1.3 
investment, and CO Category 4.13 investment as reported in 
Sec. 36.611(c).
    (3) Maintenance expense attributable to C&WF subcategory 1.3 
investment, and CO Category 4.13 investment as reported in 
Sec. 36.611(d).
    (4) Corporate Operations Expenses, Operating Taxes and the benefits 
and rent portions of operating expenses, as reported in Sec. 36.611(e) 
attributable to

[[Page 497]]

investment in C&WF Category 1.3 and COE Category 4.13. This amount is 
calculated by multiplying the total amount of these expenses and taxes 
by the ratio of the unseparated gross exchange plant investment in C&WF 
Category 1.3 and COE Category 4.13, as reported in Sec. 36.611(a), to 
the unseparated gross telecommunications plant investment, as reported 
in Sec. 36.611(f). Total Corporate Operations Expense, for purposes of 
calculating universal service support payments beginning January 1, 
1998, shall be limited to the lesser of:
    (i) The actual average monthly per-line Corporate Operations 
Expense; or
    (ii) A per-line amount computed according to paragraphs 
(a)(4)(ii)(A), (a)(4)(ii)(B), and (a)(4)(ii)(C) of this section. To the 
extent that some carriers' corporate operations expenses are disallowed 
pursuant to these limitations, the national average unseparated cost per 
loop shall be adjusted accordingly.
    (A) For study areas with 6,000 or fewer working loops the amount per 
working loop shall be $31.188-(.0023  x  the number of working loops), 
or, $25,000<divide>the number of working loops, whichever is greater;
    (B) for study areas with more than 6,000 but fewer than 18,006 
working loops, the amount per working loop shall be $3.588 + 
(82,827.60<divide>the number of working loops); and
    (C) for study areas with 18,006 or more working loops, the amount 
per working loop shall be $8.188.

<R05>
Sec. 36.622  National and study area average unseparated loop costs.

    (a) National Average Unseparated Loop Cost per Working Loop. Except 
as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, this is equal to the sum 
of the Loop Costs for each study area in the country as calculated 
pursuant to Sec. 36.621(a) divided by the sum of the working loops 
reported in Sec. 36.611(h) for each study area in the country. The 
national average unseparated loop cost per working loop shall be 
calculated by the National Exchange Carrier Association.
    (1) The National Average Unseparated Loop Cost per Working Loop 
shall be recalculated by the National Exchange Carrier Association to 
reflect the September, December, and March update filings.
    (2) Each new nationwide average shall be used in determining the 
additional interstate expense allocation for companies which made 
filings by the most recent filing date.
    (3) The calculation of a new national average to reflect the update 
filings shall not affect the amount of the additional interstate expense 
allocation for companies which did not make an update filing by the most 
recent filing date.
    (b) Study Area Average Unseparated Loop Cost per Working Loop. This 
is equal to the unseparated loop costs for the study area as calculated 
pursuant to Sec. 36.621(a) divided by the number of working loops 
reported in Sec. 36.611(h) for the study area.
    (1) If a company elects to, or is required to, update the data which 
it has filed with the National Exchange Carrier Association as provided 
in Sec. 36.612(a), the study area average unseparated loop cost per 
working loop and the amount of its additional interstate expense 
allocation shall be recalculated to reflect the updated data.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (c) The National Average Unseparated Loop Cost per Working Loop 
shall be the greater of:
    (1) The amount calculated pursuant to the method described in 
paragraph (a) of this section; or
    (2) An amount calculated to produce the maximum total Universal 
Service Fund allowable pursuant to Sec. 36.601(c).

Sec. 36.611(h) for the study area; and
    (2) Seventy-five percent of the study area unseparated loop cost per 
working loop as calculated pursuant to Sec. 36.622(b) in excess of 150 
percent of the national average for this cost as calculated pursuant to 
Sec. 36.622(a) multiplied by the number of working loops reported in 
Sec. 36.611(h) for the study area.
    (b) Until December 31, 1987, for study areas reporting more than 
50,000 working loops pursuant to Sec. 36.611(h), the expense adjustment 
(additional interstate expense allocation) is equal to the sum of the 
following:
    (1) Twenty-five percent of the study area average unseparated loop 
cost per working loop as calculated pursuant to Sec. 36.622(b) in excess

adjustment (additional interstate expense allocation) for non-rural 
telephone companies serving study areas reporting 200,000 or fewer 
working loops pursuant to Sec. 36.611(h) shall be calculated pursuant to 
Sec. 54.309 of this Chapter or Sec. 54.311 of this Chapter (which relies 
on this part), whichever is applicable.
    (1) Sixty-five percent of the study area average unseparated loop 
cost per working loop as calculated pursuant to Sec. 36.622(b) in excess 
of 115 percent of the national average for this cost but not greater 
than 150 percent of the national average for this cost as calculated

250 percent of the national average for this cost as calculated pursuant 
to Sec. 36.622(a) multiplied by the number of working loops reported in 
Sec. 36.611(h) for the study area; and
    (4) Seventy-five percent of the study area average unseparated loop 
cost per working loop as calculated pursuant to Sec. 36.622(b) in excess 
of 250 percent of the national average for this cost as calculated 
pursuant to Sec. 36.622(a) multiplied by the number of working loops 
reported in Sec. 36.611(h) for the study area.
    (e) Beginning April 1, 1989, the expense adjustment calculated 
pursuant to Sec. 36.631 (c) and (d) shall be adjusted each year to 
reflect changes in the size of the Universal Service Fund resulting from 
adjustments calculated pursuant to Sec. 36.612(a) made during the 
previous year. If the resulting amount exceeds the previous year's fund 
size, the difference will be added to the amount calculated pursuant to 
Sec. 36.631 (c) and (d) for the following year. If the adjustments made 
during the previous year result in a decrease in the size of the funding 
requirement, the difference will be subtracted from the amount 
calculated pursuant to Sec. 36.631 (c) and (d) for the following year.
