              under the Federal Register Act. Under the provisions of 44 
              U.S.C. 1507, the contents of the CFR, a special edition of the 
              Federal Register, shall be judicially noticed. The CFR is 
              prima facie evidence of the original documents published in 
              the Federal Register (44 U.S.C. 1510).

          It is prohibited to use NARA's official seal and the stylized Code 
              of Federal Regulations logo on any republication of this 
              material without the express, written permission of the 
              Archivist of the United States or the Archivist's designee. 
              Any person using NARA's official seals and logos in a manner 
              inconsistent with the provisions of 36 CFR part 1200 is 
              subject to the penalties specified in 18 U.S.C. 506, 701, and

                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2010), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

    The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of 
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a 
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used 
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and 
not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.

[[Page vii]]

    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 20.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of these rules is to set forth the requirements and 
conditions applicable to commercial mobile radio service providers.


<R05>
Sec. 20.3  Definitions.

    Appropriate local emergency authority. An emergency answering point 
that has not been officially designated as a Public Safety Answering 
Point (PSAP), but has the capability of receiving 911 calls and either 
dispatching emergency services personnel or, if necessary, relaying the 
call to another emergency service provider. An appropriate local 
emergency authority may include, but is not limited, to an existing 
local law enforcement authority, such as the police, county sheriff, 
local emergency medical services provider, or fire department.
    Automatic Number Identification (ANI). A system that identifies the 
billing account for a call. For 911 systems, the ANI identifies the 
calling party and may be used as a call back number.
    Automatic Roaming. With automatic roaming, under a pre-existing 
contractual agreement between a subscriber's home carrier and a host 
carrier, a roaming subscriber is able to originate or terminate a call 
in the host carrier's service area without taking any special actions.
    Commercial mobile radio service. A mobile service that is:
    (a)(1) provided for profit, i.e., with the intent of receiving 
compensation or monetary gain;
    (2) An interconnected service; and
    (3) Available to the public, or to such classes of eligible users as 
to be effectively available to a substantial portion of the public; or
    (b) The functional equivalent of such a mobile service described in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    Designated PSAP. The Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) designated 
by the local or state entity that has the authority and responsibility 
to designate the PSAP to receive wireless 911 calls.
    Incumbent Wide Area SMR Licensees. Licensees who have obtained 
extended implementation authorizations in the 800 MHz or 900 MHz 
service, either by waiver or under section 90.629 of these rules, and 
who offer real-time, two-way voice service that is interconnected with 
the public switched network.
    Handset-based location technology. A method of providing the 
location of wireless 911 callers that requires the use of special 
location-determining hardware and/or software in a portable or mobile 
phone. Handset-based location technology may also employ additional 
location-determining hardware and/or software in the CMRS network and/or 
another fixed infrastructure.
    Host Carrier. For automatic roaming, the host carrier is a 
facilities-based CMRS carrier on whose system another carrier's 
subscriber roams. A facilities-based CMRS carrier may, on behalf of its 
subscribers, request automatic roaming service from a host carrier.
    Interconnection or Interconnected. Direct or indirect connection 
through automatic or manual means (by wire, microwave, or other 
technologies such as store and forward) to permit the transmission or 
reception of messages

[[Page 6]]

or signals to or from points in the public switched network.
    Interconnected Service. A service:
    (a) That is interconnected with the public switched network, or 
interconnected with the public switched network through an 
interconnected service provider, that gives subscribers the capability 
to communicate to or receive communication from all other users on the 
public switched network; or
    (b) For which a request for such interconnection is pending pursuant 
to section 332(c)(1)(B) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 
332(c)(1)(B). A mobile service offers interconnected service even if the 
service allows subscribers to access the public switched network only 
during specified hours of the day, or if the service provides general 
access to points on the public switched network but also restricts 
access in certain limited ways. Interconnected service does not include 
any interface between a licensee's facilities and the public switched 
network exclusively for a licensee's internal control purposes.
    Location-capable handsets. Portable or mobile phones that contain 
special location-determining hardware and/or software, which is used by 
a licensee to locate 911 calls.
    Manual Roaming. With manual roaming, a subscriber must establish a 
relationship with the host carrier on whose system he or she wants to 
roam in order to make a call. Typically, the roaming subscriber 
accomplishes this in the course of attempting to originate a call by 
giving a valid credit card number to the carrier providing the roaming 
service.
    Mobile Service. A radio communication service carried on between 
mobile stations or receivers and land stations, and by mobile stations 
communicating among themselves, and includes:
    (a) Both one-way and two-way radio communications services;
    (b) A mobile service which provides a regularly interacting group of 
base, mobile, portable, and associated control and relay stations 
(whether licensed on an individual, cooperative, or multiple basis) for 
private one-way or two-way land mobile radio communications by eligible 
users over designated areas of operation; and
    (c) Any service for which a license is required in a personal 
communications service under part 24 of this chapter.
    Network-based Location Technology. A method of providing the 
location of wireless 911 callers that employs hardware and/or software 
in the CMRS network and/or another fixed infrastructure, and does not 
require the use of special location-determining hardware and/or software 
in the caller's portable or mobile phone.
    Private Mobile Radio Service. A mobile service that is neither a 
commercial mobile radio service nor the functional equivalent of a 
service that meets the definition of commercial mobile radio service. 
Private mobile radio service includes the following:
    (a) Not-for-profit land mobile radio and paging services that serve 
the licensee's internal communications needs as defined in part 90 of 
this chapter. Shared-use, cost-sharing, or cooperative arrangements, 
multiple licensed systems that use third party managers or users 
combining resources to meet compatible needs for specialized internal 
communications facilities in compliance with the safeguards of Sec. 
90.179 of this chapter are presumptively private mobile radio services;
    (b) Mobile radio service offered to restricted classes of eligible 
users. This includes entities eligible in the Public Safety Radio Pool 
and Radiolocation service.
    (c) 220-222 MHz land mobile service and Automatic Vehicle Monitoring 
systems (part 90 of this chapter) that do not offer interconnected 
service or that are not-for-profit; and
    (d) Personal Radio Services under part 95 of this chapter (General 
Mobile Services, Radio Control Radio Services, and Citizens Band Radio 
Services); Maritime Service Stations (excluding Public Coast stations) 
(part 80 of this chapter); and Aviation Service Stations (part 87 of 
this chapter).
    Pseudo Automatic Number Identification (Pseudo-ANI). A number, 
consisting of the same number of digits as ANI, that is not a North 
American Numbering Plan telephone directory number and may be used in 
place of an ANI to convey special meaning. The

[[Page 7]]

special meaning assigned to the pseudo-ANI is determined by agreements, 
as necessary, between the system originating the call, intermediate 
systems handling and routing the call, and the destination system.
    Public Safety Answering Point. A point that has been designated to 
receive 911 calls and route them to emergency service personnel.
    Public Switched Network. Any common carrier switched network, 
whether by wire or radio, including local exchange carriers, 
interexchange carriers, and mobile service providers, that use the North 
American Numbering Plan in connection with the provision of switched 
services.
    Statewide default answering point. An emergency answering point 
designated by the State to receive 911 calls for either the entire State 
or those portions of the State not otherwise served by a local PSAP.

Sec. 20.5  Citizenship.

    (a) This rule implements section 310 of the Communications Act, 47 
U.S.C. 310, regarding the citizenship of licensees in the commercial 
mobile radio services. Commercial mobile radio service authorizations 
may not be granted to or held by:
    (1) Any foreign government or any representative thereof;
    (2) Any alien or the representative of any alien;
    (3) Any corporation organized under the laws of any foreign 
government;
    (4) Any corporation of which more than one-fifth of the capital 
stock is owned of record or voted by aliens or their representatives or 
by a foreign government or representative thereof or by any corporation 
organized under the laws of a foreign country; or
    (5) Any corporation directly or indirectly controlled by any other 
corporation of which more than one-fourth of the capital stock is owned 
of record or voted by aliens, their representatives, or by a foreign 
government or representative thereof, or by any corporation organized 
under the laws of a foreign country, if the Commission finds that the 
public interest will be served by the refusal or revocation of such 
license.
    (b) The limits listed in paragraph (a) of this section may be 
exceeded by eligible individuals who held ownership interests on May 24, 
1993, pursuant to the waiver provisions established in section 332(c)(6) 
of the Communications Act. Transfers of ownership to any other person in 
violation of paragraph (a) of this section are prohibited.

Sec. 20.6  CMRS spectrum aggregation limit.

    (a) Spectrum limitation. No licensee in the broadband PCS, cellular, 
or SMR services (including all parties under common control) regulated 
as CMRS (see 47 CFR 20.9) shall have an attributable interest in a total 
of more than 55 MHz of licensed broadband PCS, cellular, and SMR 
spectrum regulated as CMRS with significant overlap in any geographic 
area.
    (b) SMR spectrum. To calculate the amount of attributable SMR 
spectrum for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, an entity must 
count all 800 MHz and 900 MHz channels located at any SMR base station 
inside the geographic area (MTA or BTA) where there is significant 
overlap. All 800 MHz channels located on at least one of those 
identified base stations count as 50 kHz (25 kHz paired), and all 900 
MHz channels located on at least one of those identified base stations 
count as 25 kHz (12.5 kHz paired); provided that any discrete 800 or 900 
MHz channel shall be counted only once per licensee within the 
geographic area, even if the licensee in question utilizes the same 
channel at more than one location within the relevant geographic area. 
No more than 10 MHz of SMR spectrum in the 800 and 900 MHz SMR services 
will be attributed to an entity when determining compliance with the 
cap.
    (c) Significant overlap. (1) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this 
section, significant overlap of a PCS licensed service area and CGSA(s) 
(as defined in Sec. 22.911 of this chapter) or SMR service area(s) 
occurs when at least 10 percent

[[Page 8]]

of the population of the PCS licensed service area for the counties 
contained therein, as determined by the latest available decennial 
census figures as complied by the Bureau of the Census, is within the 
CGSA(s) and/or SMR service area(s).
    (2) The Commission shall presume that an SMR service area covers 
less than 10 percent of the population of a PCS service area if none of 
the base stations of the SMR licensee are located within the PCS service 
area. For an SMR licensee's base stations that are located within a PCS 
service area, the channels licensed at those sites will be presumed to 
cover 10 percent of the population of the PCS service area, unless the 
licensee shows that its protected service contour for all of its base 
stations covers less than 10 percent of the population of the PCS 
service area.
    (d) Ownership attribution. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this 
section, ownership and other interests in broadband PCS licensees, 
cellular licensees, or SMR licensees will be attributed to their holders 
pursuant to the following criteria:
    (1) Controlling interest shall be attributable. Controlling interest 
means majority voting equity ownership, any general partnership 
interest, or any means of actual working control (including negative 
control) over the operation of the licensee, in whatever manner 
exercised.
    (2) Partnership and other ownership interests and any stock interest 
amounting to 20 percent or more of the equity, or outstanding stock, or 
outstanding voting stock of a broadband PCS, cellular or SMR licensee 
shall be attributed, except that ownership will not be attributed unless 
the partnership and other ownership interests and any stock interest 
amount to at least 40 percent of the equity, or outstanding stock, or 
outstanding voting stock of a broadband PCS, cellular or SMR licensee if 
the ownership interest is held by a small business or a rural telephone 
company, as these terms are defined in Sec. 1.2110 of this chapter or 
other related provisions of the Commission's rules, or if the ownership 
interest is held by an entity with a non-controlling equity interest in 
a broadband PCS licensee or applicant that is a small business.
    (3) Investment companies, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3, insurance 
companies and banks holding stock through their trust departments in 
trust accounts will be considered to have an attributable interest only 
if they hold 40 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of a 
corporate broadband PCS, cellular or SMR licensee, or if any of the 
officers or directors of the broadband PCS, cellular or SMR licensee are 
representatives of the investment company, insurance company or bank 
concerned. Holdings by a bank or insurance company will be aggregated if 
the bank or insurance company has any right to determine how the stock 
will be voted. Holdings by investment companies will be aggregated if 
under common management.
    (4) Non-voting stock shall be attributed as an interest in the 
issuing entity if in excess of the amounts set forth in paragraph (d)(2) 
of this section.
    (5) Debt and instruments such as warrants, convertible debentures, 
options, or other interests (except non-voting stock) with rights of 
conversion to voting interests shall not be attributed unless and until 
converted, except that this provision does not apply in determining 
whether an entity is a small business, a rural telephone company, or a 
business owned by minorities and/or women, as these terms are defined in 
Sec. 1.2110 of this chapter or other related provisions of the 
Commission's rules.
    (6) Limited partnership interests shall be attributed to limited 
partners and shall be calculated according to both the percentage of 
equity paid in and the percentage of distribution of profits and losses.
    (7) Officers and directors of a broadband PCS licensee or applicant, 
cellular licensee, or SMR licensee shall be considered to have an 
attributable interest in the entity with which they are so associated. 
The officers and directors of an entity that controls a broadband PCS 
licensee or applicant, a cellular licensee, or an SMR licensee shall be 
considered to have an attributable interest in the broadband PCS 
licensee or applicant, cellular licensee, or SMR licensee.

[[Page 9]]

    (8) Ownership interests that are held indirectly by any party 
through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by 
successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in 
the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution 
benchmark to the resulting product, except that if the ownership 
percentage for an interest in any link in the chain exceeds 50 percent 
or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were a 100 
percent interest. (For example, if A owns 20% of B, and B owns 40% of 
licensee C, then A's interest in licensee C would be 8%. If A owns 20% 
of B, and B owns 51% of licensee C, then A's interest in licensee C 
would be 20% because B's ownership of C exceeds 50%.)
    (9) Any person who manages the operations of a broadband PCS, 
cellular, or SMR licensee pursuant to a management agreement shall be 
considered to have an attributable interest in such licensee if such 
person, or its affiliate, has authority to make decisions or otherwise 
engage in practices or activities that determine, or significantly 
influence,
    (i) The nature or types of services offered by such licensee;
    (ii) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (iii) The prices charged for such services.
    (10) Any licensee or its affiliate who enters into a joint marketing 
arrangements with a broadband PCS, cellular, or SMR licensee, or its 
affiliate shall be considered to have an attributable interest, if such 
licensee, or its affiliate, has authority to make decisions or otherwise 
engage in practices or activities that determine, or significantly 
influence,
    (i) The nature or types of services offered by such licensee;
    (ii) The terms upon which such services are offered; or
    (iii) The prices charged for such services.
    (e) Divestiture. (1) Divestiture of interests as a result of a 
transfer of control or assignment of authorization must occur prior to 
consummating the transfer or assignment, except that a licensee that 
meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section 
shall have 90 days from final grant to come into compliance with the 
spectrum aggregation limit.
    (2) An applicant with:
    (i) Controlling or attributable ownership interests in broadband 
PCS, cellular, and/or SMR licenses where the geographic license areas 
cover 20 percent or less of the applicant's service area population;
    (ii) Attributable interests in broadband PCS, cellular, and/or SMR 
licenses solely due to management agreements or joint marketing 
agreements; or
    (iii) Non-controlling attributable interests in broadband PCS, 
cellular, and/or SMR licenses, regardless of the degree to which the 
geographic license areas cover the applicant's service area population, 
shall be eligible to have its application granted subject to a condition 
that the licensee shall come into compliance with the spectrum 
limitation set out in paragraph (a) within ninety (90) days after final 
grant. For purposes of this paragraph, a ``non-controlling attributable 
interest'' is one in which the holder has less than a fifty (50) percent 
voting interest and there is an unaffiliated single holder of a fifty 
(50) percent or greater voting interest.
    (3) The applicant for a license that, if granted, would exceed the 
spectrum aggregation limitation in paragraph (a) of this section shall 
certify on its application that it and all parties to the application 
will come into compliance with this limitation. If such an applicant is 
a successful bidder in an auction, it must submit with its long-form 
application a signed statement describing its efforts to date and future 
plans to come into compliance with the spectrum aggregation limitation. 
A similar statement must also be included with any application for 
assignment of licenses or transfer of control that, if granted, would 
exceed the spectrum aggregation limit.
    (4)(i) Parties holding controlling interests in broadband PCS, 
cellular, and/or SMR licensees that conflict with the attribution 
threshold or geographic overlap limitations set forth in this section 
will be considered to have come into compliance if they have submitted 
to the Commission an application for assignment of license or transfer 
of

[[Page 10]]

control of the conflicting licensee (see Sec. 1.948 of this chapter; 
see also Sec. 24.839 of this chapter (PCS)) by which, if granted, such 
parties no longer would have an attributable interest in the conflicting 
license. Divestiture may be to an interim trustee if a buyer has not 
been secured in the required period of time, as long as the applicant 
has no interest in or control of the trustee, and the trustee may 
dispose of the license as it sees fit. Where parties to broadband PCS, 
cellular, or SMR applications hold less than controlling (but still 
attributable) interests in broadband PCS, cellular, or SMR licensee(s), 
they shall submit a certification that the applicant and all parties to 
the application have come into compliance with the limitations on 
spectrum aggregation set forth in this section.
    (ii) Applicants that meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section must tender to the Commission within ninety (90) days of 
final grant of the initial license, such an assignment or transfer 
application or, in the case of less than controlling (but still 
attributable) interests, a written certification that the applicant and 
all parties to the application have come into compliance with the 
limitations on spectrum aggregation set forth in this section. If no 
such transfer or assignment application or certification is tendered to 
the Commission within ninety (90) days of final grant of the initial 
license, the Commission may consider the certification and the 
divestiture statement to be material, bad faith misrepresentations and 
shall invoke the condition on the initial license or the assignment or 
transfer, cancelling or rescinding it automatically, shall retain all 
monies paid to the Commission, and, based on the facts presented, shall 
take any other action it may deem appropriate.
    (f) Sunset. This rule section shall cease to be effective January 1, 
2003.

    Note 1 to Sec. 20.6: For purposes of the ownership attribution 
limit, all ownership interests in operations that serve at least 10 
percent of the population of the PCS service area should be included in 
determining the extent of a PCS applicant's cellular or SMR ownership.
    Note 2 to Sec. 20.6: When a party owns an attributable interest in 
more than one cellular or SMR system that overlaps a PCS service area, 
the total population in the overlap area will apply on a cumulative 
basis.
    Note 3 to Sec. 20.6: Waivers of Sec. 20.6(d) may be granted upon 
an affirmative showing:
    (1) That the interest holder has less than a 50 percent voting 
interest in the licensee and there is an unaffiliated single holder of a 
50 percent or greater voting interest;
    (2) That the interest holder is not likely to affect the local 
market in an anticompetitive manner;
    (3) That the interest holder is not involved in the operations of 
the licensee and does not have the ability to influence the licensee on 
a regular basis; and
    (4) That grant of a waiver is in the public interest because the 
benefits to the public of common ownership outweigh any potential 
anticompetitive harm to the market.

    (13) For-profit subsidiary communications services transmitted on 
subcarriers within the FM baseband signal, that provide interconnected 
service (47 CFR 73.295 of this chapter); and
    (14) A mobile service that is the functional equivalent of a 
commercial mobile radio service.
    (i) A mobile service that does not meet the definition of commercial 
mobile radio service is presumed to be a private mobile radio service.
    (ii) Any interested party may seek to overcome the presumption that 
a particular mobile radio service is a private mobile radio service by 
filing a petition for declaratory ruling challenging a mobile service 
provider's regulatory treatment as a private mobile radio service.
    (A) The petition must show that: (1) The mobile service in question 
meets the definition of commercial mobile radio service; or
    (2) The mobile service in question is the functional equivalent of a 
service that meets the definition of a commercial mobile radio service.
    (B) A variety of factors will be evaluated to make a determination 
whether the mobile service in question is the functional equivalent of a 
commercial mobile radio service, including: consumer demand for the 
service to determine whether the service is closely substitutable for a 
commercial mobile radio service; whether changes in price for the 
service under examination, or for the comparable commercial mobile radio 
service would prompt customers to change from one service to the other; 
and market research information identifying the targeted market for the 
service under review.

[[Page 12]]

    (C) The petition must contain specific allegations of fact supported 
by affidavit(s) of person(s) with personal knowledge. The petition must 
be served on the mobile service provider against whom it is filed and 
contain a certificate of service to this effect. The mobile service 
provider may file an opposition to the petition and the petitioner may 
file a reply. The general rules of practice and procedure contained in 
Sec. Sec. 1.1 through 1.52 of this chapter shall apply.
    (b) Licensees of a Personal Communications Service or applicants for 
a Personal Communications Service license, and VHF Public Coast Station 
geographic area licensees or applicants, and Automated Maritime 
Telecommunications System (AMTS) licensees or applicants, proposing to 
use any Personal Communications Service, VHF Public Coast Station, or 
AMTS spectrum to offer service on a private mobile radio service basis 
must overcome the presumption that Personal Communications Service, VHF 
Public Coast, and AMTS Stations are commercial mobile radio services.
    (1) The applicant or licensee (who must file an application to 
modify its authorization) seeking authority to dedicate a portion of the 
spectrum for private mobile radio service, must include a certification 
that it will offer Personal Communications Service, VHF Public Coast 
Station, or AMTS service on a private mobile radio service basis. The 
certification must include a description of the proposed service 
sufficient to demonstrate that it is not within the definition of 
commercial mobile radio service in Sec. 20.3. Any application 
requesting to use any Personal Communications Service, VHF Public Coast 
Station, or AMTS spectrum to offer service on a private mobile radio 
service basis will be placed on public notice by the Commission.
    (2) Any interested party may file a petition to deny the application 
within 30 days after the date of public notice announcing the acceptance 
for filing of the application. The petition shall contain specific 
allegations of fact supported by affidavit(s) of person(s) with personal 
knowledge to show that the applicant's request does not rebut the 
commercial mobile radio service presumption. The petition must be served 
on the applicant and contain a certificate of service to this effect. 
The applicant may file an opposition with allegations of fact supported 
by affidavit. The petitioner may file a reply. No additional pleadings 
will be allowed. The general rules of practice and procedure contained 
in Sec. Sec. 1.1 through 1.52 of this chapter and Sec. 22.30 of this 
chapter shall apply.
    (c) Any provider of private land mobile service before August 10, 
1993 (including any system expansions, modifications, or acquisitions of 
additional licenses in the same service, even if authorized after this 
date), and any private paging service utilizing frequencies allocated as 
of January 1, 1993, that meet the definition of commercial mobile radio 
service, shall, except for purposes of Sec. 20.5 (applicable August 10, 
1993 for the providers listed in this paragraph), be treated as private 
mobile radio service until August 10, 1996. After this date, these 
entities will be treated as commercial mobile radio service providers 
regulated under this part.

Sec. 20.11  Interconnection to facilities of local exchange carriers.

    (a) A local exchange carrier must provide the type of 
interconnection reasonably requested by a mobile service licensee or 
carrier, within a reasonable time after the request, unless such 
interconnection is not technically feasible or economically reasonable. 
Complaints against carriers under section 208 of the Communications Act, 
47 U.S.C. 208, alleging a violation of this section shall follow the 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 1.711-1.734 of this chapter, 47 CFR 1.711-
1.734.
    (b) Local exchange carriers and commercial mobile radio service 
providers shall comply with principles of mutual compensation.
    (1) A local exchange carrier shall pay reasonable compensation to a 
commercial mobile radio service provider in connection with terminating 
traffic

[[Page 13]]

that originates on facilities of the local exchange carrier.
    (2) A commercial mobile radio service provider shall pay reasonable 
compensation to a local exchange carrier in connection with terminating 
traffic that originates on the facilities of the commercial mobile radio 
service provider.
    (c) Local exchange carriers and commercial mobile radio service 
providers shall also comply with applicable provisions of part 51 of 
this chapter.
    (d) Local exchange carriers may not impose compensation obligations 
for traffic not subject to access charges upon commercial mobile radio 
service providers pursuant to tariffs.
    (e) An incumbent local exchange carrier may request interconnection 
from a commercial mobile radio service provider and invoke the 
negotiation and arbitration procedures contained in section 252 of the 
Act. A commercial mobile radio service provider receiving a request for 
interconnection must negotiate in good faith and must, if requested, 
submit to arbitration by the state commission. Once a request for 
interconnection is made, the interim transport and termination pricing 
described in Sec. 51.715 of this chapter shall apply.

Sec. 20.12  Resale and roaming.

    (a)(1) Scope of Manual Roaming and Resale. Paragraph (c) of this 
section is applicable to providers of Broadband Personal Communications 
Services (part 24, subpart E of this chapter), Cellular Radio Telephone 
Service (part 22, subpart H of this chapter), and specialized Mobile 
Radio Services in the 800 MHz and 900 MHz bands (included in part 90, 
subpart S of this chapter) if such providers offer real-time, two-way 
switched voice or data service that is interconnected with the public 
switched network and utilizes an in-network switching facility that 
enables the provider to re-use frequencies and accomplish seamless hand-
offs of subscriber calls. The scope of paragraph (b) of this section, 
concerning the resale rule, is further limited so as to exclude from the 
requirements of that paragraph those Broadband Personal Communications 
Services C, D, E, and F block licensees that do not own and control and 
are not owned and controlled by firms also holding cellular A or B block 
licenses.
    (2) Scope of Automatic Roaming. Paragraph (d) of this section is 
applicable to CMRS carriers if such carriers offer real-time, two-way 
switched voice or data service that is interconnected with the public 
switched network and utilizes an in-network switching facility that 
enables the carrier to re-use frequencies and accomplish seamless hand-
offs of subscriber calls. Paragraph (d) of this section is also 
applicable to the provision of push-to-talk and text-messaging service 
by CMRS carriers.
    (b) Resale. The resale rule is applicable as follows:
    (1) Each carrier subject to paragraph (b) of this section shall not 
restrict the resale of its services, unless the carrier demonstrates 
that the restriction is reasonable.
    (2) The resale requirement shall not apply to customer premises 
equipment, whether or not it is bundled with services subject to the 
resale requirement in this paragraph.
    (3) This paragraph shall cease to be effective five years after the 
last group of initial licenses for broadband PCS spectrum in the 1850-
1910 and the 1930-1990 MHz bands is awarded; i.e., at the close of 
November 24, 2002.
    (c) Manual Roaming. Each carrier subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section must provide mobile radio service upon request to all 
subscribers in good standing to the services of any carrier subject to 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, including roamers, while such 
subscribers are located within any portion of the licensee's licensed 
service area where facilities have been constructed and service to 
subscribers has commenced, if such subscribers are using mobile 
equipment that is technically compatible with the licensee's base 
stations.
    (d) Automatic Roaming. Upon a reasonable request, it shall be the 
duty of each host carrier subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this section to 
provide automatic roaming to any technologically

[[Page 14]]

compatible, facilities-based CMRS carrier on reasonable and not 
unreasonably discriminatory terms and conditions, pursuant to Sections 
201 and 202 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 201 and 202. The 
Commission shall presume that a request by a technologically compatible 
CMRS carrier for automatic roaming is reasonable pursuant to Sections 
201 and 202 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 201 and 202. This 
presumption may be rebutted on a case by case basis. The Commission will 
resolve automatic roaming disputes on a case-by-case basis, taking into

Sec. 20.13  State petitions for authority to regulate rates.

    (a) States may petition for authority to regulate the intrastate 
rates of any commercial mobile radio service. The petition must include 
the following:
    (1) Demonstrative evidence that market conditions in the state for 
commercial mobile radio services do not adequately protect subscribers 
to such services from unjust and unreasonable rates or rates that are 
unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. Alternatively, a state's 
petition may include demonstrative evidence showing that market 
conditions for commercial mobile radio services do not protect 
subscribers adequately from unjust and unreasonable rates, or rates that 
are unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory, and that a substantial 
portion of the commercial mobile radio service subscribers in the state 
or a specified geographic area have no alternative means of obtaining 
basic telephone service. This showing may include evidence of the range 
of basic telephone service alternatives available to consumers in the 
state.
    (2) The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of the types 
of evidence, information, and analysis that may be considered pertinent 
to determine market conditions and consumer protection by the Commission 
in reviewing any petition filed by a state under this section:
    (i) The number of commercial mobile radio service providers in the 
state, the types of services offered by commercial mobile radio service 
providers in the state, and the period of time that these providers have 
offered service in the state;
    (ii) The number of customers of each commercial mobile radio service 
provider in the state; trends in each provider's customer base during 
the most recent annual period or other data covering another reasonable 
period if annual data is unavailable; and annual revenues and rates of 
return for each commercial mobile radio service provider;
    (iii) Rate information for each commercial mobile radio service 
provider, including trends in each provider's rates during the most 
recent annual period or other data covering another reasonable period if 
annual data is unavailable;
    (iv) An assessment of the extent to which services offered by the 
commercial mobile radio service providers the state proposes to regulate 
are substitutable for services offered by other carriers in the state;
    (v) Opportunities for new providers to enter into the provision of 
competing services, and an analysis of any barriers to such entry;
    (vi) Specific allegations of fact (supported by affidavit of person 
with personal knowledge) regarding anti-competitive or discriminatory 
practices or behavior by commercial mobile radio service providers in 
the state;
    (vii) Evidence, information, and analysis demonstrating with 
particularity instances of systematic unjust and unreasonable rates, or 
rates that are unjust or unreasonably discriminatory, imposed upon 
commercial mobile radio service subscribers. Such evidence should 
include an examination of the relationship between rates and costs. 
Additionally, evidence of a pattern of such rates, that demonstrates the 
inability of the commercial mobile radio service marketplace in the 
state to produce reasonable rates through competitive forces will be 
considered especially probative; and
    (viii) Information regarding customer satisfaction or 
dissatisfaction with services offered by commercial

[[Page 15]]

mobile radio service providers, including statistics and other 
information about complaints filed with the state regulatory commission.
    (3) Petitions must include a certification that the state agency 
filing the petition is the duly authorized state agency responsible for 
the regulation of telecommunication services provided in the state.
    (4) Petitions must identify and describe in detail the rules the 
state proposes to establish if the petition is granted.
    (5) States have the burden of proof. Interested parties may file 
comments in support or in opposition to the petition within 30 days 
after public notice of the filing of a petition by a state under this 
section. Any interested party may file a reply within 15 days after the 
expiration of the filing period for comments. No additional pleadings 
may be filed. Except for Sec. 1.45 of this chapter, practice and 
procedure rules contained in Sec. Sec. 1.42-1.52 of this chapter shall 
apply. The provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.771-1.773 of this chapter do not 
apply.
    (6) The Commission shall act upon any petition filed by a state 
under this paragraph not later than the end of the nine-month period 
after the filing of the petition.
    (7) If the Commission grants the petition, it shall authorize the 
state to regulate rates for commercial mobile radio services in the 
state during a reasonable period of time, as specified by the 
Commission. The period of time specified by the Commission will be that 
necessary to ensure that rates are just and reasonable, or not unjustly 
or unreasonably discriminatory.
    (b) States that regulated rates for commercial mobile services as of 
June 1, 1993, may petition the Commission under this section before 
August 10, 1994, to extend this authority.
    (1) The petition will be acted upon by the Commission in accordance 
with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section.
    (2) The Commission shall act upon the petition (including any 
reconsideration) not later than the end of the 12-month period following 
the date of the filing of the petition by the state involved. Commercial 
mobile radio service providers offering such service in the state shall 
comply with the existing regulations of the state until the petition and 
any reconsideration of the petition are acted upon by the Commission.
    (3) The provisions of paragraph (a)(7) of this section apply to any 
petition granted by the Commission under this paragraph.
    (c) No sooner than 18 months from grant of authority by the 
Commission under this section for state rate regulations, any interested 
party may petition the Commission for an order to discontinue state 
authority for rate regulation.
    (1) Petitions to discontinue state authority for rate regulation 
must be based on recent empirical data or other significant evidence 
demonstrating that the exercise of rate authority by a state is no 
longer necessary to ensure that the rates for commercial mobile are just 
and reasonable or not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory.
    (2) Any interested party may file comments in support of or in 
opposition to the petition within 30 days after public notice of the 
filing of the petition. Any interested party may file a reply within 15 
days after the time for filing comments has expired. No additional 
pleadings may be filed. Except for 1.45 of this chapter, practice and 
procedure rules contained in Sec. 1.42-1.52 of this chapter apply. The 
provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.771-1.773 of this chapter do not apply.
    (3) The Commission shall act upon any petition filed by any 
interested party under this paragraph within nine months after the 
filing of the petition.

    (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 63.21(c) of this 
chapter, a commercial mobile radio service provider is not required to 
comply with Sec. 42.10 of this chapter.
    (2) A commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) provider that is 
classified as dominant under Sec. 63.10 of this chapter due to an 
affiliation with a foreign carrier is required to comply with Sec. 
42.11 of this chapter if the affiliated foreign carrier collects 
settlement payments from U.S. carriers for terminating U.S. 
international switched traffic at the foreign end of the route. Such a 
CMRS provider is not required to comply with Sec. 42.11, however, if it 
provides service on the affiliated route solely through the resale of an 
unaffiliated facilities-based provider's international switched 
services.
    (3) For purposes of paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, 
affiliated and foreign carrier are defined in Sec. 63.09 of this 
Chapter.
    (e) For obligations of commercial mobile radio service providers to 
provide local number portability, see Sec. 52.1 of this chapter.

paragraphs and the Public Safety Answering Point is capable of receiving 
and utilizing the data elements associated with the service and a 
mechanism for recovering the Public Safety Answering Point's costs of 
the enhanced 911 service is in place.
    (2) Commencement of six-month period. (i) Except as provided in 
paragraph (ii) of this section, for purposes of commencing the six-month 
period for carrier implementation specified in paragraphs (d), (f) and 
(g) of this section, a PSAP will be deemed capable of receiving and 
utilizing the data elements associated with the service requested, if it 
can demonstrate that it has:
    (A) Ordered the necessary equipment and has commitments from 
suppliers to have it installed and operational within such six-month 
period; and
    (B) Made a timely request to the appropriate local exchange carrier 
for the necessary trunking, upgrades, and other facilities.

[[Page 19]]

    (ii) For purposes of commencing the six-month period for carrier 
implementation specified in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, a 
PSAP that is Phase I-capable using a Non-Call Path Associated Signaling 
(NCAS) technology will be deemed capable of receiving and utilizing the 
data elements associated with Phase II service if it can demonstrate 
that it has made a timely request to the appropriate local exchange 
carrier for the ALI database upgrade necessary to receive the Phase II 
information.
    (3) Tolling of six-month period. Where a wireless carrier has served 
a written request for documentation on the PSAP within 15 days of 
receiving the PSAP's request for Phase I or Phase II enhanced 911 
service, and the PSAP fails to respond to such request within 15 days of 
such service, the six-month period for carrier implementation specified 
in paragraphs (d), (f), and (g) of this section will be tolled until the 
PSAP provides the carrier with such documentation.
    (4) Carrier certification regarding PSAP readiness issues. At the 
end of the six-month period for carrier implementation specified in 
paragraphs (d), (f) and (g) of this section, a wireless carrier that 
believes that the PSAP is not capable of receiving and utilizing the 
data elements associated with the service requested may file a 
certification with the Commission. Upon filing and service of such 
certification, the carrier may suspend further implementation efforts, 
except as provided in paragraph (j)(4)(x) of this section.
    (i) As a prerequisite to filing such certification, no later than 21 
days prior to such filing, the wireless carrier must notify the affected 
PSAP, in writing, of its intent to file such certification. Any response 
that the carrier receives from the PSAP must be included with the 
carrier's certification filing.
    (ii) The certification process shall be subject to the procedural 
requirements set forth in sections 1.45 and 1.47 of this chapter.
    (iii) The certification must be in the form of an affidavit signed 
by a director or officer of the carrier, documenting:
    (A) The basis for the carrier's determination that the PSAP will not 
be ready;
    (B) Each of the specific steps the carrier has taken to provide the 
E911 service requested;
    (C) The reasons why further implementation efforts cannot be made 
until the PSAP becomes capable of receiving and utilizing the data 
elements associated with the E911 service requested; and
    (D) The specific steps that remain to be completed by the wireless 
carrier and, to the extent known, the PSAP or other parties before the 
carrier can provide the E911 service requested.
    (iv) All affidavits must be correct. The carrier must ensure that 
its affidavit is correct, and the certifying director or officer has the 
duty to personally determine that the affidavit is correct.
    (v) A carrier may not engage in a practice of filing inadequate or 
incomplete certifications for the purpose of delaying its 
responsibilities.
    (vi) To be eligible to make a certification, the wireless carrier 
must have completed all necessary steps toward E911 implementation that 
are not dependent on PSAP readiness.
    (vii) A copy of the certification must be served on the PSAP in 
accordance with Sec. 1.47 of this chapter. The PSAP may challenge in 
writing the accuracy of the carrier's certification and shall serve a 
copy of such challenge on the carrier. See Sec. Sec. 1.45 and 1.47 and 
Sec. Sec. 1.720 through 1.736 of this chapter.
    (viii) If a wireless carrier's certification is facially inadequate, 
the six-month implementation period specified in paragraphs (d), (f) and 
(g) of this section will not be suspended as provided for in paragraph 
(j)(4) of this section.
    (ix) If a wireless carrier's certification is inaccurate, the 
wireless carrier will be liable for noncompliance as if the 
certification had not been filed.
    (x) A carrier that files a certification under paragraph (j)(4) of 
this section shall have 90 days from receipt of the PSAP's written 
notice that it is capable of receiving and utilizing the data elements 
associated with the service requested to provide such service in 
accordance with the requirements of

[[Page 20]]

paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section.
    (5) Modification of deadlines by agreement. Nothing in this section 
shall prevent Public Safety Answering Points and carriers from 
establishing, by mutual consent, deadlines different from those imposed 
for carrier and PSAP compliance in paragraphs (d), (f), and (g)(2) of 
this section.
    (k) Dispatch service. A service provider covered by this section who 
offers dispatch service to customers may meet the requirements of this 
section with respect to customers who utilize dispatch service either by 
complying with the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) through (e) 
of this section, or by routing the customer's emergency calls through a 
dispatcher. If the service provider chooses the latter alternative, it 
must make every reasonable effort to explicitly notify its current and 
potential dispatch customers and their users that they are not able to 
directly reach a PSAP by calling 911 and that, in the event of an 
emergency, the dispatcher should be contacted.
    (l) Non-service-initialized handsets. (1) Licensees subject to this 
section that donate a non-service-initialized handset for purposes of 
providing access to 911 services are required to:
    (i) Program each handset with 911 plus the decimal representation of 
the seven least significant digits of the Electronic Serial Number, 
International Mobile Equipment Identifier, or any other identifier 
unique to that handset;
    (ii) Affix to each handset a label which is designed to withstand 
the length of service expected for a non-service-initialized phone, and 
which notifies the user that the handset can only be used to dial 911, 
that the 911 operator will not be able to call the user back, and that 
the user should convey the exact location of the emergency as soon as 
possible; and
    (iii) Institute a public education program to provide the users of 
such handsets with information regarding the limitations of non-service-
initialized handsets.
    (2) Manufacturers of 911-only handsets that are manufactured on or 
after May 3, 2004, are required to:
    (i) Program each handset with 911 plus the decimal representation of 
the seven least significant digits of the Electronic Serial Number, 
International Mobile Equipment Identifier, or any other identifier 
unique to that handset;
    (ii) Affix to each handset a label which is designed to withstand 
the length of service expected for a non-service-initialized phone, and 
which notifies the user that the handset can only be used to dial 911, 
that the 911 operator will not be able to call the user back, and that 
the user should convey the exact location of the emergency as soon as 
possible; and
    (iii) Institute a public education program to provide the users of 
such handsets with information regarding the limitations of 911-only 
handsets.
    (3) Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of 
this paragraph.
    (i) Non-service-initialized handset. A handset for which there is no 
valid service contract with a provider of the services enumerated in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (ii) 911-only handset. A non-service-initialized handset that is 
manufactured with the capability of dialing 911 only and that cannot 
receive incoming calls.
    (m) Reseller obligation. (1) Beginning December 31, 2006, resellers 
have an obligation, independent of the underlying licensee, to provide 
access to basic and enhanced 911 service to the extent that the 
underlying licensee of the facilities the reseller uses to provide 
access to the public switched network complies with sections 20.18(d)-
(g).
    (2) Resellers have an independent obligation to ensure that all 
handsets or other devices offered to their customers for voice 
communications and sold after December 31, 2006 are capable of 
transmitting enhanced 911 information to the appropriate PSAP, in 
accordance with the accuracy requirements of section 20.18(i).

Sec. 20.19  Hearing aid-compatible mobile handsets.

    (a) Scope of section; definitions. (1) The hearing aid compatibility 
requirements of this section apply to providers of digital CMRS in the 
United States to the extent that they offer real-time, two-way switched 
voice or data service that is interconnected with the public switched 
network and utilizes an in-network switching facility that enables the 
provider to reuse frequencies and accomplish seamless hand-offs of 
subscriber calls, and such service is provided over frequencies in the 
800-950 MHz or 1.6-2.5 GHz bands using any air interface for which 
technical standards are stated in the standard document ``American 
National Standard Methods of Measurement of Compatibility Between 
Wireless Communication Devices and Hearing Aids,'' American National 
Standards Institute (ANSI) C63.19-2007 (June 8, 2007).
    (2) The requirements of this section also apply to the manufacturers 
of the wireless handsets that are used in delivery of the services 
specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (3) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    (i) Manufacturer refers to a wireless handset manufacturer to which 
the requirements of this section apply.
    (ii) Model refers to a wireless handset device that a manufacturer 
has designated as a distinct device model, consistent with its own 
marketing practices. However, if a manufacturer assigns different model 
device designations solely to distinguish units sold to different 
carriers, or to signify other distinctions that do not relate to either 
form, features, or capabilities, such designations shall not count as 
distinct models for purposes of this section.
    (iii) Service provider refers to a provider of digital CMRS to which 
the requirements of this section apply.
    (iv) Tier I carrier refers to a CMRS provider that offers such 
service nationwide.
    (b) Hearing aid compatibility; technical standards. A wireless 
handset used for digital CMRS only over the frequency bands and air 
interfaces referenced in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is hearing 
aid-compatible with regard to radio frequency interference or inductive 
coupling if it meets the applicable technical standard(s) set forth in 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section for all frequency bands and 
air interfaces over which it operates, and the handset has been 
certified as compliant with the test requirements for the applicable 
standard pursuant to Sec. 2.1033(d) of this chapter. A wireless handset 
that incorporates a Wi-Fi air interface is hearing aid-compatible if the 
handset otherwise satisfies the requirements of this paragraph.
    (1) For radio frequency interference.
    (i) Applicable technical standards prior to 2010. Beginning June 6, 
2008 and until January 1, 2010, a wireless handset submitted for 
equipment certification or for a permissive change relating to hearing 
aid compatibility must meet, at a minimum, the M3 rating associated with 
the technical standard set forth in either the standard document 
``American National Standard Methods of Measurement of Compatibility 
Between Wireless Communication Devices and Hearing Aids,'' ANSI C63.19-
2006 (June 12, 2006) or ANSI C63.19-2007 (June 8, 2007)--each available 
for purchase from the American National Standards Institute. Any grants 
of certification issued before June 6, 2008 under previous versions of 
ANSI C63.19 remain valid for hearing aid compatibility purposes.
    (ii) Applicable technical standards beginning in 2010. On or after 
January 1, 2010, a wireless handset submitted for equipment 
certification or for a permissive change relating to hearing aid

[[Page 22]]

compatibility must meet, at a minimum, the M3 rating associated with the 
technical standard set forth in ANSI C63.19-2007 (June 8, 2007). Any 
grants of certification issued before January 1, 2010, under the earlier 
versions of ANSI C63.19 remain valid for hearing aid compatibility 
purposes.
    (2) For inductive coupling.
    (i) Applicable technical standards prior to 2010. Beginning June 6, 
2008 and until January 1, 2010, a wireless handset submitted for 
equipment certification or for a permissive change relating to hearing 
aid compatibility must meet, at a minimum, the T3 rating associated with 
the technical standard set forth in either the standard document 
``American National Standard Methods of Measurement of Compatibility 
Between Wireless Communication Devices and Hearing Aids,'' ANSI C63.19-
2006 (June 12, 2006) or ANSI C63.19-2007 (June 8, 2007). Any grants of 
certification issued before June 6, 2008 under previous versions of ANSI 
C63.19 remain valid for hearing aid compatibility purposes.
    (ii) Applicable technical standards beginning in 2010. On or after 
January 1, 2010, a wireless handset submitted for equipment 
certification or for a permissive change relating to hearing aid 
compatibility must meet, at a minimum, the T3 rating associated with the 
technical standard set forth in ANSI C63.19-2007 (June 8, 2007). Any 
grants of certification issued before January 1, 2010, under the earlier 
versions of ANSI C63.19 remain valid for hearing aid compatibility 
purposes.

Sec. 20.19  Hearing aid-compatible mobile handsets.

    (a) * * *
    (3) * * *
    (i) Handset refers to a device used in delivery of the services 
specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section that contains a built-in 
speaker and is typically held to the ear in any of its ordinary uses.

                                * * * * *

    (b) Hearing aid compatibility; technical standards. A wireless 
handset used for digital CMRS only over the frequency bands and air 
interfaces referenced in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is hearing 
aid-compatible with regard to radio frequency interference or inductive 
coupling if it meets the applicable technical standard(s) set forth in 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section for all frequency bands and 
air interfaces over which it operates, and the handset has been 
certified as compliant with the test requirements for the applicable 
standard pursuant to Sec. 2.1033(d) of this chapter. A wireless handset 
that incorporates an air interface or operates over a frequency band for 
which no technical standards are stated in ANSI C63.19-2007 (June 8, 
2007) is hearing aid-compatible if the handset otherwise satisfies the 
requirements of this paragraph.

                                * * * * *

    (c) * * *
    (1) * * *

two digital wireless handsets in that air interface in the United States 
must offer at least one handset model compliant with paragraphs (b)(1) 
and (b)(2) of this section in that air interface, except as provided in 
paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section. Service providers that obtain 
handsets only from manufacturers that offer one or two digital wireless 
handset models in an air interface in the United States, and that have 
had more than 750 employees for at least two years and have offered 
handsets over that air interface for at least two years, are required to 
offer at least one handset model in that air interface compliant with 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, except as provided in 
paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, 
employees of a parent, subsidiary, or affiliate company under common 
ownership or control with a manufacturer or service provider are 
considered employees of the manufacturer or service provider.

power at which the handset will operate by no more than 2.5 decibels, 
except for emergency calls to 911, only for GSM operations in the 1900 
MHz band;
    (B) The handset would comply with paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
if the power as so reduced were the maximum power at which the handset 
could operate; and
    (C) Customers are informed of the power reduction mode as provided 
in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. Manufacturers and service providers 
covered by this paragraph must also comply with all other requirements 
of this section.

                                * * * * *

    (f) * * *
    (2)(i) Disclosure requirement relating to handsets that operate over 
an air interface or frequency band without hearing aid compatibility 
technical standards. Each manufacturer and service provider shall ensure 
that, wherever it provides hearing aid compatibility ratings for a 
handset that incorporates an air interface or operates over a frequency 
band for which no technical standards are stated in ANSI C63.19-2007 
(June 8, 2007), it discloses to consumers, by clear and effective means 
(e.g., inclusion of call-out cards or other media, revisions to 
packaging materials, supplying of information on Web sites) that the 
handset has not been rated for hearing aid compatibility with respect to 
that operation. This disclosure shall include the following language:

    This phone has been tested and rated for use with hearing aids for 
some of the wireless technologies that it uses. However, there may be 
some newer wireless technologies used in this phone that have not been 
tested yet for use with hearing aids. It is important to try the 
different features of this phone thoroughly and in different locations, 
using your hearing aid or cochlear implant, to determine if you hear any 
interfering noise.

[[Page 29]]

Consult your service provider or the manufacturer of this phone for 
information on hearing aid compatibility. If you have questions about 
return or exchange policies, consult your service provider or phone 
retailer.

    (ii) However, service providers are not required to include this 
language in the packaging material for handsets that incorporate a Wi-Fi 
air interface and that were obtained by the service provider before 
March 8, 2011, provided that the service provider otherwise discloses by 
clear and effective means that the handset has not been rated for 
hearing aid compatibility with respect to Wi-Fi operation.
    (3) Disclosure requirement relating to handsets that allow the user 
to reduce the maximum power for GSM operation in the 1900 MHz band. 
Handsets offered to satisfy paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section shall 
be labeled as meeting an M3 rating. Each manufacturer and service 
provider shall ensure that, wherever this rating is displayed, it 
discloses to consumers, by clear and effective means (e.g., inclusion of 
call-out cards or other media, revisions to packaging materials, 
supplying of information on Web sites), that user activation of a 
special mode is necessary to meet the hearing aid compatibility 
standard. In addition, each manufacturer or service provider shall 
ensure that the device manual or a product insert explains how to 
activate the special mode and that doing so may result in a reduction of 
coverage.

                                * * * * *

    (k) Delegation of rulemaking authority. (1) The Chief of the 
Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and the Chief of the Office of 
Engineering and Technology are delegated authority, by notice-and-
comment rulemaking, to issue an order amending this section to the 
extent necessary to adopt technical standards for additional frequency 
bands and/or air interfaces upon the establishment of such standards by 
ANSI Accredited Standards Committee C63<SUP>TM</SUP>, provided that the 
standards do not impose with respect to such frequency bands or air 
interfaces materially greater obligations than those imposed on other 
services subject to this section. Any new obligations on manufacturers 
and Tier I carriers pursuant to paragraphs (c) through (i) of this 
section as a result of such standards shall become effective no less 
than one year after release of the order adopting such standards and any 
new obligations on other service providers shall become effective no 
less than 15 months after the release of such order, except that any new 
obligations on manufacturers and service providers subject to paragraph 
(e)(1)(ii) of this section shall become effective no less than two years 
after the release of such order.

<R05>
Sec. 20.20  Conditions applicable to provision of CMRS service by incumbent Local Exchange Carriers.

    (a) Separate affiliate. An incumbent LEC providing in-region 
broadband CMRS shall provide such services through an affiliate that 
satisfies the following requirements:
    (1) The affiliate shall maintain separate books of account from its 
affiliated incumbent LEC. Nothing in this section requires the affiliate 
to maintain separate books of account that comply with part 32 of this 
chapter;
    (2) The affiliate shall not jointly own transmission or switching 
facilities with its affiliated incumbent LEC that the affiliated 
incumbent LEC uses for the provision of local exchange service in the 
same in-region market. Nothing in this section prohibits the affiliate 
from sharing personnel or other resources or assets with its affiliated 
incumbent LEC; and
    (3) The affiliate shall acquire any services from its affiliated 
incumbent LEC for which the affiliated incumbent LEC is required to file 
a tariff at tariffed rates, terms, and conditions. Other transactions 
between the affiliate and the incumbent LEC for services that are not 
acquired pursuant to tariff must be reduced to writing and must be made 
on a compensatory, arm's length basis. All transactions between the 
incumbent LEC and the affiliate are subject to part 32 of this chapter, 
including the affiliate transaction rules. Nothing in this section shall 
prohibit the affiliate from acquiring any unbundled network elements or 
exchange services for the provision of a telecommunications service from 
its affiliated incumbent LEC, subject to the same terms and conditions 
as provided in an agreement approved under section 252 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
    (b) Independence. The affiliate required in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be a separate legal entity from its affiliated incumbent 
LEC. The affiliate

[[Page 30]]

may be staffed by personnel of its affiliated incumbent LEC, housed in 
existing offices of its affiliated incumbent LEC, and use its affiliated 
incumbent LEC's marketing and other services, subject to paragraphs 
(a)(3) and (c) of this section.
    (c) Joint marketing. Joint marketing of local exchange and exchange 
access service and CMRS services by an incumbent LEC shall be subject to 
part 32 of this chapter. In addition, such agreements between the 
affiliate and the incumbent LEC must be reduced to writing and made 
available for public inspection upon request at the principle place of 
business of the affiliate and the incumbent LEC. The documentation must 
include a certification statement identical to the certification 
statement currently required to be included with all Automated Reporting 
and Management Information Systems (ARMIS) reports. The affiliate must 
also provide a detailed written description of the terms and conditions 
of the transaction on the Internet within 10 days of the transaction 
through the affiliate's home page.
    (d) Exceptions. (1) Rural telephone companies. Rural telephone 
companies are exempted from the requirements set forth in paragraphs 
(a), (b) and (c) of this section. A competing telecommunications 
carrier, interconnected with the rural telephone company, however, may 
petition the FCC to remove the exemption, or the FCC may do so on its 
own motion, where the rural telephone company has engaged in 
anticompetitive conduct.
    (2) Incumbent LECs with fewer than 2 percent of subscriber lines. 
Incumbent LECs with fewer than 2 percent of the nation's subscriber 
lines installed in the aggregate nationwide may petition the FCC for 
suspension or modification of the requirements set forth in paragraphs 
(a), (b) and (c) of this section. The FCC will grant such a petition 
where the incumbent LEC demonstrates that suspension or modification of 
the separate affiliate requirement is
    (i) Necessary to avoid a significant adverse economic impact on 
users of telecommunications services generally or to avoid a requirement 
that would be unduly economically burdensome, and
    (ii) Consistent with the public interest, convenience, and 
necessity.
    (e) Definitions. Terms used in this section have the following 
meanings:
    Affiliate. ``Affiliate'' means a person that (directly or 
indirectly) owns or controls, is owned or controlled by, or is under 
common ownership with, another person. For purposes of this section, the 
term ``own'' means to own an equity interest (or the equivalent thereof) 
of more than 10 percent.
    Broadband Commercial Mobile Radio Service (Broadband CMRS). For the 
purposes of this section, ``broadband CMRS'' means Cellular 
Radiotelephone Service (part 22, subpart H of this chapter), Specialized 
Mobile Radio (part 90, subpart S of this chapter), and broadband 
Personal Communications Services (part 24, subpart E of this chapter).
    Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (Incumbent LEC). ``Incumbent LEC'' 
has the same meaning as that term is defined in Sec. 51.5 of this 
chapter.
    In-region. For the purposes of this section, an incumbent LEC's 
broadband CMRS service is considered ``in-region'' when 10 percent or 
more of the population covered by the CMRS affiliate's authorized 
service area, as determined by the 1990 census figures, is within the 
affiliated incumbent LEC's wireline service area.
    Rural Telephone Company. ``Rural Telephone Company'' has the same 
meaning as that term is defined in Sec. 51.5 of this chapter.
    (f) Sunset. This section will no longer be effective after January 
1, 2002.

             Subpart B_Licensing Requirements and Procedures

                     Applications and Notifications


<R05>
Sec. 22.107  General application requirements.

    In general, applications for authorizations, assignments of 
authorizations, or consent to transfer of control of licensees in the 
Public Mobile Services must:
    (a) Demonstrate the applicant's qualifications to hold an 
authorization in the Public Mobile services;
    (b) State how a grant would serve the public interest, convenience, 
and necessity;
    (c) Contain all information required by FCC rules or application 
forms;
    (d) Propose operation of a facility in compliance with all rules 
governing the Public Mobile service;
    (e) Be amended as necessary to remain substantially accurate and 
complete in all significant respects, in accordance with the provisions 
of Sec. 1.65 of this chapter; and,
    (f) Be signed in accordance with Sec. 1.743 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 22.131  Procedures for mutually exclusive applications.

    Two or more pending applications are mutually exclusive if the grant 
of one application would effectively preclude the grant of one or more 
of the others under Commission rules governing the Public Mobile 
Services involved. The Commission uses the general procedures in this 
section for processing mutually exclusive applications in the Public 
Mobile Services. Additional specific procedures are prescribed in the 
subparts of this part governing the individual Public Mobile Services 
(see Sec. Sec. 22.509, 22.717, and 22.949) and in part 1 of this 
chapter.
    (a) Separate applications. Any applicant that files an application 
knowing that it will be mutually exclusive with

[[Page 39]]

one or more applications should not include in the mutually exclusive 
application a request for other channels or facilities that would not, 
by themselves, render the application mutually exclusive with those 
other applications. Instead, the request for such other channels or 
facilities should be filed in a separate application.
    (b) Filing groups. Pending mutually exclusive applications are 
processed in filing groups. Mutually exclusive applications in a filing 
group are given concurrent consideration. The Commission may dismiss as 
defective (pursuant to Sec. 1.945 of this chapter) any mutually 
exclusive application(s) whose filing date is outside of the date range 
for inclusion in the filing group. The types of filing groups used in 
day-to-day application processing are specified in paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section. A filing group is one of the following types:
    (1) Renewal filing group. A renewal filing group comprises a timely-
filed application for renewal of an authorization and all timely-filed 
mutually exclusive competing applications (see Sec. 1.935 of this 
chapter).
    (2) Same-day filing group. A same-day filing group comprises all 
mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is the same day, which 
is normally the filing date of the first-filed application(s).
    (3) Thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group. A 30-day notice and 
cut-off filing group comprises mutually exclusive applications whose 
filing date is no later than thirty (30) days after the date of the 
Public Notice listing the first-filed application(s) (according to the 
filing dates) as acceptable for filing.
    (4) Window filing group. A window filing group comprises mutually 
exclusive applications whose filing date is within an announced filing 
window. An announced filing window is a period of time between and 
including two specific dates, which are the first and last dates on 
which applications (or amendments) for a particular purpose may be 
accepted for filing. In the case of a one-day window, the two dates are 
the same. The dates are made known to the public in advance.
    (c) Procedures. Generally, the Commission may grant one application 
in a filing group of mutually exclusive applications and dismiss the 
other application(s) in the filing that are excluded by that grant, 
pursuant to Sec. 1.945 of this chapter.
    (1) Selection methods. In selecting the application to grant, the 
Commission will use competitive bidding.
    (2) Dismissal of applications. The Commission may dismiss any 
application in a filing group that is defective or otherwise subject to 
dismissal under Sec. 1.945 of this chapter, either before or after 
employing selection procedures.
    (3) Type of filing group used. Except as otherwise provided in this 
part, the type of filing group used in the processing of two or more 
mutually exclusive applications depends upon the purpose(s) of the 
applications.
    (i) If one of the mutually exclusive applications is a timely-filed 
application for renewal of an authorization, a renewal filing group is 
used.
    (ii) If any mutually exclusive application filed on the earliest 
filing date is an application for modification and none of the mutually 
exclusive applications is a timely-filed application for renewal, a 
same-day filing group is used.
    (iii) If all of the mutually exclusive applications filed on the 
earliest filing date are applications for initial authorization, a 30-
day notice and cut-off filing group is used, except that, for Phase I 
unserved area applications in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service, a 
one-day window filing group is used (see Sec. 22.949).
    (4) Disposition. If there is only one application in any type of 
filing group, the Commission may grant that application and dismiss 
without prejudice any mutually exclusive applications not in the filing 
group. If there is more than one mutually exclusive application in a 
filing group, the Commission disposes of these applications as follows:
    (i) Applications in a renewal filing group. All mutually exclusive 
applications in a renewal filing group are designated for comparative 
consideration in a hearing.
    (ii) Applications in a 30-day notice and cut-off filing group. (A) 
If all of the mutually exclusive applications in a 30-day notice and 
cut-off filing group are

[[Page 40]]

applications for initial authorization, the FCC administers competitive 
bidding procedures in accordance with Sec. 22.201 through Sec. 22.227 
and subpart Q of part 1 of this chapter, as applicable. After such 
procedures, the application of the successful bidder may be granted and 
the other applications may be dismissed without prejudice.
    (B) If any of the mutually exclusive applications in a 30-day notice 
and cut-off filing group is an application for modification, the 
Commission may attempt to resolve the mutual exclusivity by facilitating 
a settlement between the applicants. If a settlement is not reached 
within a reasonable time, the FCC may designate all applications in the 
filing group for comparative consideration in a hearing. In this event, 
the result of the hearing disposes all of the applications in the filing 
group.
    (iii) Applications in a same-day filing group. If there are two or 
more mutually exclusive applications in a same-day filing group, the 
Commission may attempt to resolve the mutual exclusivity by facilitating 
a settlement between the applicants. If a settlement is not reached 
within a reasonable time, the Commission may designate all applications 
in the filing group for comparative consideration in a hearing. In this 
event, the result of the hearing disposes of all of the applications in 
the filing group.
    (iv) Applications in a window filing group. Applications in a window 
filing group are processed in accordance with the procedures for a 30-
day notice and cut-off filing group in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this 
section.
    (d) Terminology. For the purposes of this section, terms have the 
following meanings:
    (1) The filing date of an application is the date on which that 
application was received in a condition acceptable for filing or the 
date on which the most recently filed major amendment to that 
application was received, whichever is later, excluding major amendments 
in the following circumstances:
    (i) The major amendment reflects only a change in ownership or 
control found by the Commission to be in the public interest;
    (ii) The major amendment as received is defective or otherwise found 
unacceptable for filing; or
    (iii) The application being amended has been designated for hearing 
and the Commission or the presiding officer accepts the major amendment.
    (2) An application for initial authorization is:
    (i) Any application requesting an authorization for a new system or 
station;
    (ii) Any application requesting authorization for an existing 
station to operate on an additional channel, unless the additional 
channel is for paired two-way radiotelephone operation, is in the same 
frequency range as the existing channel(s), and will be operationally 
integrated with the existing channel(s) such as by trunking;
    (iii) Any application requesting authorization for a new transmitter 
at a location more than 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from any existing 
transmitters of the applicant licensee on the requested channel or 
channel block; or
    (iv) Any application to expand the CGSA of a cellular system (as 
defined in Sec. 22.911), except during the five-year build-out period.
    (v) Any ``short-form'' application (filed on FCC Form 175) 
requesting a new paging geographic area authorization.

<R05>
Sec. 22.143  Construction prior to grant of application.

    Applicants may construct facilities in the Public Mobile services 
prior to grant of their applications, subject to the provisions of this 
section, but must not operate such facilities until the FCC grants an 
authorization. If the conditions stated in this section are not met, 
applicants must not begin to construct facilities in the Public Mobile 
Services.
    (a) When applicants may begin construction. An applicant may begin 
construction of a facility 35 days after the date of the Public Notice 
listing the application for that facility as acceptable for filing, 
except that an applicant whose application to operate a new cellular 
system was selected in a random

[[Page 41]]

selection process may begin construction of that new cellular system 35 
days after the date of the Public Notice listing it as the tentative 
selectee.
    (b) Notification to stop. If the FCC for any reason determines that 
construction should not be started or should be stopped while an 
application is pending, and so notifies the applicant, orally (followed 
by written confirmation) or in writing, the applicant must not begin 
construction or, if construction has begun, must stop construction 
immediately.
    (c) Assumption of risk. Applicants that begin construction pursuant 
to this section before receiving an authorization do so at their own 
risk and have no recourse against the United States for any losses 
resulting from:
    (1) Applications that are not granted;
    (2) Errors or delays in issuing Public Notices;
    (3) Having to alter, relocate or dismantle the facility; or
    (4) Incurring whatever costs may be necessary to bring the facility 
into compliance with applicable laws, or FCC rules and orders.

Sec. 22.150  Standard pre-filing technical coordination procedure.

    For operations on certain channels in the Public Mobile Services, 
carriers must attempt to coordinate the proposed use of spectrum with 
other spectrum users prior to filing an application for authority to 
operate a station. Rules requiring this procedure for specific channels 
and types of stations are contained in the subparts governing the 
individual Public Mobile Services.
    (a) Coordination comprises two steps--notification and response. 
Each step may be accomplished orally or in writing.
    (b) Notification must include relevant technical details of the 
proposal. At minimum, this should include the following:
    (1) Geographical coordinates of the antenna site(s).
    (2) Transmitting and receiving channels to be added or changed.
    (3) Transmitting power, emission type and polarization.
    (4) Transmitting antenna pattern and maximum gain.
    (5) Transmitting antenna height above ground level.
    (c) Applicants and licensees receiving notification must respond 
promptly, even if no channel usage conflicts are anticipated. If any 
notified party fails to respond within 30 days, the applicant may file 
the application without a response from that party.
    (d) The 30-day period begins on the date the notification is 
submitted to the Commission via the ULS. If the notification is by mail, 
this date may be ascertained by:
    (1) The return receipt on certified mail,

[[Page 42]]

    (2) The enclosure of a card to be dated and returned by the party 
being notified, or
    (3) A reasonable estimate of the time required for the mail to reach 
its destination. In this case, the date when the 30-day period will 
expire must be stated in the notification.
    (e) All channel usage conflicts discovered during the coordination 
process should be resolved prior to filing of the application. If the 
applicant is unable or unwilling to resolve a particular conflict, the 
application may be accepted for filing if it contains a statement 
describing the unresolved conflict and a brief explanation of the 
reasons why a resolution was not achieved.
    (f) If a number of changes in the technical parameters of a proposed 
facility become necessary during the course of the coordination process, 
an attempt should be made to minimize the number of separate 
notifications. If the changes are incorporated into a completely revised 
notice, the items that were changed from the previous notice should be 
identified.
    (g) In situations where subsequent changes are not numerous or 
complex, the party receiving the changed notification should make an 
effort to respond in less than 30 days. If the applicant believes a 
shorter response time is reasonable and appropriate, it should so 
indicate in the notice and suggest a response date.
    (h) If a subsequent change in the technical parameters of a proposed 
facility could not affect the facilities of one or more of the parties 
that received an initial notification, the applicant is not required to 
coordinate that change with these parties. However, these parties must 
be advised of the change and of the opinion that coordination is not 
required.

Sec. 22.165  Additional transmitters for existing systems.

    A licensee may operate additional transmitters at additional 
locations on the same channel or channel block as its existing system 
without obtaining prior Commission approval provided:
    (a) International coordination. The locations and/or technical 
parameters of the additional transmitters are such that individual 
coordination of the channel assignment(s) with a foreign administration, 
under applicable international agreements and rules in this part, is not 
required.
    (b) Antenna structure registration. Certain antenna structures must 
be registered with the Commission prior to construction or alteration. 
Registration requirements are contained in part 17 of this chapter.
    (c) Environmental. The additional transmitters must not have a 
significant environmental effect as defined by Sec. Sec. 1.1301 through 
1.1319 of this chapter.
    (d) Paging and Radiotelephone Service. The provisions in this 
paragraph apply for stations in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service.
    (1) The interfering contours of the additional transmitter(s) must 
be totally encompassed by the composite interfering contour of the 
existing station (or stations under common control of the applicant) on 
the same channel, except that this limitation does not apply to 
nationwide network paging stations or in-building radiation systems.
    (2) Additional transmitters in the 43 MHz frequency range operate 
under developmental authority, subject to the conditions set forth in 
Sec. 22.411.
    (3) The additional transmitters must not operate on control channels 
in the 72-76 MHz, 470-512 MHz, 928 MHz, 932 MHz, 941 MHz or 959 MHz 
frequency ranges.
    (e) Cellular radiotelephone service. During the five-year build-out 
period, the service area boundaries of the additional transmitters, as 
calculated by the method set forth in Sec. 22.911(a), must remain 
within the market, except that the service area boundaries may extend 
beyond the market boundary into the area that is part of the CGSA or is 
already encompassed by the service area boundaries of previously 
authorized facilities. After the five-year build-out period, the service 
area boundaries of the additional transmitters, as calculated by the 
method set forth in Sec. 22.911(a), must remain within the

[[Page 43]]

CGSA. Licensees must notify the Commission (FCC Form 601) of any 
transmitters added under this section that cause a change in the CGSA 
boundary. The notification must include full size and reduced maps, and 
supporting engineering, as described in Sec. 22.953(a)(1) through (3). 
If the addition of transmitters involves a contract service area 
boundary (SAB) extension (see Sec. 22.912), the notification must 
include a statement as to whether the five-year build-out period for the 
system on the relevant channel block in the market into which the SAB 
extends has elapsed and whether the SAB extends into any unserved area 
in the market. The notification must be made electronically via the ULS, 
or delivered to the filing place (see Sec. 1.913 of this chapter) once 
yearly during the five-year build-out on the anniversary of the license 
grant date.
    (f) Air-ground Radiotelephone Service. Ground stations may be added 
to Commercial Aviation air-ground systems at previously established 
ground station locations, pursuant to Sec. 22.859, subject to 
compliance with the applicable technical rules. This section does not 
apply to General Aviation air-ground stations.
    (g) Rural Radiotelephone Service. A ``service area'' and 
``interfering contours'' must be determined using the same method as for 
stations in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service. The service area and 
interfering contours so determined for the additional transmitter(s) 
must be totally encompassed by the similarly determined composite 
service area contour and predicted interfering contour, respectively, of 
the existing station on the same channel. This section does not apply to 
Basic Exchange Telecommunications Radio Systems.
    (h) Offshore Radiotelephone Service. This section does not apply to 
stations in the Offshore Radiotelephone Service.
    (i) Provision of information upon request. Upon request by the FCC, 
licensees must supply administrative or technical information concerning 
the additional transmitters. At the time transmitters are added pursuant 
to this section, licensees must make a record of the pertinent technical 
and administrative information so that such information is readily 
available. See Sec. 22.303.

unions in the development of programs to assure qualified minority 
persons or females of equal opportunity for employment, and including an 
effective nondiscrimination clause in new or renegotiated union 
agreements.
    (C) Avoiding use of selection techniques or tests that have the 
effect of discriminating against minority groups or females.
    (iii) To assure nondiscriminatory placement and promotion. (A) 
Instructing employees of the licensee who make decisions on placement 
and promotion that minority employees and females are to be considered 
without discrimination, and that job areas in which there is little or 
no minority or female representation should be reviewed to determine 
whether this results from discrimination.
    (B) Giving minority groups and female employees equal opportunity 
for positions which lead to higher positions. Inquiring as to the 
interest and skills of all lower-paid employees with respect to any of 
the higher-paid positions, followed by assistance, counseling, and 
effective measures to enable employees with interest and potential to 
qualify themselves for such positions.

the courts or agencies before which the matters have been heard, the 
appropriate file number (if any), and the respective disposition or 
current status of any such complaints.
    (2) Any licensee who has filed such information with the EEOC may 
file a notification of such filing with the FCC in lieu of a report.
    (d) Complaints of violations of Equal Employment Programs. 
Complaints alleging employment discrimination against a common carrier 
licensee are considered by the FCC in the following manner:
    (1) If a complaint raising an issue of discrimination is received 
against a licensee who is within the jurisdiction of the EEOC, it is 
submitted to that agency. The FCC maintains a liaison with that agency 
that keeps the FCC informed of the disposition of complaints filed 
against common carrier licensees.
    (2) Complaints alleging employment discrimination against a common 
carrier licensee who does not fall under the jurisdiction of the EEOC 
but is covered by appropriate enforceable State law, to which penalties 
apply, may be submitted by the FCC to the respective State agency.
    (3) Complaints alleging employment discrimination against a common 
carrier licensee who does not fall under the jurisdiction of the EEOC or 
an appropriate State law, are accorded appropriate treatment by the FCC.
    (4) The FCC will consult with the EEOC on all matters relating to 
the evaluation and determination of compliance by the common carrier 
licensees with the principles of equal employment as set forth herein.
    (5) Complaints indicating a general pattern of disregard of equal 
employment practices which are received against a licensee that is 
required to file an employment report to the FCC under Sec. 1.815(a) of 
this chapter are investigated by the FCC.
    (e) FCC records. A copy of every annual employment report, equal

Sec. 22.352  Protection from interference.

    Public Mobile Service stations operating in accordance with 
applicable FCC rules and the terms and conditions of their 
authorizations are normally considered to be non-interfering. If the FCC 
determines, however, that interference that significantly interrupts or 
degrades a radio service is being caused, it may, in accordance with the 
provisions of sections 303(f) and 316 of the Communications Act of 1934, 
as amended, (47 U.S.C. 303(f), 316), require modifications to any Public 
Mobile station as necessary to eliminate such interference.
    (a) Failure to operate as authorized. Any licensee causing 
interference to the service of other stations by failing to operate its 
station in full accordance with its authorization and applicable FCC 
rules shall discontinue all transmissions, except those necessary for 
the immediate safety of life or property, until it can bring its station 
into full compliance with the authorization and rules.
    (b) Intermodulation interference. Licensees should attempt to 
resolve such interference by technical means.
    (c) Situations in which no protection is afforded. Except as 
provided elsewhere in this part, no protection from interference is 
afforded in the following situations:
    (1) Interference to base receivers from base or fixed transmitters. 
Licensees should attempt to resolve such interference by technical means 
or operating arrangements.
    (2) Inteference to mobile receivers from mobile transmitters. No 
protection is provided against mobile-to-mobile interference.
    (3) Interference to base receivers from mobile transmitters. No 
protection is provided against mobile-to-base interference.
    (4) Interference to fixed stations. Licensees should attempt to 
resolve such interference by technical means or operating arrangements.
    (5) Anomalous or infrequent propagation modes. No protection is 
provided against interference caused by tropospheric and ionospheric 
propagation of signals.
    (6) Facilities for which the Commission is not notified. No 
protection is provided

[[Page 50]]

against interference to the service of any additional or modified 
transmitter operating pursuant to Sec. Sec. 1.929 or 22.165, unless and 
until the licensee modifies its authorization using FCC Form 601.
    (7) In-building radiation systems. No protection is provided against 
interference to the service of in-building radiation systems (see Sec. 
22.383).

Sec. 22.353  Blanketing interference.

    Licensees of Public Mobile Services stations are responsible for 
resolving cases of blanketing interference in accordance with the 
provisions of this section.
    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, licensees 
must resolve any cases of blanketing interference in their area of 
responsibility caused by operation of their transmitter(s) during a one-
year period following commencement of service from new or modified 
transmitter(s). Interference must be resolved promptly at no cost to the 
complainant.
    (b) The area of responsibility is that area in the immediate 
vicinity of the transmitting antenna of stations where the field 
strength of the electromagnetic radiation from such stations equals or 
exceeds 115 dB[micro]V/m. To determine the radial distance to the 
boundary of this area, the following formula must be used:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17NO94.007

where d is the radial distance to the boundary, in kilometers
p is the radial effective radiated power, in kilowatts


The maximum effective radiated power in the pertinent direction, without 
consideration of the antenna's vertical radiation pattern or height, 
must be used in the formula.
    (c) Licensees are not required to resolve blanketing interference to 
mobile receivers or non-RF devices or blanketing interference occurring 
as a result of malfunctioning or mistuned receivers, improperly 
installed consumer antenna systems, or the use of high gain antennas or 
antenna booster amplifiers by consumers.
    (d) Licensees that install transmitting antennas at a location where 
there are already one or more transmitting antennas are responsible for 
resolving any new cases of blanketing interference in accordance with 
this section.
    (e) Two or more licensees that concurrently install transmitting 
antennas at the same location are jointly responsible for resolving 
blanketing interference cases, unless the FCC can readily determine 
which station is causing the interference, in which case the licensee of 
that station is held fully responsible.
    (f) After the one year period of responsibility to resolve 
blanketing interference, licensees must provide upon request technical 
information to complainants on remedies for blanketing interference.


<R05>
Sec. 22.355  Frequency tolerance.

Sec. 22.357  Emission types.

    Any authorized station in the Public Mobile Services may transmit 
emissions of any type(s) that comply with the applicable emission rule, 
i.e. Sec. 22.359, Sec. 22.861 or Sec. 22.917.

[70 FR 19308, Apr. 13, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 22.359  Emission limitations.

    The rules in this section govern the spectral characteristics of 
emissions in the Public Mobile Services, except for the Air-Ground 
Radiotelephone Service (see Sec. 22.861, instead) and the Cellular

[[Page 51]]

Radiotelephone Service (see Sec. 22.917, instead).
    (a) Out of band emissions. The power of any emission outside of the 
authorized operating frequency ranges must be attenuated below the 
transmitting power (P) by a factor of at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB.
    (b) Measurement procedure. Compliance with these rules is based on 
the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth 
of 30 kHz or more. In the 60 kHz bands immediately outside and adjacent 
to the authorized frequency range or channel, a resolution bandwidth of 
at least one percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental 
emission of the transmitter may be employed. A narrower resolution 
bandwidth is permitted in all cases to improve measurement accuracy 
provided the measured power is integrated over the full required 
measurement bandwidth (i.e., 30 kHz or 1 percent of emission bandwidth, 
as specified). The emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the 
signal between two points, one below the carrier center frequency and 
one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which all emissions 
are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power.
    (c) Alternative out of band emission limit. Licensees in the Public 
Mobile Services may establish an alternative out of band emission limit 
to be used at specified frequencies (band edges) in specified 
geographical areas, in lieu of that set forth in this section, pursuant 
to a private contractual arrangement of all affected licensees and 
applicants. In this event, each party to such contract shall maintain a 
copy of the contract in their station files and disclose it to 
prospective assignees or transferees and, upon request, to the FCC.
    (d) Interference caused by out of band emissions. If any emission 
from a transmitter operating in any of the Public Mobile Services 
results in interference to users of another radio service, the FCC may 
require a greater attenuation of that emission than specified in this 
section.

Sec. 22.365  Antenna structures; air navigation safety.

    Licensees that own their antenna structures must not allow these 
antenna structures to become a hazard to air navigation. In general, 
antenna structure owners are responsible for registering antenna 
structures with the FCC if required by part 17 of this chapter, and for 
installing and maintaining any required marking and lighting. However, 
in the event of default of this responsibility by an antenna structure 
owner, each FCC permittee or licensee authorized to use an affected 
antenna structure will be held responsible by the FCC for ensuring that 
the antenna structure continues to meet the requirements of part 17 of 
this chapter. See Sec. 17.6 of this chapter.
    (a) Marking and lighting. Antenna structures must be marked, lighted 
and maintained in accordance with Part 17 of this chapter and all 
applicable rules and requirements of the Federal Aviation 
Administration.
    (b) Maintenance contracts. Antenna structure owners (or licensees 
and permittees, in the event of default by an antenna structure owner) 
may enter into contracts with other entities to monitor and carry out 
necessary maintenance of antenna structures. Antenna structure owners 
(or licensees and permittees, in the event of default by an antenna 
structure owner) that make such contractual arrangements continue to be 
responsible for the maintenance of antenna structures in regard to air 
navigation safety.

Sec. 22.371  Disturbance of AM broadcast station antenna patterns.

    Public Mobile Service licensees that construct or modify towers in 
the immediate vicinity of AM broadcast stations are responsible for 
measures necessary to correct disturbance of the AM station antenna 
pattern which causes operation outside of the radiation parameters 
specified by the FCC for the AM station, if the disturbance occurred as 
a result of such construction or modification.
    (a) Non-directional AM stations. If tower construction or 
modification is planned within 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) of

[[Page 52]]

a non-directional AM broadcast station tower, the Public Mobile Service 
licensee must notify the licensee of the AM broadcast station in advance 
of the planned construction or modification. Measurements must be made 
to determine whether the construction or modification affected the AM 
station antenna pattern. The Public Mobile Service licensee is 
responsible for the installation and continued maintenance of any 
detuning apparatus necessary to restore proper non-directional 
performance of the AM station tower.
    (b) Directional AM stations. If tower construction or modification 
is planned within 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) of a directional AM broadcast 
station array, the Public Mobile Service licensee must notify the 
licensee of the AM broadcast station in advance of the planned 
construction or modification. Measurements must be made to determine 
whether the construction or modification affected the AM station antenna 
pattern. The Public Mobile Service licensee is responsible for the 
installation and continued maintenance of any detuning apparatus 
necessary to restore proper performance of the AM station array.

Sec. 22.377  Certification of transmitters.

    Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, transmitters 
used in the Public Mobile Services, including those used with signal 
boosters, in-building radiation systems and cellular repeaters, must be 
certificated for use in the radio services regulated under this part. 
Transmitters must be certificated when the station is ready for service, 
not necessarily at the time of filing an application.
    (a) The FCC may list as certificated only transmitters that are 
capable of meeting all technical requirements of the rules governing the 
service in which they will operate. The procedure for obtaining 
certification is set forth in part 2 of this chapter.
    (b) Transmitters operating under a developmental authorization (see 
subpart D of this part) do not have to be certificated.

                 Subpart D_Developmental Authorizations


<R05>
Sec. 22.401  Description and purposes of developmental authorizations.

    Eligible entities (see Sec. 22.7) may apply for, and the FCC may 
grant, authority to construct and operate one or more transmitters 
subject to the rules in this subpart and other limitations, waivers and/
or conditions that may be prescribed. Authorizations granted on this 
basis are developmental authorizations. In general, the FCC grants 
developmental authorizations in situations and circumstances where it 
cannot reasonably be determined in advance whether a particular 
transmitter can be operated or a particular service can be provided 
without causing interference to the service of existing stations. For 
example, the FCC may grant developmental authorizations for:
    (a) Field strength surveys to evaluate the technical suitability of 
antenna locations for stations in the Public Mobile Services;
    (b) Experimentation leading to the potential development of a new 
Public Mobile Service or technology; or,
    (c) Stations transmitting on channels in certain frequency ranges, 
to provide a trial period during which it can be individually determined 
whether such stations can operate without causing excessive interference 
to existing services.

<R05>
Sec. 22.403  General limitations.

    The provisions and requirements of this section are applicable to 
all developmental authorizations.
    (a) Developmental authorizations are granted subject to the 
condition that they may be cancelled by the FCC at any time, upon notice 
to the licensee,

[[Page 53]]

and without the opportunity for a hearing.
    (b) Except as otherwise indicated in this subpart, developmental 
authorizations normally terminate one year from the date of grant. The 
FCC may, however, specify a different term.
    (c) Stations operating under developmental authorizations must not 
interfere with the services of regularly authorized stations.
    (d) A grant of a developmental authorization does not provide any 
assurance that the FCC will grant an application for regular 
authorization to operate the same transmitter(s), even if operation 
during the developmental period has not caused interference and/or the 
developmental program is successful.


<R05>
Sec. 22.409  Developmental authorization for a new Public Mobile Service or technology.

    The FCC may grant applications for developmental authority to 
construct and operate transmitters for the purpose of developing a new 
Public Mobile Service or a new technology not regularly authorized under 
this part, subject to the requirements of this section. Such 
applications may request the use of any portion of the spectrum 
allocated for Public Mobile Services in the Table of Frequency 
Allocations contained in part 2 of this chapter, regardless of whether 
that spectrum is regularly available under this part. Requests to use 
any portion of the spectrum for a service or purpose other than that 
indicated in the Table of Frequency Allocations in part 2 of this 
chapter may be made only in accordance with the provisions of part 5 of 
this chapter.
    (a) Preliminary determination. The FCC will make a preliminary 
determination with respect to the factors in paragraphs (a)(1) through 
(a)(3) of this section before acting on an application for developmental 
authority pursuant to this section. These factors are:
    (1) That the public interest, convenience or necessity warrants 
consideration of the establishment of the proposed service or 
technology;
    (2) That the proposal appears to have potential value to the public 
that could warrant the establishment of the new service or technology;
    (3) That some operational data should be developed for consideration 
in any rule making proceeding which may be initiated to establish such 
service or technology.
    (b) Petition required. Applications for developmental authorizations 
pursuant to this section must be accompanied by a petition for rule 
making requesting the FCC to amend its rules as may be necessary to 
provide for the establishment of the proposed service or technology.
    (c) Application requirements. Authorizations for developmental 
authority pursuant to this section will be issued only upon a showing 
that the applicant has a definite program of research and development 
which has reasonable promise of substantial contribution to the services 
authorized by this part. The application must contain an exhibit 
demonstrating the applicant's technical qualifications to conduct the 
research and development program, including a description of the nature 
and extent of engineering facilities that the applicant has available 
for such purpose. Additionally, the FCC may, in its discretion, require 
a showing of financial qualification.
    (d) Communication service for hire prohibited. Stations authorized 
under developmental authorizations granted pursuant to this section must 
not be used to provide communication service for hire, unless otherwise 
specifically authorized by the FCC.
    (e) Adherence to program. Carriers granted developmental 
authorization pursuant to this section must substantially adhere to the 
program of research and development described in their application for 
developmental authorization, unless the FCC directs otherwise.
    (f) Report requirements. Upon completion of the program of research 
and development, or upon the expiration of the developmental 
authorization under which such program was permitted, or at such times 
during the term of the station authorization as the FCC may deem 
necessary to evaluate the progress of the developmental program, the 
licensee shall submit a comprehensive report, containing:

[[Page 54]]

    (1) A description of the progress of the program and a detailed 
analysis of any result obtained;
    (2) Copies of any publications produced by the program;
    (3) A listing of any patents applied for, including copies of any 
patents issued;
    (4) Copies of any marketing surveys or other measures of potential 
public demand for the new service;
    (5) A description of the carrier's experiences with operational 
aspects of the program including--
    (i) The duration of transmissions on each channel or frequency range 
and the technical parameters of such transmissions; and,
    (ii) Any interference complaints received as a result of operation 
and how these complaints were investigated and resolved.
    (g) Confidentiality. Normally, applications and developmental 
reports are a part of the FCC's public records. However, an applicant or 
licensee may request that the FCC withhold from public records specific 
exhibits, reports and other material associated with a developmental 
authorization.
    (h) Renewal. Expiring developmental authorizations issued pursuant 
to this section may be renewed if the carrier--
    (1) Shows that further progress in the program of research and 
development requires additional time to operate under developmental 
authorization;
    (2) Complied with the reporting requirements of paragraph (f) of 
this section; and,
    (3) Immediately resolved to the FCC's satisfaction all complaints of 
interference caused by the station operating under developmental 
authority.

Sec. 22.413  Developmental authorization of 72-76 MHz fixed transmitters.

    Because of the potential for interference with the reception by 
broadcast television sets and video recorders of full service TV 
stations transmitting on TV Channels 4 and 5, 72-76 MHz channels are 
assigned for use within 16 kilometers (10 miles) of the antenna of any 
full service TV station transmitting on TV Channel 4 or 5 only under 
developmental authorizations subject to the requirements of this 
section, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (a) Carrier responsibility. Carriers so authorized shall operate the 
72-76 MHz fixed station under developmental authority for a period of at 
least six months. During the developmental period, carriers must resolve 
any broadcast television receiver interference problems that may occur 
as a result of operation of the 72-76 MHz transmitter(s).
    (b) Exceptions. The FCC may grant a regular authorization in the 
Paging and Radiotelephone Service for a 72-76 MHz fixed station under 
the following circumstances:
    (1) After six months of operation under developmental authorization, 
and provided that broadcast TV interference complaints have been 
resolved by the carrier in a satisfactory manner. Licensees that hold a 
developmental authorization for a 72-76 MHz fixed station and wish to 
request a regular authorization must file an application using FCC Form 
601 via the ULS prior to the expiration of the developmental 
authorization.
    (2) In the case of the assignment of or a transfer of control of a 
regular authorization of a 72-76 MHz fixed station in the Paging and 
Radiotelephone Service, the FCC may grant such assignment or consent to 
such transfer of control provided that the station has been in 
continuous operation providing service with no substantial 
interruptions.
    (3) If a proposed 72-76 MHz fixed transmitter antenna is to be 
located within 50 meters (164 feet) of the antenna of the full service 
TV station transmitting on TV Channel 4 or 5, the FCC may grant a 
regular authorization instead of a developmental authorization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Availability. The FCC may determine whether to issue a paging 
geographic area authorization for any specific channel or channel pair 
in any specific paging geographic area. The FCC may replace existing 
site specific authorizations for facilities on a channel or channel pair 
located in a paging geographic area with a paging geographic area 
authorization for that channel or channel pair, if in its sole 
discretion, the FCC determines that

[[Page 56]]

the public interest would be served by such replacement.
    (d) Filing windows. The FCC accepts applications for paging 
geographic area authorizations only during filing windows. The FCC 
issues Public Notices announcing in advance the dates of the filing 
windows, and the specific paging geographic areas and channels for which 
applications may be accepted.
    (e) One grant per geographic area. The FCC may grant one and only 
one application for a paging geographic area authorization for any 
specific channel or channel pair in any specific paging geographic area 
defined in paragraph (b) of this section. Selection from among mutually 
exclusive applications for a paging geographic area authorization will 
be made in accordance with the procedures in Sec. Sec. 22.131 and 
22.200 through 22.299. If after the selection process but prior to 
filing a ``long form'' application, a successful bidder decides to 
partition the paging geographic area, the FCC may require and accept 
multiple ``long form'' applications from the consortium members.
    (f) Exclusive right to expand. During the term of a paging 
geographic area authorization, the FCC does not accept, from anyone 
other than the paging geographic area licensee, any major application 
for authorization to operate a facility that would serve unserved area 
within the paging geographic area specified in that paging geographic 
area authorization, on the channel specified in that paging geographic 
area authorization, unless any extension of the interfering contour of 
the proposed facility falls:
    (1) Within the composite interfering contour of another licensee; 
or,
    (2) Into unserved area and the paging geographic area licensee 
consents to such extension.
    (g) Subsequent applications not accepted. During the term of a 
paging geographic area authorization, the FCC does not accept any 
application for authorization relating to a facility that is or would be 
located within the paging geographic area specified in that paging 
geographic area authorization, on the channel specified in that paging 
geographic area authorization, except in the following situations:
    (1) FCC grant of an application authorizing the construction of the 
facility could have a significant environmental effect as defined by 
Sec. 1.1307 of this chapter. See Sec. 22.115(a)(5).
    (2) Specific international coordination procedures are required, 
prior to assignment of a channel to the facility, pursuant to a treaty 
or other agreement between the United States government and the 
government of Canada or Mexico. See Sec. 22.169.
    (3) The paging geographic area licensee or another licensee of a 
system within the paging geographic area applies to assign its 
authorization or for FCC consent to a transfer of control.
    (h) Adjacent geographic area coordination required. Before 
constructing a facility for which the interfering contour (as defined in 
Sec. 22.537 or Sec. 22.567 of this part, as appropriate for the 
channel involved) would extend into another paging geographic area, a 
paging geographic area licensee must obtain the consent of the relevant 
co-channel paging geographic area licensee, if any, into whose area the 
interfering contour would extend. Licensees are expected to cooperate 
fully and in good faith attempt to resolve potential interference 
problems before bringing matters to the FCC. In the event that there is 
no co-channel paging geographic area licensee from whom to obtain 
consent in the area into which the interfering contour would extend, the 
facility may be constructed and operated subject to the condition that, 
at such time as the FCC issues a paging geographic area authorization 
for that adjacent geographic area, either consent must be obtained or 
the facility modified or eliminated such that the interfering contour no 
longer extends into the adjacent geographic area.
    (i) Protection of existing service. All facilities constructed and 
operated pursuant to a paging geographic area authorization must provide 
co-channel interference protection in accordance with Sec. 22.537 or 
Sec. 22.567, as appropriate for the channel involved, to all authorized 
co-channel facilities of exclusive licensees within the paging 
geographic area. Non-exclusive licensees on the thirty-five exclusive 
929 MHz channels are not entitled to exclusive status, and will continue 
to operate under the

[[Page 57]]

sharing arrangements established with the exclusive licensees and other 
non-exclusive licensees that were in effect prior to February 19, 1997. 
MEA, EA, and nationwide geographic area licensees have the right to 
share with non-exclusive licensees on the thirty-five exclusive 929 MHz 
channels on a non-interfering basis.
    (j) Site location restriction. The transmitting antenna of each 
facility constructed and operated pursuant to a paging geographic area 
authorization must be located within the paging geographic area 
specified in the authorization.
    (k) Coverage requirements. Failure by an MEA or EA licensee to meet 
either the coverage requirements in paragraphs (k)(1) and (k)(2) of this 
section, or alternatively, the substantial service requirement in 
paragraph (k)(3) of this section, will result in automatic termination 
of authorizations for those facilities that were not authorized, 
constructed, and operating at the time the geographic area authorization 
was granted. MEA and EA licensees have the burden of showing when their 
facilities were authorized, constructed, and operating, and should 
retain necessary records of these sites until coverage requirements are 
fulfilled. For the purpose of this paragraph, to ``cover'' area means to 
include geographic area within the composite of the service contour(s) 
determined by the methods of Sec. Sec. 22.537 or 22.567 as appropriate 
for the particular channel involved. Licensees may determine the 
population of geographic areas included within their service contours 
using either the 1990 census or the 2000 census, but not both.
    (1) No later than three years after the initial grant of an MEA or 
EA geographic area authorization, the licensee must construct or 
otherwise acquire and operate sufficient facilities to cover one third 
of the population in the paging geographic area. The licensee must 
notify the FCC at the end of the three-year period pursuant to Sec. 
1.946 of this chapter, either that it has satisfied this requirement or 
that it plans to satisfy the alternative requirement to provide 
substantial service in accordance with paragraph (k)(3) of this section.
    (2) No later than five years after the initial grant of an MEA or EA 
geographic area authorization, the licensee must construct or otherwise 
acquire and operate sufficient facilities to cover two thirds of the 
population in the paging geographic area. The licensee must notify the 
FCC at the end of the five year period pursuant to Sec. 1.946 of this 
chapter, either that it has satisfied this requirement or that it has 
satisfied the alternative requirement to provide substantial service in 
accordance with paragraph (k)(3) of this section.
    (3) As an alternative to the coverage requirements of paragraphs 
(k)(1) and (k)(2) of this section, the paging geographic area licensee 
may demonstrate that, no later than five years after the initial grant 
of its paging geographic area authorization, it provides substantial 
service to the paging geographic area. ``Substantial service'' means 
service that is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of 
mediocre service that would barely warrant renewal.

<R05>
Sec. 22.507  Number of transmitters per station.

    This section concerns the number of transmitters licensed under each 
station authorization in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service, other 
than paging geographic area authorizations.
    (a) Operationally related transmitters. Each station must have at 
least one transmitter. There is no limit to the number of transmitters 
that a station may comprise. However, transmitters within a station 
should be operationally related and/or should serve the same general 
geographical area. Operationally related transmitters are those that 
operate together as a system (e.g., trunked systems, simulcast systems), 
rather than independently.
    (b) Split of large systems. The FCC may split wide-area systems into 
two or more stations for administrative convenience. Except for 
nationwide paging and other operationally related transmitters, 
transmitters that are widely separated geographically are not licensed 
under a single authorization.

[[Page 58]]

    (c) Consolidation of separate stations. The FCC may consolidate 
site-specific contiguous authorizations upon request (FCC Form 601) of 
the licensee, if appropriate under paragraph (a) of this section. Paging 
licensees may include remote, stand-alone transmitters under the single 
system-wide authorization, if the remote, stand-alone transmitter is 
linked to the system via a control/repeater facility or by satellite. 
Including a remote, stand-alone transmitter in a system-wide 
authorization does not alter the limitations provided under Sec. 
22.503(f) on entities other than the paging geographic area licensee. In 
the alternative, paging licensees may maintain separate site-specific 
authorizations for stand-alone or remote transmitters. The earliest 
expiration date of the authorizations that make up the single system-
wide authorization will determine the expiration date for the system-
wide authorization. Licensees must file timely renewal applications for 
site-specific authorizations included in a single system-wide 
authorization request until the request is approved. Renewal of the 
system-wide authorization will be subject to Sec. 1.949 of this 
chapter.
    (d) Replacement of site-by-site authorizations with single 
authorization. After a paging geographic area authorization for a 
channel has been issued, the FCC may, on its own motion, replace the 
authorization(s) of any other licensee (for facilities located within 
that paging geographic area on that channel) with a single replacement 
authorization.

Sec. 22.509  Procedures for mutually exclusive applications in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service.

    Mutually exclusive applications in the Paging and Radiotelephone 
Service, including those that are mutually exclusive with applications 
in the Rural Radiotelephone Service, are processed in accordance with 
Sec. 22.131 and with this section.
    (a) Applications in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service may be 
mutually exclusive with applications in the Rural Radiotelephone Service 
if they seek authorization to operate facilities on the same channel in 
the same area, or the technical proposals are otherwise in conflict. See 
Sec. 22.567.
    (b) A modification application in either service filed on the 
earliest filing date may cause all later-filed mutually exclusive 
applications of any type in either service to be ``cut off'' (excluded 
from a same-day filing group) and dismissed, pursuant to Sec. 
22.131(c)(3)(ii) and Sec. 22.131(c)(4).

Sec. 22.513  Partitioning and disaggregation.

    MEA and EA licensees may apply to partition their authorized 
geographic service area or disaggregate their authorized spectrum at any 
time following grant of their geographic area authorizations. Nationwide 
geographic area licensees may apply to partition their authorized 
geographic service area or disaggregate their authorized spectrum at any 
time as of August 23, 1999.
    (a) Application required. Parties seeking approval for partitioning 
and/or disaggregation shall apply for partial assignment of a license 
pursuant to Sec. 1.948 of this chapter.
    (b) Partitioning. In the case of partitioning, requests for 
authorization for partial assignment of a license must include, as 
attachments, a description of the partitioned service area and a 
calculation of the population of the partitioned service area and the 
authorized geographic service area. The partitioned service area shall 
be defined by 120 sets of geographic coordinates at points at every 3 
degrees azimuth from a point within the partitioned service area along 
the partitioned service area boundary unless either an FCC-recognized 
service area is used (e.g., MEA or EA) or county lines are followed. The 
geographical coordinates must be specified in degrees, minutes, and 
seconds to the nearest

[[Page 59]]

second latitude and longitude, and must be based upon the 1983 North 
American Datum (NAD83). In the case where FCC-recognized service areas 
or county lines are used, applicants need only list the specific area(s) 
through use of FCC designations or county names that constitute the 
partitioned area.
    (c) Disaggregation. Spectrum may be disaggregated in any amount.
    (d) Combined partitioning and disaggregation. Licensees may apply 
for partial assignment of authorizations that propose combinations of 
partitioning and disaggregation.
    (e) License term. The license term for a partitioned license area 
and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original 
licensee's license term as provided for in Sec. 1.955 of this chapter.
    (f) Coverage requirements for partitioning. (1) Parties to a 
partitioning agreement must satisfy at least one of the following 
requirements:
    (i) The partitionee must satisfy the applicable coverage 
requirements set forth in Sec. 22.503(k)(1), (2) and (3) for the 
partitioned license area; or
    (ii) The original licensee must meet the coverage requirements set 
forth in Sec. 22.503(k)(1), (2) and (3) for the entire geographic area. 
In this case, the partitionee must meet only the requirements for 
renewal of its authorization for the partitioned license area.
    (2) Parties seeking authority to partition must submit with their 
partial assignment application a certification signed by both parties 
stating which of the above options they select.
    (3) Partitionees must submit supporting documents showing compliance 
with their coverage requirements as set forth in Sec. 22.503(k)(1), (2) 
and (3).
    (4) Failure by any partitionee to meet its coverage requirements 
will result in automatic cancellation of the partitioned authorization 
without further Commission action.
    (g) Coverage requirements for disaggregation. (1) Parties to a 
disaggregation agreement must satisfy at least one of the following 
requirements:
    (i) Either the disaggregator or disaggregatee must satisfy the 
coverage requirements set forth in Sec. 22.503 (k)(1), (2) and (3) for 
the entire license area; or
    (ii) Parties must agree to share responsibility for meeting the 
coverage requirements set forth in Sec. 22.503 (k)(1), (2) and (3) for 
the entire license area.
    (2) Parties seeking authority to disaggregate must submit with their 
partial assignment application a certification signed by both parties 
stating which of the above requirements they meet.
    (3) Disaggregatees must submit supporting documents showing 
compliance with their coverage requirements as set forth in Sec. 22.503 
(k)(1), (2) and (3).
    (4) Parties that accept responsibility for meeting the coverage 
requirements and later fail to do so will be subject to automatic 
license cancellation without further Commission action.

Sec. 22.515  Permissible communications paths.

    Mobile stations may communicate only with and through base stations. 
Base stations may communicate only with mobile stations and receivers on 
land or surface vessels.


<R05>
Sec. 22.527  Signal boosters.

    Licensees may install and operate signal boosters on channels listed 
in Sec. 22.531 only in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 22.165 
governing additional transmitters for existing systems. Licensees must 
not allow any signal booster that they operate to cause interference to 
the service or operation of any other authorized stations or systems.

Sec. 22.535  Effective radiated power limits.

    The effective radiated power (ERP) of transmitters operating on the 
channels listed in Sec. 22.531 must not exceed the limits in this 
section.
    (a) Maximum ERP. The ERP must not exceed the applicable limits in 
this paragraph under any circumstances.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Basic power limit. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the ERP of transmitters on the VHF channels must not exceed 500 
Watts.
    (c) Height-power limit. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the ERP of transmitters on the VHF

[[Page 62]]

channels must not exceed the amount that would result in an average 
distance to the service contour of 32.2 kilometers (20 miles). The 
average distance to the service contour is calculated by taking the 
arithmetic mean of the distances determined using the procedures 
specified in Sec. 22.537 for the eight cardinal radial directions, 
excluding cardinal radial directions for which 90% or more of the 
distance so calculated is over water.
    (d) Encompassed interfering contour areas. Transmitters are exempt 
from the basic power and height-power limits of this section if the area 
within their interfering contours is totally encompassed by the 
interfering contours of operating co-channel base transmitters 
controlled by the same licensee. For the purpose of this paragraph, 
operating transmitters are authorized transmitters that are providing 
service to subscribers.
    (e) Adjacent channel protection. The ERP of transmitters must not 
exceed 500 Watts if they:
    (1) Transmit on a channel in the 152-159 MHz frequency range and are 
located less than 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) from any station licensed in 
the Private Radio Services that receives on an adjacent channel; or,
    (2) Transmit on channel 158.10 or 158.70 MHz and are located less 
than 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) from any station licensed in the Public 
Mobile Services that receives on either of the following adjacent 
channels: 158.07 MHz or 158.67 MHz.
    (f) Signal boosters. The effective radiated power of signal boosters 
must not exceed 5 watts ERP under any normal operating condition.

Sec. 22.537  Technical channel assignment criteria.

    The rules in this section establish technical assignment criteria 
for the channels listed in Sec. 22.531. These criteria permit channel 
assignments to be made in a manner such that reception by public paging 
receivers of signals from base transmitters, within the service area of 
such base transmitters, is protected from interference caused by the 
operation of independent co-channel base transmitters.
    (a) Contour overlap. The FCC may grant an application requesting 
assignment of a channel to a proposed base transmitter only if:
    (1) The interfering contour of the proposed transmitter does not 
overlap the service contour of any protected co-channel transmitter 
controlled by a carrier other than the applicant, unless that carrier 
has agreed in writing to accept any interference that may result from 
operation of the proposed transmitter; and,
    (2) The service contour of the proposed transmitter does not overlap 
the interfering contour of any protected co-channel transmitter 
controlled by a carrier other than the applicant, unless the applicant 
agrees to accept any interference that may result from operation of the 
protected co-channel transmitter; and,
    (3) The area and/or population to which service would be provided by 
the proposed transmitter is substantial, and service gained would exceed 
that lost as a result of agreements to accept interference.
    (b) Protected transmitter. For the purposes of this section, 
protected transmitters are authorized transmitters for which there is a 
current FCC public record and transmitters proposed in prior-filed 
pending applications.
    (c) VHF service contour. For paging stations transmitting on the VHF 
channels, the distance from the transmitting antenna to the service 
contour along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows:

d=1.243xh\0.40\xp\0.20\

where d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    (1) Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 
must be used as the value for h in the above formula.
    (2) The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than 
27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction or 0.1 Watt, whichever 
is more.
    (3) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the service 
contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is 
routinely calculated

[[Page 63]]

by linear interpolation of distance as a function of angle. However, in 
resolving petitions to deny, the FCC may calculate the distance to the 
service contour using the formula in paragraph (c) of this section with 
actual HAAT and ERP data for the inter-station radial and additional 
radials above and below the inter-station radial at 2.5[deg] intervals.
    (d) VHF interfering contour. For paging stations transmitting on the 
VHF channels, the distance from the transmitting antenna to the 
interfering contour along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows:

d=6.509xh\0.28\xp\0.17\

where d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    (1) Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 
must be used as the value for h in the above formula.
    (2) The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than 
27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction or 0.1 Watt, whichever 
is more.
    (3) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the interfering 
contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is 
routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function 
of angle. In resolving petitions to deny, however, the FCC may calculate 
the distance to the interfering contour using the formula in paragraph 
(d) of this section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the inter-station 
radial and additional radials above and below the inter-station radial 
at 2.5[deg] intervals.
    (e) 931 MHz service contour. For paging stations transmitting on the 
931 MHz channels, the service contour is a circle, centered on the 
transmitting antenna, with a radius determined from Table E-1 of this 
section.

Sec. 22.559  Paging application requirements.

    In addition to information required by subparts B and D and Sec. 
22.529, applications for authorization to operate a paging transmitter 
on the channels listed in Sec. 22.531, other than applications for a 
paging geographic area authorization, must contain the applicable 
supplementary information described in this section.
    (a) Interference exhibit. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section, an exhibit demonstrating compliance with Sec. 22.537 with 
regard to protected transmitters is required for applications to operate 
a transmitter on the VHF channels. This exhibit must:
    (1) Identify each protected transmitter located within 109 
kilometers (68 miles) of the proposed transmitter in directions in which 
the distance to the interfering contour is 76.5 kilometers (47.5 miles) 
or less, and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) of the proposed 
transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering 
contour exceeds 76.5 kilometers (47.5 miles).
    (2) For each protected transmitter identified, show the results of 
distance calculations indicating that there would be no overlap of 
service and interfering contours, or alternatively, indicate that the 
licensee of or applicant for the protected transmitter and/or the 
applicant, as required, have agreed in writing to accept any 
interference resulting from operation of the proposed transmitter.
    (b) Encompassment exhibit. An exhibit showing that the area within 
the interfering contour of the proposed transmitter would be totally 
encompassed by interfering contours of operating co-channel base 
transmitters controlled by the applicant is required for applications to 
operate a transmitter with ERP exceeding the basic power and height-
power limits of Sec. 22.535. For VHF transmitters, this encompassment 
exhibit may substitute for the interference exhibit required in 
paragraph (a) of this section.

exempt from the basic power and height-power limits of this section if 
the area within their interfering contours is totally encompassed by the 
interfering contours of operating co-channel based transmitters 
controlled by the same licensee. For the purpose of this paragraph, 
operating transmitters are authorized transmitters that are providing 
service to subscribers.
    (e) Adjacent channel protection. The ERP of base and fixed 
transmitters must not exceed 500 Watts if they transmit on channel 
454.025 MHz and are located less than 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) from any 
Private Radio Services station receiving on adjacent channel 454.0000 
MHz.
    (f) Mobile transmitters. The transmitter output power of mobile 
transmitters must not exceed 60 watts.

Sec. 22.567  Technical channel assignment criteria.

    The rules in this section establish technical assignment criteria 
for the channels listed in Sec. 22.561. The criteria in paragraphs (a) 
through (f) of this section permit channel assignments to be made in a 
manner such that reception by public mobile receivers of signals from 
base transmitters, within the service area of such base transmitters, is 
protected from interference caused by the operation of independent co-
channel base and fixed transmitters in the Paging and Radiotelephone 
Service

[[Page 66]]

and central office stations, including Basic Exchange Telephone Radio 
Systems (BETRS), in the Rural Radiotelephone Service. Additional 
criteria in paragraph (g) of this section permit channel assignments to 
be made in a manner such that BETRS communications are protected from 
interference caused by the operation of independent co-channel base and 
fixed transmitters in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service and other 
central office stations in the Rural Radiotelephone Service. Separate 
criteria in paragraph (h) of this section apply only to assignment of 
the channels designated in Sec. 22.561 as mobile channels to base and 
fixed transmitters, and permit these channel assignments to be made in a 
manner such that reception by public base and fixed receivers of signals 
from associated mobile and fixed transmitters is protected from 
interference caused by the operation of independent co-channel base and 
fixed transmitters.
    (a) Contour overlap. The FCC may grant an application requesting 
assignment of a channel to a proposed base, fixed or central office 
station transmitter only if:
    (1) The interfering contour of the proposed transmitter does not 
overlap the service contour of any protected co-channel transmitter 
controlled by a carrier other than the applicant, unless that carrier 
has agreed in writing to accept any interference that may result from 
operation of the proposed transmitter; and
    (2) The service contour of the proposed transmitter does not overlap 
the interfering contour of any protected co-channel transmitter 
controlled by a carrier other than the applicant, unless the application 
contains a statement that the applicant agrees to accept any 
interference that may result from operation of the protected co-channel 
transmitter; and
    (3) The area and/or population to which service would be provided by 
the proposed transmitter is substantial, and service gained would exceed 
that lost as a result of agreements to accept interference.
    (b) Protected transmitter. For the purposes of this section, 
protected transmitters are authorized transmitters for which there is a 
current FCC public record and transmitters proposed in prior-filed 
pending applications, in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service and the 
Rural Radiotelephone Service.
    (c) VHF service contour. For base stations transmitting on the VHF 
channels, the radial distance from the transmitting antenna to the 
service contour along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows:

d=1.609xh\0.40\xp\0.20\

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    (1) Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 
must be used as the value for h in the above formula.
    (2) The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than 
27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction, or 0.1 Watt, whichever 
is more.
    (3) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the service 
contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is 
routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function 
of angle. However, in resolving petitions to deny, the FCC may calculate 
the distance to the service contour using the formula in paragraph (c) 
of this section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the inter-station 
radial and additional radials above and below the inter-station radial 
at 2.5[deg] intervals.
    (d) VHF interfering contour. For base and fixed stations 
transmitting on the VHF channels, the radial distance from the 
transmitting antenna to the interfering contour along each cardinal 
radial is calculated as follows:
    (1) If the radial antenna HAAT is less than 150 meters:

d=8.577xh\0.24\xp\0.19\

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 must 
be used as the value for h in the above formula.
    (2) If the radial antenna HAAT is 150 meters or more:

d=12.306xh\0.23\xp\0.14\


[[Page 67]]


where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    (3) The value used for p in the above formulas must not be less than 
27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction, or 0.1 Watt, whichever 
is more.
    (4) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the interfering 
contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is 
routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function 
of angle. However, in resolving petitions to deny, the FCC may calculate 
the distance to the interfering contour using the appropriate formula in 
paragraph (d) of this section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the 
inter-station radial and additional radials above and below the inter-
station radial at 2.5[deg] intervals.
    (e) UHF service contour. For base stations transmitting on the UHF 
channels, the radial distance from the transmitting antenna to the 
service contour along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows:

d=1.726xh\0.35\xp\0.18\

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    (1) Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 
must be used as the value for h in the above formula.
    (2) The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than 
27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction, or 0.1 Watt, whichever 
is more.
    (3) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the service 
contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is 
routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function 
of angle. However, in resolving petitions to deny, the FCC may calculate 
the distance to the service contour using the formula in paragraph (e) 
of this section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the inter-station 
radial and addition radials above and below the below the inter-station 
radial at 2.5[deg] intervals.
    (f) UHF interfering contour. For base and fixed stations 
transmitting on the UHF channels, the radial distance from the 
transmitting antenna to the interfering contour along each cardinal 
radial is calculated as follows:
    (1) If the radial antenna HAAT is less than 150 meters:

d=9.471xh\0.23\xp\0.15\

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 must 
be used as the value for h in the above formula.
    (2) If the radial antenna HAAT is 150 meters or more:

d=6.336xh\0.31\xp\0.15\

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    (3) The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than 
27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction, or 0.1 Watt, whichever 
is more.
    (4) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the interfering 
contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is 
routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function 
of angle. However, in resolving petitions to deny, the FCC may calculate 
the distance to the interfering contour using the appropriate formula in 
paragraph (f) of this section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the 
inter-station radial and additional radials above and below the inter-
station radial at 2.5[deg] intervals.
    (g) Protection for BETRS. In applying the provisions of paragraph 
(a) of this section, if either or both of the transmitters involved is a 
BETRS central office station, the following contour substitutions must 
be used:
    (1) The service contour of the BETRS central office station(s) is a 
circle, centered on the central office station antenna, with a radius of 
40 kilometers (25 miles).
    (2) The interfering contour of any station of any type, when 
determining whether it would overlap the service contour of a BETRS 
central office station, is calculated as follows:

d=36.364xh\0.2\x p\0.1\


[[Page 68]]


where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 must 
be used as the value for h in the above formula. The value used for p in 
the above formula must not be less than 27 dB less than the maximum ERP 
in any direction, or 0.1 Watt, whichever is more.
    (h) Assignment of mobile channels to base or fixed transmitters. 
Mobile channels may be assigned to base or fixed transmitters if the 
following criteria are met:
    (1) The paired base channel, as designated in Sec. 22.561, is 
assigned to base transmitters in the same geographical area operated by 
the same licensee.
    (2) The authorization is granted subject to the condition that no 
interference be caused to fixed receivers in use on or prior to the date 
of the grant.


<R05>
Sec. 22.571  Responsibility for mobile stations.

    Mobile stations that are subscribers in good standing to a two-way 
service in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service, when receiving service 
from that station, are considered to be operating under the 
authorization of that station. Licensees are responsible for exercising 
effective operational control over mobile stations receiving service 
through their stations. Mobile stations that are subscribers in good 
standing to a two-way service in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service, 
while receiving service from a different station, are considered to be 
operating under the authorization of such different station. The 
licensee of such different station is responsible, during such temporary 
period, for exercising effective operational control over such mobile 
stations as if they were subscribers to it.


<R05>
Sec. 22.573  Use of base transmitters as repeaters.

    As an additional function, base transmitters may be used as 
repeaters. Licensees must be able to turn the base transmitter on or off 
from the control point regardless of whether a subscriber-operated 
transmitter is transmitting.


<R05>
Sec. 22.575  Use of mobile channel for remote control of station functions.

    Carriers may remotely control station functions (e.g. shut down or 
reactivate base transmitters, turn aviation obstruction warning lights 
on or off, etc.) using a control transmitter operating on a mobile 
channel, subject to the conditions in this section and in Sec. 
22.567(h).
    (a) The control transmitter must be capable of overriding 
transmissions from subscriber-operated transmitters if necessary. 
Subscriber-operated transmitters must not be capable of being used to 
deliberately or accidentally prevent the licensee from controlling the 
station.
    (b) The licensee must implement measures designed to prevent station 
functions from being controlled by persons not authorized by the 
licensee to control the station.
    (c) The control transmitter location must be within the composite 
service contour of the licensee's authorized station on the paired base 
channel.


<R05>
Sec. 22.579  Operation of mobile transmitters across U.S.-Canada border.

    Mobile stations licensed by Canada may receive two-way service while 
in the United States from stations licensed under this part, after 
authorization has been granted by the FCC. Mobile stations that normally 
operate under the authority of base stations licensed under this part 
may receive two-way service while in Canada from stations licensed under 
this part or by Canada, upon authorization by Canada.


<R05>
Sec. 22.589  One-way or two-way application requirements.

    In addition to information required by subparts B and D and Sec. 
22.529, applications for authorization to operate a paging transmitter 
on the channels listed in Sec. 22.531, other than applications for a 
paging geographic area authorization, must contain the applicable 
supplementary information described in this section.
    (a) Interference exhibit. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section, an exhibit demonstrating compliance with Sec. 22.567 with 
regard to protected transmitters is required. This exhibit must:

[[Page 69]]

    (1) For UHF channels, identify each protected transmitter located 
within 108 kilometers (67 miles) of the proposed transmitter in 
directions in which the distance to the interfering contour is 76.4 
kilometers (47.5 miles) or less, and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) 
of the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the 
interfering contour exceeds 76.4 kilometers (47.5 miles); and identify 
each protected Basic Exchange Telephone Radio System central office 
transmitter in the Rural Radiotelephone Service within 231 kilometers 
(144 miles),
    (2) For VHF channels, identify each protected transmitter located 
within 135 kilometers (84 miles) of the proposed transmitter in 
directions in which the distance to the interfering contour is 93.3 
kilometers (58 miles) or less, and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) of 
the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the 
interfering contour exceeds 93.3 kilometers (58 miles).
    (3) For each protected transmitter identified, show the results of 
distance calculations indicating that there would be no overlap of 
service and interfering contours, or alternatively, indicate that the 
licensee of or applicant for the protected transmitter and/or the 
applicant, as required, have agreed in writing to accept any 
interference resulting from operation of the proposed transmitter.
    (b) Encompassment exhibit. An exhibit showing that the area within 
the interfering contour of the proposed transmitter would be totally 
encompassed by interfering contours of operating co-channel base 
transmitters controlled by the applicant is required for applications to 
operate a transmitter with ERP exceeding the basic power and height-
power limits of Sec. 22.565. This encompassment exhibit may substitute 
for the interference exhibit required in paragraph (a) of this section.

Sec. 22.593  Effective radiated power limits.

    The effective radiated power of fixed stations operating on the 
channels listed in Sec. 22.591 must not exceed 150 Watts. The 
equivalent isotropically radiated power of existing fixed microwave 
stations (2110-2130 and 2160-2180 MHz) licensed under this part

<R05>
Sec. 22.599  Assignment of 72-76 MHz channels.

    Because of the potential for interference to the reception of TV 
Channels 4 and 5 by broadcast television sets and video recorders, 
assignments of the 72-76 MHz channels are subject to the following 
conditions:
    (a) Assignments of 72-76 MHz channels for use within 129 kilometers 
(80 miles) of a full service TV station transmitting on TV Channel 4 or 
5 are subject to the condition that the licensee must eliminate any 
interference caused to television reception on TV Channels 4 and 5. If 
the FCC notifies the licensee of an interference problem and the 
licensee does not resolve the problem within 90 days of such 
notification, operation of the interfering 72-76 MHz fixed station must 
be immediately discontinued.
    (b) 72-76 MHz channels may be assigned for use within 16 kilometers 
(10 miles) of a full service TV station transmitting on TV Channel 4 or 
5 under a developmental authorization, pursuant to Sec. 22.413. 
However, for use within 50 meters (164 feet) of a TV station 
transmitting on TV Channel 4 or 5, 72-76 MHZ channels may be assigned 
under a regular authorization, rather than a developmental 
authorization.


<R05>
Sec. 22.601  Existing microwave stations licensed under this part.

    Existing microwave stations (2110-2130 and 2160-2180 MHz) licensed 
under this part (pursuant to former rules) are subject to the transition 
rules in Sec. 22.602. No new microwave systems will be authorized under 
this part.
    (a) Coordination required. Before filing applications for authority 
to modify existing stations on these channels or major amendments to 
such applications, carriers must coordinate the planned channel usage, 
using the procedure outlined in Sec. 22.150, with affected parties in 
this radio service and the Point-to-Point Microwave Service and the 
Multipoint Distribution Service. Affected parties are licensees and 
other applicants with previously filed pending applications whose 
stations could affect or be affected by the proposed modification of the 
existing station in terms of interference.
    (b) System parameters. In designing a system modification, the 
applicant must select sites, equipment and channels that will avoid 
harmful interference to other users. All parties must cooperate fully 
and make reasonable efforts to resolve technical problems and conflicts 
that may inhibit the most effective and efficient use of the radio 
spectrum; however, a party receiving notification is not obligated to 
suggest changes or re-design a proposal in cases involving conflicts. 
The applicant must identify in the application all parties with which 
the technical proposal was coordinated. In the event that technical 
problems are not resolved or if an affected party does not respond to 
coordination efforts within 30 days after notification, an explanation 
must be contained in the application. Where technical conflicts are 
resolved by an agreement between the parties that requires special 
procedures to reduce the likelihood of harmful interference (such as the 
use of artificial site shielding), or would result in a reduction of 
quality or capacity of either system, the details thereof must be 
contained in the application.
    (c) Bandwidth. Applicants must request the minimum emission 
bandwidth necessary. The FCC does not authorize bandwidths larger than 
800 kHz under this part.

Sec. 22.602  Transition of the 2110-2130 and 2160-2180 MHz channels to emerging technologies.

    The 2110-2130 and 2160-2180 MHz microwave channels formerly listed 
in Sec. 22.591 have been re-allocated for use by emerging technologies 
(ET) services. No new systems will be authorized under this part. The 
rules in this section provide for a transition period during which 
existing Paging and Radiotelephone Service (PARS) licensees using these 
channels may relocate operations to other media or to other fixed 
channels, including those in other microwave bands. For PARS licensees 
relocating operations to other microwave bands, authorization must be 
obtained under part 101 of this chapter.
    (a) Licensees proposing to implement ET services may negotiate with 
PARS licensees authorized to use these channels, for the purpose of 
agreeing to terms under which the PARS licensees would--
    (1) Relocate their operations to other fixed microwave bands or 
other media, or alternatively,
    (2) Accept a sharing arrangement with the ET licensee that may 
result in an otherwise impermissible level of interference to the PARS 
operations.

    (c) Relocation of fixed microwave licensees in the 2110-2130 MHz and 
2160-2180 MHz bands will be subject to mandatory negotiations only. A 
separate mandatory negotiation period will commence for each fixed 
microwave licensee when an ET licensee informs that fixed microwave 
licensee in writing of its desire to negotiate. Mandatory negotiation 
periods are defined as follows:
    (1) Non-public safety incumbents will have a two-year mandatory 
negotiation period; and
    (2) Public safety incumbents will have a three-year mandatory 
negotiation period.
    (d) The mandatory negotiation period is triggered at the option of 
the ET licensee. Once mandatory negotiations have begun, a PARS licensee 
may not refuse to negotiate and all parties are required to negotiate in 
good faith. Good faith requires each party to provide information to the 
other that is reasonably necessary to facilitate the relocation process. 
In evaluating claims that a party has not negotiated in good faith, the 
FCC will consider, inter alia, the following factors:
    (1) Whether the ET licensee has made a bona fide offer to relocate 
the PARS licensee to comparable facilities in accordance with section 
101.75(b) of this chapter;
    (2) If the PARS licensee has demanded a premium, the type of premium 
requested (e.g., whether the premium is directly related to relocation, 
such as system-wide relocations and analog-to-digital conversions, 
versus other types of premiums), and whether the value of the premium as 
compared to the cost of providing comparable facilities is 
disproportionate (i.e., whether there is a lack of proportion or 
relation between the two);
    (3) What steps the parties have taken to determine the actual cost 
of relocation to comparable facilities;
    (4) Whether either party has withheld information requested by the 
other party that is necessary to estimate relocation costs or to 
facilitate the relocation process. Any party alleging a violation of our 
good faith requirement must attach an independent estimate of the 
relocation costs in question to any documentation filed with the 
Commission in support of its claim. An independent cost estimate must 
include a specification for the comparable facility and a statement of 
the costs associated with providing that facility to the incumbent 
licensee.
    (e) Involuntary period. After the end of the mandatory negotiation 
period, ET licensees may initiate involuntary relocation procedures 
under the Commission's rules. ET licensees are obligated to pay to 
relocate only the specific microwave links to which their systems pose 
an interference problem. Under involuntary relocation, a PARS licensee 
is required to relocate, provided that:
    (1) The ET applicant, provider, licensee or representative 
guarantees payment of relocation costs, including all engineering, 
equipment, site and FCC fees, as well as any legitimate and prudent 
transaction expenses incurred by the PARS licensee that are directly 
attributable to an involuntary relocation, subject to a cap of two 
percent of

[[Page 72]]

the hard costs involved. Hard costs are defined as the actual costs 
associated with providing a replacement system, such as equipment and 
engineering expenses. ET licensees are not required to pay PARS 
licensees for internal resources devoted to the relocation process. ET 
licensees are not required to pay for transaction costs incurred by PARS 
licensees during the voluntary or mandatory periods once the involuntary 
period is initiated or for fees that cannot be legitimately tied to the 
provision of comparable facilities;
    (2) The ET applicant, provider, licensee or representative completes 
all activities necessary for implementing the replacement facilities, 
including engineering and cost analysis of the relocation procedure and, 
if radio facilities are involved, identifying and obtaining, on the 
incumbents behalf, new channels and frequency coordination; and,
    (3) The ET applicant, provider, licensee or representative builds 
the replacement system and tests it for comparability with the existing 
2 GHz system.
    (f) Comparable Facilities. The replacement system provided to an 
incumbent during an involuntary relocation must be at least equivalent 
to the existing PARS system with respect to the following three factors:
    (1) Throughput. Communications throughput is the amount of 
information transferred within a system in a given amount of time. If 
analog facilities are being replaced with analog, the ET licensee is 
required to provide the PARS licensee with an equivalent number of 4 kHz 
voice channels. If digital facilities are being replaced with digital, 
the ET licensee must provide the PARS licensee with equivalent data 
loading bits per second (bps). ET licensees must provide PARS licensees 
with enough throughput to satisfy the PARS licensee's system use at the 
time of relocation, not match the total capacity of the PARS system.
    (2) Reliability. System reliability is the degree to which 
information is transferred accurately within a system. ET licensees must 
provide PARS licensees with reliability equal to the overall reliability 
of their system. For digital data systems, reliability is measured by 
the percent of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a desired value, 
and for analog or digital voice transmissions, it is measured by the 
percent of time that audio signal quality meets an established 
threshold. If an analog voice system is replaced with a digital voice 
system, only the resulting frequency response, harmonic distortion, 
signal-to-noise ratio and its reliability will be considered in 
determining comparable reliability.
    (3) Operating Costs. Operating costs are the cost to operate and 
maintain the PARS system. ET licensees must compensate PARS licensees 
for any increased recurring costs associated with the replacement 
facilities (e.g. additional rental payments, increased utility fees) for 
five years after relocation. ET licensees may satisfy this obligation by 
making a lump-sum payment based on present value using current interest 
rates. Additionally, the maintenance costs to the PARS licensee must be 
equivalent to the 2 GHz system in order for the replacement system to be 
considered comparable.
    (g) The PARS licensee is not required to relocate until the 
alternative facilities are available to it for a reasonable time to make 
adjustments, determine comparability, and ensure a seamless handoff.
    (h) [Reserved]
    (i) After April 25, 1996, all major modifications and extensions to 
existing PARS systems operating on channels in the 2110-2130 and 2160-
2180 MHz bands will be authorized on a secondary basis to future ET 
operations. All other modifications will render the modified PARS 
license secondary to future ET operations unless the incumbent 
affirmatively justifies primary status and the incumbent PARS licensee 
establishes that the modification would not add to the relocation costs 
of ET licensees. Incumbent PARS licensees will maintain primary status 
for the following technical changes:
    (1) Decreases in power;
    (2) Minor changes (increases or decreases) in antenna height;
    (3) Minor location changes (up to two seconds);
    (4) Any data correction which does not involve a change in the 
location of an existing facility;

[[Page 73]]

    (5) Reductions in authorized bandwidth;
    (6) Minor changes (increases or decreases) in structure height;
    (7) Changes (increases or decreases) in ground elevation that do not 
affect centerline height;
    (8) Minor equipment changes.
    (j) Sunset. PARS licensees will maintain primary status in the 2110-
2130 MHz and 2160-2180 MHz bands unless and until an ET licensee 
requires use of the spectrum. ET licensees are not required to pay 
relocation costs after the relocation rules sunset (i.e., for the 2110-
2130 MHz and 2160-2180 MHz bands, ten years after the first ET license 
is issued in the respective band). Once the relocation rules sunset, an 
ET licensee may require the incumbent to cease operations, provided that 
the ET licensee intends to turn on a system within interference range of 
the incumbent, as determined by TIA TSB 10-F or any standard successor. 
ET licensee notification to the affected PARS licensee must be in 
writing and must provide the incumbent with no less than six months to 
vacate the spectrum. After the six-month notice period has expired, the 
PARS licensee must turn its license back into the Commission, unless the 
parties have entered into an agreement which allows the PARS licensee to 
continue to operate on a mutually agreed upon basis. If the parties 
cannot agree on a schedule or an alternative arrangement, requests for 
extension will be accepted and reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The 
Commission will grant such extensions only if the incumbent can 
demonstrate that:
    (1) It cannot relocate within the six-month period (e.g., because no 
alternative spectrum or other reasonable option is available), and;
    (2) The public interest would be harmed if the incumbent is forced 
to terminate operations (e.g., if public safety communications services 
would be disrupted).
    (k) Reimbursement and relocation expenses in the 2110-2130 MHz and 
2160-2180 MHz bands. Whenever an ET licensee in the 2110-2130 MHz and 
2160-2180 MHz band relocates a paired PARS link with one path in the 
2110-2130 MHz band and the paired path in the 2160-2180 MHz band, the ET 
license will be entitled to reimbursement pursuant to the procedures 
described in Sec. Sec. 27.1160 through 27.1174 of this chapter.

Sec. 22.603  488-494 MHz fixed service in Hawaii.

    Before filing applications for authorization of inter-island control 
and/or repeater stations, applicants must coordinate the planned channel 
usage with existing licensees and other applicants with previously filed 
applications, using the procedure outlined in Sec. 22.150. Applicants 
and licensees shall cooperate fully and make reasonable efforts to 
resolve any channel usage conflicts. In situations where technical 
solutions to such conflicts cannot be devised, the FCC may select a 
channel or channels to assign or may designate the application(s) for 
hearing. To be acceptable for filing, applications and major technical 
amendments must contain a certification that coordination has been 
completed and an exhibit listing the name(s) of the licensees and 
applicants with which the planned channel usage has been coordinated.

    The following channels are allocated for assignment to transmitters 
utilized within point-to-multipoint systems that support transmitters 
that provide public mobile service. Unless otherwise indicated, all 
channels have a bandwidth of 20 kHz and are designated by their center 
frequencies in MegaHertz. No new licenses will be issued for any 900 MHz 
frequencies in this section. See part 101, subpart O of this chapter for 
treatment of incumbents and for new licensing procedures. Incumbents 
under part 22 are subject to the restrictions of part 101, subpart O of 
this chapter but may make permissible modifications, transfers, 
assignments, or renew their licenses using procedures, forms, fees, and 
filing requirements of part 22.

Sec. 22.623  System configuration.

    This section requires a minimum configuration for point-to-
multipoint systems using the channels listed in Sec. 22.621.
    (a) 928-960 MHz. The channels may be assigned, individually or 
paired, only to fixed transmitters in a system that controls at least 
four public mobile base transmitters that transmit on the same channel. 
If a 932-933 MHz channel and a 941-942 MHz channel are assigned as a 
pair, the 941-942 MHz channel must be assigned only to control 
transmitters; the 932-933 MHz channel may be assigned to control or 
fixed relay transmitters.
    (b) 470-512 MHz. These channels may be assigned only individually 
(unpaired), to control transmitters that directly control at least four 
public mobile base transmitters that transmit on the same channel. Fixed 
relay transmitters are not authorized.
    (c) Selection and assignment. The FCC selects and assigns a channel 
when granting applications for authorization to operate a new station to 
transmit in the 470-512, 932-933 and 941-942 MHz frequency ranges. 
Applicants having a preference may request the assignment of a specific 
channel or channel pair, but the FCC may in some cases be unable to 
satisfy such requests.


<R05>
Sec. 22.625  Transmitter locations.

    This section governs where point-to-multipoint transmitters on the 
channels listed in Sec. 22.621 may be located.
    (a) 928-960 MHz. In this frequency range, the required minimum 
distance separation between co-channel fixed transmitters is 113 
kilometers (70 miles).
    (b) 470-512 MHz. The purpose of the rule in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section is to define the areas in which the 470-512 MHz channels are 
allocated for public mobile use. The purpose of the rules in paragraphs 
(b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section is to reduce the likelihood that 
interference to television reception from public mobile operations on 
these channels will occur.
    (1) Control transmitter locations. Control transmitter locations 
must be within 80 kilometers (50 miles) of the designated locations in 
this paragraph.

    (2) Protection from intermodulation interference. Control 
transmitter locations must be at least 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) from the 
main transmitter locations of all TV stations transmitting on TV 
channels separated by 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, or 8 TV channels from the TV 
channel containing the frequencies on which the control station will 
transmit. This requirement is intended to reduce the likelihood of 
intermodulation interference.
    (3) Co-channel protection from control transmitters with high 
antennas. This paragraph applies only to control transmitters that 
utilize an antenna height of more than 152 meters (500 feet) above 
average terrain. The distance between the location of such a control 
transmitter and the applicable protected TV station location specified 
in this paragraph must equal or exceed the sum of the distance from the 
control transmitter location to the radio horizon in the direction of 
the specified location and 89 kilometers (55 miles--representing the 
distance from the main transmitter location of the TV station to its 
Grade B contour in the direction of the control transmitter). The 
protected TV station locations in this paragraph are the locations of 
record as of September 1974, and these do not change even though the TV 
stations may have been subsequently relocated.

(b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section is to reduce the likelihood that 
interference to television receiption from public mobile operations on 
these channels will occur. The protected TV station locations specified 
in this section are the locations of record as of September 1974, and 
these do not change even though the TV stations may have been 
subsequently relocated.
    (1) Co-channel protection. The ERP of control transmitters must not 
exceed the limits in the tables in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(iii) 
of this section. The limits depend upon the height above average terrain 
of the control transmitter antenna and the distance between the control 
transmitter and the nearest protected TV station location in paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section.
    (i) The protected TV station locations are as follows (all 
coordinates are referenced to North American Datum 1983 (NAD83)):

This paragraph applies only to base transmitter locations in the New 
York-Northeastern New Jersey urban area that utilize an antenna height 
of more than 152 meters (500 feet) above average terrain. The distance 
between the location of such a base transmitter and the applicable 
protected TV station location specified in this paragraph must equal or 
exceed the sum of the distance from the base transmitter location to the 
radio horizon in the direction of the specified location and 89 
kilometers (55 miles--representing the distance from the main 
transmitter location of the TV station to its Grade B contour in the 
direction of the base transmitter). The distance to the radio horizon is 
calculated as follows:

    (g) The FCC may waive specific distance separation requirements of 
paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section if the applicant submits an 
engineering analysis which demonstrates that terrain effects and/or 
operation with less effective radiated power would satisfy the 
applicable minimum desired to undesired signal strength ratios at the 
Grade B contours of the protected TV stations. For this purpose, the 
Grade B contour of a TV station is deemed to be a circle with a 89 
kilometer (55 mile) radius, centered on the protected TV station 
location, and along which the median TV signal field strength is 64 
dB[micro]V/m. In any showing intended to demonstrate compliance with the 
minimum desired to undesired signal ratio requirements of this section, 
all predicted field strengths must have been determined using the UHF TV 
propagation curves contained in part 73 of this chapter.

Sec. 22.659  Effective radiated power limits.

    The purpose of the rules in this section, which limit effective 
radiated power (ERP), is to reduce the likelihood that interference to 
television reception from public mobile operations on these channels 
will occur. The protected TV station locations specified in this section 
are the locations of record as of September 1974, and these do not 
change even though the TV stations may have been subsequently relocated.
    (a) Maximum ERP. The ERP of base transmitters must not exceed 100 
Watts under any circumstances. The ERP of mobile transmitters must not 
exceed 60 Watts under any circumstances.
    (b) Co-channel protection from base transmitters. The ERP of base 
transmitters in the New York-Northeastern New Jersey urban area must not 
exceed the limits in the tables referenced in paragraphs (b)(2) and 
(b)(3) of this section. The limits depend upon the height above average 
terrain of the base transmitter antenna and the distance between the 
base transmitter and the nearest protected TV station location in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

    (2) Tables E-8 and E-9 of this section apply to base transmitters in 
the New York-Northeastern New Jersey urban area that transmit on 
channels in the 476-482 MHz range.
    (3) Tables E-10 and E-11 of this section apply to base transmitters 
in the New York-Northeastern New Jersey urban area that transmit on 
channels in the 470-476 MHz range.
    (c) Adjacent channel protection from base transmitters. The ERP of 
base transmitters must not exceed the limits in Table E-12 of this 
section. The limits depend upon the height above average terrain of the 
base transmitter antenna and the distance between the base transmitter 
and the nearest protected TV station location specified in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section.
    (1) The protected TV station locations are as follows (all 
coordinates are referenced to North American Datum 1983 (NAD83)):

<R05>
Sec. 22.701  Scope.

    The rules in this subpart govern the licensing and operation of 
stations and systems in the Rural Radiotelephone Service. The licensing 
and operation of these stations and systems is also subject to rules 
elsewhere in this part that apply generally to the Public Mobile 
Services. In case of conflict, however, the rules in this subpart 
govern.


<R05>
Sec. 22.702  Eligibility.

    Existing and proposed communications common carriers are eligible to 
hold authorizations to operate conventional central office, interoffice 
and rural stations in the Rural Radiotelephone Service. Subscribers are 
also eligible to hold authorizations to operate rural subscriber 
stations in the Rural Radiotelephone Service.

Sec. 22.703  Separate rural subscriber station authorization not required.

    A separate authorization is not required for rural subscriber 
stations for which the effective radiated power does not exceed 60 Watts 
and for which FAA notification of construction or alteration of the 
antenna structure is not required (see criteria in Sec. 17.7 of this 
chapter). Authority to operate such rural subscriber stations is 
conferred by the authorization of the central office or base station 
from which they receive service.


<R05>
Sec. 22.705  Rural radiotelephone system configuration.

    Stations in the Rural Radiotelephone Service are authorized to 
communicate as follows:
    (a) Rural subscriber stations are authorized to communicate with and 
through the central office station(s) with which they are associated. 
However, where the establishment of a central office station in this 
service is not feasible, rural subscriber stations may be authorized to 
communicate with and through a base station in the Paging and 
Radiotelephone Service.
    (b) Central office stations may communicate only with rural 
subscriber stations.

[[Page 84]]

    (c) Interoffice stations may communicate only with other interoffice 
stations.


<R05>
Sec. 22.709  Rural radiotelephone service application requirements.

    In addition to information required by Subparts B and D of this 
part, FCC Form 601 applications for authorization to operate a station 
in the Rural Radiotelephone Service must contain the applicable 
supplementary information described in this section.
    (a) Interoffice stations. Applications for authority to operate a 
new interoffice station or to add transmitters or points of 
communications to an existing interoffice station must contain an 
exhibit demonstrating that the requested facilities would be used only 
for interconnecting central office stations and explaining why the use 
of alternative existing radio or wire facilities is not feasible.
    (b) Technical information required. For each transmitter in the 
Rural Radiotelephone Service, the following information is required by 
FCC Form 601:
    (1) Location description: city; county; state; geographic 
coordinates correct to <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 second, the datum used 
(NAD83), site elevation above mean sea level, proximity to adjacent 
market boundaries and international borders;
    (2) Antenna height to tip above ground level, the height of the 
center of radiation of the antenna above the average terrain, the height 
of the antenna center of radiation above the average elevation of the 
terrain along each of the 8 cardinal radials, antenna gain in the 
maximum lobe, the beamwidth of the maximum lobe of the antenna, a polar 
plot of the horizontal gain pattern of the antenna, the electric field 
polarization of the wave emitted by the antenna when installed as 
proposed;
    (3) The center frequency of each channel requested, the maximum 
effective radiated power, the effective radiated power in each of the 
cardinal radial directions, any non-standard emission types to be used, 
including bandwidth and modulation type, the transmitter classification 
(e.g. central office), and the locations and call signs, if any, of any 
fixed points of communication.
    (c) No landline facilities. Each application for a central office 
station must contain an exhibit showing that it is impracticable to 
provide the required communication service by means of landline 
facilities.
    (d) Interference exhibit. Applications for central office, 
interoffice and relay stations must include an exhibit identifying co-
channel facilities and demonstrating, in accordance with Sec. 22.715 
that the proposed station, if authorized, would not cause interference 
to the service of those co-channel facilities. This exhibit must:
    (1) For UHF channels, identify each protected transmitter located 
within 108 kilometers (67 miles) of the proposed transmitter in 
directions in which the distance to the interfering contour is 76.4 
kilometers (47.5 miles) or less, and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) 
of the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the 
interfering contour exceeds 76.4 kilometers (47.5 miles); and identify 
each protected Basic Exchange Telephone Radio System central office 
transmitter in the rural Radiotelephone Service within 231 kilometers 
(144 miles).
    (2) For VHF channels, identify each protected transmitter located 
within 135 kilometers (84 miles) of the proposed transmitter in 
directions in which the distance to the interfering contour is 93.3 
kilometers (58 miles) or less, and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) of 
the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the 
interfering contour exceeds 93.3 kilometers (58 miles).
    (3) For each protected transmitter identified, show the results of 
distance calculations indicating that there would be no overlap of 
service and interfering contours, or alternatively, indicate that the 
licensee of or applicant for the protected transmitter and/or the 
applicant, as required, have agreed in writing to accept any 
interference resulting from operation of the proposed transmitter.
    (e) Blocking probability. Applications for authority to operate 
basic exchange telephone radio systems (BETRS) that request more than 
two channel pairs must include an exhibit containing calculations 
showing that the number of

[[Page 85]]

channels requested is the minimum necessary to achieve the required 
grade of service (in terms of blocking probability), and that there will 
be adequate spectrum available in the area to meet realistic estimates 
of current and future demand for paging, two-way mobile and rural 
radiotelephone services (see Sec. 22.719(c)). Applications for 
authority to operate new conventional rural radiotelephone systems that 
request more than two channel pairs must include a statement explaining 
why BETRS technology is not being proposed.
    (f) Antenna Information. Upon request by an applicant, licensee, or 
the Commission, a part 22 applicant or licensee of whom the request is 
made shall furnish the antenna type, model, and the name of the antenna 
manufacturer to the requesting party within ten (10) days of receiving 
written notification.

Sec. 22.717  Procedure for mutually exclusive applications in the Rural Radiotelephone Service.

    Mutually exclusive applications in the Rural Radiotelephone Service, 
including those that are mutually exclusive with applications in the 
Paging and Radiotelephone Service, are processed in accordance with 
Sec. 22.131 and with this section.
    (a) Applications in the Rural Radiotelephone Service may be mutually 
exclusive with applications in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service if 
they seek authorization to operate facilities on the same channel in the 
same area, or the technical proposals are otherwise in conflict. See 
Sec. 22.567.
    (b) A modification application in either service filed on the 
earliest filing date may cause all later-filed mutually exclusive 
applications of any type in either service to be ``cut off'' (excluded 
from a same-day filing group) and dismissed, pursuant to Sec. 
22.131(c)(3)(ii) and Sec. 22.131(c)(4).

<R05>
Sec. 22.719  Additional channel policy for rural radiotelephone stations.

    The rules in this section govern the processing of applications for 
central office stations that request a rural radiotelephone channel pair 
when the applicant has applied for or been granted an authorization for 
other rural radiotelephone channel pairs in the same area. The general 
policy of the FCC is to promote effective use of the spectrum by 
encouraging the use of spectrum-efficient technologies (i.e. BETRS) and 
by assigning the minimum number of channels necessary to provide 
service.
    (a) Transmitters in same area. Any central office station 
transmitter on any channel pair listed in Sec. 22.725 is considered to 
be in the same area as another central office station transmitter on any 
other channel pair listed in Sec. 22.725 if the transmitting antennas 
are located within 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) of each other.
    (b) Initial channel pairs. The FCC does not assign more than two 
channel pairs for new central office stations, unless there are more 
than eight rural subscriber stations to be served. Stations

[[Page 86]]

are considered to be new if there are no authorized transmitters on any 
channel listed in Sec. 22.725 controlled by the applicant in the same 
geographic area.
    (c) Additional channel pairs. Applications for central office 
station transmitters to be located in the same area as an authorized 
central office station controlled by the applicant, but to operate on a 
different channel pair(s) are considered as requests for additional 
channel pair(s) for the authorized central office station. The FCC may 
grant applications for additional channel pairs provided that the need 
for each additional channel pair (after the first two) is established 
and fully justified in terms of achieving the required grade of service 
(blocking probability), and the applicant demonstrates that there will 
still be adequate spectrum available in the area to meet realistic 
estimates of current and future demand for paging, two-way mobile and 
rural radiotelephone services. In the case of conventional rural 
radiotelephone central office stations, an explanation must be provided 
as to why BETRS technology is not being used instead of additional 
channel pairs.

               Conventional Rural Radiotelephone Stations


<R05>
Sec. 22.721  Geographic area authorizations.

    Eligible persons may apply for a paging geographic area 
authorization in the Rural Radiotelephone Service, on the channel pairs 
listed in Sec. 22.725, by following the procedures and requirements set 
forth in Sec. 22.503 for paging geographic area authorizations.

[62 FR 11636, Mar. 12, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 22.723  Secondary site-by-site authorizations.

    Authorizations for new facilities (including new sites and 
additional channel pairs for existing sites) in the Rural Radiotelephone 
Service (including BETRS facilities) may be granted after May 12, 1997 
only on the condition that such authorizations shall be secondary to any 
existing or future co-channel paging geographic area authorization in 
the Paging and Radiotelephone Service or the Rural Radiotelephone 
Service. If the paging geographic area licensee notifies the Rural 
Radiotelephone Service licensee that operation of a co-channel secondary 
facility must be discontinued because it may cause interference to 
existing or planned facilities, the Rural Radiotelephone Service 
licensee must discontinue operation of that facility on the particular 
channel pair involved no later than six months after such notice.

[62 FR 11636, Mar. 12, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 22.725  Channels for conventional rural radiotelephone stations and basic exchange telephone radio systems.

    The following channels are allocated for paired assignment to 
transmitters that provide conventional rural radiotelephone service and 
to transmitters in basic exchange telephone radio systems. These 
channels may be assigned for use by central office or rural subscriber 
stations as indicated, and interoffice stations. These channels may be 
assigned also for use by relay stations in systems where it would be 
impractical to provide rural radiotelephone service without the use of 
relay stations. All channels have a bandwidth of 20 kHz and are 
designated by their center frequencies in MegaHertz.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Basic power limit. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the ERP of central office station transmitters must not exceed 
500 Watts.
    (c) Height-power limits. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, the ERP of central office station transmitters must not exceed 
the amount that would result in an average distance to the ``service 
contour'' of 41.6 kilometers (26 miles) for VHF channels or 30.7 
kilometers (19 miles) for UHF channels. The average distance to the 
``service contour'' is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of the 
distances determined using the procedures specified in Sec. 22.567 for 
the eight cardinal radial directions, excluding cardinal radial 
directions for which 90% or more of the distance so calculated is over 
water.
    (d) Encompassed interfering contour areas. Central office station 
transmitters are exempt from the basic power and height-power limits of 
this section if the area within their interfering contours is totally 
encompassed by the interfering contours of operating co-channel central 
office station transmitters controlled by the same licensee. For the 
purpose of this paragraph, operating transmitters are authorized 
transmitters that are providing service to subscribers.
    (e) Adjacent channel protection. The ERP of central office station 
transmitters must not exceed 500 Watts if they transmit on channel 
454.025 MHz and are located less than 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) from any 
Private Radio Services station receiving on adjacent channel 454.000 
MHz.

Sec. 22.731  Emission limitations.

    Upon application for multichannel operation, the FCC may authorize 
emission bandwidths wider than those specified in Sec. 22.357, provided 
that spectrum utilization is equal to or better than that achieved by 
single channel operation.


<R05>
Sec. 22.733  Priority of service.

    Within the Rural Radiotelephone Service, the channels listed in 
Sec. 22.725 are intended primarily for use in rendition of public 
message service between rural subscriber and central office stations and 
to provide radio trunking facilities between central offices. The 
channels may also be used, however, for the rendition of private leased-
line communication service provided that such usage would not reduce or 
impair the extent or quality of communication service that would be 
available, in the absence of private leased-line service, to the general 
public receiving or subsequently requesting public message service from 
a central office.


<R05>
Sec. 22.737  Temporary fixed stations.

    The FCC may, upon proper application therefor, authorize the 
construction and operation of temporary fixed

[[Page 88]]

stations. Temporary fixed stations are to be used as rural subscriber, 
interoffice, or central office stations when those stations are 
unavailable or when service from those stations is disrupted by storms 
or emergencies.
    (a) Six month limitation. If it is necessary for a temporary fixed 
station to remain at the same location for more than six months, the 
licensee of that station must apply for authorization to operate the 
station at the specific location at least 30 days before the end of the 
six month period.
    (b) International communications. Communications between the United 
States and Canada or Mexico must not be carried using a temporary fixed 
station without prior authorization from the FCC. Licensees desiring to 
carry such communications should apply sufficiently in advance to allow 
for the time necessary to coordinate with Canada or Mexico.

Sec. 22.809  Transmitting power limits.

    The transmitting power of ground and airborne mobile transmitters 
operating on the channels listed in Sec. 22.805 must not exceed the 
limits in this section.
    (a) Ground station transmitters. The effective radiated power of 
ground stations must not exceed 100 Watts and must not be less than 50 
Watts, except as provided in Sec. 22.811.
    (b) Airborne mobile transmitters. The transmitter power output of 
airborne mobile transmitters must not exceed 25 Watts and must not be 
less than 4 Watts.


<R05>
Sec. 22.813  Technical channel pair assignment criteria.

    The rules in this section establish technical assignment criteria 
for the channel pairs listed in Sec. 22.805. These criteria are 
intended to provide substantial service volumes over areas that have 
significant local and regional general aviation activity, while 
maintaining the continuous nationwide in-route coverage of the original 
geographical layout.
    (a) Distance separation for co-channel ground stations. The FCC may 
grant an application requesting assignment of a communication channel 
pair to a proposed ground transmitter only if the proposed antenna 
location is at least 800 kilometers (497 miles) from the antenna 
location of the nearest co-channel ground transmitter in the United 
States, its territories and possessions; and 1000 kilometers (621 miles) 
from the antenna location of the nearest co-channel ground transmitter 
in Canada.
    (b) Dispersion. The FCC may grant an application requesting 
assignment of a communication channel pair to a proposed ground 
transmitter only if there are no more than five different communication 
channel pairs already assigned to ground transmitters with antenna 
locations within a 320 kilometer (199 mile) radius of the proposed 
antenna location.

Sec. 22.817  Additional channel policies.

    The rules in this section govern the processing of applications for 
authority to operate a ground station transmitter on any ground station 
communication channel listed in Sec. 22.805 when the applicant has 
applied or been

[[Page 90]]

granted an authorization for other ground station communication channels 
in the same area. The general policy of the FCC is to assign one ground 
station communication channel in an area to a carrier per application 
cycle, up to a maximum of six ground station communication channels per 
area. That is, a carrier must apply for one ground station communication 
channel, receive the authorization, construct the station, and notify 
the FCC of commencement of service before applying for an additional 
ground station communication channel in that area.
    (a) Air-ground transmitters in same area. Any transmitter on any of 
the ground station channels listed in Sec. 22.805 is considered to be 
in the same area as another transmitter on any ground station channel 
listed in Sec. 22.805 if it is located less than 350 kilometers (217 
miles) from that transmitter.
    (b) Initial channel. The FCC will not assign more than one ground 
station communication channel for new ground stations. Ground stations 
are considered to be new if there are no authorized ground station 
transmitters on any channel listed in Sec. 22.805 controlled by the 
applicant in the same area.
    (c) Additional channel. Applications for ground transmitters to be 
located in the same area as an authorized ground station controlled by 
the applicant, but to operate on a different ground station 
communication channel, are considered as requesting an additional 
channel for the authorized station.
    (d) Amendment of pending application. If the FCC receives and 
accepts for filing an application for a ground station transmitter to be 
located in the same area as a ground station transmitter proposed in a 
pending application previously filed by the applicant, but on a 
different ground station communication channel, the subsequent 
application is treated as a major amendment to change the technical 
proposal of the prior application. The filing date of any application so 
amended is the date the FCC received the subsequent application.
    (e) Dismissal of premature applications for additional channel. If 
the FCC receives an application requesting an additional ground station 
communication channel for an authorized ground station prior to 
receiving notification that the station is providing service to 
subscribers on the authorized channel(s), the FCC may dismiss that 
application without prejudice.
    (f) Dismissal of applications for seventh channel. If the FCC 
receives an application requesting an additional ground station 
communication channel for an authorized ground station which would, if 
granted, result in that station being assigned more than six ground 
station communication channels in the same area, the FCC may dismiss 
that application without prejudice.

Sec. 22.859  Incumbent commercial aviation air-ground systems.

    This section contains rules concerning continued operation of 
commercial aviation air-ground systems that were originally authorized 
prior to January 1, 2004 to provide radiotelephone service using 
narrowband (6 kHz) channels, and that have been providing service 
continuously since the original commencement of service (hereinafter 
``incumbent systems'').
    (a) An incumbent system may continue to operate under its 
authorization, for the remaining term of such authorization, subject to 
the terms and conditions attached thereto. Wherever such technical and 
operational conditions differ from technical and operational rules in 
this subpart, those conditions shall govern its operations.
    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, the 
licensee of an incumbent system shall not be entitled to an expectation 
of renewal of said authorization.
    (c) During the period that an incumbent system continues to operate 
and provide service pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, air-
ground systems of licensees holding a new authorization for the spectrum 
within which the incumbent system operates must not cause interference 
to the incumbent system. Protection from interference requires that the 
signals of the new systems must not exceed a ground station received 
power of -130 dBm within a 6 kHz receive bandwidth, calculated assuming 
a 0 dBi vertically polarized receive antenna.

<R05>
Sec. 22.861  Emission limitations.

    The rules in this section govern the spectral characteristics of 
emissions for commercial aviation systems in the Air-Ground 
Radiotelephone Service. Commercial aviation air-ground systems may use 
any type of emission or technology that complies with the technical 
rules in this subpart.
    (a) Out of band emissions. The power of any emission outside of the 
authorized operating frequency ranges must be attenuated below the 
transmitting power (P) by a factor of at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB.
    (b) Measurement procedure. Compliance with these rules is based on 
the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth 
of 100 kHz or greater. In the 1 MHz bands immediately outside and 
adjacent to the frequency block a resolution bandwidth of at least one 
percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the 
transmitter may be employed. A narrower resolution bandwidth is 
permitted in all cases to improve measurement accuracy provided the 
measured power is integrated over the full required measurement 
bandwidth (i.e., 100 kHz or 1 percent of emission bandwidth, as 
specified). The emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal 
between two points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above 
the carrier center frequency, outside of which all emissions are 
attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power.
    (c) Alternative out of band emission limit. The licensee(s) of 
commercial aviation air-ground systems, together with affected licensees 
of Cellular Radiotelephone Service systems operating in the spectrum 
immediately below and adjacent to the commercial aviation air-ground 
bands, may establish an alternative out of band emission limit to be 
used at the 849 MHz and 894 MHz band edge(s) in specified geographical 
areas, in lieu of that set forth in this section, pursuant to a private 
contractual arrangement of all affected licensees and applicants. In 
this event, each party to such contract shall maintain a copy of the 
contract in their station files and disclose it to prospective assignees 
or transferees and, upon request, to the FCC.
    (d) Interference caused by out of band emissions. If any emission 
from a transmitter operating in this service results in interference to 
users of another radio service, the FCC may require a greater 
attenuation of that emission than specified in this section.

    (a) The peak ERP of airborne mobile station transmitters must not 
exceed 12 Watts.
    (b) The peak ERP of ground station transmitters must not exceed 500 
Watts.

Sec. 22.873  Construction requirements for commercial aviation air-ground systems.

    Licensees authorized to use more than one megahertz (1 MHz) of the 
800 MHz commercial aviation air-ground spectrum allocation (see Sec. 
22.857) must make a showing of ``substantial service'' as set forth in 
this section. Failure by any such licensee to meet this requirement will 
result in forfeiture of the license and the licensee will be ineligible 
to regain it. Licensees authorized to use one megahertz or less of the 
800 MHz commercial aviation air-ground spectrum allocation are not 
subject to the requirements in this section.
    (a) ``Substantial service'' is defined as service that is sound, 
favorable, and substantially above a level of mediocre service that just 
might minimally warrant renewal.
    (b) Each commercial aviation air-ground system subject to the 
requirements of this section must demonstrate substantial service within 
5 years after grant of the authorization. Substantial service may be 
demonstrated by, but is not limited to, either of the following ``safe 
harbor'' provisions:
    (1) Construction and operation of 20 ground stations, with at least 
one ground station located in each of the 10 Federal Aviation 
Administration regions; or,
    (2) Provision of service to the airspace of 25 of the 50 busiest 
airports (as measured by annual passenger boardings).

systems is the same as the definition set forth in Sec. 22.970 which is 
applicable to Cellular Radiotelephone Service systems.

[70 FR 19311, Apr. 13, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 22.878  Obligation to abate unacceptable interference.

    This section applies only to commercial aviation ground stations 
transmitting in the 849-851 MHz band, other than commercial aviation 
ground stations operating under the authority of a license originally 
granted prior to January 1, 2004.
    (a) Strict responsibility. Any licensee who, knowingly or 
unknowingly, directly or indirectly, causes or contributes to causing 
unacceptable interference to a non-cellular part 90 licensee in the 800 
MHz band, as defined in Sec. 22.877, shall be strictly accountable to 
abate the interference, with full cooperation and utmost diligence, in 
the shortest time practicable. Interfering licensees shall consider all 
feasible interference abatement measures, including, but not limited to, 
the remedies specified in the interference resolution procedures set 
forth in Sec. 22.879. This strict responsibility obligation applies to 
all forms of interference, including out-of-band emissions and 
intermodulation.
    (b) Joint and Several responsibility. If two or more licensees, 
whether in the commercial aviation air-ground radiotelephone service or 
in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service (see Sec. 22.971), knowingly or 
unknowingly, directly or indirectly, cause or contribute to causing 
unacceptable interference to a non-cellular part 90 licensee in the 800 
MHz band, as defined in Sec. 22.877, such licensees shall be jointly 
and severally responsible for abating interference, with full 
cooperation and utmost diligence, in the shortest practicable time.

[[Page 93]]

    (1) This joint and several responsibility rule requires interfering 
licensees to consider all feasible interference abatement measures, 
including, but not limited to, the remedies specified in the 
interference resolution procedures set forth in Sec. 22.879(c). This 
joint and several responsibility rule applies to all forms of 
interference, including out-of-band emissions and intermodulation.
    (2) Any licensee that can show that its signal does not directly or 
indirectly cause or contribute to causing unacceptable interference to a 
non-cellular part 90 licensee in the 800 MHz band, as defined in Sec. 
22.877, shall not be held responsible for resolving unacceptable 
interference. Notwithstanding, any licensee that receives an 
interference complaint from a public safety/CII licensee shall respond 
to such complaint consistent with the interference resolution procedures 
set forth in Sec. 22.879.

Sec. 22.879  Interference resolution procedures.

    This section applies only to commercial aviation ground stations 
transmitting in the 849-851 MHz band, other than commercial aviation 
ground stations operating under the authority of a license originally 
granted prior to January 1, 2004.
    (a) Initial notification. Commercial aviation air-ground system 
licensees may receive initial notification of interference from non-
cellular part 90 licensees in the 800 MHz band pursuant to Sec. 
90.674(a) of this chapter.
    (1) Commercial aviation air-ground system licensees shall join with 
part 90 ESMR licensees and Cellular Radiotelephone Service licensees in 
utilizing an electronic means of receiving the initial notification 
described in Sec. 90.674(a) of this chapter. See Sec. 22.972.
    (2) Commercial aviation air-ground system licensees must respond to 
the initial notification described in Sec. 90.674(a) of this chapter as 
soon as possible and no later than 24 hours after receipt of 
notification from a part 90 public safety/CII licensee. This response 
time may be extended to 48 hours after receipt from other part 90 non-
cellular licensees provided affected communications on these systems are 
not safety related.
    (b) Interference analysis. Commercial aviation air-ground system 
licensees--who receive an initial notification described in Sec. 
90.674(a) of this chapter--shall perform a timely analysis of the 
interference to identify the possible source. Immediate on-site visits 
may be conducted when necessary to complete timely analysis. 
Interference analysis must be completed and corrective action initiated 
within 48 hours of the initial complaint from a part 90 public safety/
CII licensee. This response time may be extended to 96 hours after the 
initial complaint from other part 90 non-cellular licensees provided 
affected communications on these systems are not safety related. 
Corrective action may be delayed if the affected licensee agrees in 
writing (which may be, but is not required to be, recorded via e-mail or 
other electronic means) to a longer period.
    (c) Mitigation steps. Any commercial aviation air-ground system that 
is responsible for causing unacceptable interference to non-cellular 
part 90 licensees in the 800 MHz band shall take affirmative measures to 
resolve such interference.
    (1) Commercial aviation air-ground system licensees found to 
contribute to unacceptable interference, as defined in Sec. 22.877, 
shall resolve such interference in the shortest time practicable. 
Commercial aviation air-ground system licensees must provide all 
necessary test apparatus and technical personnel skilled in the 
operation of such equipment as may be necessary to determine the most 
appropriate means of timely eliminating the interference. However, the 
means whereby interference is abated or the technical parameters that 
may need to be adjusted is left to the discretion of the commercial 
aviation air-ground system licensee, whose affirmative measures may 
include, but not be limited to, the following techniques:
    (i) Increasing the desired power of the public safety/CII signal;
    (ii) Decreasing the power of the commercial aviation air-ground 
system signal;
    (iii) Modifying the commercial aviation air-ground system antenna 
height;

[[Page 94]]

    (iv) Modifying the commercial aviation air-ground system antenna 
characteristics;
    (v) Incorporating filters into the commercial aviation air-ground 
system transmission equipment;
    (vi) Changing commercial aviation air-ground system frequencies; and
    (vii) Supplying interference-resistant receivers to the affected 
public safety/CII licensee(s). If this technique is used, in all 
circumstances, commercial aviation air-ground system licensees shall be 
responsible for all costs thereof.
    (2) Whenever short-term interference abatement measures prove 
inadequate, the affected part 90 non-cellular licensee shall, consistent 
with but not compromising safety, make all necessary concessions to 
accepting interference until a longer-term remedy can be implemented.
    (3) When a part 90 public safety licensee determines that a 
continuing presence of interference constitutes a clear and imminent 
danger to life or property, the licensee causing the interference must 
discontinue the associated operation immediately, until a remedy can be 
identified and applied. The determination that a continuing presence 
exists that constitutes a clear and imminent danger to life or property, 
must be made by written statement that:
    (i) Is in the form of a declaration, notarized affidavit, or 
statement under penalty or perjury, from an officer or executive of the 
affected public safety licensee;
    (ii) Thoroughly describes the basis of the claim of clear and 
imminent danger;
    (iii) Was formulated on the basis of either personal knowledge or 
belief after due diligence;
    (iv) Is not proffered by a contractor or other third party; and,
    (v) Has been approved by the Chief of the Public Safety and Homeland 
Security Bureau or other designated Commission official. Prior to the 
authorized official making a determination that a clear and imminent 
danger exists, the associated written statement must be served by hand-
delivery or receipted fax on the applicable offending licensee, with a 
copy transmitted by the fastest available means to the Washington, DC 
office of the Commission's Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau.

Sec. 22.880  Information exchange.

    (a) Prior notification. Public safety/CII licensees may notify a 
commercial aviation air-ground system licensee that they wish to receive 
prior notification of the activation or modification of a commercial 
aviation air-ground system ground station site in their area. 
Thereafter, the commercial aviation air-ground system licensee must 
provide the following information to the public safety/CII licensee at 
least 10 business days before a new ground station is activated or an 
existing ground station is modified:
    (1) Location;
    (2) Effective radiated power;
    (3) Antenna manufacturer, model number, height above ground level 
and up tilt angle, as installed;
    (4) Channels available for use.
    (b) Purpose of prior notification. The prior notification of ground 
station activation or modification is for informational purposes only: 
public safety/CII licensees are not afforded the right to accept or 
reject the activation of a proposed ground station or to unilaterally 
require changes in its operating parameters. The principal purposes of 
prior notification are to:
    (1) Allow a public safety licensee to advise the commercial aviation 
air-ground system licensee whether it believes a proposed ground station 
will generate unacceptable interference;
    (2) Permit commercial aviation air-ground system licensee(s) to make 
voluntary changes in ground station parameters when a public safety 
licensee alerts them to possible interference; and
    (3) Rapidly identify the source if interference is encountered when 
the ground station is activated.

systems are also subject to rules elsewhere in this part that apply 
generally to the Public Mobile Services. In case of conflict, however, 
the rules in this subpart govern.


<R05>
Sec. 22.901  Cellular service requirements and limitations.

    The licensee of each cellular system is responsible for ensuring 
that its cellular system operates in compliance with this section.
    (a) Each cellular system must provide either mobile service, fixed 
service, or a combination of mobile and fixed service, subject to the 
requirements, limitations and exceptions in this section. Mobile service 
provided may be of any type, including two way radiotelephone, dispatch, 
one way or two way paging, and personal communications services (as 
defined in part 24 of this chapter). Fixed service is considered to be 
primary service, as is mobile service. When both mobile and fixed 
service are provided, they are considered to be co primary services. In 
providing cellular services, each cellular system may incorporate any 
technology that meets all applicable technical requirements in this 
part.
    (b) Until February 18, 2008, each cellular system that provides two-
way cellular mobile radiotelephone service must--
    (1) Maintain the capability to provide compatible analog service 
(``AMPS'') to cellular telephones designed in conformance with the 
specifications contained in sections 1 and 2 of the standard document 
ANSI TIA/EIA-553-A-1999 Mobile Station--Base Station Compatibility 
Standard (approved October 14, 1999); or, the corresponding portions, 
applicable to mobile stations, of whichever of the predecessor standard 
documents was in effect at the time of the manufacture of the telephone. 
This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the 
Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. 
Copies of the standard may be purchased from Global Engineering 
Documents, 15 Inverness Way East, Englewood, CO 80112-5704 (or via the

    (2) Provide AMPS, upon request, to subscribers and roamers using 
such cellular telephones while such subscribers are located in any 
portion of the cellular system's CGSA where facilities have been 
constructed and service to subscribers has commenced. See also Sec. 
20.12 of this chapter. Cellular licensees must allot sufficient system 
resources such that the quality of AMPS provided, in terms of geographic 
coverage and traffic capacity, is fully adequate to satisfy the 
concurrent need for AMPS availability.

to other licensees or proposed by tentative selectees or other 
applicants, except those with mutually exclusive applications.
    (a) Licensees must cooperate and make reasonable efforts to resolve 
technical problems that may inhibit effective and efficient use of the 
cellular radio spectrum; however, licensees are not obligated to suggest 
extensive changes to or redesign other licensees' cellular systems. 
Licensees must make reasonable efforts to avoid blocking the growth of 
other cellular systems that are likely to need additional capacity in 
the future.
    (b) If technical problems are addressed by an agreement or operating 
agreement between the licensees that would result in a reduction of 
quality or capacity of either system, the licensees must notify the 
Commission by updating FCC Form 601.

Cellular markets comprise Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and 
Rural Service Areas (RSAs). All cellular markets and the counties they 
comprise are listed in Public Notice Report No. CL-92-40 ``Common 
Carrier Public Mobile Services Information, Cellular MSA/RSA Markets and 
Counties'', dated January 24, 1992, DA 92-109, 7 FCC Rcd 742 (1992).
    (a) MSAs. Metropolitan Statistical Areas are 306 areas, including 
New England County Metropolitan Areas and the Gulf of Mexico Service 
Area (water area of the Gulf of Mexico, border is the coastline), 
defined by the Office of Management and Budget, as modified by the FCC.
    (b) RSAs. Rural Service Areas are 428 areas, other than MSAs, 
established by the FCC.

Sec. 22.911  Cellular geographic service area.

    The Cellular Geographic Service Area (CGSA) of a cellular system is 
the geographic area considered by the FCC to be served by the cellular 
system. The CGSA is the area within which cellular systems are entitled 
to protection and within which adverse effects for the purpose of 
determining whether a petitioner has standing are recognized.
    (a) CGSA determination. The CGSA is the composite of the service 
areas of all of the cells in the system, excluding any area outside the 
cellular market boundary, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, and excluding any area within the CGSA of another cellular 
system. The service area of a cell is the area within its service area

[[Page 97]]

boundary (SAB). The distance to the SAB is calculated as a function of 
effective radiated power (ERP) and antenna center of radiation height 
above average terrain (HAAT), height above sea level (HASL) or height 
above mean sea level (HAMSL).
    (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) of this section, 
the distance from a cell transmitting antenna to its SAB along each 
cardinal radial is calculated as follows:

d=2.531xh\0.34\ xp\0.17\

where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    (2) The distance from a cell transmitting antenna located in the 
Gulf of Mexico Service Area (GMSA) to its SAB along each cardinal radial 
is calculated as follows:


d = 6.895 x h\0.30\x p\0.15\

Where:

d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

    (3) The value used for h in the formula in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section must not be less than 8 meters (26 feet) HASL (or HAMSL, as 
appropriate for the support structure). The value used for h in the 
formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must not be less than 30 
meters (98 feet) HAAT, except that for unserved area applications 
proposing a cell with an ERP not exceeding 10 Watts, the value for h 
used in the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to determine the 
service area boundary for that cell may be less than 30 meters (98 feet) 
HAAT, but not less than 3 meters (10 feet) HAAT.
    (4) The value used for p in the formulas in paragraphs (a)(1) and 
(a)(2) of this section must not be less than 0.1 Watt or 27 dB less than 
(1/500 of) the maximum ERP in any direction, whichever is more.
    (5) Whenever use of the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
pursuant to the exception contained in paragraph (a)(3) of this section 
results in a calculated distance that is less than 5.4 kilometers (3.4 
miles), the radial distance to the service area boundary is deemed to be 
5.4 kilometers (3.4 miles).
    (6) The distance from a cell transmitting antenna to the SAB along 
any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is calculated by linear 
interpolation of distance as a function of angle.
    (b) Alternative CGSA determination. If a carrier believes that the 
method described in paragraph (a) of this section produces a CGSA that 
departs significantly (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>20% in the service area of 
any cell) from the geographic area where reliable cellular service is 
actually provided, the carrier may submit, as an exhibit to an 
application for modification of the CGSA using FCC Form 601, a depiction 
of what the carrier believes the CGSA should be. Such submissions must 
be accompanied by one or more supporting propagation studies using 
methods appropriate for the 800-900 MHz frequency range, including all 
supporting data and calculations, and/or by extensive field strength 
measurement data. For the purpose of such submissions, cellular service 
is considered to be provided in all areas, including ``dead spots'', 
between the transmitter location and the locus of points where the 
predicted or measured median field strength finally drops to 32 
dB[micro]V/m (i.e. does not exceed 32 dB[micro]V/m further out). If, 
after consideration of such submissions, the FCC finds that adjustment 
to a CGSA is warranted, the FCC may grant the application.
    (1) The alternative CGSA determination must define the CGSA in terms 
of distances from the cell sites to the 32 dBuV/m contour along the 
eight cardinal radials, with points in other azimuthal directions 
determined by the method given in paragraph (a)(6) of this section. The 
distances used for the cardinal radials must be representative of the 
coverage within the 45[deg] sectors, as depicted by the alternative CGSA 
determination.
    (2) If an uncalibrated predictive model is used to depict the CGSA, 
the alternative CGSA determination must identify factors (e.g. terrain 
roughness or features) that could plausibly account for the difference 
between actual coverage and that defined by the formula in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section. If actual measurements or a measurement-
calibrated predictive model are used to depict the CGSA, and this fact

[[Page 98]]

is disclosed in the alternative CGSA determination, it is not necessary 
to offer an explanation of the difference between actual coverage and 
that defined by the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the 
formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is clearly inapplicable for 
the cell(s) in question (e.g. for microcells), this should be disclosed 
in the alternative CGSA determination.
    (3) The provision for alternative CGSA determinations was made in 
recognition that the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is a 
general model that provides a reasonable approximation of coverage in 
most land areas, but may under-predict or over-predict coverage in 
specific areas with unusual terrain roughness or features, and may be 
inapplicable for certain purposes, e.g., cells with a coverage radius of 
less than 8 kilometers (5 miles). In such cases, alternative methods 
that utilize more specific models are appropriate. Accordingly, the FCC 
does not consider use of the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
with parameters outside of the limits in paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4) and 
(a)(5) of this section or with data for radials other than the cardinal 
radials to be a valid alternative method for determining the CGSA of a 
cellular system.
    (c) CGSA extension areas. SAB extensions (areas outside of the 
cellular market boundary, but within the service area as calculated 
using the methods of paragraph (a) of this section) are part of the CGSA 
only under the following circumstances:
    (1) During the five year build-out period of the system in the 
cellular market containing the extension, the licensees of systems on 
the same channel block in adjacent cellular markets may agree that the 
portion of the service area of one system that extends into unserved 
areas in the other system's cellular market is part of the CGSA of the 
former system.
    (2) At the end of the five year build-out period of the system in 
the cellular market containing the extension, the portion of the service 
area that extends into unserved areas in another cellular market becomes 
part of the CGSA, provided that the licensee of the system so extended 
files a system information update in accordance with Sec. 22.947(c).
    (3) For original systems in MSAs, extensions of the CGSA authorized 
by the FCC are part of the CGSA to the extent authorized.
    (d) Protection afforded. Within the CGSA determined in accordance 
with this section, cellular systems are entitled to protection from co-
channel and first-adjacent channel interference and from capture of 
subscriber traffic by adjacent systems on the same channel block.
    (1) Licensees must cooperate in resolving co-channel and first-
adjacent channel interference by changing channels used at specific 
cells or by other technical means.
    (2) Protection from capture of subscriber traffic is applied and 
limited in accordance with the following:
    (i) Subscriber traffic is captured if an SAB of one cellular system 
overlaps the CGSA of another operating cellular system. Therefore, 
cellular licensees must not begin to operate any facility that would 
cause an SAB to overlap the existing CGSA of another cellular system on 
the same channel block, without first obtaining the written consent of 
the licensee of that system. However, cellular licensees may continue to 
operate existing facilities that produce an SAB overlapping a 
subsequently-authorized portion of the CGSA of another cellular system 
on the same channel block until the licensee of that system requests 
that the SAB be removed from its CGSA. Such request may be made directly 
to the licensee of the overlapping system or to the FCC. In the event 
such request is made, the licensee of the overlapping system must reduce 
the transmitting power or antenna height (or both) at the pertinent cell 
site as necessary to remove the SAB from the CGSA of the other system, 
unless a written consent from the licensee of the other system allowing 
the SAB to remain is obtained. Cellular licensees may enter into 
contracts with the licensees of other cellular systems on the same 
channel block to allow SABs to overlap CGSAs.
    (ii) Cellular licensees are at most entitled to have a CGSA free of 
SABs

[[Page 99]]

from other cellular systems on the same channel block.
    (e) Unserved areas. Unserved areas are areas outside of all existing 
CGSAs (on either of the channel blocks), to which the Communications Act 
of 1934, as amended, is applicable.

Sec. 22.912  Service area boundary extensions.

    This section contains rules governing service area boundary (SAB) 
extensions. SAB extensions are areas outside of the cellular market 
boundary, but within the service area as calculated using the methods of 
Sec. 22.911(a). Cellular systems must be designed to comply with the 
rules in this section. Applications proposing systems that would not 
comply with the rules in this section are defective. Service within SAB 
extensions is not protected from interference or capture under Sec. 
22.911(d) unless and until the area within the SAB extension becomes a 
part of the cellular geographic service area (CGSA) in accordance with 
Sec. 22.911(c).
    (a) De minimis extensions. Except as otherwise provided in 
paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, SABs may be extended into 
adjacent cellular markets if such extensions are de minimis, are 
demonstrably unavoidable for technical reasons of sound engineering 
design, and do not extend into the CGSA of any other licensee's cellular 
system on the same channel block, any part of the Gulf of Mexico 
Exclusive Zone (GMEZ), or into any adjacent cellular market on a channel 
block for which the five year build-out period has expired.
    (b) Contract extensions. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 
(d) of this section, cellular system licensees may enter into contracts 
to allow SAB extensions as follows:
    (1) The licensee of any cellular system may, at any time, enter into 
a contract with an applicant for, or licensee of, a cellular system on 
the same channel block in an adjacent cellular market, to allow one or 
more SAB extensions into its CGSA only (not into unserved area).
    (2) The licensee of the first authorized cellular system on each 
channel block in the Gulf of Mexico Service Area (GMSA) may enter into a 
contract with an applicant for, or licensee of, a cellular system on the 
same channel block in an adjacent cellular market or in the Gulf of 
Mexico Coastal Zone (GMCZ), to allow one or more SAB extensions into the 
Gulf of Mexico Exclusive Zone.
    (3) The licensee of the first authorized cellular system on each 
channel block in each cellular market may enter into a contract with an 
applicant for or licensee of a cellular system on the same channel block 
in an adjacent cellular market, to allow one or more SAB extensions into 
its CGSA and/or unserved area in its cellular market, during its five 
year build-out period.
    (b) Contract extensions. Except as restricted in paragraph (d) of 
this section, licensees of cellular systems on the same channel block in 
adjacent cellular markets may, at any time, enter into contracts with 
applicants or other licensees to allow SAB extensions into their CGSA 
only (not into unserved areas). Except as restricted in paragraph (d) of 
this section, licensees of the first authorized cellular systems on the 
same channel block in adjacent cellular markets may agree to allow SAB 
extensions into their CGSA and/or unserved areas in their cellular 
markets during the five year build-out period of the market into which 
the SAB extends.
    (c) Same applicant/licensee. Except as restricted in paragraph (d) 
of this section, licensees of cellular systems that are also an 
applicant or licensee on the same channel block in adjacent cellular 
markets may, at any time, allow or propose SAB extensions from their 
adjacent market system into their CGSH only (not into unserved areas). 
Except as restricted in paragraph (d) of this section, licensees of the 
first authorized cellular systems that are also an applicant or licensee 
on the same channel block in adjacent cellular markets may allow or 
propose SAB extensions from their adjacent market system into their CGSA 
and/or unserved areas in their cellular markets during the five year 
build-out period of the market into which the SAB extends.

[[Page 100]]

    (d) Unserved area systems. Phase I initial cellular applications 
must not propose SAB extensions. Phase I sole major modification 
applications and Phase II applications may propose SAB extensions, 
subject to the conditions in this section.

<R05>
Sec. 22.913  Effective radiated power limits.

    The effective radiated power (ERP) of transmitters in the Cellular 
Radiotelephone Service must not exceed the limits in this section.
    (a) Maximum ERP. In general, the effective radiated power (ERP) of 
base transmitters and cellular repeaters must not exceed 500 Watts. 
However, for those systems operating in areas more than 72 km (45 miles) 
from international borders that:
    (1) Are located in counties with population densities of 100 persons 
or fewer per square mile, based upon the most recently available 
population statistics from the Bureau of the Census; or,
    (2) Extend coverage on a secondary basis into cellular unserved 
areas, as those areas are defined in Sec. 22.949, the ERP of base 
transmitters and cellular repeaters of such systems must not exceed 1000 
Watts. The ERP of mobile transmitters and auxiliary test transmitters 
must not exceed 7 Watts.
    (b) Height-power limit. The ERP of base transmitters must not exceed 
the amount that would result in an average distance to the service area 
boundary of 79.1 kilometers (49 miles) for cellular systems authorized 
to serve the Gulf of Mexico MSA and 40.2 kilometers (25 miles) for all 
other cellular systems. The average distance to the service area 
boundary is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of the distances 
determined using the procedures specified in Sec. 22.911 for the eight 
cardinal radial directions.
    (c) Coordination exemption. Licensees need not comply with the 
height-power limit in paragraph (b) of this section if the proposed 
operation is coordinated with the licensees of all affected cellular 
systems on the same channel block within 121 kilometers (75 miles) and 
concurrence is obtained.

<R05>
Sec. 22.917  Emission limitations for cellular equipment.

    The rules in this section govern the spectral characteristics of 
emissions in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service.
    (a) Out of band emissions. The power of any emission outside of the 
authorized operating frequency ranges must be attenuated below the 
transmitting power (P) by a factor of at least 43 + 10 log(P) dB.
    (b) Measurement procedure. Compliance with these rules is based on 
the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth 
of 100 kHz or greater. In the 1 MHz bands immediately outside and 
adjacent to the frequency block a resolution bandwidth of at least one 
percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the 
transmitter may be employed. A narrower resolution bandwidth is 
permitted in all cases to improve measurement accuracy provided the 
measured power is integrated over the full required measurement 
bandwidth (i.e. 100 kHz or 1 percent of emission bandwidth, as 
specified). The emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal 
between two points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above 
the carrier center frequency, outside of which all emissions are 
attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power.
    (c) Alternative out of band emission limit. Licensees in this 
service may establish an alternative out of band emission limit to be 
used at specified band edge(s) in specified geographical areas, in lieu 
of that set forth in this section, pursuant to a private contractual 
arrangement of all affected licensees and applicants. In this event, 
each party to such contract shall maintain a copy of the contract in 
their station files and disclose it to prospective assignees or 
transferees and, upon request, to the FCC.
    (d) Interference caused by out of band emissions. If any emission 
from a transmitter operating in this service results in interference to 
users of another radio service, the FCC may require a

[[Page 101]]

greater attenuation of that emission than specified in this section.

Sec. 22.921  911 call processing procedures; 911-only calling mode.

    Mobile telephones manufactured after February 13, 2000 that are 
capable of operating in the analog mode described in the standard 
document ANSI TIA/EIA-553-A-1999 Mobile Station--Base Station 
Compatibility Standard (approved October 14, 1999--available for 
purchase from Global Engineering Documents, 15 Inverness East, 
Englewood, CO 80112), must incorporate a special procedure for 
processing 911 calls. Such procedure must recognize when a 911 call is 
made and, at such time, must override any programming in the mobile unit 
that determines the handling of a non-911 call and permit the call to be 
transmitted through the analog systems of other carriers. This special 
procedure must incorporate one or more of the 911 call system selection 
processes endorsed or approved by the FCC.

Sec. 22.923  Cellular system configuration.

    Mobile stations communicate with and through base transmitters only. 
Base transmitters communicate with mobile stations directly or through 
cellular repeaters. Auxiliary test stations may communicate with base or 
mobile stations for the purpose of testing equipment.


<R05>
Sec. 22.925  Prohibition on airborne operation of cellular telephones.

    Cellular telephones installed in or carried aboard airplanes, 
balloons or any other type of aircraft must not be operated while such 
aircraft are airborne (not touching the ground). When any aircraft 
leaves the ground, all cellular telephones on board that aircraft must 
be turned off. The following notice must be posted on or near each 
cellular telephone installed in any aircraft:
    ``The use of cellular telephones while this aircraft is airborne is 
prohibited by FCC rules, and the violation of this rule could result in 
suspension of service and/or a fine. The use of cellular telephones 
while this aircraft is on the ground is subject to FAA regulations.''


<R05>
Sec. 22.927  Responsibility for mobile stations.

    Mobile stations that are subscribers in good standing to a cellular 
system, when receiving service from that cellular system, are considered 
to be operating under the authorization of that cellular system. 
Cellular system licensees are responsible for exercising effective 
operational control over mobile stations receiving service through their 
cellular systems. Mobile stations that are subscribers in good standing 
to a cellular system, while receiving service from a different cellular 
system, are considered to be operating under the authorization of such 
different system. The licensee of such different system is responsible, 
during such temporary period, for exercising effective operational 
control over such mobile stations as if they were subscribers to it.


<R05>
Sec. 22.929  Application requirements for the Cellular Radiotelephone Service.

    In addition to information required by subparts B and D of this 
part, applications for authorization in the Cellular Radiotelephone 
Service contain required information as described in the instructions to 
the form. Site coordinates must be referenced to NAD83 and be correct to 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 second.
    (a) Administrative information. The following information is 
required either by FCC Form 601, or as an exhibit:
    (1) Location description; city; county; state; geographical 
coordinates correct to <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 second, the datum used 
(NAD 83), site elevation above mean sea level, proximity to adjacent 
market boundaries and international borders;
    (2) Antenna height to tip above ground level, the height of the 
center of radiation of the antenna above the average terrain, the height 
of the antenna center of radiation above the average elevation of the 
terrain along each of the 8 cardinal radials, antenna gain in the 
maximum lobe, the beamwidth of the maximum lobe of the antenna, a polar 
plot of the horizontal

[[Page 102]]

 gain pattern of the antenna, the electric field polarization of the 
wave emitted by the antenna when installed as proposed:
    (3) The channel block requested, the maximum effective radiated 
power, the effective radiated power in each of the cardinal radial 
directions.
    (b) If the application involves a service area boundary (SAB) 
extension (Sec. 22.912 of this chapter), the licensee must provide a 
statement as described in Sec. 22.953.
    (c) Maps. If the application proposes a change in the CGSA, it must 
include full size and reduced maps, and supporting engineering, as 
described in Sec. 22.953 (a)(1) through (a)(3).
    (d) Antenna Information. Upon request by an applicant, licensee, or 
the Commission, a cellular applicant or licensee of whom the request is 
made shall furnish the antenna type, model, and the name of the antenna 
manufacturer to the requesting party within ten (10) days of receiving 
written notification.

Sec. 22.935  Procedures for comparative renewal proceedings.

    The procedures in this section apply to comparative renewal 
proceedings in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service.
    (a) If one or more of the applications competing with an application 
for renewal of a cellular authorization are filed, the renewal applicant 
must file with the Commission its original renewal expectancy showing 
electronically via the ULS. This filing must be submitted no later than 
60 days after the date of the Public Notice listing as acceptable for 
filing the renewal application and the competing applications.
    (b) Interested parties may file petitions to deny any of the 
mutually exclusive applications. Any such petitions to deny must be 
filed no later than 30 days after the date that the renewal applicant 
submitted its renewal expectancy showing. Applicants may file replies to 
any petitions to deny applications that are filed. Any such replies must 
be filed no later than 15 days after the date that the petition(s) to 
deny was filed. No further pleadings will be accepted.
    (c) In most instances, the renewal application and any competing 
applications will be designated for a two-step procedure. An 
Administrative Law Judge (Presiding Judge) will conduct a threshold 
hearing (step one), in which both the licensee and the competing 
applicants will be parties, to determine whether the renewal applicant 
deserves a renewal expectancy. If the order designating the applications 
for hearing specifies any basic qualifying issues against the licensee, 
those issues will be tried in this threshold hearing. If the Presiding 
Judge determines that the renewal applicant is basically qualified and 
due a renewal expectancy, the competing applicants will be found 
ineligible for further consideration and their applications will be 
denied. If the Presiding Judge determines that the renewal applicant 
does not merit a renewal expectancy but is otherwise qualified, then all 
of the applications will be considered in a comparative hearing (step 
two).
    (d) Any competing applicant may request a waiver of the threshold 
hearing (step one), if such applicant demonstrates that its proposal so 
far exceeds the service already being provided that there would be no 
purpose in making a threshold determination as to whether the renewal 
applicant deserved a renewal expectancy vis-a-vis such a competing 
applicant. Any such waiver request must be filed at the time the 
requestor's application is filed. Petitions opposing such waiver 
requests may be filed. Any such petitions must be filed no later than 30 
days after the date that the renewal applicant submitted its renewal 
expectancy showing. Replies to any petitions opposing such waiver 
requests may be filed. Any such replies must be filed no later than 15 
days after the date that the petition(s) were filed. No further 
pleadings will be accepted. Any waiver request submitted pursuant to 
this paragraph will be acted upon prior to designating the applications 
for hearing. If a request to waive the threshold hearing (step one) is 
granted, the renewal expectancy issue will be designated as part of the 
comparative hearing (step two), and will remain the most important 
comparative factor in

[[Page 103]]

deciding the case, as provided in Sec. 22.940(a).
    (e) If the Presiding Judge issues a ruling in the threshold (step 
one) that denies the licensee a renewal expectancy, all of the 
applicants involved in the proceeding will be allowed to file direct 
cases no later than 90 days after the release date of the Presiding 
Judge's ruling. Rebuttal cases must be filed no later than 30 days after 
the date that the direct cases were filed.
    (f) The Presiding Judge shall use the expedited hearing procedures 
delineated in this paragraph in both threshold (step one) and 
comparative (step two) hearings conducted in comparative cellular 
renewal proceedings.
    (1) The Presiding Judge will schedule a first hearing session as 
soon as practicable after the date for filing rebuttal evidence. This 
first session will be an evidentiary admission session at which each 
applicant will identify and offer its previously circulated direct and 
rebuttal exhibits, and each party will have an opportunity to lodge 
objections.
    (2) After accepting the exhibits into evidence, the Presiding Judge 
will entertain motions to cross-examine and rule whether any sponsoring 
witness needs to be produced for cross-examination.
    Determination of what, if any, cross-examination is necessary is 
within the sound judicial discretion of the Presiding Judge, the 
prevailing standard being whether the person requesting cross-
examination has persuasively demonstrated that written evidence is 
ineffectual to develop proof. If cross-examination is necessary, the 
Presiding Judge will specify a date for the appearance of all witnesses. 
In addition, if the designation order points out an area where 
additional underlying data is needed, the Presiding Judge will have the 
authority to permit the limited use of discovery procedures. Finally, 
the Presiding Judge may find that certain additional testimony or cross-
examination is needed to provide a complete record for the FCC. If so, 
the Presiding Judge may schedule a further session.
    (3) After the hearing record is closed, the Presiding Judge may 
request Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law to be filed no 
later than 30 days after the final hearing session. Replies are not 
permitted except in unusual cases and then only with respect to the 
specific issues named by the Presiding Judge.
    (4) The Presiding Judge will then issue an Initial Decision, 
preferably within 60 days of receipt of the last pleadings. If mutually 
exclusive applications are before the Presiding Judge, the Presiding 
Judge will determine which applicant is best qualified. The Presiding 
Judge may also rank the applicants in order of merit if there are more 
than two.
    (5) Parties will have 30 days in which to file exceptions to the 
Initial Decision.

Sec. 22.936  Dismissal of applications in cellular renewal proceedings.

    Any applicant that has filed an application in the Cellular 
Radiotelephone Service that is mutually exclusive with an application 
for renewal of a cellular authorization (competing application), and 
seeks to resolve the mutual exclusivity by requesting dismissal of its 
application, must obtain the approval of the FCC.
    (a) If a competing applicant seeks to dismiss its application prior 
to the Initial Decision stage of the hearing on its application, it must 
submit to the Commission a request for approval of the dismissal of its 
application. This request for approval of the dismissal of its 
application must be submitted and must also include a copy of any 
agreement related to the withdrawal or dismissal, and an affidavit 
setting forth:
    (1) A certification that neither the petitioner nor its principals 
has received or will receive any money or other consideration in excess 
of legitimate and prudent expenses in exchange for the withdrawal or 
dismissal of the application, except that this provision does not apply 
to dismissal or withdrawal of applications pursuant to bona fide merger 
agreements;
    (2) The exact nature and amount of any consideration received or 
promised;

[[Page 104]]

    (3) An itemized accounting of the expenses for which it seeks 
reimbursement; and
    (4) The terms of any oral agreement related to the withdrawal or 
dismissal of the application.
    (b) In addition, within 5 days of the filing date of the applicant 
or petitioner's request for approval, each remaining party to any 
written or oral agreement must submit an affidavit setting forth:
    (1) A certification that neither the applicant nor its principals 
has paid or will pay money or other consideration in excess of the 
legitimate and prudent expenses of the petitioner in exchange for 
withdrawing or dismissing the application; and
    (2) The terms of any oral agreement relating to the withdrawal or 
dismissal of the application.
    (c) For the purposes of this section:
    (1) Affidavits filed pursuant to this section must be executed by 
the filing party, if an individual, a partner having personal knowledge 
of the facts, if a partnership, or an officer having personal knowledge 
of the facts, if a corporation or association.
    (2) Applications are deemed to be pending before the FCC from the 
time the application is filed with the FCC until such time as an order 
of the FCC granting, denying or dismissing the application is no longer 
subject to reconsideration by the FCC or to review by any court.
    (3) ``Legitimate and prudent expenses'' are those expenses 
reasonably incurred by a party in preparing to file, filing, prosecuting 
and/or settling its application for which reimbursement is sought.
    (4) ``Other consideration'' consists of financial concessions, 
including, but not limited to, the transfer of assets or the provision 
of tangible pecuniary benefit, as well as non-financial concessions that 
confer any type of benefit on the recipient.

Sec. 22.939  Site availability requirements for applications competing with cellular renewal applications.

    In addition to the other requirements set forth in this part for 
initial cellular applications, any application competing against a 
cellular renewal application must contain, when initially filed, 
appropriate documentation demonstrating that its proposed antenna 
site(s) will be available. Competing applications that do not include 
such documentation will be dismissed. If the competing applicant does 
not own a particular site, it must, at a minimum demonstrate that the 
site is available to it by providing a letter from the owner of the 
proposed antenna site expressing the owner's intent to sell or lease the 
proposed site to the applicant. If any proposed antenna site is under 
U.S. Government control, the applicant must submit written confirmation 
of the site's availability from the appropriate Government agency. 
Applicants which file competing applications against incumbent cellular 
licensees may not rely on the assumption that an incumbent licensee's 
antenna sites are available for their use.


<R05>
Sec. 22.940  Criteria for comparative cellular renewal proceedings.

    This section sets forth criteria to be used in comparative cellular 
renewal proceedings. The ultimate issue in comparative renewal 
proceedings will be to determine, in light of the evidence adduced in 
the proceeding, what disposition of the applications would best serve 
the public interest, convenience and necessity.
    (a) Renewal expectancies. The most important comparative factor to 
be considered in a comparative cellular renewal proceeding is a major 
preference, commonly referred to as a ``renewal expectancy.''
    (1) The cellular renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal 
proceeding will receive a renewal expectancy, if its past record for the 
relevant license period demonstrates that:
    (i) The renewal applicant has provided ``substantial'' service 
during its past license term. ``Substantial'' service is defined as 
service which is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of 
mediocre service which just might minimally warrant renewal; and
    (ii) The renewal applicant has substantially compiled with 
applicable FCC rules, policies and the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended.

[[Page 105]]

    (2) In order to establish its right to a renewal expectancy, a 
cellular renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding 
must submit a showing explaining why it should receive a renewal 
expectancy. At a minimum, this showing must include.
    (i) A description of its current service in terms of geographic 
coverage and population served, as well as the system's ability to 
accommodate the needs of roamers;
    (ii) An explanation of its record of expansion, including a 
timetable of the construction of new cell sites to meet changes in 
demand for cellular service;
    (iii) A description of its investments in its cellular system; and
    (iv) Copies of all FCC orders finding the licensee to have violated 
the Communications Act or any FCC rule or policy; and a list of any 
pending proceedings that relate to any matter described in this 
paragraph.
    (3) In making its showing of entitlement to a renewal expectancy, a 
renewal applicant may claim credit for any system modification 
applications that were pending on the date it filed its renewal 
application. Such credit will not be allowed if the modification 
application is dismissed or denied.
    (b) Additional comparative issues. The following additional 
comparative issues will be included in comparative cellular renewal 
proceedings, if a full comparative hearing is conducted pursuant to 
Sec. 22.935(c).
    (1) To determine on a comparative basis the geographic areas and 
population that each applicant proposes to serve; to determine and 
compare the relative demand for the services proposed in said areas; and 
to determine and compare the ability of each applicant's cellular system 
to accommodate the anticipated demand for both local and roamer service;
    (2) To determine on a comparative basis each applicant's proposal 
for expanding its system capacity in a coordinated manner in order to 
meet anticipated increasing demand for both local and roamer service;
    (3) To determine on a comparative basis the nature and extent of the 
service proposed by each applicant, including each applicant's proposed 
rates, charges, maintenance, personnel, practices, classifications, 
regulations and facilities (including switching capabilities); and
    (4) To determine on a comparative basis each applicant's past 
performance in the cellular industry or another business of comparable 
type and size.
    (c) Additional showings for competing applications. With respect to 
evidence introduced pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, any 
applicant filing a competing application against a cellular renewal 
application (competing applicant) who claims a preference for offering 
any service not currently offered by the incumbent licensee must 
demonstrate that there is demand for that new service and also present a 
business plan showing that the competing applicant can operate the 
system economically. Any competing applicant who proposes to replace 
analog technology with digital technology will receive no credit for its 
proposal unless it submits a business plan showing how it will operate 
its system economically and how it will provide more comprehensive 
service than does the incumbent licensee with existing and implemented 
cellular technology.


<R05>
Sec. 22.943  Limitations on transfer of control and assignment for 

authorizations issued as a result of a comparative renewal proceeding.

    Except as otherwise provided in this section, the FCC does not 
accept applications for consent to transfer of control or for assignment 
of the authorization of a cellular system that has been acquired by the 
current licensee for the first time as a result of a comparative renewal 
proceeding until the system has provided service to subscribers for at 
least three years.
    (a) The FCC may accept and grant applications for consent to 
transfer of control or for assignment of the authorization of a cellular 
system that is to be transferred as a part of a bona fide sale of an on-
going business to which the cellular operation is incidental.
    (b) The FCC may accept and grant applications for consent to 
transfer of control or for assignment of the authorization of a cellular 
system that is

[[Page 106]]

to be transferred as a result of the death of the licensee.
    (c) The FCC may accept and grant applications for consent to 
transfer of control or for assignment of authorization if the transfer 
or assignment is pro forma and does not involve a change in ownership.

<R05>
Sec. 22.946  Service commencement and construction systems.

    (a) Commencement of service. New cellular systems must be at least 
partially constructed and begin providing cellular service to 
subscribers within the service commencement periods specified in Table 
H-1 of this section. Service commencement periods begin on the date of 
grant of the initial authorization, and are not extended by the grant of 
subsequent authorizations for the cellular system (such as for major 
modifications). The licensee must notify the FCC (FCC Form 601) after 
the requirements of this section are met (see Sec. 1.946 of this 
chapter).

                   Table H-1--Commencement of Service
------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Type of cellular system          Required to commence service in
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first system authorized on each      36 months.
 channel block in markets 1-90.
The first system authorized on each      18 months.
 channel block in all other markets and
 any subsequent systems authorized
 pursuant to contracts in partitioned
 markets.
The first system authorized on each      No requirement.
 channel block in the Gulf of Mexico
 Exclusive Zone.
All other systems......................  12 months.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) To satisfy this requirement, a cellular system must be 
interconnected with the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and 
must be providing service to mobile stations operated by its subscribers 
and roamers. A cellular system is considered to be providing service 
only if mobile stations can originate telephone calls to and receive 
telephone calls from wireline telephones through the PSTN.
    (c) Construction period for specific facilities. The construction 
period applicable to specific new or modified cellular facilities for 
which a separate authorization is granted is one year, beginning on the 
date the authorization is granted.

<R05>
Sec. 22.947  Five year build-out period.

    Except for systems authorized in the Gulf of Mexico Exclusive Zone, 
the licensee of the first cellular system authorized on each channel 
block in each cellular market is afforded a five year period, beginning 
on the date the initial authorization for the system is granted, during 
which it may expand the system within that market.
    (a) Exclusive right to expand within market. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, the FCC does not accept applications for 
authority to operate a new cellular system in any unserved area in a 
market on a channel block during the five year build-out period.
    (b) Partitioned markets. During the five-year build-out period, the 
licensee of the first cellular system on each channel block in each 
market may enter into contracts with eligible parties, allowing such 
parties to apply by using FCC Form 601 for a new cellular system in that 
channel block within the market. The FCC may grant such applications if 
they are in compliance with the rules in this part. Markets with two or 
more authorized cellular systems on the same channel block during the 
five year build-out period are referred to (with respect to the affected 
channel block) as ``partitioned markets''.
    (1) Partitioning contracts must define the CGSA of the subsequent 
cellular system in accordance with Sec. 22.911, including any expansion 
rights ceded. If not exercised, any such expansion rights terminate at 
the end of the five year build-out period.
    (2) The five year build-out period begins on the date the initial 
authorization for the first cellular system is granted, and is not 
extended or affected in any way by the initial authorization of any 
subsequent cellular systems pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
    (c) System information update. Sixty days before the end of the five 
year build-out period, the licensee of each cellular system authorized 
on each channel block in each cellular market

[[Page 107]]

must file, in triplicate, a system information update (SIU), comprising 
a full size map, a reduced map, and an exhibit showing technical data 
relevant to determination of the system's CGSA. Separate maps must be 
submitted for each market into which the CGSA extends, showing the 
extension area in the adjacent market. Maps showing extension areas must 
be labeled (i.e. marked with the market number and channel block) for 
the market into which the CGSA extends. SIUs must accurately depict the 
relevant cell locations and coverage of the system at the end of the 
five year build-out period. SIUs must be filed at the Federal 
Communications Commission, Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, Mobility 
Division, 445 12th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20554. If any changes to 
the system occur after the filing of the SIU, but before the end of the 
five year build-out period, the licensee must file, in triplicate, 
additional maps and/or data as necessary to insure that the cell 
locations and coverage of the system as of the end of the five year 
build-out period are accurately depicted.
    (1) The scale of the full-size map must be 1:500,000, regardless of 
whether any different scale is used for the reduced map. The map must 
have a legend, a distance scale and correctly labeled latitude and 
longitude lines. The map must be clear and legible. The map must 
accurately show the cell sites (transmitting antenna locations) which 
determine the CGSA, the entire CGSA, any extension of the composite 
service are boundary beyond the CGSA (see Sec. 22.911) and the relevant 
portions of the cellular market boundary. The date on which the map 
depictions are accurate must appear on the map.
    (2) The reduced map must be a proportional reduction, to 8\1/2\x11 
inches, of the full-size map required in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, unless it proves to be impractical to depict the entire market 
by reducing the full-size map. In such instance, an 8\1/2\x11 inch map 
of a different scale may be substituted, provided that the required 
features of the full-size map are clearly depicted and labeled.

Sec. 22.948  Partitioning and Disaggregation.

    (a) Eligibility--(1) Generally. Parties seeking approval for 
partitioning and disaggregation shall request an authorization for 
partial assignment of a license pursuant to Sec. 1.948 of this chapter. 
Cellular licensees may partition or disaggregate their spectrum to other 
qualified entities.
    (2) Partitioning. During the five year build-out period, as defined 
in Sec. 22.947, cellular licensees may partition any portion of their 
cellular market to other qualified entities. After the five year build-
out period, cellular licensees and unserved area licensees may partition 
any portion of their Cellular Geographic Service Area (CGSA), as defined 
by Sec. 22.911, to other qualified entities but may not partition 
unserved portions of their cellular market.
    (3) Disaggregation. After the five year build-out period, as defined 
in Sec. 22.947, parties obtaining disaggregated spectrum may only use 
such spectrum in that portion of the cellular market encompassed by the 
original licensee's CGSA and may not use such spectrum to provide 
service to unserved portions of the cellular market.
    (b) Disaggregation. Cellular licensees and unserved area licensees 
may disaggregate spectrum in any amount.
    (c) Combined partitioning and disaggregation. The Commission will 
consider requests for partial assignment of cellular licenses that 
propose combinations of partitioning and disaggregation.
    (d) License Term. The license term for the partitioned license area 
and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original 
cellular licensee's or the unserved area licensee's license term.

<R05>
Sec. 22.949  Unserved area licensing process.

    This section sets forth the process for licensing unserved areas in 
cellular markets on channel blocks for which the five year build-out 
period has expired. This process has two phases: Phase I and Phase II. 
This section also sets forth the Phase II process applicable to 
applications to serve the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Zone.
    (a) Phase I. Phase I is a one-time process that provides an 
opportunity for eligible parties to file competing applications for 
authority to operate a new cellular system in or to expand an existing 
cellular system into unserved areas (Phase I initial applications) as 
soon as these areas become available. In addition, each licensee whose 
Phase I initial application is granted is afforded one opportunity 
during the Phase I process to file an application proposing major 
modifications to the cellular system authorized by that grant (a Phase I 
major modification application), without being subject to competing 
applications.
    (1) Phase I initial applications must be filed on the 31st day after 
the expiration of the five year build-out period of the authorized 
system(s) on the channel block requested in the market containing the 
unserved area.
    (i) Each Phase I application must request authorization for one and 
only one cellular geographic service area (CGSA) in one and only one 
cellular market.
    (ii) Applicants must not file more than one Phase I initial 
application for any cellular market.
    (iii) Phase I initial applications must not propose any de minimis 
or contract service area boundary (SAB) extensions.
    (2) Only one Phase I initial application is granted on each channel 
block in each market. Consequently, whenever two or more acceptable 
Phase I initial applications are timely filed in the same market on the 
same channel block, such Phase I initial applications are mutually 
exclusive, regardless of any other considerations such as the technical 
proposals. In order to determine which of such mutually exclusive Phase 
I initial applications to grant, the Commission administers competitive 
bidding procedures in accordance with subpart Q of part 1 of this 
chapter. After such procedures, the application of the winning bidder 
may be granted and the applications excluded by that grant may be 
dismissed without prejudice.

    Note: Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 22.949(a)(2), mutually 
exclusive Phase I initial applications that were filed between March 10, 
1993 and July 25, 1993, inclusive, are to be included in a random 
selection process, following which the selected application may be 
granted and the applications excluded by that grant may be dismissed 
without prejudice.

    (3) Phase I major modification applications (applications filed 
during Phase I that propose major modifications to cellular systems 
authorized by the grant of Phase I initial applications) must be filed 
no later than 90 days after the grant of the Phase I initial 
application. Each Phase I licensee may file only one Phase I major 
modification application. The FCC will not accept any competing 
applications in response to a Phase I major modification application. 
Phase I licensees may not sell to a third party any rights to apply for 
unserved area.
    (i) Phase I major modification applications may propose de minimis 
or contract SAB extensions; provided that a contract SAB extension into 
an adjacent market may be proposed only if, at the time the Phase I 
major modification application is filed, the licensee in the adjacent 
market (on the requested channel block) has the right to enter into such 
a contract (see Sec. 22.912(c)).
    (ii) Phase I major modification application may propose a CGSA that 
is not contiguous with the authorized or proposed CGSA, provided that 
the non-contiguous CGSA meets the minimum coverage requirement of Sec. 
22.951.
    (4) Phase I licensees may also file applications for or 
notifications of minor modifications to its system. However, such minor 
modifications may not reduce the size of the CGSA below the minimum 
coverage requirement of Sec. 22.951.
    (b) Phase II. Phase II is an on-going filing process that allows 
eligible parties to apply for any unserved areas

[[Page 109]]

that may remain in a market after the Phase I process is complete.
    (1) If a Phase I initial application is granted for a market and 
channel block, Phase II applications (applications for authority to 
operate a cellular system in any remaining unserved area) for that 
market and channel block may be filed on or after the 121st day after 
the Phase I application was granted. If no Phase I initial applications 
are granted for a market and channel block, Phase II applications for 
that market and channel block may be filed on or after the 31st day 
after the FCC dismissed the last pending Phase I application. If no 
Phase I initial applications are received for a market and channel 
block, Phase II applications for that market and channel block may be 
filed on or after the 32nd day after the expiration of the relevant 
five-year build-out period.
    (2) There is no limit to the number of Phase II applications that 
may be granted on each channel block in each market. Consequently, Phase 
II applications are mutually exclusive only if the proposed CGSAs would 
overlap. Mutually exclusive applications are processed using the general 
procedures in Sec. 22.131.
    (3) Phase II applications may propose a CGSA covering more than one 
cellular market. Each Phase II application must request authorization 
for one and only one CGSA. Phase II applications may propose de minimis 
and contract SAB extensions.
    (c) Settlements among some, but not all, applicants with mutually 
exclusive applications for unserved areas (partial settlements) are 
prohibited. Settlements among all applicants with mutually exclusive 
applications (full settlements) are allowed and must be filed no later 
than the date that the FCC Form 175 (short-form) is filed.
    (d) Limitations on amendments. Notwithstanding the provisions of 
Sec. 1.927 of this chapter, Phase I applications are subject to the 
following additional limitations in regard to the filing of amendments.
    (1) The Commission will not accept amendments (of any type) to 
mutually exclusive Phase I applications prior to the conclusion of the 
competitive bidding process.
    (2) The FCC will not accept major amendments to Phase I 
applications.
    (3) Minor amendments required by Sec. 1.65 of this chapter must be 
filed no later than thirty (30) days after public notice announcing the 
results of the competitive bidding process.

Sec. 22.950  Provision of service in the Gulf of Mexico Service Area (GMSA)

    The GMSA has been divided into two areas for licensing purposes, the 
Gulf of Mexico Exclusive Zone (GMEZ) and the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Zone 
(GMCZ). This section describes these areas and sets forth the process 
for licensing facilities in these two respective areas within the GMSA.
    (a) The GMEZ and GMCZ are defined as follows:
    (1) Gulf of Mexico Exclusive Zone. The geographical area within the 
Gulf of Mexico Service Area that lies between the coastline line and the 
southern demarcation line of the Gulf of Mexico Service Area, excluding 
the area comprising the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Zone.
    (2) Gulf of Mexico Coastal Zone. The geographical area within the 
Gulf of Mexico Service Area that lies between the coast line of Florida 
and a line extending approximately twelve nautical miles due south from 
the coastline boundary of the States of Florida and Alabama, and 
continuing along the west coast of Florida at a distance of twelve 
nautical miles from the shoreline. The line is defined by Great Circle 
arcs connecting the following points (geographical coordinates listed as 
North Latitude, West Longitude) consecutively in the order listed:
(i) 30[deg]16[min]49[sec] N 87[deg]31[min]06[sec] W
(ii) 30[deg]04[min]35[sec] N 87[deg]31[min]06[sec] W
(iii) 30[deg]10[min]56[sec] N 86[deg]26[min]53[sec] W
(iv) 30[deg]03[min]00[sec] N 86[deg]00[min]29[sec] W
(v) 29[deg]33[min]00[sec] N 85[deg]32[min]49[sec] W
(vi) 29[deg]23[min]21[sec] N 85[deg]02[min]06[sec] W
(vii) 29[deg]49[min]44[sec] N 83[deg]59[min]02[sec] W
(viii) 28[deg]54[min]00[sec] N 83[deg]05[min]33[sec] W
(ix) 28[deg]34[min]41[sec] N 82[deg]53[min]38[sec] W
(x) 27[deg]50[min]39[sec] N 83[deg]04[min]27[sec] W

[[Page 110]]

(xi) 26[deg]24[min]22[sec] N 82[deg]23[min]22[sec] W
(xii) 25[deg]41[min]39[sec] N 81[deg]49[min]40[sec] W
(xiii) 24[deg]59[min]02[sec] N 81[deg]15[min]04[sec] W
(xiv) 24[deg]44[min]23[sec] N 81[deg]57[min]04[sec] W
(xv) 24[deg]32[min]37[sec] N 82[deg]02[min]01[sec] W
    (b) Service Area Boundary Calculation. The service area boundary of 
a cell site located within the Gulf of Mexico Service Area is calculated 
pursuant to Sec. 22.911(a)(2). Otherwise, the service area boundary is 
calculated pursuant to Sec. Sec. 22.911(a)(1) or 22.911(b).
    (c) Operation within the Gulf of Mexico Exclusive Zone (GMEZ). GMEZ 
licensees have exclusive right to provide service in the GMEZ, and may 
add, modify, or remove facilities anywhere within the GMEZ without prior 
Commission approval. There is no five-year buildout period for GMEZ 
licensees, no requirement to file system information update maps 
pursuant to Sec. 22.947, and no unserved area licensing procedure for 
the GMEZ.
    (d) Operation within the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Zone (GMCZ). The 
GMCZ is subject to the Phase II unserved area licensing procedures set 
forth in Sec. 22.949(b).

Sec. 22.951  Minimum coverage requirement.

    Applications for authority to operate a new cellular system in an 
unserved area, other than those filed by the licensee of an existing 
system that abuts the unserved area, must propose a contiguous cellular 
geographical service area (CGSA) of at least 130 square kilometers (50 
square miles). Area within contract SAB extensions counts toward the 
minimum coverage requirement. However, area within de minimis SAB 
extensions does not count toward the minimum coverage requirement. 
Applications for authority to operate a new cellular system in an 
unserved area, other than those filed by the licensee of an existing 
system that abuts the unserved area, must not propose coverage of water 
areas only (or water areas and uninhabited islands or reefs only), 
except for unserved areas in the Gulf of Mexico MSA.


<R05>
Sec. 22.953  Content and form of applications.

    Applications for authority to operate a cellular system in an 
unserved area must comply with the specifications in this section.
    (a) Applications for authority to operate a cellular system in an 
unserved area must include the following information in addition to the 
requirements specified in Sec. Sec. 1.919, 1.923 and 1.924. The 
following exhibits must be set off by tabs and numbered as follows:
    (1) Exhibit I--full-size map. The scale of the full-size map must be 
1:500,000, regardless of whether any different scale is used for the 
reduced map required in Exhibit II. The map must have a legend, a 
distance scale and correctly labeled latitude and longitude lines. The 
map must be clear and legible. The map must accurately show the cell 
sites (transmitting antenna locations), the entire CGSA, any extension 
of the composite service area boundary beyond the CGSA (see Sec. 
22.911) and the relevant portions of the cellular market boundary.
    (2) Exhibit II--reduced map. This map must be a proportional 
reduction, to 8\1/2\ x 11 inches, of the full-size map required for 
Exhibit I, unless it proves to be impractical to depict the entire 
cellular market by reducing the full-size map. In such instance, an 8\1/
2\x11 inch map of a different scale may be substituted, provided that 
the required features of the full-size map are clearly depicted and 
labeled.

Sec. 22.970  Unacceptable interference to part 90 non-cellular 800 MHz

licensees from cellular radiotelephone or part 90-800 MHz cellular systems.

    (a) Definition. Except as provided in 47 CFR 90.617(k), unacceptable 
interference to non-cellular part 90 licensees in the 800 MHz band from 
cellular radiotelephone or part 90-800 MHz cellular systems will be 
deemed to occur when the below conditions are met:
    (1) A transceiver at a site at which interference is encountered:
    (i) Is in good repair and operating condition, and is receiving:
    (A) A median desired signal of -104 dBm or higher, as measured at 
the R.F. input of the receiver of a mobile unit; or
    (B) A median desired signal of -101 dBm or higher, as measured at 
the R.F. input of the receiver of a portable i.e. hand-held unit; and, 
either
    (ii) Is a voice transceiver:
    (A) With manufacturer published performance specifications for the 
receiver section of the transceiver equal to, or exceeding, the minimum 
standards set out in paragraph (b) of this section, below; and;
    (B) Receiving an undesired signal or signals which cause the 
measured Carrier to Noise plus interference (C/(I+N)) ratio of the 
receiver section of said transceiver to be less than 20 dB, or,
    (iii) Is a non-voice transceiver receiving an undesired signal or 
signals which cause the measured bit error rate (BER) (or some 
comparable specification) of the receiver section of said transceiver to 
be more than the value reasonably designated by the manufacturer.
    (2) Provided, however, that if the receiver section of the mobile or 
portable voice transceiver does not conform to the standards set out in 
paragraph (b) of this section, then that transceiver shall be deemed 
subject to unacceptable interference only at sites where the median 
desired signal satisfies the applicable threshold measured signal power 
in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section after an upward adjustment to 
account for the difference in receiver section performance. The upward 
adjustment shall be equal to the increase in the desired signal required 
to restore the receiver section of the subject transceiver to the 20 dB 
C/(I+N) ratio of paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. The adjusted 
threshold levels shall then define the minimum measured signal power(s) 
in lieu of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) of this section at which the licensee 
using such non-compliant transceiver is entitled to interference 
protection.
    (b) Minimum receiver requirements. Voice transceivers capable of 
operating in the 806-824 MHz portion of the 800 MHz band shall have the 
following minimum performance specifications in order for the system in 
which such transceivers are used to claim entitlement to full protection 
against unacceptable interference (See paragraph (a) (2) of this 
section).
    (1) Voice units intended for mobile use: 75 dB intermodulation 
rejection ratio; 75 dB adjacent channel rejection ratio; -116 dBm 
reference sensitivity.
    (2) Voice units intended for portable use: 70 dB intermodulation 
rejection

[[Page 113]]

ratio; 70 dB adjacent channel rejection ratio; -116 dBm reference 
sensitivity.

Sec. 22.971  Obligation to abate unacceptable interference.

    (a) Strict Responsibility. Any licensee who, knowingly or 
unknowingly, directly or indirectly, causes or contributes to causing 
unacceptable interference to a non-cellular part 90 of this chapter 
licensee in the 800 MHz band, as defined in Sec. 22.970, shall be 
strictly accountable to abate the interference, with full cooperation 
and utmost diligence, in the shortest time practicable. Interfering 
licensees shall consider all feasible interference abatement measures, 
including, but not limited to, the remedies specified in the 
interference resolution procedures set forth in Sec. 22.972(c). This 
strict responsibility obligation applies to all forms of interference, 
including out-of-band emissions and intermodulation.
    (b) Joint and several responsibility. If two or more licensees 
knowingly or unknowingly, directly or indirectly, cause or contribute to 
causing unacceptable interference to a non-cellular part 90 of this 
chapter licensee in the 800 MHz band, as defined in Sec. 22.970, such 
licensees shall be jointly and severally responsible for abating 
interference, with full cooperation and utmost diligence, in the 
shortest practicable time.
    (1) This joint and several responsibility rule requires interfering 
licensees to consider all feasible interference abatement measures, 
including, but not limited to, the remedies specified in the 
interference resolution procedures set forth in Sec. 22.972(c). This 
joint and several responsibility rule applies to all forms of 
interference, including out-of-band emissions and intermodulation.
    (2) Any licensee that can show that its signal does not directly or 
indirectly, cause or contribute to causing unacceptable interference to 
a non-cellular part 90 of this chapter licensee in the 800 MHz band, as 
defined in this chapter, shall not be held responsible for resolving 
unacceptable interference. Notwithstanding, any licensee that receives 
an interference complaint from a public safety/CII licensee shall 
respond to such complaint consistent with the interference resolution 
procedures set forth in this chapter.

[69 FR 67834, Nov. 22, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 76707, Dec. 28, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 22.972  Interference resolution procedures.

    (a) Initial notification. (1) Cellular Radiotelephone licensees may 
receive initial notification of interference from non-cellular part 90 
of this chapter licensees in the 800 MHz band pursuant to Sec. 
90.674(a) of this chapter.
    (2) Cellular Radiotelephone licensees, in conjunction with part 90 
ESMR licensees, shall establish an electronic means of receiving the 
initial notification described in Sec. 90.674(a) of this chapter. The 
electronic system must be designed so that all appropriate Cellular 
Radiotelephone licensees and part 90 ESMR licensees can be contacted 
about the interference incident with a single notification. The 
electronic system for receipt of initial notification of interference 
complaints must be operating no later than February 22, 2005.
    (3) Cellular Radiotelephone licensees must respond to the initial 
notification described in Sec. 90.674(a) of this chapter, as soon as 
possible and no later than 24 hours after receipt of notification from a 
part 90 public safety/CII licensee. This response time may be extended 
to 48 hours after receipt from other part 90 non-cellular licensees 
provided affected communications on these systems are not safety 
related.
    (b) Interference analysis. Cellular Radiotelephone licensees--who 
receive an initial notification described in Sec. 90.674(a) of this 
chapter--shall perform a timely analysis of the interference to identify 
the possible source. Immediate on-site visits may be conducted when 
necessary to complete timely analysis. Interference analysis must be 
completed and corrective action initiated within 48 hours of the initial 
complaint from a part 90 of this chapter public safety/CII licensee. 
This response time may be extended to 96 hours after the initial 
complaint from other part 90 of this chapter non-cellular licensees 
provided affected communications on these systems are not safety 
related. Corrective action may

[[Page 114]]

be delayed if the affected licensee agrees in writing (which may be, but 
is not required to be, recorded via e-mail or other electronic means) to 
a longer period.
    (c) Mitigation steps. (1) All Cellular Radiotelephone and part 90 of 
this chapter--800 MHz cellular system licensees who are responsible for 
causing unacceptable interference shall take all affirmative measures to 
resolve such interference. Cellular Radiotelephone licensees found to 
contribute to unacceptable interference, as defined in Sec. 22.970, 
shall resolve such interference in the shortest time practicable. 
Cellular Radiotelephone licensees and part 90 of this chapter--800 MHz 
cellular system licensees must provide all necessary test apparatus and 
technical personnel skilled in the operation of such equipment as may be 
necessary to determine the most appropriate means of timely eliminating 
the interference. However, the means whereby interference is abated or 
the cell parameters that may need to be adjusted is left to the 
discretion of the Cellular Radiotelephone and/or part 90 of this 
chapter--800 MHz cellular system licensees, whose affirmative measures 
may include, but not be limited to, the following techniques:
    (i) Increasing the desired power of the public safety/CII signal;
    (ii) Decreasing the power of the part 90 ESMR and/or Cellular 
Radiotelephone system signal;
    (iii) Modifying the part 90 ESMR and/or Cellular Radiotelephone 
system antenna height;
    (iv) Modifying the part 90 ESMR and/or Cellular Radiotelephone 
system antenna characteristics;
    (v) Incorporating filters into part 90 ESMR and/or Cellular 
Radiotelephone transmission equipment;
    (vi) Permanently changing part 90 ESMR and/or Cellular 
Radiotelephone frequencies; and
    (vii) Supplying interference-resistant receivers to the affected 
public safety/CII licensee(s). If this technique is used, in all 
circumstances, Cellular Radiotelephone and/or part 90 of this chapter 
ESMR licensees shall be responsible for all costs thereof.
    (2) Whenever short-term interference abatement measures prove 
inadequate, the affected part 90 of this chapter non-cellular licensee 
shall, consistent with but not compromising safety, make all necessary 
concessions to accepting interference until a longer-term remedy can be 
implemented.
    (3) Discontinuing operations when clear imminent danger exists. When 
a part 90 of this chapter public safety licensee determines that a 
continuing presence of interference constitutes a clear and imminent 
danger to life or property, the licensee causing the interference must 
discontinue the associated operation immediately, until a remedy can be 
identified and applied. The determination that a continuing presence 
exists that constitutes a clear and imminent danger to life or property, 
must be made by written statement that:
    (i) Is in the form of a declaration, notarized affidavit, or 
statement under penalty or perjury, from an officer or executive of the 
affected public safety licensee;
    (ii) Thoroughly describes the basis of the claim of clear and 
imminent danger;
    (iii) Was formulated on the basis of either personal knowledge or 
belief after due diligence;
    (iv) Is not proffered by a contractor or other third party; and
    (v) Has been approved by the Chief of the Public Safety and Homeland 
Security Bureau or other designated Commission official. Prior to the 
authorized official making a determination that a clear and imminent 
danger exists, the associated written statement must be served by hand-
delivery or receipted fax on the applicable offending licensee, with a 
copy transmitted by the fastest available means to the Washington, DC 
office of the Commission's Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau.

<R05>
Sec. 22.973  Information exchange.

    (a) Prior notification. Public safety/CII licensees may notify a 
part 90 ESMR or cellular radiotelephone licensee that they wish to 
receive prior notification of the activation or modification of part 90 
ESMR or cellular radiotelephone cell sites in their area.

[[Page 115]]

Thereafter, the part 90 ESMR or cellular radiotelephone licensee must 
provide the following information to the public safety/CII licensee at 
least 10 business days before a new cell site is activated or an 
existing cell site is modified:
    (1) Location;
    (2) Effective radiated power;
    (3) Antenna height;
    (4) Channels available for use.
    (b) Purpose of prior notification. The prior coordination of cell 
sites is for informational purposes only. Public safety/CII licensees 
are not afforded the right to accept or reject the activation of a 
proposed cell or to unilaterally require changes in its operating 
parameters. The principal purposes of notification are to:
    (1) Allow a public safety licensee to advise the part 90 of this 
chapter ESMR or Cellular Radiotelephone licensee whether it believes a 
proposed cell will generate unacceptable interference;
    (2) Permit Cellular Radiotelephone or part 90 of this chapter ESMR 
licensees to make voluntary changes in cell parameters when a public 
safety licensee alerts them to possible interference; and
    (3) Rapidly identify the source if interference is encountered when 
the cell is activated.

    (8) Interstitial channels. Interstitial channels are those with 
center frequencies offset by <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>12.5 kHz from the 
listed center frequencies. The FCC may assign interstitial channels to 
offshore stations in Zone A subject to the following conditions:
    (i) Offshore stations transmitting on interstitial channels must be 
located east of W.92[deg] longitude.
    (ii) Operations on interstitial channels are considered to be 
secondary to operations on channels with the listed center frequencies.
    (iii) Offshore stations operating on interstitial channels must be 
used only for voice grade general communications or to provide for 
private line service.

    Note to paragraph (a) of Sec. 22.1007: These channels are contained 
in UHF TV Channel 17.

    (b) Zone B--Southern Louisiana--Texas. (1) The geographical area in 
Zone B is bounded as follows:

    From longitude W.87[deg]45[min] on the East to longitude 
W.95[deg]00[min] on the West and from the 4.8 kilometer (3 mile) limit 
along the Gulf of Mexico shoreline on the North to the limit of the 
Outer Continental Shelf on the South.

    (2) These channels may be assigned for use by offshore central 
(base/fixed) or subscriber stations (fixed, temporary fixed, surface 
and/or airborne mobile) as indicated, for voice-grade general 
communications and private line service:

<R05>
Sec. 22.1009  Transmitter locations.

    The rules in this section establish limitations on the locations 
from which stations in the Offshore Radiotelephone Service may transmit.
    (a) All stations. Offshore stations must not transmit from locations 
outside the boundaries of the appropriate zones specified in Sec. 
22.1007. Offshore stations must not transmit from locations within 241 
kilometers (150 miles) of any full-service television station that 
transmits on the TV channel containing the channel on which the offshore 
station transmits.
    (b) Airborne subscriber stations. Airborne subscriber stations must 
not transmit from altitudes exceeding 305 meters (1000 feet) above mean 
sea level. Airborne mobile stations in Zone A must not transmit from 
locations within 129 kilometers (80 miles) of Lake Charles, Louisiana. 
Airborne mobile stations in Zone B must not transmit from locations 
within 129 kilometers (80 miles) of Lafayette, Louisiana. Airborne 
mobile stations in Zone C must not transmit from locations within 129 
kilometers (80 miles) of Corpus Christi or locations within 129 
kilometers (80 miles) of Houston, Texas.


<R05>
Sec. 22.1011  Antenna height limitations.

    The antenna height of offshore stations must not exceed 61 meters 
(200 feet) above mean sea level. The antenna height of offshore surface 
mobile stations must not exceed 10 meters (30 feet) above the waterline.


<R05>
Sec. 22.1013  Effective radiated power limitations.

    The effective radiated power (ERP) of transmitters in the Offshore 
Radiotelephone Service must not exceed the limits in this section.
    (a) Maximum power. The ERP of transmitters in this service must not 
exceed 1000 Watts under any circumstances.
    (b) Mobile transmitters. The ERP of mobile transmitters must not 
exceed 100 Watts. The ERP of mobile transmitters, when located within 32 
kilometers (20 miles) of the 4.8 kilometer (3 mile) limit, must not 
exceed 25 Watts. The ERP of airborne mobile stations must not exceed 1 
Watt.
    (c) Protection for TV Reception. The ERP limitations in this 
paragraph are intended to reduce the likelihood that interference to 
television reception from offshore radiotelephone operations will occur.
    (1) Co-channel protection. The ERP of offshore stations must not 
exceed the limits in Table I-1 of this section. The limits depend upon 
the height above mean sea level of the offshore transmitting antenna and 
the distance between the antenna location of the offshore transmitter 
and the antenna location of the main transmitter of the nearest full-
service television station that transmits on the TV channel containing 
the channel on which the offshore station transmits.
    (2) Adjacent channel protection. The ERP of offshore stations 
located within 128.8 kilometers (80 miles) of the main transmitter 
antenna of a full service TV station that transmits on a TV channel 
adjacent to the TV channel which contains the channel on which the 
offshore station transmits must not exceed the limits in the Table I-2 
of Sec. 22.1015. The limits depend upon the height above mean sea level 
of the offshore transmitting antenna and the distance between the 
location of the offshore transmitter and the 4.8 kilometer (3 mile) 
limit.

antenna height above mean sea level.
    (b) Average terrain elevation shall be calculated using elevation 
data from a 30 arc second or better Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). DEM 
data is available from United States Geological Survey (USGS). The data 
file shall be identified. If 30 arc second data is used, the elevation 
data must be processed for intermediate points using interpolation 
techniques; otherwise, the nearest point may be used. If DEM data is not 
available, elevation data from the Defense Mapping Agency's Digital 
Chart of the World (DCW) may be used.
    (c) Radial average terrain elevation is calculated as the average of 
the elevation along a straight line path from 3 to 16 kilometers 
extending radially from the antenna site. At least 50 evenly spaced data 
points for each radial shall be used in the computation.
    (d) Average terrain elevation is the average of the eight radial 
average terrain elevations (for the eight cardinal radials).
    (e) The position location of the antenna site shall be determined to 
an accuracy of no less than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 meters in both the 
horizontal (latitude and longitude) and vertical (ground elevation) 
dimensions with respect to the National Geodetic Reference System.

antenna structure owners are responsible for registering antenna 
structures with the FCC if required by part 17 of this chapter, and for 
installing and maintaining any required marking and lighting. However, 
in the event of default of this responsibility by an antenna structure 
owner, each FCC permittee or licensee authorized to use an affected 
antenna structure will be held responsible by the FCC for ensuring that 
the antenna structure continues to meet the requirements of part 17 of 
this chapter. See Sec. 17.6 of this chapter.
    (a) Marking and lighting. Antenna structures must be marked, lighted 
and maintained in accordance with part 17 of this chapter and all 
applicable rules and requirements of the Federal Aviation 
Administration.
    (b) Maintenance contracts. Antenna structure owners (or licensees 
and permittees, in the event of default by an antenna structure owner) 
may enter into contracts with other entities to monitor and carry out 
necessary maintenance of antenna structures. Antenna structure owners 
(or licensees and permittees, in the event of default by an antenna 
structure owner) that make such contractual arrangements continue to be 
responsible for the maintenance of antenna structures in regard to air 
navigation safety.

Sec. 24.103  Construction requirements.

    (a) Nationwide narrowband PCS licensees shall construct base 
stations that provide coverage to a composite area of 750,000 square 
kilometers or serve 37.5 percent of the U.S. population within five 
years of initial license grant date; and, shall construct base stations 
that provide coverage to a composite area of 1,500,000 square kilometers 
or serve 75 percent of the U.S. population within ten years of initial 
license grant date. Licensees may, in the alternative, provide 
substantial service to the licensed area as provided in paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (b) Regional narrowband PCS licensees shall construct base stations 
that provide coverage to a composite area of 150,000 square kilometers 
or serve 37.5 percent of the population of the service area within five 
years of initial license grant date; and, shall construct base stations 
that provide coverage to a composite area of 300,000 square kilometers 
or serve 75 percent of the service area population within ten years of 
initial license grant date. Licensees may, in the alternative, provide 
substantial service to the licensed area as provided in paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (c) MTA narrowband PCS licensees shall construct base stations that 
provide coverage to a composite area of 75,000 square kilometers or 25 
percent of the geographic area, or serve 37.5 percent of the population 
of the service area within five years of initial license grant date; 
and, shall construct base

[[Page 126]]

stations that provide coverage to a composite area of 150,000 square 
kilometers or 50 percent of the geographic area, or serve 75 percent of 
the population of the service area within ten years of initial license 
grant date. Licensees may, in the alternative, provide substantial 
service to the licensed area as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (d) As an alternative to the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), 
and (c) of this section, narrowband PCS licensees may demonstrate that, 
no later than ten years after the initial grant of their license, they 
provide substantial service to their licensed area. Licensees choosing 
this option must notify the FCC by filing FCC Form 601, no later than 15 
days after the end of the five year period following the initial grant 
of their license, that they plan to satisfy the alternative requirement 
to provide substantial service. ``Substantial service'' is defined as 
service that is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of 
mediocre service that would barely warrant renewal.
    (e) In demonstrating compliance with the construction requirements 
set forth in this section, licensees must base their calculations on 
signal field strengths that ensure reliable service for the technology 
utilized. Licensees may determine the population of geographic areas 
included within their service contours using either the 1990 census or 
the 2000 census, but not both.
    (1) For the purpose of this section, the service radius of a base 
station may be calculated using the following formula:

d<INF>km</INF> = 2.53 x h<INF>m</INF>0.34 x p\0.17\

where d<INF>km</INF> is the radial distance in kilometers,
h<INF>m</INF> is the antenna HAAT of the base station in meters, and
p is the e.r.p. of the base station in watts.

    (2) Alternatively, licensees may use any service radius contour 
formula developed or generally used by industry, provided that such 
formula is based on the technical characteristics of their system.
    (f) Upon meeting the five and ten year benchmarks in paragraphs (a), 
(b), and (c) of this section, or upon meeting the substantial service 
alternative in paragraph (d), licensees shall notify the Commission by 
filing FCC Form 601 and including a map and other supporting 
documentation that demonstrate the required geographic area coverage, 
population coverage, or substantial service to the licensed area. The 
notification must be filed with the Commission within 15 days of the 
expiration of the relevant period.
    (g) If the sale of a license is approved, the new licensee is held 
to the original build-out requirement.
    (h) Failure by a licensee to meet the above construction 
requirements shall result in forfeiture of the license and ineligibility 
to regain it.

Sec. 24.104  Partitioning and disaggregation.

    Nationwide, regional, and MTA licensees may apply to partition their 
authorized geographic service area or disaggregate their authorized 
spectrum at any time following grant of their geographic area 
authorizations.
    (a) Application required. Parties seeking approval for partitioning 
and/or disaggregation shall apply for partial assignment of a license 
pursuant to Sec. 1.948 of this chapter.
    (b) Partitioning. In the case of partitioning, applicants and 
licensees must file FCC Form 603 pursuant to Sec. 1.948 of this chapter 
and describe the partitioned service area on a schedule to the 
application. The partitioned service area shall be defined by up to 120 
sets of geographic coordinates at points at every 3 degrees azimuth from 
a point within the partitioned service area along the partitioned 
service area boundary unless either an FCC-recognized service area is 
used (e.g., MEA or EA) or county lines are followed. The geographical 
coordinates must be specified in degrees, minutes, and seconds to the 
nearest second latitude and longitude, and must be based upon the 1983 
North American Datum (NAD83). In the case where FCC-recognized service 
areas or county lines are used, applicants need only list the specific 
area(s) through use of FCC designations or county names that constitute 
the partitioned area.

[[Page 127]]

    (c) Disaggregation. Spectrum may be disaggregated in any amount.
    (d) Combined partitioning and disaggregation. Licensees may apply 
for partial assignment of authorizations that propose combinations of 
partitioning and disaggregation.
    (e) License term. The license term for a partitioned license area 
and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original 
licensee's license term as provided for in Sec. 1.955 of this chapter.
    (f) Coverage requirements for partitioning. (1) Parties to a 
partitioning agreement must satisfy at least one of the following 
requirements:
    (i) The partitionee must satisfy the applicable coverage 
requirements set forth in Sec. 24.103 for the partitioned license area; 
or
    (ii) The original licensee must meet the coverage requirements set 
forth in Sec. 24.103 for the entire geographic area. In this case, the 
partitionee must meet only the requirements for renewal of its 
authorization for the partitioned license area.
    (2) Parties seeking authority to partition must submit with their 
partial assignment application a certification signed by both parties 
stating which of the options they select.
    (3) Partitionees must submit supporting documents showing compliance 
with their coverage requirements as set forth in Sec. 24.103.
    (4) Failure by any partitionee to meet its coverage requirements 
will result in automatic cancellation of the partitioned authorization 
without further Commission action.
    (g) Coverage requirements for disaggregation. (1) Parties to a 
disaggregation agreement must satisfy at least one of the following 
requirements:
    (i) Either the disaggregator or disaggregatee must satisfy the 
coverage requirements set forth in Sec. 24.103 for the entire license 
area; or
    (ii) Parties must agree to share responsibility for meeting the 
coverage requirements set forth in Sec. 24.103 for the entire license 
area.
    (2) Parties seeking authority to disaggregate must submit with their 
partial assignment application a certification signed by both parties 
stating which of the requirements they select.
    (3) Disaggregatees must submit supporting documents showing 
compliance with their coverage requirements as set forth in Sec. 
24.103.
    (4) Parties that accept responsibility for meeting the coverage 
requirements and later fail to do so will be subject to automatic 
license cancellation without further Commission action.

Sec. 24.203  Construction requirements.

    (a) Licensees of 30 MHz blocks must serve with a signal level 
sufficient to provide adequate service to at least one-third of the 
population in their licensed area within five years of being licensed 
and two-thirds of the population in their licensed area within ten years 
of being licensed. Licensees may, in the alternative, provide 
substantial service to their licensed area within the appropriate five- 
and ten-year benchmarks. Licensees may choose to define population using 
the 1990 census or the 2000 census. Failure by any licensee to meet 
these requirements will result in forfeiture or non-renewal of the 
license and the licensee will be ineligible to regain it.
    (b) Licensees of 10 MHz blocks except for the 1910-1915 MHz and 
1990-1995 MHz, including 10 MHz C block licenses reconfigured pursuant 
to Amendment of the Commission's Rules Regarding Installment Payment 
Financing for Personal Communications Services (PCS) Licensees, WT 
Docket No. 97-82, Sixth Report and Order, FCC 00-313, and 15 MHz blocks 
resulting from the disaggregation option as provided in the Commission's 
Rules Regarding Installment Payment Financing for Personal 
Communications Services (PCS) Licensees, Second Report and Order and 
Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making, WT Docket 97-82, 12 FCC Rcd 
16436 (1997), as modified by Order on Reconsideration of the Second 
Report and Order, WT Docket 97-82, 13 FCC Rcd 8345 (1998), must serve 
with a signal level sufficient to provide adequate

[[Page 131]]

service to at least one-quarter of the population in their licensed area 
within five years of being licensed, or make a showing of substantial 
service in their licensed area within five years of being licensed. 
Population is defined as the 1990 population census. Licensees may elect 
to use the 2000 population census to determine the five-year 
construction requirement. Failure by any licensee to meet these 
requirements will result in forfeiture of the license and the licensee 
will be ineligible to regain it.
    (c) Licensees must file maps and other supporting documents showing 
compliance with the respective construction requirements within the 
appropriate five- and ten-year benchmarks of the date of their initial 
licenses.
    (d) Licensees in the paired 1910-1915 MHz and 1990-1995 MHz bands 
must make a showing of ``substantial service'' in their license area 
within ten years of the date of initial license issuance or renewal. 
``Substantial service'' is defined as service which is sound, favorable, 
and substantially above a level of mediocre service which just might 
minimally warrant renewal. Failure by any licensee to meet this 
requirement will result in forfeiture of the license and the licensee 
will be ineligible to regain it.

    (c) Mobile and portable stations are limited to 2 watts EIRP and the 
equipment must employ a means for limiting power to the minimum 
necessary for successful communications.
    (d) Power measurements for transmissions by stations authorized 
under this section may be made either in accordance with a Commission-
approved average power technique or in compliance with paragraph (e) of 
this section. In both instances, equipment employed must be authorized 
in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 24.51. In measuring 
transmissions in this band using an average power technique, the peak-
to-average ratio (PAR) of the transmission may not exceed 13 dB.
    (e) Peak transmit power must be measured over any interval of 
continuous transmission using instrumentation calibrated in terms of an 
rms-equivalent voltage. The measurement results shall be properly 
adjusted for any instrument limitations, such as detector response 
times, limited resolution bandwidth capability when compared to the 
emission bandwidth, sensitivity, etc., so as to obtain a true peak 
measurement for the emission in question over the full bandwidth of the 
channel.

Sec. 24.237  Interference protection.

    (a) All licensees are required to coordinate their frequency usage 
with the co-channel or adjacent channel incumbent fixed microwave 
licensees in the 1850-1990 MHz band. Coordination must occur before 
initiating operations from any base station. Problems that arise during 
the coordination process are to be resolved by the parties to the 
coordination. Licensees are required to coordinate with all users 
possibly affected, as determined by appendix I to this subpart E 
(Appendix E of the Memorandum Opinion and Order, GEN Docket No. 90-314, 
FCC 94-144; TIA Telecommunications Systems Bulletin 10-F, ``Interference 
Criteria for Microwave Systems,'' May 1994, (TSB10-F)); or an 
alternative method agreed to by the parties.
    (b) The results of the coordination process need to be reported to 
the Commission only if the parties fail to agree. Because broadband PCS 
licensees are required to protect fixed microwave licensees in the 1850-
1990 MHz band, the Commission will be involved in the coordination 
process only upon complaint of interference from a fixed microwave 
licensee. In such a case, the Commission will resolve the issues.
    (c) In all other respects, coordination procedures are to follow the 
requirements of Sec. 101.103(d) of this chapter to the extent that 
these requirements are not inconsistent with those specified in this 
part.
    (d) The licensee must perform an engineering analysis to assure that 
the proposed facilities will not cause interference to existing OFS 
stations within the coordination distance specified in Table 3 of a 
magnitude greater than that specified in the criteria set forth in 
paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, unless there is prior agreement 
with the affected OFS licensee. Interference calculations shall be based 
on the sum of the power received at the terminals of each microwave 
receiver from all of the applicant's current and proposed PCS 
operations.

<R05>
Sec. 24.238  Emission limitations for Broadband PCS equipment.

    The rules in this section govern the spectral characteristics of 
emissions in the Broadband Personal Communications Service.
    (a) Out of band emissions. The power of any emission outside of the 
authorized operating frequency ranges must be attenuated below the 
transmitting power (P) by a factor of at least 43 + 10 log(P) dB.
    (b) Measurement procedure. Compliance with these rules is based on 
the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth 
of 1 MHz or greater. However, in the 1 MHz bands immediately outside and 
adjacent to the frequency block a resolution bandwidth of at least one 
percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the 
transmitter may be employed. A narrower resolution bandwidth is 
permitted in all cases to improve measurement accuracy provided the 
measured power is integrated over the full required measurement 
bandwidth (i.e. 1 MHz or 1 percent of emission bandwidth, as specified). 
The emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal between two 
points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above the carrier 
center frequency, outside of which all emissions are attenuated at least 
26 dB below the transmitter power.
    (c) Alternative out of band emission limit. Licensees in this 
service may establish an alternative out of band emission limit to be 
used at specified band edge(s) in specified geographical areas, in lieu 
of that set forth in this section, pursuant to a private contractual 
arrangement of all affected licensees and applicants. In this event, 
each party to such contract shall maintain a copy of the contract in 
their station files and disclose it to prospective assignees or 
transferees and, upon request, to the FCC.
    (d) Interference caused by out of band emissions. If any emission 
from a transmitter operating in this service results in interference to 
users of another radio service, the FCC may require a greater 
attenuation of that emission than specified in this section.

   Policies Governing Microwave Relocation From the 1850-1990 MHz Band


<R05>
Sec. 24.239  Cost-sharing requirements for broadband PCS.

    Frequencies in the 1850-1990 MHz band listed in Sec. 101.147(c) of 
this chapter have been allocated for use by PCS. In accordance with 
procedures specified in Sec. Sec. 101.69 through 101.81 of this 
chapter, PCS entities (both licensed and unlicensed) are required to 
relocate the existing Fixed Microwave Services (FMS) licensees in these 
bands if interference to the existing FMS operations would occur. All 
PCS entities who benefit from spectrum clearance by other PCS entities 
or a voluntarily relocating

[[Page 135]]

microwave incumbent, must contribute to such relocation costs. PCS 
entities may satisfy this requirement by entering into private cost-
sharing agreements or agreeing to terms other than those specified in 
Sec. 24.243. However, PCS entities are required to reimburse other PCS 
entities or voluntarily relocating microwave incumbents that incur 
relocation costs and are not parties to the alternative agreement. In 
addition, parties to a private cost-sharing agreement may seek 
reimbursement through the clearinghouse (as discussed in Sec. 24.241) 
from PCS entities that are not parties to the agreement. The cost-
sharing plan is in effect during all phases of microwave relocation 
specified in Sec. 101.69 of this chapter. If a licensee in the 
Broadband PCS Service enters into a spectrum leasing arrangement (as set 
forth in part 1, subpart X of this chapter) and the spectrum lessee 
triggers a cost-sharing obligation, the licensee is the PCS entity

Sec. 24.241  Administration of the Cost-Sharing Plan.

    The Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, under delegated authority, 
will select an entity to operate as a neutral, not-for-profit 
clearinghouse. This clearinghouse will administer the cost-sharing plan 
by, inter alia, maintaining all of the cost and payment records related 
to the relocation of each link and determining the cost-sharing 
obligation of subsequent PCS entities. The cost-sharing rules will not 
take effect until an administrator is selected.

Sec. 24.243  The cost-sharing formula.

    A PCS relocator who relocates an interfering microwave link, i.e. 
one that is in all or part of its market area and in all or part of its 
frequency band or a voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent, is 
entitled to pro rata reimbursement based on the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12JN96.001

    (a) RN equals the amount of reimbursement.
    (b) C equals the actual cost of relocating the link. Actual 
relocation costs include, but are not limited to, such items as: Radio 
terminal equipment (TX and/or RX--antenna, necessary feed lines, MUX/
Modems); towers and/or modifications; back-up power equipment; 
monitoring or control equipment; engineering costs (design/path survey); 
installation; systems testing; FCC filing costs; site acquisition and 
civil works; zoning costs; training; disposal of old equipment; test 
equipment (vendor required); spare equipment; project management; prior 
coordination notification under Sec. 101.103(d) of this chapter; site 
lease renegotiation; required antenna upgrades for interference control; 
power plant upgrade (if required); electrical grounding systems; Heating 
Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) (if required); alternate 
transport equipment; and leased facilities. C also includes voluntarily 
relocating microwave incumbent's independent third party appraisal of 
its compensable relocation costs and incumbent transaction expenses that 
are directly attributable to the relocation, subject to a cap of two 
percent of the ``hard'' costs involved. C may not exceed $250,000 per 
link, with an additional $150,000 permitted if a new or modified tower 
is required.
    (c) N equals the number of PCS entities that would have interfered 
with the link. For the PCS relocator, N=1. For the next PCS entity that 
would have interfered with the link, N=2, and so on. In the case of a 
voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent, N=1 for the first PCS entity 
that would have interfered with the link. For the next PCS entity that 
would have interfered with the link, N=2, and so on.
    (d) Tm equals the number of months that have elapsed between the 
month the PCS relocator or voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent 
obtains reimbursement rights for the link and

[[Page 136]]

the month that the clearinghouse notifies a later-entrant of its 
reimbursement obligation for the link. A PCS relocator obtains 
reimbursement rights for the link on the date that it signs a relocation 
agreement with a microwave incumbent. A voluntarily relocating microwave 
incumbent obtains reimbursement rights for the link on the date that the 
incumbent notifies the Commission that it intends to discontinue, or has 
discontinued, the use of the link, pursuant to Sec. 101.305 of the 
Commission's rules.

[62 FR 12757, Mar. 18, 1997, as amended at 65 FR 46113, July 27, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 24.245  Reimbursement under the Cost-Sharing Plan.

    (a) Registration of reimbursement rights. (1) To obtain 
reimbursement, a PCS relocator must submit documentation of the 
relocation agreement to the clearinghouse within ten business days of 
the date a relocation agreement is signed with an incumbent.
    (2) To obtain reimbursement, a voluntarily relocating microwave 
incumbent must submit documentation of the relocation of the link to the 
clearinghouse within ten business days of the date that the incumbent 
notifies the Commission that it intends to discontinue, or has 
discontinued, the use of the link, pursuant to Sec. 101.305 of the 
Commission's rules.
    (b) Documentation of expenses. Once relocation occurs, the PCS 
relocator or the voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent, must submit 
documentation itemizing the amount spent for items listed in Sec. 
24.243(b). The voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent, must also 
submit an independent third party appraisal of its compensable 
relocation costs. The appraisal should be based on the actual cost of 
replacing the incumbent's system with comparable facilities and should 
exclude the cost of any equipment upgrades or items outside the scope of 
Sec. 24.243(b). The PCS relocator or the voluntarily relocating 
microwave incumbent, must identify the particular link associated with 
appropriate expenses (i.e., costs may not be averaged over numerous 
links). If a PCS relocator pays a microwave incumbent a monetary sum to 
relocate its own facilities, the PCS relocator must estimate the costs 
associated with relocating the incumbent by itemizing the anticipated 
cost for items listed in Sec. 24.243(b). If the sum paid to the 
incumbent cannot be accounted for, the remaining amount is not eligible 
for reimbursement. A PCS relocator may submit receipts or other 
documentation to the clearinghouse for all relocation expenses incurred 
since April 5, 1995.
    (c) Full Reimbursement. A PCS relocator who relocates a microwave 
link that is either fully outside its market area or its licensed 
frequency band may seek full reimbursement through the clearinghouse of 
compensable costs, up to the reimbursement cap as defined in Sec. 
24.243(b). Such reimbursement will not be subject to depreciation under 
the cost-sharing formula.

<R05>
Sec. 24.247  Triggering a reimbursement obligation.

    (a) Licensed PCS. The clearinghouse will apply the following test to 
determine if a PCS entity preparing to initiate operations must pay a 
PCS relocator or a voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent in 
accordance with the formula detailed in Sec. 24.243:
    (1) All or part of the relocated microwave link was initially co-
channel with the licensed PCS band(s) of the subsequent PCS entity;
    (2) A PCS relocator has paid the relocation costs of the microwave 
incumbent; and
    (3) The subsequent PCS entity is preparing to turn on a fixed base 
station at commercial power and the fixed base station is located within 
a rectangle (Proximity Threshold) described as follows:
    (i) The length of the rectangle shall be x where x is a line 
extending through both nodes of the microwave link to a distance of 48 
kilometers (30 miles) beyond each node. The width of the rectangle shall 
be y where y is a line perpendicular to x and extending for a distance 
of 24 kilometers (15 miles) on both sides of x. Thus, the rectangle is 
represented as follows:

[[Page 137]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MR91.041

    (ii) If the application of the Proximity Threshold test indicates 
that a reimbursement obligation exists, the clearinghouse will calculate 
the reimbursement amount in accordance with the cost-sharing formula and 
notify the subsequent PCS entity of the total amount of its 
reimbursement obligation.
    (b) Unlicensed PCS. UTAM's reimbursement obligation is triggered 
either:
    (1) When a county is cleared of microwave links in the unlicensed 
allocation, and UTAM invokes a Zone 1 power cap as a result of third 
party relocation activities; or
    (2) A county is cleared of microwave links in the unlicensed 
allocation and UTAM reclassifies a Zone 2 county to Zone 1 status.
    (c) Any new entrants granted licenses for the 1910-1915 MHz band 
must reimburse UTAM a pro rata share of its total expenses incurred by 
UTAM as of the date that the new entrants gain access to the band. The 
percent required by new entrants to pay shall be calculated based upon 
the amount of spectrum granted to the new entrant as compared to the 
total amount of spectrum UTAM is responsible for clearing of incumbents 
(20 megahertz), and must be paid before a new entrant begins operations 
in the band. For example, if a new entrant obtains a license for 5 
megahertz of spectrum in this band, it is required to reimburse UTAM 
one-quarter of UTAM's total costs to date on a pro rata shared basis. 
New entrants will be responsible for the actual costs associated with 
future relocation activities in their licensed spectrum, but will be 
entitled to seek reimbursement from UTAM for the proportion of those 
band clearing costs that benefit users of the 1915-1930 MHz band.

<R05>
Sec. 24.249  Payment issues.

    (a) Timing. On the day that a PCS entity files its prior 
coordination notice (PCN) in accordance with Sec. 101.103(d) of this 
chapter, it must file a copy of the PCN with the clearinghouse. The 
clearinghouse will determine if any reimbursement obligation exists and 
notify the PCS entity in writing of its repayment obligation, if any. 
When the PCS entity receives a written copy of such obligation, it must 
pay directly to the PCS relocator or the voluntarily relocating 
microwave incumbent the amount owed within thirty days, with the 
exception of those businesses that qualify for installment payments. A 
business that qualifies for an installment payment plan must make its 
first installment payment within thirty days of notice from the 
clearinghouse. UTAM's first payment will be due thirty days after its 
reimbursement obligation is triggered, as described in Sec. 24.247(b).
    (b) Eligibility for Installment Payments. PCS licensees that are 
allowed to pay for their licenses in installments under

[[Page 138]]

our designated entity rules will have identical payment options 
available to them with respect to payments under the cost-sharing plan. 
The specific terms of the installment payment mechanism, including the 
treatment of principal and interest, are the same as those applicable to 
the licensee's installment auction payments. If, for any reason, the 
entity eligible for installment payments is no longer eligible for such 
installment payments on its license, that entity is no longer eligible 
for installment payments under the cost-sharing plan. UTAM may make 
quarterly payments over a five-year period with an interest rate of 
prime plus 2.5 percent. UTAM may also negotiate separate repayment 
arrangements with other parties.

Sec. 24.251  Dispute resolution under the Cost-Sharing Plan.

    Disputes arising out of the cost-sharing plan, such as disputes over 
the amount of reimbursement required, must be brought, in the first 
instance, to the clearinghouse for resolution. To the extent that 
disputes cannot be resolved by the clearinghouse, parties are encouraged 
to use expedited ADR procedures, such as binding arbitration, mediation, 
or other ADR techniques.

[61 FR 29693, June 12, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 24.253  Termination of cost-sharing obligations.

    The cost-sharing plan will sunset for all PCS entities on April 4, 
2005, which is ten years after the date that voluntary negotiations 
commenced for A and B block PCS entities. Those PCS entities that are 
paying their portion of relocation costs on an installment basis must 
continue the payments until the obligation is satisfied.

Sec. Appendix I to Subpart E of Part 24--A Procedure for Calculating PCS 
   Signal Levels at Microwave Receivers (Appendix E of the Memorandum 
                           Opinion and Order)

    The new Rules adopted in Part 24 stipulate that estimates of 
interference to fixed microwave operations from a PCS operation will be 
based on the sum of signals received at a microwave receiver from the 
PCS operation. This appendix describes a procedure for computing this 
PCS level.
    In general, the procedure involves four steps:
    1. Determine the geographical coordinates of all microwave receivers 
operating on co-channel and adjacent frequencies within the coordination 
distance of each base station and the characteristics of each receiver, 
i.e., adjacent channel susceptibility, antenna gain, pattern and height, 
and line and other losses.
    2. Determine an equivalent isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.) 
for each base station and equivalent e.i.r.p. values for the mobiles and 
portables associated with each base station. Determine the values of 
pertinent correction and weighting factors based on building heights and 
density and distribution of portables. Close-in situations, prominent 
hills, and extra tall buildings require special treatment.
    3. Based on PCS e.i.r.p. values, correction and weighting factors, 
and microwave receiving system characteristics determined above, 
calculate the total interference power at the input of each microwave 
receiver, using the Longley-Rice propagation model.
    4. Based on the interference power level computed in step 3, 
determine interference to each microwave receiver using criteria 
described in Part 24 and EIA/TIA Bulletin 10-F.
    The interference from each base station and the mobiles and 
portables associated with it is calculated as follows:

P<INF>rbi</INF>=10Log (p<INF>tbi</INF>)-L<INF>bi</INF>-
UC<INF>i</INF>+G<INF>mwi</INF>-C<INF>i</INF>-BP<INF>i</INF>
P<INF>rmi</INF>=10Log (n<INF>mi</INF>xp<INF>tmi</INF>)-L<INF>mi</INF>-
UC<INF>i</INF>+G<INF>mwi</INF>-C<INF>i</INF>
P<INF>rpsi</INF>=10Log (n<INF>psi</INF>xp<INF>tpsi</INF>)-
L<INF>psi</INF>-UC<INF>i</INF>+G<INF>mwi</INF>-C<INF>i</INF>
P<INF>rpbi</INF>=10Log (n<INF>pbi</INF>xp<INF>tpbi</INF>)-
L<INF>pbi</INF>-UC<INF>i</INF>-(BP<INF>i</INF>-BH<INF>i</INF>) 
+G<INF>mwi</INF>-C<INF>i</INF>
P<INF>rpri</INF>=10Log (n<INF>pri</INF>xp<INF>tpri</INF>)-
L<INF>pri</INF>-(UC<INF>i</INF>-BH<INF>i</INF>)+G<INF>mwi</INF>-
C<INF>i</INF>

where:

P refers to Power in dBm
p refers to power in milliwatts
P<INF>rbi</INF>=Power at MW receiver from ith base station in dBm
p<INF>tbi</INF>=e.i.r.p. transmitted from ith base station in 
milliwatts, which equals average power per channel x number of channels 
x antenna gain with respect to an isotropic antenna - line loss
L<INF>bi</INF>=Path loss between MW and base station site in dB
UC<INF>i</INF>=Urban correction factor in dB
G<INF>mwi</INF>=Gain of MW antenna in pertinent direction (dBi)
C<INF>i</INF>=Channel discrimination of MW system in dB
P<INF>rmi</INF>=Power at MW receiver from mobiles associated with ith 
base station
p<INF>tmi</INF>=e.i.r.p. transmitted from mobiles associated with ith 
base station

[[Page 139]]

n<INF>mi</INF>=Number of mobiles associated with ith base station
L<INF>mi</INF>=Path loss between MW and mobile transmitters in dB
P<INF>rpsi</INF>=Power at MW receiver from outdoor portables (s for 
sidewalk)
p<INF>tpsi</INF>=e.i.r.p. transmitted from outdoor portables associated 
with ith base station
n<INF>psi</INF>=Number of outdoor portables associated with ith base 
station
L<INF>psi</INF>=Path loss between MW and outdoor portables in dB
P<INF>rpbi</INF>=Power at MW receiver from indoor portables (b for 
building)
p<INF>tpbi</INF>=e.i.r.p. transmitted from indoor portables associated 
with ith base station
n<INF>pbi</INF>=number of indoor portables associated with ith base 
station
L<INF>pbi</INF>=Path loss in dB between MW and base station site (using 
average building height divided by 2 as effective antenna height)
P<INF>rpri</INF>=Power at MW receiver from rooftop portables (r for 
rooftop)
p<INF>tpri</INF>=e.i.r.p. transmitted from rooftop portables associated 
with ith base station
n<INF>pri</INF>=Number of rooftop portables associated with ith base 
station
L<INF>pri</INF>=Path loss in dB between MW and base station site (using 
average building height as effective antenna height)
BP<INF>i</INF>=Building penetration loss at street level in dB
BH<INF>i</INF>=Height gain for portables in buildings dB=2.5x(nf-1), 
where nf is number of floors

    Note: where C<INF>i</INF> varies from channel-to-channel, which 
often is the case, the summation process is more complex, requiring 
summation at a channel level first.

    Finally, the total PCS interference power at a given microwave 
receiver from all the base stations in a given frequency band is found 
by summing the contributions from the individual stations. Likewise, the 
total interference power at a given microwave receiver from all mobiles 
and portables operating in a given frequency band is found by summing 
the contributions from the mobiles and portables associated with each 
cell.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR24JN94.017

    Base Stations. Interference from each base station to each microwave 
should normally be considered independently. A group of base stations 
having more or less (within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>50 percent) the same 
height above average terrain, the same e.i.r.p., basically the same path 
to a microwave receiving site, and subtending an angle to that receiving 
site of less than 5 degrees, may be treated as a group, using the total 
power of the group and the average antenna height of the group to 
calculate path loss, L.
    Mobile Stations. The e.i.r.p. from mobile transmitters is weighted 
according to the number of base station channels expected to be devoted 
to mobile operation at any given time. The antenna height of mobiles 
used in calculating path loss, L, is assumed to be 2 meters.
    Portable Stations. The e.i.r.p. from the portable units associated 
with each base station is weighted according to the estimated portion of 
portables associated with that cell expected to be operated inside 
buildings at any given time and the portion which could be expected to 
be operating from elevated locations, such as balconies or building 
rooftops. For example, in the case of service intended for business use 
in an urban area, one might expect that perhaps 85 percent of the 
portables in use at any given time would be operating from within 
buildings and perhaps 5 percent might be operating from rooftops or 
balconies. The remaining 10 percent would be outside at street level.
    Calculation of an equivalent e.i.r.p. for cells in suburban areas 
will involve different weighting criteria.
    Urban Correction Factor. The urban correction factor (UC) depends on 
the height and density of buildings surrounding a base station. For the 
core area of large cities, it is assumed to be 35 dB. For medium size 
cities and fringe areas of large cities (4- to 6-story buildings with 
scattered taller buildings and lower buildings and open spaces) it is 
assumed to be 25 dB; for small cities and towns, 15 dB, and for suburban 
residential areas (one- and two-story, single family houses with 
scattered multiple-story apartment buildings, shopping centers and open 
areas), 10 dB.
    The unadjusted urban correction factor, UC, should not be applied to 
base station antenna heights that are greater than 50 percent of the 
average building height for a cell.

[[Page 140]]

    Building Height and Building Penetration Factors. The building 
height correction, BH, is a function of the average building height 
within the nominal coverage area of the base station. It is used in 
conjunction with the building penetration loss, BP, to adjust the 
expected interference contribution from that portion of the portables 
transmitting from within buildings. The adjustment is given by:

BP=20 dB in urban areas
BP=10 dB in suburban areas
BH=2.5x(nf-1) dB

where nf is the average height (number of floors) of the buildings in 
the area.
    (Note that this formula implies a net gain when the average building 
height is greater than 8 floors). All buildings more than twice the 
average height should be considered individually. The contribution to BH 
from that portion of portables in the building above the average 
building height should be increased by a factor of 20Log(h) dB, where h 
is the height of the portables above the average building height in 
meters.
    Channel Discrimination Factor. A factor based on the interference 
selectivity of the microwave receiver.
    Propagation Model. The PCS to microwave path loss, L, is calculated 
using the Longley-Rice propagation model, Version 1.2.2., in the point-
to-point mode. The Longley-Rice [1] model was derived from NBS Technical 
Note 101 [2], and updated in 1982 by Hufford [3]. Version 1.2.2 
incorporated modifications described in a letter by Hufford [4] in 1985. 
Terrain elevations used as input to the model should be from the U.S. 
Geological Survey 3-second digitized terrain database.
    Special Situations. If a cell size is large compared to the distance 
between the cell and a microwave receiving site so that it subtends an 
angle greater than 5 degrees, the cell should be subdivided and 
calculations should be based on the expected distribution of mobiles and 
portables within each subdivision.
    If terrain elevations within a cell differ by more than a factor of 
two-to-one, the cell should be subdivided and microwave interference 
calculations should be based on the average terrain elevation for each 
subdivision.
    If a co-channel PCS base station lies within the main beam of a 
microwave antenna (<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 degrees), there is no 
intervening terrain obstructions, and the power at the microwave 
receiver from that base station, assuming free space propagation, would 
be 3 dB or less below the interference threshold, interference will be 
assumed to exist unless the PCS licensee can demonstrate otherwise by 
specific path loss calculations based on terrain and building losses.
    If any part of a cell or cell subdivision lies within the main beam 
of a co-channel microwave antenna, there is no intervening terrain 
obstructions, and the accumulative power of 5 percent or less of the 
mobiles, assuming free space propagation would be 3 dB or less below the 
interference threshold, interference will be assumed to exist unless the 
PCS licensee can demonstrate otherwise by specific path loss 
calculations based on terrain and building losses.
    If a building within a cell or cell subdivision lies within the main 
beam of a co-channel microwave antenna, there is no intervening terrain 
obstructions, and the cumulative power of 5 percent or fewer of the 
portables, assuming free space propagation, would be 3 dB or less below 
the interference threshold, interference will be assumed to exist unless 
the PCS licensee can demonstrate otherwise by specific path loss 
calculations based on terrain and building losses.

Sec. 24.430  Opposition to applications.

    (a) Petitions to deny (including petitions for other forms of 
relief) and responsive pleadings for Commission consideration must 
comply with Sec. 1.2108 of this chapter and must:

involved) with which it is concerned;
    (2) Be filed in accordance with the pleading limitations, filing 
periods, and other applicable provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.41 through 1.52 
of this chapter except where otherwise provided in Sec. 1.2108 of this 
chapter;
    (3) Contain specific allegations of fact which, except for facts of 
which official notice may be taken, shall be supported by affidavit of a 
person or persons with personal knowledge thereof, and which shall be 
sufficient to demonstrate that the petitioner (or respondent) is a party 
in interest and that a grant of, or other Commission action regarding, 
the application would be prima facie inconsistent with the public 
interest; and
    (4) Contain a certificate of service showing that it has been mailed 
to the applicant no later than the date of filing thereof with the 
Commission.
    (b) A petition to deny a major amendment to a previously filed

Sec. 24.431  Mutually exclusive applications.

    (a) The Commission will consider applications to be mutually 
exclusive if their conflicts are such that the grant of one application 
would effectively preclude by reason of harmful electrical interference, 
or other practical reason, the grant of one or more of the other 
applications. The Commission will presume ``harmful electrical 
interference'' to mean interference which would result in a material 
impairment to service rendered to the public despite full cooperation in 
good faith by all applicants or parties to achieve reasonable technical 
adjustments which would avoid electrical conflict.
    (b) Mutually exclusive applications filed on Form 175 for the 
initial provision of narrowband PCS service are subject to competitive 
bidding in accordance with the procedures in subpart F of this part and 
in 47 CFR part 1, subpart Q.
    (c) An application will be entitled to comparative consideration 
with one or more conflicting applications only if the Commission 
determines that such comparative consideration will serve the public 
interest.

    (a) General rule for licenses offered for closed bidding. (1) No 
application is acceptable for filing and no license shall be granted to 
a winning bidder in closed bidding for frequency block C or frequency 
block F, unless the applicant, together with its affiliates and persons 
or entities that hold interests in the applicant and their affiliates, 
have had gross revenues of less than $125 million in each of the last 
two years and total assets of less than $500 million at the time the 
applicant's short-form application (Form 175) is filed.
    (2) Any licensee awarded a license won in closed bidding pursuant to 
the eligibility requirements of this section (or pursuant to Sec. 
24.839(a)(2)) shall maintain its eligibility until at least five years 
from the date of initial license grant, except that a licensee's (or 
other attributable entity's) increased gross revenues or increased total 
assets due to nonattributable equity investments (i.e., from sources 
whose gross revenues and total assets are not considered under paragraph 
(b) of this section), debt financing, revenue from operations or other 
investments, business development, or expanded service shall not be 
considered.
    (3) Tiers. (i) For purposes of determining spectrum to which the 
eligibility requirements of this section are applicable, the BTA service 
areas (see Sec. 24.202(b)) are divided into two tiers according to 
their population as follows:
    (A) Tier 1: BTA service areas with population equal to or greater 
than 2.5 million;
    (B) Tier 2: BTA service areas with population less than 2.5 million.
    (ii) For Auction No. 35, the population of individual BTA service 
areas will be based on the 1990 census. For auctions beginning after the 
start of Auction No. 35, the population of individual BTA service areas 
will be based on the most recent available decennial census.
    (4) Application of eligibility requirements. (i) The following 
categories of licenses will be subject to closed bidding pursuant to the 
eligibility requirements of this section in auctions that begin after 
the effective date of this paragraph.
    (A) For Tier 1 BTAs, one of the 10 MHz C block licenses (1895-1900 
MHz paired with 1975-1980 MHz);
    (B) For Tier 2 BTAs, two of the 10 MHz C block licenses (1895-1900 
MHz paired with 1975-1980 MHz; 1900-1905 MHz paired with 1980-1985 MHz) 
and all 15 MHz C block licenses.
    (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this 
section, any C block license for operation on spectrum that has been 
offered, but not won by a bidder, in closed bidding in any auction 
beginning on or after March 23, 1999, will not be subject in a 
subsequent auction to closed bidding pursuant to the eligibility 
requirements of this section.
    (5) Special rule for licensees disaggregating or returning certain

    (i) In addition to entities qualifying for closed bidding under

participated in the auction for frequency block C, which began on 
December 18, 1995, or the reauction for frequency block C, which began 
on July 3, 1996, will be eligible to bid for C block licenses offered in 
closed bidding in any reauction of frequency block C spectrum that 
begins within two years of March 23, 1999.
    (ii) In cases of merger, acquisition, or other business combination 
of entities, where each of the entities is eligible to bid for C block 
licenses offered in closed bidding in any reauction of C block spectrum 
on the basis of the eligibility exception set forth in paragraph 
(a)(5)(i) of this section, the resulting entity will also be eligible 
for the exception specified in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section.

    (iii) In cases of merger, acquisition, or other business combination 
of entities, where one or more of the entities are ineligible for the 
exception set forth in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, the 
resulting entity will not be eligible pursuant to paragraph (a)(5)(i) of 
this section unless an eligible entity possesses de jure and de facto 
control over the resulting entity.

shall be calculated on a fully diluted basis; all agreements such as 
warrants, stock options and convertible debentures will generally be 
treated as if the rights thereunder already have been fully exercised, 
except that such agreements may not be used to appear to terminate or 
divest ownership interests before they actually do so, in order to

nonattributable equity requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii)(A) and 
(b)(1)(iv)(A) of this section.

    Example 1 for paragraph (b)(1)(viii). ABC Corp. is owned by 
individuals, A, B, and C, each having an equal one-third voting interest 
in ABC Corp. A and B together, with two-thirds of the stock have the 
power to control ABC Corp. and have an identity of interest. If A & B 
invest in DE Corp., a broadband PCS applicant for block C, A and B's 
separate interests in DE Corp. must be aggregated because A and B are to 
be treated as one person.
    Example 2 for paragraph (b)(1)(viii). ABC Corp. has subsidiary BC 
Corp., of which it holds a controlling 51 percent of the stock. If ABC 
Corp. and BC Corp., both invest in DE Corp., their separate interests in 
DE Corp. must be aggregated because ABC Corp. and BC Corp. are 
affiliates of each other.

    (2) The following provisions apply to licenses acquired pursuant to 
Sec. 24.839(a)(2) or (a)(3) on or after October 30, 2000. In addition

Sec. 24.713  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 24.714  Partitioned licenses and disaggregated spectrum.

    (a) Eligibility. (1) Parties seeking approval for partitioning and 
disaggregation shall request an authorization for partial assignment of 
a license pursuant to Sec. 24.839.

[[Page 149]]

    (2) Broadband PCS licensees in spectrum blocks A, B, D, and E and 
broadband PCS C and F block licenses not subject to the eligibility 
requirements of Sec. 24.709 may apply to partition their licensed 
geographic service area or disaggregate their licensed spectrum at any 
time following the grant of their licenses.
    (3) Broadband PCS licensees that acquired C or F block licenses in 
closed bidding subject to the eligibility requirements of Sec. 24.709 
may partition their licensed geographic service area or disaggregate 
their licensed spectrum at any time to an entity that meets the 
eligibility criteria set forth in Sec. 24.709 at the time the request 
for partial assignment of license is filed or to an entity that holds 
license(s) for frequency blocks C and F that met the eligibility 
criteria set forth in Sec. 24.709 at the time of receipt of such 
license(s). Partial assignment applications seeking partitioning or 
disaggregation of broadband PCS licenses in spectrum blocks C and F must 
include an attachment demonstrating compliance with this section.
    (b) Technical standards--(1) Partitioning. In the case of 
partitioning, applicants and licensees must file FCC Form 603 pursuant 
to Sec. 1.948 of this chapter and list the partitioned service area on 
a schedule to the application. The geographic coordinates must be 
specified in degrees, minutes, and seconds to the nearest second of 
latitude and longitude and must be based upon the 1983 North American 
Datum (NAD83).
    (2) Disaggregation. Spectrum may be disaggregated in any amount.
    (3) Combined partitioning and disaggregation. The Commission will 
consider requests for partial assignment of licenses that propose 
combinations of partitioning and disaggregation.
    (c) Installment payments--(1) Apportioning the balance on 
installment payment plans. When a winning bidder elects to pay for its 
license through an installment payment plan pursuant to Sec. Sec. 
1.2110(g) of this chapter or 24.716, and partitions its licensed area or 
disaggregates spectrum to another party, the outstanding balance owed by 
the licensee on its installment payment plan (including accrued and 
unpaid interest) shall be apportioned between the licensee and 
partitionee or disaggregatee. Both parties will be responsible for 
paying their proportionate share of the outstanding balance to the U.S. 
Treasury. In the case of partitioning, the balance shall be apportioned 
based upon the ratio of the population of the partitioned area to the 
population of the entire original license area calculated based upon the 
most recent census data. In the case of disaggregation, the balance 
shall be apportioned based upon the ratio of the amount of spectrum 
disaggregated to the amount of spectrum allocated to the licensed area.
    (2) Parties not qualified for installment payment plans. (i) When a 
winning bidder elects to pay for its license through an installment 
payment plan, and partitions its license or disaggregates spectrum to 
another party that would not qualify for an installment payment plan or 
elects not to pay its share of the license through installment payments, 
the outstanding balance owed by the licensee (including accrued and 
unpaid interest shall be apportioned according to Sec. 24.714(c)(1)).
    (ii) The partitionee or disaggregatee shall, as a condition of the 
approval of the partial assignment application, pay its entire pro rata 
amount within 30 days of Public Notice conditionally granting the 
partial assignment application. Failure to meet this condition will 
result in a rescission of the grant of the partial assignment 
application.
    (iii) The licensee shall be permitted to continue to pay its pro 
rata share of the outstanding balance and shall receive new financing 
documents (promissory note, security agreement) with a revised payment 
obligation, based on the remaining amount of time on the original 
installment payment schedule. These financing documents will replace the 
licensee's existing financing documents, which shall be marked 
``superseded'' and returned to the licensee upon receipt of the new 
financing documents. The original interest rate, established pursuant to 
Sec. 1.2110(g)(3)(i) of this chapter at the time of the grant of the 
initial license in the market, shall continue to be applied to the 
licensee's

[[Page 150]]

portion of the remaining government obligation. The Commission will 
require, as a further condition to approval of the partial assignment 
application, that the licensee execute and return to the U.S. Treasury 
the new financing documents within 30 days of the Public Notice 
conditionally granting the partial assignment application. Failure to 
meet this condition will result in the automatic cancellation of the 
grant of the partial assignment application.
    (iv) A default on the licensee's payment obligation will only affect 
the licensee's portion of the market.
    (3) Parties qualified for installment payment plans. (i) Where both 
parties to a partitioning or disaggregation agreement qualify for 
installment payments, the partitionee or disaggregatee will be permitted 
to make installment payments on its portion of the remaining government 
obligations, as calculated according to Sec. 24.714(c)(1).
    (ii) Each party will be required, as a condition to approval of the 
partial assignment application, to execute separate financing documents 
(promissory note, security agreement) agreeing to pay their pro rata 
portion of the balance due (including accrued and unpaid interest) based 
upon the installment payment terms for which they qualify under the 
rules. The financing documents must be returned to the U.S. Treasury 
within thirty (30) days of the Public Notice conditionally granting the 
partial assignment application. Failure by either party to meet this 
condition will result in the automatic cancellation of the grant of the 
partial assignment application. The interest rate, established pursuant 
to Sec. 1.2110(g)(3)(i) of this chapter at the time of the grant of the 
initial license in the market, shall continue to be applied to both 
parties' portion of the balance due. Each party will receive a license 
for their portion of the partitioned market or disaggregated spectrum.
    (iii) A default on an obligation will only affect that portion of 
the market area held by the defaulting party.
    (iv) Partitionees and disaggregatees that qualify for installment 
payment plans may elect to pay some of their pro rata portion of the 
balance due in a lump sum payment to the U.S. Treasury and to pay the 
remaining portion of the balance due pursuant to an installment payment 
plan.
    (d) License term. The license term for a partitioned license area 
and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original 
licensee's license term as provided for in Sec. 24.15.
    (e) Construction requirements--(1) Requirements for partitioning. 
Parties seeking authority to partition must meet one of the following 
construction requirements:
    (i) The partitionee may certify that it will satisfy the applicable 
construction requirements set forth in Sec. 24.203 for the partitioned 
license area; or
    (ii) The original licensee may certify that it has or will meet its 
five-year construction requirement and will meet the ten-year 
construction requirement, as set forth in Sec. 24.203, for the entire 
license area. In that case, the partitionee must only satisfy the 
requirements for ``substantial service,'' as set forth in Sec. 
24.16(a), for the partitioned license area by the end of the original 
ten-year license term of the licensee.
    (iii) Applications requesting partial assignments of license for 
partitioning must include a certification by each party as to which of 
the above construction options they select.
    (iv) Partitionees must submit supporting documents showing 
compliance with the respective construction requirements within the 
appropriate five- and ten-year construction benchmarks set forth in 
Sec. 24.203.
    (v) Failure by any partitionee to meet its respective construction 
requirements will result in the automatic cancellation of the 
partitioned or disaggregated license without further Commission action.
    (2) Requirements for disaggregation. Parties seeking authority to 
disaggregate must submit with their partial assignment application a 
certification signed by both parties stating which of the parties will 
be responsible for meeting the five- and ten-year construction 
requirements for the PCS market as set forth in Sec. 24.203. Parties 
may agree to share responsibility for

[[Page 151]]

meeting the construction requirements. Parties that accept 
responsibility for meeting the construction requirements and later fail 
to do so will be subject to license forfeiture without further 
Commission action.

may pay the remaining 80 percent of the net auction price for the 
license in installment payments pursuant to Sec. 1.2110(g) of this 
chapter and under the following terms:
    (a) For an eligible licensee with gross revenues exceeding $75

obligations applicable on the date the license is granted, plus 3.5 
percent; payments shall include both principal and interest amortized 
over the term of the license;
    (b) For an eligible licensee with gross revenues not exceeding $75 
million (calculated in accordance with Sec. 1.2110(b) of this chapter 
and, when applicable, Sec. 24.709(b)) in each of the two preceding

[68 FR 42999, July 21, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 24.720  Definitions.

    (a) Scope. The definitions in this section apply to Sec. Sec. 
24.709 through 24.717, unless otherwise specified in those sections.
    (b) Small and very small business. (1) A small business is an entity 
that, together with its affiliates and persons or entities that hold 
interest in such entity and their affiliates, has average annual gross 
revenues that are not more than $40 million for the preceding three 
years.
    (2) A very small business is an entity that, together with its 
affiliates and persons or entities that hold interests in such entity 
and their affiliates, has average annual gross revenues that are not 
more than $15 million for the preceding three years.
    (c) Institutional Investor. An institutional investor is an 
insurance company, a bank holding stock in trust accounts through its 
trust department, or an investment company as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80a-
3(a), including within such definition any entity that would otherwise 
meet the definition of investment company under 15 U.S.C. 80a-3(a) but 
is

[[Page 152]]

excluded by the exemptions set forth in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3(b) and (c), 
without regard to whether such entity is an issuer of securities; 
provided that, if such investment company is owned, in whole or in part, 
by other entities, such investment company, such other entities and the 
affiliates of such other entities, taken as a whole, must be primarily 
engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in 
securities or in distributing or providing investment management 
services for securities.
    (d) Nonattributable Equity. (1) Nonattributable equity shall mean:
    (i) For corporations, voting stock or non-voting stock that includes 
no more than twenty-five percent of the total voting equity, including 
the right to vote such stock through a voting trust or other 
arrangement;
    (ii) For partnerships, joint ventures and other non-corporate 
entities, limited partnership interests and similar interests that do 
not afford the power to exercise control of the entity.
    (2) For purposes of assessing compliance with the equity limits in 
Sec. Sec. 24.709 (b)(1)(iii)(A) and (b)(1)(iv)(A), where such interests 
are not held directly in the applicant, the total equity held by a 
person or entity shall be determined by successive multiplication of the 
ownership percentages for each link in the vertical ownership chain.
    (e) Control Group. A control group is an entity, or a group of 
individuals or entities, that possesses de jure control and de facto 
control of an applicant or licensee, and as to which the applicant's or 
licensee's charters, bylaws, agreements and any other relevant documents 
(and amendments thereto) provide:
    (1) That the entity and/or its members own unconditionally at least 
50.1 percent of the total voting interests of a corporation;
    (2) That the entity and/or its members receive at least 50.1 percent 
of the annual distribution or any dividends paid on the voting stock of 
a corporation;
    (3) That, in the event of dissolution or liquidation of a 
corporation, the entity and/or its members are entitled to receive 100 
percent of the value of each share of stock in its possession and a 
percentage of the retained earnings of the concern that is equivalent to 
the amount of equity held in the corporation; and
    (4) That, for other types of businesses, the entity and/or its 
members have the right to receive dividends, profits and regular and 
liquidating distributions from the business in proportion to the amount 
of equity held in the business.

    Note to paragraph (e): Voting control does not always assure de 
facto control, such as for example, when the voting stock of the control 
group is widely dispersed (see e.g., Sec. 1.2110(c)(5)(ii)(C) of this 
chapter).

    (f) Publicly Traded Corporation with Widely Dispersed Voting Power. 
A publicly traded corporation with widely dispersed voting power is a 
business entity organized under the laws of the United States:
    (1) Whose shares, debt, or other ownership interests are traded on 
an organized securities exchange within the United States;
    (2) In which no person:
    (i) Owns more than 15 percent of the equity; or
    (ii) Possesses, directly or indirectly, through the ownership of 
voting securities, by contract or otherwise, the power to control the 
election of more than 15 percent of the members of the board of 
directors or other governing body of such publicly traded corporation; 
and
    (3) Over which no person other than the management and members of 
the board of directors or other governing body of such publicly traded 
corporation, in their capacities as such, has de facto control.
    (4) The term person shall be defined as in section 13(d) of the 
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (15 U.S.C. 78(m)), and 
shall also include investors that are commonly controlled under the 
indicia of control set forth in the definition of affiliate in Sec. 
1.2110(c)(5) of the Commission's rules.
    (g) Qualifying investor. (1) A qualifying investor is a person who 
is (or holds an interest in) a member of the applicant's (or licensee's) 
control group and whose gross revenues and total assets, when aggregated 
with those of all other attributable investors and affiliates, do not 
exceed the gross revenues

[[Page 153]]

and total assets limits specified in Sec. 24.709(a), or, in the case of 
an applicant (or licensee) that is a small business, do not exceed the 
gross revenues limit specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) For purposes of assessing compliance with the minimum equity 
requirements of Sec. 24.709(b)(1)(v) and (b)(1)(vi), where such equity 
interests are not held directly in the applicant, interests held by 
qualifying investors shall be determined by successive multiplication of 
the ownership percentages for each link in the vertical ownership chain.
    (3) For purposes of Sec. 24.709(b)(1)(v)(A)(3) and 
(b)(1)(vi)(A)(3), a qualifying investor is a person who is (or holds an 
interest in) a member of the applicant's (or licensee's) control group 
and whose gross revenues and total assets do not exceed the gross 
revenues and total assets limits specified in Sec. 24.709(a).
    (h) Preexisting entity; Existing investor. A preexisting entity is 
an entity that was operating and earning revenues for at least two years 
prior to December 31, 1994. An existing investor is a person or entity 
that was an owner of record of a preexisting entity's equity as of 
November 10, 1994, and any person or entity acquiring de minimis equity 
holdings in a preexisting entity after that date.

    Note to paragraph (h): In applying the term existing investor to de 
minimis interests in preexisting entities obtained or increased after 
November 10, 1994, the Commission will scrutinize any significant 
restructuring of the preexisting entity that occurs after that date and 
will presume that any change of equity that is five percent or less of 
the preexisting entity's total equity is de minimis. The burden is on 
the applicant (or licensee) to demonstrate that changes that exceed five 
percent are not significant.

aggregation limits as follows:
    (a) The broadband PCS applicant shall submit a signed statement with 
its long-form application stating that

[[Page 155]]

<R05>
Sec. 25.103  Definitions.

    (a) Communications common carrier. The term ``communications common 
carrier'' as used in this part means any person (individual, 
partnership, association, joint-stock company, trust, corporation, or 
other entity) engaged as a common carrier for hire, in interstate or 
foreign communication by wire or radio or in interstate or foreign radio 
transmission of energy, including such carriers as are described in 
subsection 2(b) (2) and (3) of the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended, and, in addition, for purposes of subpart H of this part, 
includes any individual, partnership, association, joint-stock company, 
trust, corporation, or other entity which owns or controls, directly or 
indirectly, or is under direct or indirect common control with, any such 
carrier.
    (b) Authorized carrier. The term ``authorized carrier'' means a 
communications common carrier which is authorized by the Federal 
Communications Commission under the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended, to provide services by means of communications satellites.
    (c) Communications satellite corporation. (1) The terms 
``communications satellite corporation'' or ``corporation'' as used in 
this part mean the corporation created pursuant to the provisions of 
Title III of the Communications Satellite Act of 1962.
    (2) The corporation shall be deemed to be a common carrier within 
the meaning of section 3(10) of the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended.
    (d) Communication-satellite earth station complex. The term 
communication-satellite earth station complex includes transmitters, 
receivers, and communications antennas at the earth station site 
together with the interconnecting terrestrial facilities (cables, lines, 
or microwave facilities) and modulating and demodulating equipment 
necessary for processing of traffic received from the terrestrial 
distribution system(s) prior to transmission via satellite and of 
traffic received from the satellite prior to transfer of channels of 
communication to terrestrial distribution system(s).
    (e) Communication-satellite earth station complex functions. The 
communication-satellite earth station complex interconnects with 
terminal equipment of common carriers or authorized entities at the 
interface; accepts traffic

[[Page 159]]

from such entities at the interface, processes for transmission via 
satellite and performs the transmission function; receives traffic from 
a satellite or satellites, processes it in a form necessary to deliver 
channels of communication to terrestrial common carriers or such other 
authorized entities and delivers the processed traffic to such entities 
at the interface.
    (f) Interface. The point of interconnection between two distinct but 
adjacent communications systems having different functions. The 
interface in the communication-satellite service is that point where 
communications terminal equipment of the terrestrial common carriers or 
other authorized entities interconnects with the terminal equipment of 
the communication-satellite earth station complex. The interface in the 
communication-satellite service shall be located at the earth station 
site, or if this is impracticable, as close thereto as possible.
    (g) Emergency call center (ECC). A facility that subscribers of 
satellite commercial mobile radio services call when in need of 
emergency assistance by dialing ``911'' on their mobile satellite earth 
terminal.

<R05>
Sec. 25.104  Preemption of local zoning of earth stations.

    (a) Any state or local zoning, land-use, building, or similar 
regulation that materially limits transmission or reception by satellite 
earth station antennas, or imposes more than minimal costs on users of 
such antennas, is preempted unless the promulgating authority can 
demonstrate that such regulation is reasonable, except that nonfederal 
regulation of radio frequency emissions is not preempted by this 
section. For purposes of this paragraph (a), reasonable means that the 
local regulation:
    (1) Has a clearly defined health, safety, or aesthetic objective 
that is stated in the text of the regulation itself; and
    (2) Furthers the stated health, safety or aesthetic objective 
without unnecessarily burdening the federal interests in ensuring access 
to satellite services and in promoting fair and effective competition 
among competing communications service providers.
    (b)(1) Any state or local zoning, land-use, building, or similar 
regulation that affects the installation, maintenance, or use of a 
satellite earth station antenna that is two meters or less in diameter 
and is located or proposed to be located in any area where commercial or 
industrial uses are generally permitted by non-federal land-use 
regulation shall be presumed unreasonable and is therefore preempted 
subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. No civil, criminal, 
administrative, or other legal action of any kind shall be taken to 
enforce any regulation covered by this presumption unless the 
promulgating authority has obtained a waiver from the Commission 
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, or a final declaration from 
the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction that the presumption 
has been rebutted pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (2) Any presumption arising from paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
may be rebutted upon a showing that the regulation in question:
    (i) Is necessary to accomplish a clearly defined health or safety 
objective that is stated in the text of the regulation itself;
    (ii) Is no more burdensome to satellite users than is necessary to 
achieve the health or safety objective; and
    (iii) Is specifically applicable on its face to antennas of the 
class described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (c) Any person aggrieved by the application or potential application 
of a state or local zoning or other regulation in violation of paragraph 
(a) of this section may, after exhausting all nonfederal administrative 
remedies, file a petition with the Commission requesting a declaration 
that the state or local regulation in question is preempted by this 
section. Nonfederal administrative remedies, which do not include 
judicial appeals of administrative determinations, shall be deemed 
exhausted when:
    (1) The petitioner's application for a permit or other authorization 
required by the state or local authority has

[[Page 160]]

been denied and any administrative appeal and variance procedure has 
been exhausted;
    (2) The petitioner's application for a permit or other authorization 
required by the state or local authority has been on file for ninety 
days without final action;
    (3) The petitioner has received a permit or other authorization 
required by the state or local authority that is conditioned upon the 
petitioner's expenditure of a sum of money, including costs required to 
screen, pole-mount, or otherwise specially install the antenna, greater 
than the aggregate purchase or total lease cost of the equipment as 
normally installed; or
    (4) A state or local authority has notified the petitioner of 
impending civil or criminal action in a court of law and there are no 
more nonfederal administrative steps to be taken.
    (d) Procedures regarding filing of petitions requesting declaratory 
rulings and other related pleadings will be set forth in subsequent 
Public Notices. All allegations of fact contained in petitions and 
related pleadings must be supported by affidavit of a person or persons 
with personal knowledge thereof.
    (e) Any state or local authority that wishes to maintain and enforce 
zoning or other regulations inconsistent with this section may apply to 
the Commission for a full or partial waiver of this section. Such 
waivers may be granted by the Commission in its sole discretion, upon a 
showing by the applicant that local concerns of a highly specialized or 
unusual nature create a necessity for regulation inconsistent with this 
section. No application for waiver shall be considered unless it 
specifically sets forth the particular regulation for which waiver is 
sought. Waivers granted in accordance with this section shall not apply 
to later-enacted or amended regulations by the local authority unless 
the Commission expressly orders otherwise.
    (f) A satellite earth station antenna that is designed to receive 
direct broadcast satellite service, including direct-to-home satellite 
services, that is one meter or less in diameter or is located in Alaska 
is covered by the regulations in Sec. 1.4000 of this chapter.

Sec. 25.113  Station licenses and launch authority.

    (a) Construction permits are not required for satellite earth 
stations. Construction of such stations may commence prior to grant of a 
license at the applicant's own risk. Applicants must comply with the 
provisions of 47 CFR 1.1312 relating to environmental processing prior 
to commencing construction.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) FAA notification. Before the construction of new antenna 
structures or alteration in the height of existing antenna structures is 
authorized by the FCC, a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
determination of ``no hazard'' may be required. To apply for this 
determination, the FAA must be notified of the planned construction. 
Criteria used to determine whether FAA notification is required for a 
particular antenna structure are contained in part 17 of this chapter. 
Applications proposing construction of one or more new antenna 
structures or alteration of the overall height of one or more existing 
antenna structures, where FAA notification prior to such construction or 
alteration is not required by part 17 of this chapter, must indicate 
such and, unless the reason is obvious (e.g. structure height is less 
than 6.10 meters AGL) must contain a statement explaining why FAA 
notification is not required.
    (d) Painting and lighting. The owner of each antenna structure 
required to be painted and/or illuminated under the provisions of 
Section 303(q) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, shall 
operate and maintain the antenna structure painting and lighting in 
accordance with part 17 of this chapter. In the event of default by the 
owner, each licensee or permittee shall be individually responsible for 
conforming to the requirements pertaining to antenna structure painting 
and lighting.
    (e) Antenna Structure Registration Number. Applications proposing 
construction of one or more new antenna structures or alteration of the 
overall height of one or more existing structures, where FAA 
notification prior to such construction or alteration is required by 
part 17 of this chapter, must include the FCC Antenna Structure 
Registration Number(s) for the affected structure(s). If no such number 
has been assigned at the time the application is filed, the applicant 
must state in the application whether or not the antenna structure owner 
has notified the FAA of the proposed construction or alteration and 
applied to the FCC for an Antenna Structure Registration Number in 
accordance with part 17 of this chapter for the antenna structure in 
question.
    (f) Construction permits are not required for U.S.-licensed space 
stations. Construction of such stations may commence, at the applicant's 
own risk, prior to grant of a license. Prior to commencing construction, 
however, applicants must notify the Commission in writing they plan to 
begin construction at their own risk.
    (g) Except as set forth in paragraph (h) of this section, a launch 
authorization and station license (i.e., operating authority) must be 
applied for and granted before a space station may be launched and 
operated in orbit. Request for launch authorization may be

[[Page 163]]

included in an application for space station license. However, an 
application for authority to launch and operate an on-ground spare 
satellite will be considered pursuant to the following procedures:
    (1) Applications for launch and operation of an on-ground spare 
NGSO-like satellite will be considered pursuant to the procedures set 
forth in Sec. 25.157, except as set forth in paragraph (g)(3) of this 
section.
    (2) Applications for launch and operation of an on-ground spare GSO-
like satellite will be considered pursuant to the procedures set forth 
in Sec. 25.158, except as set forth in paragraph (g)(3) of this 
section.
    (3) Neither paragraph (g)(1) nor (g)(2) of this section will apply 
in cases where the space station to be launched is determined to be an 
emergency replacement for a previously authorized space station that has 
been lost as a result of a launch failure or a catastrophic in-orbit 
failure.
    (h) Licensees of Non-Geostationary Satellite Orbit (NGSO) satellite 
systems need not file separate applications to operate technically 
identical in-orbit spares authorized as part of a blanket license 
pursuant to Sec. 25.114(e) or any other satellite blanket licensing 
provision in this part. However, the licensee shall notify the 
Commission within 30 days of bringing the in-orbit spare into operation, 
and certify that operation of this space station did not cause the 
licensee to exceed the total number of operating space stations 
authorized by the Commission, and that the licensee will operate the 
space station within the applicable terms and conditions of its license. 
These notifications must be filed electronically on FCC Form 312.

    (12) Applications for authorizations in the non-geostationary 
satellite orbit fixed-satellite service (NGSO FSS) in the bands 10.7 GHz 
to 14.5 GHz shall also provide all information specified in Sec. 
25.146.
    (13) For satellite applications in the Direct Broadcast Satellite 
service, if the proposed system's technical characteristics differ from 
those specified in the Appendix 30 BSS Plans, the Appendix 30A feeder 
link Plans, Annex 5 to Appendix 30 or Annex 3 to Appendix 30A, each 
applicant shall provide:
    (i) The information requested in Appendix 4 of the ITU's Radio 
Regulations. Further, applicants shall provide sufficient technical 
showing that the proposed system could operate satisfactorily if all 
assignments in the BSS and feeder link Plans were implemented.
    (ii) Analyses of the proposed system with respect to the limits in 
Annex 1 to Appendices 30 and 30A.
    (14) A description of the design and operational strategies that 
will be used to mitigate orbital debris, including the following 
information:
    (i) A statement that the space station operator has assessed and 
limited the amount of debris released in a planned manner during normal 
operations, and has assessed and limited the probability of the space 
station becoming a source of debris by collisions with small debris or 
meteoroids that could cause loss of control and prevent post-mission 
disposal;
    (ii) A statement that the space station operator has assessed and 
limited the probability of accidental explosions during and after 
completion of mission operations. This statement must include a 
demonstration that debris generation will not result from the conversion 
of energy sources on board the spacecraft into energy that fragments the 
spacecraft. Energy sources include chemical, pressure, and kinetic 
energy. This demonstration should address whether stored energy will be 
removed at the spacecraft's end of life, by depleting residual fuel and 
leaving all fuel line valves open, venting any pressurized system, 
leaving all batteries in a permanent discharge state, and removing any 
remaining source of stored energy, or through other equivalent 
procedures specifically disclosed in the application;
    (iii) A statement that the space station operator has assessed and 
limited the probability of the space station becoming a source of debris 
by collisions with large debris or other operational space stations. 
Where a space station will be launched into a low-Earth orbit

[[Page 166]]

that is identical, or very similar, to an orbit used by other space 
stations, the statement must include an analysis of the potential risk 
of collision and a description of what measures the space station 
operator plans to take to avoid in-orbit collisions. If the space 
station operator is relying on coordination with another system, the 
statement must indicate what steps have been taken to contact, and 
ascertain the likelihood of successful coordination of physical 
operations with, the other system. The statement must disclose the 
accuracy--if any--with which orbital parameters of non-geostationary 
satellite orbit space stations will be maintained, including apogee, 
perigee, inclination, and the right ascension of the ascending node(s). 
In the event that a system is not able to maintain orbital tolerances, 
i.e., it lacks a propulsion system for orbital maintenance, that fact 
should be included in the debris mitigation disclosure. Such systems 
must also indicate the anticipated evolution over time of the orbit of 
the proposed satellite or satellites. Where a space station requests the 
assignment of a geostationary-Earth orbit location, it must assess 
whether there are any known satellites located at, or reasonably 
expected to be located at, the requested orbital location, or assigned 
in the vicinity of that location, such that the station keeping volumes 
of the respective satellites might overlap. If so, the statement must 
include a statement as to the identities of those parties and the 
measures that will be taken to prevent collisions;
    (iv) A statement detailing the post-mission disposal plans for the 
space station at end of life, including the quantity of fuel--if any--
that will be reserved for post-mission disposal maneuvers. For 
geostationary-Earth orbit space stations, the statement must disclose 
the altitude selected for a post-mission disposal orbit and the 
calculations that are used in deriving the disposal altitude. The 
statement must also include a casualty risk assessment if planned post-
mission disposal involves atmospheric re-entry of the space station. In 
general, an assessment should include an estimate as to whether portions 
of the spacecraft will survive re-entry and reach the surface of the 
Earth, as well as an estimate of the resulting probability of human 
casualty.
    (15) Each applicant for a space station license in the 17/24 GHz 
broadcasting-satellite service shall include the following information 
as an attachment to its application:
    (i) Except as set forth in paragraph (d)(15)(ii) of this section, an 
applicant proposing to operate in the 17.3-17.7 GHz frequency band, must 
provide a demonstration that the proposed space station will comply with 
the power flux density limits set forth in Sec. 25.208(w) of this part.
    (ii) In cases where the proposed space station will not comply with 
the power flux density limits set forth in Sec. 25.208(w) of this part, 
the applicant will be required to provide a certification that all 
potentially affected parties acknowledge and do not object to the use of 
the applicant's higher power flux densities. The affected parties with 
whom the applicant must coordinate are those GSO 17/24 GHz BSS satellite 
networks located up to <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>6[deg] away for excesses of 
up to 3 dB above the power flux-density levels specified in Sec. 
25.208(w) of this part, and up to <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10[deg] away 
greater for excesses greater than 3 dB above those levels.
    (iii) An applicant proposing to provide international service in the 
17.7-17.8 GHz band must demonstrate that it will meet the power flux 
density limits set forth in Sec. 25.208(c) of this part.
    (16) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (d)(15) of this 
section, each applicant for a license to operate a 17/24 GHz BSS space 
station that will be used to provide video programming directly to 
consumers in the United States, that will not meet the requirements of 
Sec. 25.225 of this part, must include as an attachment to its 
application a technical analysis demonstrating that providing video 
programming service to consumers in Alaska and Hawaii that is comparable 
to the video programming service provided to consumers in the 48 
contiguous United States (CONUS) is not feasible as a technical matter 
or that, while technically feasible, such service would require so many 
compromises in

[[Page 167]]

satellite design and operation as to make it economically unreasonable.
    (17) An applicant seeking to operate a space station in the 17/24 
GHz broadcasting-satellite service pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 
25.262(b) of this part, at an offset location no greater than one degree 
offset from an orbital location specified in Appendix F of the Report 
and Order adopted May 2, 2007, IB Docket No. 06-123, FCC 07-76, must 
submit a written request to that effect as part of the narrative portion 
of its application.
    (e) Applicants requesting authority to launch and operate a system 
comprised of technically identical, non-geostationary satellite orbit 
space stations may file a single ``blanket'' application containing the 
information specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section for each 
representative space station.

the licensee shall notify the Commission of the complete technical 
parameters of each individual earth station site before that site is 
bought into operation under the lead authorization. Full frequency 
coordination of each individual site (e.g., for each satellite and the 
spectrum associated therewith) shall be completed prior to filing 
Commission notification. The coordination must be conducted in 
accordance with Sec. 25.203. Such notification shall be done by 
electronic filing and shall be consistent with the technical parameters 
of Schedule B of FCC Form 312.
    (iii) Following successful coordination of such an earth station, if 
the earth station operator does not file a lead application or a 
Schedule B within six months after it successfully completes 
coordination, it will be assumed that such frequency use is no longer 
desired, unless a second notification has been received within ten days 
prior to the end of the six month period. Such renewal notifications 
must be sent to all parties concerned. If the lead application or 
Schedule B, or renewal notification, is not timely received, the 
coordination will lapse and the licensee must re-coordinate the relevant 
earth stations if it still wishes to bring them into operation.
    (iv) Operation of each individual site may commence immediately 
after the public notice is released that identifies the notification 
sent to the Commission and if the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(vi) 
of this section are met. Continuance of operation of each station for 
the duration of the lead license term shall be dependent upon successful 
completion of the normal public notice process. If any objections are 
received to the new station prior to the end of the 30 day comment 
period of the Public Notice, the licensee shall immediately cease 
operation of those particular stations until the coordination dispute is 
resolved and the CSAT licensee informs the Commission of the resolution. 
If the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section are not met, 
operation may not commence until the Commission issues the public notice 
acting on the CSAT terminal authorization.
    (v) Each CSAT licensee shall annually provide the Commission an 
updated list of all operational earth stations in its system. The annual 
list shall also include a list of all earth stations deactivated during 
the year and identification of the satellites providing service to the 
network as of the date of the report.
    (vi) Conditional authorization. (A) An applicant for a new CSAT 
radio station or modification of an existing CSAT station authorized 
under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section in the 3700-4200; or 5925-6425 
MHz bands may operate the proposed station during the pendency of its 
application after the release of the public notice accepting the 
notification for filing that complies with paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this 
section. The applicant, however, must first certify that the following 
conditions are satisfied:
    (1) The frequency coordination procedures of Sec. 25.203 have been 
successfully completed;
    (2) The antenna structure has been previously studied by the Federal 
Aviation Administration and determined to pose no hazard to aviation 
safety as required by subpart B of part 17 of this chapter; or the 
antenna or tower structure does not exceed 6.1 meters above ground level 
or above an existing man-made structure (other than an antenna 
structure), if the antenna or tower has not been previously studied by 
the Federal Aviation Administration and cleared by the FCC;
    (3) The grant of the application(s) does not require a waiver of the 
Commission's rules (with the exception of a request for waiver 
pertaining to fees);
    (4) The applicant has determined that the facility(ies) will not 
significantly affect the environment as defined in Sec. 1.1307 of this 
chapter;
    (5) The station site does not lie within 56.3 kilometers of any 
international

[[Page 169]]

border or within a radio ``Quiet Zone'' identified in Sec. 1.924 of 
this chapter; and
    (6) The filed application is consistent with the proposal that was 
coordinated pursuant to Sec. 25.251.
    (B) Conditional authority ceases immediately if the Schedule B is 
returned by the Commission because it is not accepted for filing.
    (C) A conditional authorization pursuant to paragraphs (c)(2)(vi)(A) 
and (c)(2)(vi)(B) of this section is evidenced by retaining a copy of 
the Schedule B notification with the station records. Conditional 
authorization does not prejudice any action the Commission may take on 
the subject application(s) or the Schedule B notifications.
    (D) Conditional authority is accepted with the express understanding 
that such authority may be modified or cancelled by the Commission at 
any time without hearing if, in the Commission's discretion, the need 
for such action arises. An applicant operating pursuant to this 
conditional authority assumes all risks associated with such operation, 
the termination or modification of the conditional authority, or the 
subsequent dismissal or denial of its application(s).
    (E) The copy of the Schedule B notification form must be posted at 
each station operating pursuant to this section.
    (vii) Period of construction. Construction of each earth station 
must be completed and the station must be brought into regular operation 
within twelve months from the date that action is taken to authorize 
that station to operate under the lead authorization, except as may be 
otherwise determined by the Commission for any particular application.
    (d) User transceivers in the NVNG, 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile-Satellite 
Service, and 2 GHz Mobile-Satellite Service need not be individually 
licensed. Service vendors may file blanket applications for transceivers

superimposed, as follows:

[[Page 170]]

    (i) Showing off-axis co-polarized EIRP spectral density in the 
azimuth plane, for off-axis angles from minus 10[deg] to plus 10[deg] 
and from minus 180[deg] to plus 180[deg];
    (ii) Showing off-axis co-polarized EIRP spectral density in the 
elevation plane, at off-axis angles from 0[deg]to plus 30[deg];
    (iii) Showing off-axis cross-polarized EIRP spectral density in the 
azimuth plane, at off-axis angles from minus 10[deg] to plus 10[deg]; 
and
    (iv) Showing off-axis cross-polarized EIRP spectral density in the 
elevation plane, at off-axis angles from minus 10[deg] to plus 10[deg]
    (2) A certification on Schedule B that the antenna conforms to the 
gain pattern criteria of Sec. Sec. 25.209(a) and (b), that when 
combined with input power density (computed from the maximum on-axis 
EIRP density per carrier less the antenna gain entered in Schedule B), 
demonstrates that the off-axis EIRP spectral density envelope set forth

    (h) Any earth station applicant filing an application pursuant to 
Sec. 25.218 of this chapter must file three tables showing the off-axis 
EIRP level of the proposed earth station antenna of the plane of the 
geostationary orbit, the elevation plane, and towards the horizon. In 
each table, the EIRP level must be provided at increments of 0.1[deg] 
for angles between 0[deg] and 10[deg] off-axis, and at increments of 
5[deg] for angles between 10[deg] and 180[deg] off-axis.
    (1) For purposes of the off-axis EIRP table in the plane of the 
geostationary orbit, the off-axis angle is the angle in degrees from the 
line connecting the focal point of the antenna to the target satellite, 
within the plane determined by the focal point of the antenna and the 
line tangent to the arc of the geostationary satellite orbit at the 
position of the target satellite.
    (2) For purposes of the off-axis EIRP table in the elevation plane, 
the off-axis angle is the angle in degrees from the line connecting the 
focal point of the antenna to the target satellite, within the plane 
perpendicular to the plane determined by the focal point of the antenna 
and the line tangent to the arc of the geostationary satellite orbit at 
the position of the target satellite.
    (3) For purposes of the off-axis EIRP table towards the horizon, the 
off-axis angle is the angle in degrees from the line determined by the 
intersection of the horizontal plane and the elevation plane described 
in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, in the horizontal plane. The 
horizontal plane is the plane determined by the focal point of the 
antenna and the horizon.
    (4) In addition, in an attachment to its application, the earth 
station applicant must certify that it will limit its pointing error to 
0.5[deg], or demonstrate that it will comply with the applicable off-
axis EIRP envelopes in Sec. 25.218 of this part when the antenna is 
mispointed at its maximum pointing error.
    (i) Any earth station applicant filing an application for a VSAT 
network made up of FSS earth stations and planning to use a contention 
protocol must include in its application a certification that it will 
comply with the requirements of Sec. 25.134(g)(4).

considered only after previously filed space station license 
applications or space station modification applications have been 
considered.
    (iv) Applications for modifications of space station authorizations 
to increase the authorized bandwidth will not be considered in cases in 
which the original space station authorization was granted pursuant to 
the procedures set forth in Sec. 25.157(e) or Sec. 25.158(c)(4).
    (v) Any 17/24 GHz BSS space station operator whose license is 
conditioned to operate at less than the power level otherwise permitted 
by Sec. Sec. 25.208(c) and/or (w) of this part, and is conditioned to 
accept interference from a neighboring 17/24 GHz BSS space station, may 
file a modification application to remove those two conditions in the 
event that the license for that neighboring space station is cancelled 
or surrendered. In the event that two or more such modification 
applications are filed, and those applications are mutually exclusive, 
the modification applications will be considered on a first-come, first-
served basis pursuant to the procedure set forth in Sec. 25.158 of this 
part.
    (3) In the event that a space station licensee provides notification 
of a planned license modification pursuant to Sec. 25.118(e), and the 
Commission finds that the proposed modification does not meet the 
requirements of Sec. 25.118(e), the Commission will issue a public 
notice announcing that the proposed license modification will be 
considered pursuant to the procedure specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and 
(d)(2) of this section.
    (e) [Reserved]
    (f) An application for modification of a space station license to 
add an ancillary terrestrial component to an eligible satellite network 
will be treated as a request for a minor modification if the particulars 
of operations provided by the applicant comply with the criteria 
specified in Sec. 25.149. Notwithstanding the treatment of such an 
application as a minor modification, the Commission shall place any 
initial application for the modification of a space station license to 
add an ancillary terrestrial component on notice for public comment. 
Except as provided for in Sec. 25.149(f), no application for authority 
to add an ancillary terrestrial component to an eligible satellite 
network shall be granted until the applicant has demonstrated actual 
compliance with the criteria specified in Sec. 25.149(b).
    (g) In cases where an earth station licensee proposes additional 
transmitters, facilities, or modifications, the resulting transmissions 
of which can reasonably be expected to cause the power density to exceed 
the RF exposure limits specified in part 1, subpart I of this chapter by 
five percent, the licensee must submit an environmental assessment 
pursuant to Sec. 1.1307(b)(3)(i) of this chapter as an attachment to 
its modification application.

Sec. 25.120  Application for special temporary authorization.

    (a) In circumstances requiring immediate or temporary use of 
facilities, request may be made for special temporary authority to 
install and/or operate new or modified equipment. The request must 
contain the full particulars of the proposed operation including all 
facts sufficient to justify the temporary authority sought and the 
public interest therein. No request for temporary authority will be 
considered unless it is received by the Commission at least 3 working 
days prior to the date of proposed construction or operation or, where 
an extension is sought, the expiration date of the existing temporary 
authorization. A request received within less than 3 working days may be 
accepted only upon due showing of extraordinary reasons for the delay in 
submitting the request which could not have been earlier foreseen by the 
applicant. A copy of the request for special temporary authority also 
shall be forwarded to the Commission's Columbia Operations Center, 9200 
Farm House Lane, Columbia, MD 21046-1609.
    (b)(1) The Commission may grant a temporary authorization only upon 
a finding that there are extraordinary circumstances requiring temporary 
operations in the public interest and that delay in the institution of 
these temporary operations would seriously prejudice the public 
interest. Convenience to the applicant, such as marketing considerations 
or meeting scheduled customer in-service dates, will not be deemed 
sufficient for this purpose.
    (2) The Commission may grant a temporary authorization for a period 
not to exceed 180 days, with additional periods not exceeding 180 days, 
if the Commission has placed the special temporary authority (STA) 
request on public notice.
    (3) The Commission may grant a temporary authorization for a period 
not to exceed 60 days, if the STA request has not been placed on public 
notice, and the applicant plans to file a request for regular authority 
for the service.
    (4) The Commission may grant a temporary authorization for a period 
not to exceed 30 days, if the STA request has not been placed on public 
notice, and an application for regular authority is not contemplated.
    (c) Each application proposing construction of one or more earth 
station antennas or alteration of the overall height of one or more 
existing earth station antenna structures, where FAA notification prior 
to such construction or alteration is required by part 17 of this 
chapter, must include the FCC Antenna Structure Registration Number(s) 
for the affected satellite earth station antenna(s). If no such number 
has been assigned at the time the application(s) is filed, the applicant 
must state in the application whether the satellite earth station 
antenna owner has notified the FAA of the proposed construction or 
alteration and applied to the FCC for an Antenna Structure Registration 
Number in accordance with part 17 of this chapter. Applications 
proposing construction of one or more earth station antennas or 
alteration of the overall height of one or more existing earth station 
antennas, where FAA notification prior to such construction or 
alteration is not required by part 17 of this chapter, must indicate 
such and, unless the satellite earth station antenna is 6.10 meters or 
less above ground level (AGL), must contain a statement explaining why 
FAA notification is not required.

manufacturer's range test plots of the antenna gain patterns specified 
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (c) The tests specified in paragraph (b) of this section are 
normally performed at the manufacturer's facility; but for those 
antennas that are very large and only assembled on-site, on-site 
measurements may be used for product qualification data. If on-site data 
is to be used for qualification, the test frequencies and number of 
patterns should follow, where possible, the recommendations in paragraph 
(b) of this section, and the test data is to be submitted in the same 
manner as described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) For each new or modified transmitting antenna over 3 meters in 
diameter, the following on-site verification measurements must be 
completed at one frequency on an available transponder in each frequency 
band of interest and submitted to the Commission.
    (1) Co-polarized patterns in the elevation plane, plus and minus 7 
degrees, in the transmit band.
    (2) Co-polarized patterns in the azimuth and elevation planes, plus 
and minus 7 degrees, in the receive band.
    (3) System cross-polarization discrimination on-axis. The FCC 
envelope specified in Sec. 25.209 shall be superimposed on each 
pattern. The transmit patterns are to be measured with the aid of a co-
operating earth station in coordination with the satellite system 
control center under the provisions of Sec. 25.272.
    (e) Certification that the tests required by paragraph (c) of this 
section have been satisfactorily performed shall be provided to the 
Commission in notification that construction of the facilities has been 
completed as required by Sec. 25.133.
    (f) Antennas less than 3 meters in diameter and antennas on simple 
(manual) drive mounts that are operated at a fixed site are exempt from 
the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section provided that 
a detailed technical showing is made that confirms proper installation, 
pointing procedures, and polarization alignment and manufacturing 
quality control. These showing must also include a plan for periodic 
testing and field installation procedures and precautions.
    (g) Records of the results of the tests required by this section 
must be maintained at the antenna site or the earth station operator's 
control center and be available for inspection.

earth stations operating in the 1.6/2.4 GHz and 1.5/1.6 GHz Mobile 
Satellite Services are subject to the following operating conditions:
    (a) User transceiver units associated with the 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile-
Satellite Service or 2 GHz Mobile-Satellite Service may not be operated 
on civil aircraft unless the earth station has a direct physical 
connection to the aircraft cabin or cockpit communication system.
    (b) No person without an FCC license for such operation may transmit 
to a space station in this service from anywhere in the United States 
except to receive service from the holder of a pertinent FCC blanket 
license or from another party with the permission of such a blanket 
licensee.
    (c) The holder of an FCC blanket license for operation of 
transceivers for communication via a 1.6/2.4 GHz, 1.5/1.6 GHz, or 2 GHz 
Mobile Satellite Service system shall be responsible for operation of 
any such transceiver to receive service provided by that licensee or 
provided by another party with the blanket licensee's consent. Operators 
of such satellite systems shall not transmit communications to or from 
user transceivers in the United States unless such communications are 
authorized under a service contract with the holder of a pertinent FCC 
blanket license for transceiver operation or under a service contract 
with another party with authority for such transmission delegated by 
such a blanket licensee.
    (d) Any mobile earth station (MES) associated with the Mobile 
Satellite Service operating in the 1530-1544 MHz and 1626.5-1645.5 MHz 
bands shall have the following minimum set of capabilities to ensure 
compliance with Footnote S5.353A and the priority and real-time 
preemption requirements imposed by Footnote US315.
    (1) All MES transmissions shall have a priority assigned to them 
that preserves the priority and preemptive access given to maritime 
distress and safety communications sharing the band.
    (2) Each MES with a requirement to handle maritime distress and 
safety data communications shall be capable of either:
    (i) Recognizing message and call priority identification when 
transmitted from its associated Land Earth Station (LES) or
    (ii) Accepting message and call priority identification embedded in 
the message or call when transmitted from its associated LES and passing 
the identification to shipboard data message processing equipment.

[[Page 183]]

    (3) Each MES shall be assigned a unique terminal identification 
number that will be transmitted upon any attempt to gain access to a 
system.
    (4) After an MES has gained access to a system, the mobile terminal 
shall be under control of a LES and shall obtain all channel assignments 
from it.
    (5) All MESs that do not continuously monitor a separate signalling 
channel or signalling within the communications channel shall monitor 
the signalling channel at the end of each transmission.
    (6) Each MES shall automatically inhibit its transmissions if it is 
not correctly receiving separate signalling channel or signalling within 
the communications channel from its associated LES.
    (7) Each MES shall automatically inhibit its transmissions on any or 
all channels upon receiving a channel-shut-off command on a signalling 
or communications channel it is receiving from its associated LES.
    (8) Each MES with a requirement to handle maritime distress and 
safety communications shall have the capability within the station to 
automatically preempt lower precedence traffic.
    (e) Any Land Earth Station (LES) associated with the Mobile 
Satellite Service operating in the 1530-1544 MHz and 1626.5-1645.5 MHz 
bands shall have the following minimum set of capabilities to ensure 
that the MSS system complies with Footnote S5.353A and the priority and 
real-time preemption requirements imposed by Footnote US315. It should 
be noted that the LES operates in the Fixed-Satellite Service (``FSS'') 
as a feeder-link for the MSS (Radio Regulations 71) and that the 
following capabilities are to facilitate the priority and preemption 
requirements. The FSS feeder-link stations fulfilling these MSS 
requirements shall not have any additional priority with respect to FSS 
stations operating with other FSS systems.
    (1) All LES transmissions to mobile earth stations (MESs) shall have 
a priority assigned to them that preserves the priority and preemptive 
access given to maritime distress and safety communications.
    (2) The LES shall recognize the priority of calls to and from MES 
and make channel assignments taking into account the priority access 
that is given to maritime distress and safety communications.
    (3) The LES shall be capable of receiving the MES identification 
number when transmitted and verifying that it is an authorized user of 
the system to prohibit unauthorized access.
    (4) The LES shall be capable of transmitting channel assignment 
commands to the MESs.
    (5) The communications channels used between the LES and the MES 
shall have provision for signalling within the voice/data channel, for 
an MES, which does not continuously monitor the LES signalling channel 
during the time of a call.
    (6) The LES shall transmit periodic control signalling signals to 
MES, which do not continuously monitor the LES signalling channel.
    (7) The LES shall automatically inhibit all transmissions to MESs to 
which it is not transmitting a signalling channel or signalling within 
the communications channel.
    (8) The LES shall be capable of transmitting channel-shut-off 
commands to the MESs on signalling or communications channels.
    (9) Each LES shall be capable of interrupting, and if necessary, 
preempting ongoing routine traffic from an MES in order to complete a 
maritime distress, urgency or safety call to that particular MES.
    (10) Each LES shall be capable of automatically turning off one or 
more of its associated channels in order to complete a maritime 
distress, urgency or safety call.
    (f) Incorporation of ancillary terrestrial component base station 
into an L-band mobile-satellite service system. Any licensee authorized 
to construct and launch an L-band mobile-satellite system may construct 
ancillary terrestrial component (ATC) base stations as defined in Sec. 
25.201 at its own risk and subject to the conditions specified in this 
subpart any time after commencing construction of the mobile-satellite 
service system.
    (g) Pre-operational build-out and testing. An MSS licensee may, 
without further authority from the Commission

[[Page 184]]

and at its own risk engage in pre-operational build-out and, conduct 
equipment tests for the purpose of making such adjustments and 
measurements as may be necessary to assure compliance with the terms of 
the technical provisions of its MSS license, ATC operation requirements, 
the rules and regulations in this Part and the applicable engineering 
standards. Prior to engaging in such pre-operational build-out and 
testing, an MSS licensee must notify the Commission concerning the 
initiation of MSS system satellite construction and the MSS operator's 
intent to construct and test ATC facilities. This notification must take 
the form of a letter formally filed with the Commission in the 
appropriate MSS license docket. Such letter shall specify the 
frequencies on which the MSS licensee proposes to engage in pre-
operational testing and shall specify the name, address, telephone 
number and other such information as may be necessary to contact a MSS 
licensee representative for the reporting and mitigation of any 
interference that may occur as a result of such pre-operational testing 
and build-out. MSS licensees engaging in pre-operational build-out and 
testing must also comply with Sec. Sec. 5.83, 5.85(c), 5.111, and 5.117 
of this chapter relating to experimental operations. An MSS licensee may 
not offer ATC service to the public for compensation during pre-
operational testing. In order to operate any ATC base stations, such a 
licensee must meet all the requirements set forth in Sec. 25.147 and 
must have been granted ATC authority.
    (h) Aircraft. All portable or hand-held transceiver units (including 
transceiver units installed in other devices that are themselves

information demonstrating that U.S.-licensed satellite systems have 
effective competitive opportunities to provide analogous services in:
    (1) The country in which the non-U.S. licensed space station is 
licensed; and
    (2) All countries in which communications with the U.S. earth 
station will originate or terminate. The applicant bears the burden of 
showing that there are no practical or legal constraints that limit or 
prevent access of the U.S. satellite system in the relevant foreign 
markets. The exhibit required by this paragraph must also include a 
statement of why grant of the application is in the public interest. 
This paragraph shall not apply with respect to requests for authority to 
operate using a non-U.S. licensed satellite that is licensed by or 
seeking a license from a country that is a member of the World Trade 
Organization for services covered under the World Trade Organization 
Basic Telecommunications Agreement.
    (b) Earth station applicants, or entities filing a ``letter of 
intent,'' or ``Petition for Declaratory Ruling,'' requesting authority 
to operate with a non-U.S. licensed space station must attach to their 
FCC Form 312 an exhibit providing legal and technical information for 
the non-U.S. licensed space station in accordance with part 25. 
Applications addressed in this paragraph must be filed electronically 
through the International Bureau Filing System (IBFS).
    (c) A non-U.S. licensed NGSO-like satellite system seeking to serve 
the United States can be considered contemporaneously with other U.S. 
NGSO-like satellite system pursuant to Sec. 25.157 and considered 
before later-filed applications of other U.S. satellite system 
operators, and a non-U.S.-licensed GSO-like satellite system seeking to

[[Page 185]]

serve the United States can have its request placed in a queue pursuant 
to Sec. 25.158 and considered before later-filed applications of other 
U.S. satellite system operators, if the non-U.S. licensed satellite 
system is:
    (1) In orbit and operating;
    (2) Has a license from another administration; or
    (3) Has been submitted for coordination to the International 
Telecommunication Union.
    (d) Earth station applicants requesting authority to operate with a 
non-U.S.-licensed space station and non-U.S.-licensed satellite 
operators filing letters of intent or petitions for declaratory ruling 
to access the U.S. market must demonstrate that the non-U.S.-licensed 
space station has complied with all applicable Commission requirements 
for non-U.S. licensed systems to operate in the United States, including 
but not limited to the following:
    (1) Milestones;
    (2) Reporting requirements;
    (3) Any other applicable service rules;
    (4) For non-U.S.-licensed satellites that are not in orbit and 
operating, a bond must be posted. This bond must be in the amount of $5 
million for NGSO satellite systems, or $3 million for GSO satellites, 
denominated in U.S. dollars, and compliant with the terms of Sec. 
25.165 of this chapter. The party posting the bond will be permitted to 
reduce the amount of the bond upon a showing that a milestone has been 
met, in accordance with the terms of Sec. 25.165(d) of this chapter.
    (5) Non-U.S. licensed GSO-like space station operators with a total 
of five requests for access to the U.S. market in a particular frequency 
band, or a total of five previously granted requests for access to the 
U.S. market with unbuilt GSO-like space stations in a particular 
frequency band, or a combination of pending GSO-like requests and 
granted requests for unbuilt GSO-like space stations in a particular 
frequency band that equals five, will not be permitted to request access 
to the U.S. market with another GSO-like space station license in that 
frequency band. In addition, non-U.S.-licensed NGSO-like satellite 
system operators with one request on file with the Commission in a 
particular frequency band, or one granted request for an unbuilt NGSO-
like satellite system in a particular frequency band, will not be 
permitted to request access to the U.S. market with another NGSO-like 
satellite system in that frequency band.
    (e) A non-U.S.-licensed satellite operator that is seeking to serve 
the United States pursuant to a Letter of Intent may amend its request

applicants for purposes of determining the order in which the Letters of 
Intent will be considered relative to other pending applications.
    (f) A non-U.S.-licensed satellite operator that has been permitted 
to serve the United States pursuant to a Letter of Intent or Petition 
for Declaratory Ruling, may modify its U.S. operations under the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 25.117(d). In addition, a non-U.S.-
licensed satellite operator that has been permitted to serve the United 
States pursuant to a Petition for Declaratory Ruling, may modify its 
U.S. operations under the procedures set forth in Sec. 25.118(e).
    (g) A non-U.S.-licensed satellite operator that has been permitted 
to serve the United States pursuant to a Petition for Declaratory Ruling 
must notify the Commission if it plans to transfer control or assign its 
license to another party, so that the Commission can afford interested 
parties an opportunity to comment on whether the proposed transaction 
affects any of the considerations we made when we allowed the satellite 
operator to enter the U.S. market. If the transferee or assignee is not 
licensed by or seeking a license from a country that is a member of the 
World Trade Organization for services covered under the World Trade 
Organization Basic Telecommunications Agreement, the non-U.S.-licensed 
satellite operator will be required to make the showing described in 
paragraph (a) of this section.

conditions shall not exceed 1.5 dB or 15 % of the actual amount of 
monitored excess attenuation in dB, whichever is larger, with a 
confidence level of 90 percent except over transient periods accounting 
for no more than 0.5% of the time during which the excess is no more 
than 4.0 dB.
    (6) Power flux-density (PFD) at the Earth's surface produced by 
emissions from a space station for all conditions, including clear sky, 
and for all methods of modulation shall not exceed a level of -118 dBW/
m\2\/MHz, in addition to the limits specified in Sec. 25.208 (d).
    (b) Each applicant for earth station license(s) that proposes levels 
in excess of those defined in paragraph (a) of this section shall submit 
link budget analyses of the operations proposed along with a detailed 
written explanation of how each uplink and each transmitted satellite 
carrier density figure is derived. Applicants shall also submit a 
narrative summary which must indicate whether there are margin 
shortfalls in any of the current baseline services as a result of the 
addition of the applicant's higher power service, and if so, how the 
applicant intends to resolve those margin short falls. Applicants shall 
certify that all potentially affected parties (i.e., those GSO FSS 
satellite networks that are 2, 4, and 6 degrees apart) acknowledge and 
do not object to the use of the applicant's higher power densities.
    (c) Licensees authorized pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
shall bear the burden of coordinating with any future applicants or 
licensees whose proposed compliant operations at 6 degrees or smaller 
orbital spacing, as defined by paragraph (a) of this section, is 
potentially or actually adversely affected by the operation of the non-
compliant licensee. If no good faith agreement can be reached, however, 
the non-compliant licensee shall reduce its earth station and space 
station power density levels to be compliant with those specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) The applicant shall provide for each earth station antenna type, 
a series of radiation patterns measured on a production antenna 
performed on a calibrated antenna range and, as a minimum, shall be made 
at the bottom, middle, and top frequencies of the 30 GHz band. The 
radiation patterns are:
    (1) Co-polarized patterns for each of two orthogonal senses of 
polarizations in two orthogonal planes of the antenna.
    (i) In the azimuth plane, plus and minus 10 degrees and plus and 
minus 180 degrees.
    (ii) In the elevation plane, zero to 30 degrees.
    (2) Cross-polarization patterns in the E- and H-planes, plus and 
minus 10 degrees.
    (3) Main beam gain.
    (e) Protection of receive earth stations from adjacent satellite 
interference is based on either the antenna performance specified in 
Sec. 25.209 (a) and (b), or the actual receiving earth station antenna 
performance, if actual performance provides greater isolation from 
adjacent satellite interference. For purposes of insuring the correct 
level of protection, the applicant shall provide, for each earth station 
antenna type, the antenna performance plots for the 20 GHz band, 
including the format specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (f) The earth station licensee shall not transmit towards a GSO FSS 
satellite unless it has prior authorization from the satellite operator 
or a space segment vendor authorized by the satellite operator. The 
specific transmission shall be conducted in accordance with the 
operating protocol specified by the satellite operator. The holder of an 
FCC blanket license pursuant to this section shall be responsible for 
operation of any transceiver to receive GSO FSS service provided by that 
licensee or provided by another party with the blanket licensee's 
consent. Operators of GSO FSS systems shall not transmit communications 
to or from user transceivers in the United States unless such 
communications are authorized under a service contract with the holder 
of a pertinent FCC

[[Page 188]]

blanket license or under a service contract with another party with 
authority for such transceiver operation delegated by such a blanket 
licensee.
    (g) A licensee applying to renew its license must include on FCC 
Form 405 the number of constructed earth stations.

Sec. 25.142  Licensing provisions for the non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service.

    (a) Space station application requirements. (1) Each application for 
a space station system authorization in the non-voice, non-geostationary 
mobile-satellite service shall describe in detail the proposed non-
voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite system, setting forth all 
pertinent technical and operational aspects of the system, and the 
technical and legal qualifications of the applicant. In particular, each 
application shall include the information specified in Sec. 25.114. 
Applicants must also file information demonstrating compliance with all 
requirements of this section, and showing, based on existing system 
information publicly available at the Commission at the time of filing, 
that they will not cause unacceptable interference to any non-voice, 
non-geostationary mobile-satellite service system authorized to 
construct or operate.
    (2) Applicants for a non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite 
must identify the power flux density produced at the Earth's surface by 
each space station of their system in the frequency bands 137-138 MHz 
and 400.15-401 MHz, to allow determination of whether coordination with 
terrestrial services is required under international footnotes 599A and 
647B of Sec. 2.106 of the Commission's Rules. In addition, applicants 
must identify the measures they would employ to protect the radio 
astronomy service in the 150.05-153 MHz and 406.1-410 MHz bands from 
harmful interference from unwanted emissions.
    (3) Emission limitations. (i) Applicants in the non-voice, non-
geostationary mobile-satellite service shall show that their space 
stations will not exceed the emission limitations of Sec. 25.202(f) 
(1), (2) and (3), as calculated for a fixed point on the Earth's surface 
in the plane of the space station's orbit, considering the worst-case 
frequency tolerance of all frequency determining components, and maximum 
positive and negative Doppler shift of both the uplink and downlink 
signals, taking into account the system design.
    (ii) Applicants in the non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite 
service shall show that no signal received by their satellites from 
sources outside of their system shall be retransmitted with a power flux 
density level, in the worst 4 kHz, higher than the level described by 
the applicants in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (4) [Reserved]
    (5) Replacement of space stations within the system license term. 
The licensee need not file separate applications to construct, launch 
and operate technically identical replacement satellites within the term 
of the system authorization. However, the licensee shall certify to the 
Commission, at least thirty days prior to launch of such replacement(s) 
that:
    (i) The licensee intends to launch a space station that is 
technically identical to those authorized in its system license, and
    (ii) Launch of this space station will not cause the licensee to 
exceed the

[[Page 191]]

total number of operating space stations authorized by the Commission.
    (b) Operating conditions. In order to ensure compatible operations 
with authorized users in the frequency bands to be utilized for 
operations in the non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service, 
non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service systems must 
operate in accordance with the conditions specified in this section.
    (1) Service limitation. Voice services may not be provided.
    (2) Coordination requirements with Federal government users.
    (i) The frequency bands allocated for use by the non-voice, non-
geostationary mobile-satellite service are also authorized for use by 
agencies of the Federal government. The Federal use of frequencies in 
the non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service frequency 
bands is under the regulatory jurisdiction of the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).
    (ii) The Commission will use its existing procedures for liaison 
with NTIA to reach agreement with respect to achieving compatible 
operations between Federal government users under the jurisdiction of 
NTIA and non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service systems 
(including user transceivers subject to blanket licensing under Sec. 
25.115(d)) through the frequency assignment and coordination practices 
established by NTIA and the Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee 
(IRAC). In order to facilitate such frequency assignment and 
coordination, applicants shall provide the Commission with sufficient 
information to evaluate electromagnetic compatibility with the Federal 
government use of the spectrum, and any additional information requested 
by the Commission. As part of the coordination process, applicants shall 
show that they will not cause unacceptable interference to authorized 
Federal government users, based upon existing system information 
provided by the Government. The frequency assignment and coordination of 
the satellite system with Federal government users shall be completed 
prior to grant of construction authorization.
    (iii) The Commission shall also coordinate with NTIA/IRAC with 
regard to the frequencies to be shared by those earth stations of non-
voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service systems that are not 
subject to blanket licensing under Sec. 25.115(d), and authorized 
Federal government stations in the fixed and mobile services, through 
the exchange of appropriate systems information.
    (3) Coordination among non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite 
service systems. Applicants for authority to establish non-voice, non-
geostationary mobile-satellite service systems are encouraged to 
coordinate their proposed frequency usage with existing permittees and 
licensees in the non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service 
whose facilities could be affected by the new proposal in terms of 
frequency interference or restricted system capacity. All affected 
applicants, permittees, and licensees shall, at the direction of the 
Commission, cooperate fully and make every reasonable effort to resolve 
technical problems and conflicts that may inhibit effective and 
efficient use of the radio spectrum; however, the permittee or licensee 
being coordinated with is not obligated to suggest changes or re-
engineer an applicant's proposal in cases involving conflicts.
    (4) Safety and distress communications. Stations operating in the 
non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service that are used to 
comply with any statutory or regulatory equipment carriage requirements 
may also be subject to the provisions of sections 321(b) and 359 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Licensees are advised that these 
provisions give priority to radio communications or signals relating to 
ships in distress and prohibit a charge for the transmission of maritime 
distress calls and related traffic.
    (c) Reporting requirements. All operators of non-voice, non-
geostationary mobile-satellite service systems shall, on June 30 of each 
year, file a report with the International Bureau and the Commission's 
Columbia Operations Center in Columbia, Maryland, containing the 
following information current as of May 31st of that year:

[[Page 192]]

    (1) A listing of any non-scheduled space station outages for more 
than thirty minutes and the cause(s) of such outages;
    (2) A detailed description of the utilization made of the in-orbit 
satellite system. That description should identify the percentage of 
time that the system is actually used for domestic transmission, the 
amount of capacity (if any) sold but not in service, and the amount of 
unused system capacity; and
    (3) Identification of any space stations not available for service 
or otherwise not performing to specifications, the cause(s) of these 
difficulties, and the date any space station was taken out of service or 
the malfunction identified.
    (d) Prohibition of certain agreements. No license shall be granted 
to any applicant for a non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite 
service system if that applicant, or any companies controlling or 
controlled by the applicant, shall acquire or enjoy any right, for the 
purpose of handling traffic to or from the United States, its 
territories or possessions, to construct or operate space segment or 
earth stations in the non-voice, non-geosynchronous mobile-satellite 
service, or to interchange traffic, which is denied to any other United 
States company by reason of any concession, contract, understanding, or 
working arrangement to which the licensee or any persons or companies 
controlling or controlled by the licensee are parties.
    (e) Spectrum priority. (1) The non-voice, non-geosynchronous mobile-
satellite service system that is authorized in the second application 
processing round to operate in the 148-148.25 MHz, 148.75-148.855 MHz, 
148.905-149.81 MHz and 150-150.05 MHz uplink frequency bands and the 
400.505-400.5517 MHz, 400.5983-400.645 MHz, 137.025-137.175 MHz, 
137.333-137.4125 MHz, 137.475-137.525 MHz, 137.595-137.645 MHz, 137.753-
137.787 MHz and 137.825-138 MHz downlink frequency bands (the ``System 2 
licensee'') will have a first priority to apply for and use a limited 
amount of downlink spectrum duly allocated worldwide and domestically to 
the non-voice, non-geosynchronous mobile-satellite service by the ITU, 
at WRC-97 or a subsequent World Radiocommunication Conference, and by 
the Commission, respectively (the ``Future Spectrum''). The System 2 
licensee will be eligible to apply for and use the first 210 kHz of 
Future Spectrum plus spectrum sufficient to account for Doppler 
frequency shift in the Future Spectrum (the ``Supplemental Spectrum'') 
to implement its non-voice, non-geosynchronous mobile-satellite service 
system. The System 2 licensee's application for and use of the 
Supplemental Spectrum is subject to the Commission's Rules and policies, 
such reasonable operating conditions as may be imposed by the 
Commission, and international spectrum coordination requirements. For so 
long as the System 2 licensee is permitted by the Government of France 
to operate in the 400.5517-400.5983 MHz band coordinated with the French 
system S80-1, the Supplemental Spectrum shall be reduced to an amount 
equivalent to 150 kHz of Future Spectrum plus spectrum sufficient to 
account for Doppler frequency shift in the Future Spectrum.
    (2) The System 2 licensee's priority to apply for and use the 
Supplemental Spectrum is conditioned on the System 2 licensee's 
compliance with the terms and conditions of its second processing round 
authorization, including, but not limited to, its system construction, 
launch and operation milestones, and any modifications thereto, and the 
Commission's Rules. The System 2 licensee's priority to apply for and 
use the Supplemental Spectrum shall automatically terminate upon the 
occurrence of any of the following events:
    (i) The System 2 licensee being permitted to operate in the 
Supplemental Spectrum;
    (ii) The expiration or revocation of the System 2 licensee's second 
processing round authorization;
    (iii) The discontinuance of use of the spectrum assigned to the 
System 2 licensee under its second processing round authorization; or
    (iv) The surrender of the System 2 licensee's second processing 
round authorization to the Commission.

    (3) [Reserved]
    (c) Replacement of Space Stations Within the System License Term. 
Licensees of 1.6/2.4 GHz mobile-satellite systems authorized through a 
blanket license pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section need not file 
separate applications to construct, launch and operate technically 
identical replacement satellites within the term of the system 
authorization. However, the licensee shall certify to the Commission, at 
least thirty days prior to launch of such replacement(s) that:
    (1) The licensee intends to launch a space station that is 
technically identical to those authorized in its system authorization, 
and
    (2) Launch of this space station will not cause the licensee to 
exceed the total number of operating space stations authorized by the 
Commission.
    (d) In-Orbit Spares. Licensees need not file separate applications 
to operate technically identical in-orbit spares authorized as part of 
the blanket license pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. However, 
the licensee shall certify to the Commission, within 10 days of bringing 
the in-orbit spare into operation, that operation of this space station

Sec. 25.146  Licensing and operating authorization provisions for the 

non-geostationary satellite orbit fixed-satellite service (NGSO FSS) in the bands 10.7 
          GHz to 14.5 GHz.

    (a) A comprehensive technical showing shall be submitted for the 
proposed non-geostationary satellite orbit fixed-satellite service (NGSO 
FSS) system in the bands 10.7 GHz to 14.5 GHz. The technical information 
shall demonstrate that the proposed NGSO FSS system would not exceed the 
validation equivalent power flux-density (EPFD) limits as specified in 
Sec. 25.208 (g), (k), and (l) for EPFD<INF>down</INF>, and 
EPFD<INF>up</INF>. If the technical demonstration exceeds the validation 
EPFD limits at any test points within the U.S. for domestic service and 
at any points outside of the U.S. for international service or at any 
points in the geostationary satellite orbit, as appropriate, the 
application would be unacceptable for filing and will be returned to the 
applicant with a brief statement identifying the non-compliance 
technical demonstration. The technical showing consists of the 
following:
    (1) Single-entry validation equivalent power flux-density, in the 
space-to-Earth direction, (EPFDdown) limits. (i) Provide a set of power 
flux-density (pfd) masks, on the surface of the Earth, for each space 
station in the NGSO FSS system. The pfd masks shall be generated in 
accordance with the specification stipulated in the ITU-R Recommendation 
BO.1503, ``Functional Description to be used in Developing Software 
Tools for Determining Conformity of Non-GSO FSS Networks with Limits 
Contained in Article S22 of the Radio Regulations.'' In particular, the 
pfd mask must encompass the power flux-density radiated by the space 
station regardless of the satellite transmitter power resource 
allocation and traffic/beam switching strategy that are used at 
different periods of a NGSO FSS system life. The pfd masks shall also be 
in an electronic form that can be accessed by the computer program 
contained in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (ii) Identify and describe in detail the assumptions and conditions 
used in generating the power flux-density masks.
    (iii) If a computer program that has been approved by the ITU for 
determining compliance with the single-entry EPFD<INF>down</INF> 
validation limits is not yet available, the applicant shall provide a 
computer program for the single-entry EPFD<INF>down</INF> validation 
computation, including both the source code and the executable file. 
This computer program shall be developed in accordance with the 
specification stipulated in Recommendation ITU-R S.1503 (2000). If the 
applicant uses the ITU approved software, the applicant shall indicate 
the program name and the version used.
    (iv) Identify and describe in detail the necessary input parameters 
for the execution of the computer program identified in paragraph 
(a)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (v) Provide the result, the cumulative probability distribution 
function of EPFD, of the execution of the computer program described in 
paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section by using only the input parameters 
contained in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(iv) of this section.
    (2) Single-entry validation equivalent power flux-density, in the 
Earth-to-space direction, EPFDup limits. (i) Provide a set of NGSO FSS 
earth station maximum equivalent isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.) 
mask as a function of the off-axis angle generated by a NGSO FSS earth 
station. The maximum e.i.r.p. mask shall be generated in accordance with 
the specification stipulated in the ITU-R Recommendation BO.1503. In 
particular, the results of calculations encompass what would be radiated 
regardless of the earth station transmitter power resource allocation 
and traffic/beam switching strategy are used at different periods of a 
NGSO FSS system life. The e.i.r.p. masks shall also be in an electronic 
form that can be accessed by the computer program contained in paragraph 
(a)(2)(iii) of this section.

[[Page 200]]

    (ii) Identify and describe in detail the assumptions and conditions 
used in generating the maximum earth station e.i.r.p. mask.
    (iii) If a computer program that has been approved by the ITU for 
determining compliance with the single-entry EPFD<INF>up</INF> 
validation limits is not yet available, the applicant shall provide a 
computer program for the single-entry EPFD<INF>up</INF> validation 
computation, including both the source code and the executable file. 
This computer program shall be developed in accordance with the 
specification stipulated in Recommendation ITU-R S.1503 (2000). If the 
applicant uses the ITU approved software, the applicant shall indicate 
the program name and the version used.
    (iv) Identify and describe in detail the necessary input parameters 
for the execution of the computer program identified in paragraph 
(a)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (v) Provide the result of the execution of the computer program 
described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section by using only the 
input parameters contained in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(iv) of 
this section.
    (b) Ninety days prior to the initiation of service to the public, 
the NGSO FSS system licensee shall submit a comprehensive technical 
showing for the non-geostationary satellite orbit fixed-satellite 
service (NGSO FSS) system in the bands 10.7 GHz to 14.5 GHz. The 
technical information shall demonstrate that the NGSO FSS system is 
expected not to operate in excess of the additional operational 
EPFD<INF>down</INF> limits and the operational EPFD<INF>down</INF> 
limits as specified in Sec. 25.208 (i), (j) and notes 2 and 3 to the 
table in paragraph (l). If the technical demonstration exceeds the 
additional operational EPFD<INF>down</INF> limits or the operational 
EPFD<INF>down</INF> limits at any test points with the U.S. for domestic 
service and at any test points out side of the U.S. for international 
service, the NGSO FSS system licensee shall not initiate service to the 
public until the deficiency has been rectified by reducing satellite 
transmission power or other adjustments. This must be substantiated by 
subsequent technical showings. The technical showings consist of the 
following:
    (1) Single-entry additional operational equivalent power flux-
density, in the space-to-Earth direction, (additional operational 
EPFDdown) limits. (i) Provide a set of anticipated operational power 
flux-density (pfd) masks, on the surface of the Earth, for each space 
station in the NGSO FSS system. The anticipated operational power flux-
density masks could be generated by using the method specified in ITU-R 
Recommendation BO.1503. In particular, the anticipated operational pfd 
mask shall take into account the expected maximum traffic loading 
distributions and geographic specific scheduling of the actual measured 
space station antenna patterns (see Sec. 25.210(k)). The anticipated 
operational power flux-density masks shall also be in an electronic form 
that can be accessed by the computer program contained in paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (ii) Identify and describe in detail the assumptions and conditions 
used in generating the anticipated operational power flux-density masks.
    (iii) Provide a computer program for the single-entry additional 
operational EPFD<INF>down</INF> verification computation, including both 
the source code and the executable file. This computer program could be 
developed by using the method specified in ITU-R Recommendation BO.1503.
    (iv) Identify and describe in detail the necessary input parameters 
for the execution of the additional operational EPFD<INF>down</INF> 
verification computer program identified in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of 
this section.

<R05>
Sec. 25.148  Licensing provisions for the Direct Broadcast Satellite Service.

    (a) License terms. License terms for DBS facilities are specified in 
Sec. 25.121(a).
    (b) Due diligence. (1) All persons granted DBS authorizations shall 
proceed with due diligence in constructing DBS systems. Permittees shall 
be required to complete contracting for construction of the satellite 
station(s) within one year of the grant of the authorization. The 
satellite stations shall also be required to be in operation within six 
years of the authorization grant.
    (2) In addition to the requirements stated in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, all persons who receive new or additional DBS 
authorizations after January 19, 1996 shall complete construction of the 
first satellite in their respective DBS systems within four years of 
grant of the authorization. All satellite stations in such a DBS system 
shall be in operation within six years of the grant of the 
authorization.
    (3) DBS licensees shall be required to proceed consistent with all 
applicable due diligence obligations, unless otherwise determined by the 
Commission upon proper showing in any particular case. Transfer of 
control of the authorization shall not be considered to justify 
extension of these deadlines.
    (c) Geographic service requirements. Those entities acquiring DBS 
authorizations after January 19, 1996, or who after January 19, 1996 
modify a previous DBS authorization to launch a replacement satellite, 
must provide DBS service to Alaska and Hawaii where such service is 
technically feasible from the authorized orbital location. This 
requirement does not apply to DBS satellites authorized to operate at 
the 61.5[deg] W.L. orbital location. DBS applicants seeking to operate 
from locations other than 61.5[deg] W.L. who do not provide service to 
Alaska and Hawaii, must provide technical analyses to the Commission 
demonstrating that such service is not feasible as a technical matter, 
or that while technically feasible such services would require so many 
compromises in satellite design and operation as to make it economically 
unreasonable.
    (d) DBS subject to competitive bidding. Mutually exclusive initial 
applications to provide DBS are subject to competitive bidding 
procedures. The general competitive bidding procedures set

[[Page 204]]

forth in part 1, subpart Q of this chapter will apply unless otherwise 
provided in this part.
    (e) DBS long form application. Winning bidders are subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 1.2107 of this chapter except that in lieu of a FCC 
Form 601 each winning bidder shall submit the long-form satellite 
service application (FCC Form 312) within thirty (30) days after being 
notified by Public Notice that it is the winning bidder. Each winning 
bidder will also be required to submit by the same deadline the 
information described in Sec. 25.215 (Technical) and Sec. 25.601 
(EEO), and in paragraph (f) of this section. Each winner also will be 
required to file, by the same deadline, a signed statement describing 
its efforts to date and future plans to come into compliance with any 
applicable spectrum limitations, if it is not already in compliance. 
Such information shall be submitted pursuant to the procedures set forth 
in Sec. 25.114 and any associated Public Notices.
    (f) Technical qualifications. DBS operations must be in accordance 
with the sharing criteria and technical characteristics contained in 
Appendices 30 and 30A of the ITU's Radio Regulations. Operation of 
systems using differing technical characteristics may be permitted, with 
adequate technical showing, and if a request has been made to the ITU to 
modify the appropriate Plans to include the system's technical 
parameters.

Sec. 25.149  Application requirements for ancillary terrestrial components 

in the mobile-satellite service networks operating in the 1.5./1.6 GHz, 1.6/2.4 GHz 
          and 2 GHz mobile-satellite service.

    (a) Applicants for ancillary terrestrial component authority shall 
demonstrate that the applicant does or will comply with the following 
through certification or explanatory technical exhibit, as appropriate:
    (1) ATC shall be deployed in the forward-band mode of operation 
whereby the ATC mobile terminals transmit in the MSS uplink bands and 
the ATC base stations transmit in the MSS downlink bands in portions of 
the 2000-2020 MHz/2180-2200 MHz bands (2 GHz band), the 1626.5-1660.5 
MHz/1525-1559 MHz bands (L-band), and the 1610-1626.5 MHz/2483.5-2500 
MHz bands (Big LEO band).

    Note to paragraph (a)(1): An L-band MSS licensee is permitted to 
apply for ATC authorization based on a non-forward-band mode of 
operation provided it is able to demonstrate that the use of a non-
forward-band mode of operation would produce no greater potential 
interference than that produced as a result of implementing the rules of 
this section.

    (2) ATC operations shall be limited to certain frequencies:
    (i) In the 2000-2020 MHz/2180-2200 MHz bands (2 GHz MSS band), ATC 
operations are limited to the selected assignment of the 2 GHz MSS 
licensee that seeks ATC authority.
    (ii) In the 1626.5-1660.5 MHz/1525-1559 MHz bands (L-band), ATC 
operations are limited to the frequency assignments authorized and 
internationally coordinated for the MSS system of the MSS licensee that 
seeks ATC authority.
    (iii) In the 1610-1626.5 MHz/2483.5-2500 MHz bands (Big LEO bands), 
ATC operations are limited to the 1610-1617.775 MHz, 1621.35-1626.5 MHz, 
and 2483.5-2495 MHz bands and to the specific frequencies authorized for 
use by the MSS licensee that seeks ATC authority.
    (3) ATC operations shall not exceed the geographical coverage area 
of the mobile satellite service network of the applicant for ATC 
authority.
    (4) ATC base stations shall comply with all applicable antenna and 
structural clearance requirements established in part 17 of this 
chapter.
    (5) ATC base stations and mobile terminals shall comply with part 1 
of this chapter, Subpart I--Procedures Implementing the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969, including the guidelines for human 
exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic fields as defined in 
Sec. Sec. 1.1307(b) and 1.1310 of this chapter for PCS networks.
    (6) ATC base station operations shall use less than all available 
MSS frequencies when using all available frequencies for ATC base 
station operations would exclude otherwise available signals from MSS 
space-stations.
    (b) Applicants for an ancillary terrestrial component shall 
demonstrate

[[Page 205]]

that the applicant does or will comply with the following criteria 
through certification:
    (1) Geographic and temporal coverage. (i) For the 2 GHz MSS band, an 
applicant must demonstrate that it can provide space-segment service 
covering all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands one-
hundred percent of the time, unless it is not technically possible, 
consistent with the coverage requirements for 2 GHz MSS GSO operators.
    (ii) For the L-band, an applicant must demonstrate that it can 
provide space-segment service covering all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and 
the U.S. Virgin Islands one-hundred percent of the time, unless it is 
not technically possible for the MSS operator to meet the coverage 
criteria from its orbital position.
    (iii) For the Big LEO band, an applicant must demonstrate that it 
can provide space-segment service to all locations as far north as 
70[deg] North latitude and as far south as 55[deg] South latitude for at 
least seventy-five percent of every 24-hour period, i.e., that at least 
one satellite will be visible above the horizon at an elevation angle of 
at least 5[deg] for at least 18 hours each day, and on a continuous 
basis throughout the fifty states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, i.e., that at least one satellite will be visible above the 
horizon at an elevation angle of at least 5[deg] at all times.
    (2) Replacement satellites. (i) Operational NGSO MSS ATC systems 
shall maintain an in-orbit spare satellite.
    (ii) Operational GSO MSS ATC systems shall maintain a spare 
satellite on the ground within one year of commencing operations and 
launch it into orbit during the next commercially reasonable launch 
window following a satellite failure.
    (iii) All MSS ATC licensees must report any satellite failures, 
malfunctions or outages that may require satellite replacement within 
ten days of their occurrence.
    (3) Commercial availability. Mobile-satellite service must be 
commercially available (viz., offering services for a fee) in accordance 
with the coverage requirements that pertain to each band as a 
prerequisite to an MSS licensee's offering ATC service.
    (4) Integrated services. MSS ATC licensees shall offer an integrated 
service of MSS and MSS ATC. Applicants for MSS ATC may establish an 
integrated service offering by affirmatively demonstrating that:
    (i) The MSS ATC operator will use a dual-mode handset that can 
communicate with both the MSS network and the MSS ATC component to 
provide the proposed ATC service; or
    (ii) Other evidence establishing that the MSS ATC operator will 
provide an integrated service offering to the public.
    (5) In-band operation. (i) In the 2 GHz MSS band, MSS ATC is limited 
to an MSS licensee's selected assignment. MSS ATC operations on 
frequencies beyond the MSS licensee's selected assignment are 
prohibited.
    (ii) In the Big LEO bands, MSS ATC is limited to no more than 7.775 
MHz of spectrum in the L-band and 11.5 MHz of spectrum in the S-band. 
Licensees in these bands may implement ATC only on those channels on 
which MSS is authorized, consistent with the Big LEO band-sharing 
arrangement.
    (iii) In the L-band, MSS ATC is limited to those frequency 
assignments available for MSS use in accordance with the Mexico City 
Memorandum of Understanding, its successor agreements or the result of 
other organized efforts of international coordination.
    (c) Equipment certification. (1) Each ATC MET utilized for operation 
under this part and each transmitter marketed, as set forth in Sec. 
2.803 of this chapter, must be of a type that has been authorized by the 
Commission under its certification procedure for use under this part.
    (2) Any manufacturer of radio transmitting equipment to be used in 
these services may request equipment authorization following the 
procedures set forth in subpart J of part 2 of this chapter. Equipment 
authorization for an individual transmitter may be requested by an 
applicant for a station authorization by following the procedures set 
forth in part 2 of this chapter.
    (3) Licensees and manufacturers are subject to the radiofrequency 
radiation exposure requirements specified in

[[Page 206]]

Sec. Sec. 1.1307(b), 2.1091 and 2.1093 of this chapter, as appropriate. 
MSS ATC base stations must comply with the requirements specified in 
Sec. 1.1307(b) of this chapter for PCS base stations. MSS ATC mobile 
terminals must comply with the requirements specified for mobile and 
portable PCS transmitting devices in Sec. 1.1307(b) of this chapter.

authorization of mobile or portable devices operating under this section 
must contain a statement confirming compliance with these requirements 
for both fundamental emissions and unwanted emissions. Technical 
information showing the basis for this statement must be submitted to 
the Commission upon request.
    (d) Applicants for an ancillary terrestrial component authority 
shall demonstrate that the applicant does or will comply with the 
provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.924 and 25.203(e) through 25.203(g) and with 
Sec. Sec. 25.252, 25.253, or 25.254, as appropriate, through 
certification or explanatory technical exhibit.
    (e) Except as provided for in paragraph (f) of this section, no 
application for an ancillary terrestrial component shall be granted 
until the applicant has demonstrated actual compliance with the 
provisions of paragraph (b) of this section. Upon receipt of ATC 
authority, all ATC licensees must ensure continued compliance with this 
section and Sec. Sec. 25.252, 25.253, or 25.254, as appropriate.
    (f) Special provision for operational MSS systems. Applicants for 
MSS ATC authority with operational MSS systems that are in actual 
compliance with the requirements prescribed in paragraphs (b)(1), 
(b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section at the time of application may elect 
to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(5) of this 
section prospectively by providing a substantial showing in its

    (2) Applications for authority granted pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section shall be placed on public notice pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section. If no comments or petitions are filed within 30 
days of the public notice date, the authority granted will be considered 
a regular temporary fixed earth station authorization as of 30 days 
after the public notice date. If a comment or petition is filed within 
30 days of the public notice date, the applicant must suspend operations 
immediately pending resolution of the issues raised in that comment or 
petition.

Sec. 25.152  Dismissal and return of applications.

    (a) Any application may be dismissed without prejudice as a matter 
of right if the applicant requests its dismissal prior to final 
Commission action.
    (b) The Commission will dismiss an application for failure to 
prosecute or for failure to respond substantially within a specified 
time period to official correspondence or requests for additional 
information. Dismissal will be without prejudice unless the application 
is mutually exclusive pursuant to Sec. 25.155, in which case it will be 
dismissed with prejudice.


<R05>
Sec. 25.153  Repetitious applications.

    (a) Where an application has been denied or dismissed with 
prejudice, the Commission will not consider a like application involving 
service of the same kind to the same area by the same applicant, or by 
its successor or assignee, or on behalf of or for the benefit of any of 
the original parties in interest, until

[[Page 208]]

after the lapse of 12 months from the effective date of the Commission's 
action. The Commission may, for good cause shown, waive the requirements 
of this section.
    (b) Where an appeal has been taken from the action of the Commission 
denying a particular application, another application for the same class 
of station and for the same area, in whole or in part, filed by the same 
applicant or by his successor or assignee, or on behalf or for the 
benefit of the original parties in interest, will not be considered 
until the final disposition of the appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 25.154  Opposition to applications and other pleadings.

    (a) Petitions to deny, petitions for other forms of relief, and 
other objections or comments must:
    (1) Identify the application or applications (including applicant's 
name, station location, Commission file numbers, and radio service 
involved) with which it is concerned;
    (2) Be filed within thirty (30) days after the date of public notice 
announcing the acceptance for filing of the application or major 
amendment thereto (unless the Commission otherwise extends the filing 
deadline);
    (3) Filed in accordance with the pleading limitations, periods and 
other applicable provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.41 through 1.52 of this 
chapter, except that such petitions must be filed electronically through 
the International Bureau Filing System (IBFS) in accordance with the 
applicable provisions of part 1, subpart Y of this chapter;
    (4) Contain specific allegations of fact (except for those of which 
official notice may be taken) to support the specific relief requested, 
which shall be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with 
personal knowledge thereof, and which shall be sufficient to demonstrate 
that the petitioner (or respondent) is a party of interest and that a 
grant of, or other Commission action regarding, the application would be 
prima facie inconsistent with the public interest; and
    (5) Contain a certificate of service showing that it has been mailed 
to the applicant no later than the date the pleading is filed with the 
Commission.
    (b) The Commission will classify as informal objections:
    (1) Any pleading not filed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this 
section;
    (2) Any pleading to which the thirty (30) day public notice period 
of Sec. 25.151 does not apply; or
    (3) Any objections to the grant of an application when the 
objections do not conform to either paragraph (a) of this section or to 
other Commission rules and requirements.
    (c) Except for opposition to petitions to deny an application filed 
pursuant to Sec. 25.220, oppositions to petitions to deny an 
application or responses to comments and informal objections regarding 
an application may be filed within 10 days after the petition, comment, 
or objection is filed and must be in accordance with other applicable 
provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.41 through 1.52 of this chapter, except that 
such oppositions must be filed electronically through the International 
Bureau Filing System (IBFS) in accordance with the applicable provisions 
of part 1, subpart Y of this chapter.

pursuant to Sec. 25.220, reply comments by the party that filed the 
original petition may be filed with respect to pleadings filed pursuant 
to paragraph (c) of this section within 5 days after the time for filing 
oppositions has expired unless the Commission otherwise extends the 
filing deadline and must be in accordance with other applicable 
provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.41 through 1.52 of this chapter, except that 
such reply comments must be filed electronically through the 
International Bureau Filing System (IBFS) in accordance with the 
applicable provisions of part 1, subpart Y of this chapter.
    (e) If a petition to deny an application filed pursuant to Sec. 
25.220 is filed, the applicant must file a statement with the Commission 
explaining whether the applicant has resolved all outstanding issues 
raised by the petitioner, within 30 days of the date the petition for 
deny is filed. This statement must be in accordance with the provisions 
of Sec. Sec. 1.41 through 1.52 of this chapter applicable to 
oppositions to petitions to deny, except that such reply comments must 
be filed electronically

<R05>
Sec. 25.155  Mutually exclusive applications.

    (a) The Commission will consider applications to be mutually 
exclusive if their conflicts are such that the grant of one application 
would effectively preclude by reason of harmful electrical interference, 
or other practical reason, the grant of one or more other applications.
    (b) An application for an NGSO-like space station license, within 
the meaning of Sec. 25.157, will be entitled to comparative 
consideration with one or more conflicting applications only if:
    (1) The application is mutually exclusive with another NGSO-like 
space station application; and
    (2) The application is received by the Commission in a condition 
acceptable for filing by the ``cut-off'' date specified in a public 
notice.
    (c) An application for a GSO-like space station license, within the 
meaning of Sec. 25.158, will be entitled to comparative consideration 
with one or more conflicting applications only if:
    (1) The application is mutually exclusive with another GSO-like 
space station application; and
    (2) The application is received by the Commission in a condition 
acceptable for filing at the same millisecond as another GSO-like space 
station application with which it is mutually exclusive.

<R05>
Sec. 25.156  Consideration of applications.

    (a) Applications for a radio station authorization, or for 
modification or renewal of an authorization, will be granted if, upon 
examination of the application, any pleadings or objections filed, and 
upon consideration of such other matters as it may officially notice, 
the Commission finds that the applicant is legally, technically, and 
otherwise qualified, that the proposed facilities and operations comply 
with all applicable rules, regulations, and policies, and that grant of 
the application will serve the public interest, convenience and 
necessity.
    (b) Whenever the Commission grants any application in part, or 
subject to any terms or conditions other than those routinely applied to 
applications of the same type, the grant shall be considered final 
unless the Commission should revise its action (either by granting the 
application as originally requested, or by designating the application 
for hearing) in response to a petition for reconsideration which:
    (1) Is filed by the applicant within thirty (30) days from the 
release date of the conditioned grant; and
    (2) Rejects the grant as made and explains the reasons why the 
application should be granted as originally requested.
    (c) Reconsideration or review of any final action taken by the 
Commission will be in accordance with subpart A of part 1 of this 
chapter.
    (d)(1) Applications for NGSO-like satellite systems will be 
considered pursuant to the procedures set forth in Sec. 25.157.
    (2) Applications for GSO-like satellite systems will be considered 
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Sec. 25.158.
    (3) Applications for NGSO-like satellite and GSO-like systems 
employing two or more service bands will be treated like separate 
applications for each service band, and each service band request will 
be considered pursuant to Sec. 25.157 or Sec. 25.158, as appropriate.
    (4) Applications for feeder link authority or intersatellite link 
authority will be treated like an application separate from its 
associated service band. Each feeder link request or intersatellite link 
request will be considered pursuant to the procedure for GSO-like 
service or NGSO-like service, as applicable.
    (5) In cases where the Commission has not adopted frequency-band 
specific service rules, the Commission will not consider NGSO-like 
applications after it has granted a GSO-like application, and it will 
not consider GSO-like applications after it has granted an NGSO-like 
application, unless and until the Commission establishes

[[Page 210]]

NGSO/GSO sharing criteria for that frequency band. In the event that the 
Commission receives NGSO-like applications and GSO-like applications at 
the same time, and the Commission has not adopted sharing criteria in 
that band, the Commission will divide the spectrum between GSO-like and 
NGSO-like licensees based on the proportion of qualified GSO-like and 
NGSO-like applicants.
    (6) An application for DBS or DARS services will be entitled to 
comparative consideration with one or more conflicting applications only 
if:
    (i) The application is mutually exclusive with another application; 
and
    (ii) The application is received by the Commission in a condition 
acceptable for filing by the ``cut-off'' date specified in a public 
notice.

<R05>
Sec. 25.157  Consideration of NGSO-like satellite applications.

    (a) This section specifies the Commission's procedures for 
considering license applications for ``NGSO-like satellite systems.'' 
For purposes of this section, the term ``NGSO-like satellite system'' is 
defined as:
    (1) All NGSO satellite systems, and
    (2) All GSO MSS satellite systems, in which the satellites are 
designed to communicate with earth stations with omni-directional 
antennas.
    (b) Each NGSO-like satellite system application will be reviewed to 
determine whether it is acceptable for filing within the meaning of 
Sec. 25.112. Any application that is not acceptable for filing would be 
returned to the applicant.
    (c) Each NGSO-like satellite system application that is acceptable 
for filing will be reviewed to determine whether it is a ``competing 
application,'' i.e., filed in response to a public notice initiating a 
processing round, or a ``lead application,'' i.e., all other NGSO-like 
satellite system applications.
    (1) Competing applications that are acceptable for filing will be 
placed on public notice to provide interested parties an opportunity to 
file pleadings in response to the application pursuant to Sec. 25.154.
    (2) Lead applications that are acceptable for filing will be placed 
on public notice. This public notice will initiate a processing round, 
establish a cut-off date for competing NGSO-like satellite system 
applications, and provide interested parties an opportunity to file 
pleadings in response to the application pursuant to Sec. 25.154.
    (d) After review of each of the applications in the processing 
round, and all the pleadings filed in response to each application, the 
Commission will grant all the applications that meet the standards of 
Sec. 25.156(a), and deny the other applications.
    (e)(1) In the event that there is insufficient spectrum in the 
frequency band available to accommodate all the qualified applicants in 
a processing round, the available spectrum will be divided equally among 
the licensees whose applications are granted pursuant to paragraph (d) 
of this section, except as set forth in paragraph (e)(2) or (e)(3) of 
this section.
    (2) In cases where there are only one or two applications in a 
processing round granted pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, each 
applicant will be assigned 1/3 of the available spectrum, and the 
remaining spectrum will be made available to other licensees in an 
additional processing round pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) In cases where there are three or more applications in a 
processing round granted pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, and 
one or more applicants apply for less spectrum than they would be 
warranted under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, those applicants will 
be assigned the bandwidth amount they requested in their applications. 
In those cases, the remaining qualified applicants will be assigned the 
lesser of the amount of spectrum they requested in their applications 
and the amount spectrum that they would be assigned if the available 
spectrum were divided equally among the remaining qualified applicants.
    (f)(1) Each licensee will be allowed to select the particular band 
segment it wishes to use no earlier than 60 days before they plan to 
launch the first satellite in its system, and no later than 30 days 
before that date, by submitting a letter to the Secretary of the 
Commission. The licensee shall serve copies of this letter to the other 
participants

[[Page 211]]

in the processing round pursuant to Sec. 1.47 of this chapter.
    (2) The licensee shall request contiguous bandwidth in both the 
uplink and downlink band. Each licensee's bandwidth selection in both 
the uplink and downlink band shall not preclude other licensees from 
selecting contiguous bandwidth.
    (3) If two or more licensees in a processing round request the same 
band segment, all licensees other than the first one to request that 
particular band segment will be required to make another selection.
    (g)(1) In the event that an applicants' license is cancelled for any 
reason, the Commission will redistribute the bandwidth allocated to that 
applicant equally among the remaining applicants whose licenses were 
granted concurrently with the cancelled license, unless the Commission 
determines that such a redistribution would not result in a sufficient 
number of licensees remaining to make reasonably efficient use of the 
frequency band.
    (2) In the event that the redistribution of bandwidth set forth in 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section would not result in a sufficient number 
of licensees remaining to make reasonably efficient use of the frequency 
band, the Commission will issue a public notice initiating a processing 
round, as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, to invite parties 
to apply for an NGSO-like satellite system license to operate in a 
portion of the bandwidth made available as a result of the cancellation 
of the initial applicant's license. Parties already holding licenses to 
operate an NGSO-like satellite system in that frequency band will not be 
permitted to participate in that processing round.
    (3) There is a presumption that three satellite licensees in a 
frequency band are sufficient to make reasonably efficient use of the 
frequency band.
    (h) Services offered pursuant to an NGSO-like license in a frequency 
band granted before the Commission has adopted frequency-band-specific 
service rules for that band will be subject to the default service rules 
in Sec. 25.217.

[68 FR 51505, Aug. 27, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 25.158  Consideration of GSO-like satellite applications.

    (a) This section specifies the Commission's procedures for 
considering license applications for ``GSO-like satellite systems.'' For 
purposes of this section, the term ``GSO-like satellite system'' is 
defined as a GSO satellite designed to communicate with earth stations 
with directional antennas. Examples of GSO-like satellite systems are 
those which use earth stations with antennas with directivity towards 
the satellites, such as FSS, and MSS feeder links which use GSO 
satellites. GSO-like satellite systems are satellite systems that are 
not NGSO-like satellite systems within the meaning of Sec. 25.157(a).
    (b) Applications for GSO-like satellite system licenses will be 
placed in a queue and considered in the order that they are filed, 
pursuant to the following procedure:
    (1) The application will be reviewed to determine whether it is 
acceptable for filing within the meaning of Sec. 25.112. If not, the 
application will be returned to the applicant.
    (2) If the application is acceptable for filing, the application 
will be placed on public notice pursuant to Sec. 25.151, and interested 
parties will be given an opportunity to file pleadings pursuant to Sec. 
25.154.
    (3) The application will be granted only if it meets each of the 
following criteria:
    (i) After review of the application and any pleadings filed in 
response to that application, the Commission finds that the application 
meets the standards of Sec. 25.156(a); and
    (ii) The proposed satellite will not cause harmful interference to 
any previously licensed operations.
    (c) An applicant for a GSO-like satellite system license is not 
allowed to transfer, assign, or otherwise permit any other entity to 
assume its place in any queue.
    (d) In the event that two or more GSO-like satellite system license 
applications are mutually exclusive within the meaning of Sec. 
25.155(c), the Commission will consider those applications pursuant to 
the following procedure:
    (1) Each application will be reviewed to determine whether it is 
acceptable

[[Page 212]]

for filing within the meaning of Sec. 25.112. Any application not found 
acceptable for filing will be returned to the applicant.
    (2) All applications that are acceptable for filing will be placed 
on public notice pursuant to Sec. 25.151, and interested parties will 
be given an opportunity to file pleadings pursuant to Sec. 25.154.
    (3) Each application will be granted if it meets the criteria of 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and otherwise will be denied.
    (4) In the event that two or more applications are granted pursuant 
to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the available bandwidth at the 
orbital location or locations in question will be divided equally among 
those licensees.
    (5) Licensees whose licenses are granted pursuant to paragraph 
(d)(4) of this section will be allowed to select the particular band 
segment it wishes to use no earlier than 60 days before they plan to 
launch the first satellite in its system, and no later than 30 days 
before that date, by submitting a letter to the Secretary of the 
Commission. The licensee shall serve copies of this letter to the other 
participants in the processing round pursuant to Sec. 1.47 of this 
chapter.
    (6) Licensees whose licenses are granted pursuant to paragraph 
(d)(4) of this section shall request contiguous bandwidth in both the 
uplink and downlink band. Each licensee's bandwidth selection shall not 
preclude other licensees from selecting contiguous bandwidth.
    (7) If two or more licensees whose licenses are granted pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(4) of this section request the same band segment, all 
licensees other than the first one to request that particular band 
segment will be required to make another selection.
    (e) Services offered pursuant to a GSO-like license in a frequency 
band granted before the Commission has adopted frequency-band-specific 
service rules for that band will be subject to the default service rules 
in Sec. 25.217.

[68 FR 51506, Aug. 27, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 25.159  Limits on pending applications and unbuilt satellite systems.

    (a) Applicants with a total of five applications for GSO-like space 
station licenses on file with the Commission in a particular frequency 
band, or a total of five licensed-but-unbuilt GSO-like space stations in 
a particular frequency band, or a combination of pending GSO-like 
applications and licensed-but-unbuilt GSO-like space stations in a 
particular frequency band that equals five, will not be permitted to 
apply for another GSO-like space station license in that frequency band.
    (b) Applicants with an application for one NGSO-like satellite 
system license on file with the Commission in a particular frequency 
band, or one licensed-but-unbuilt NGSO-like satellite system in a 
particular frequency band, will not be permitted to apply for another 
NGSO-like satellite system license in that frequency band.
    (c) If an applicant has an attributable interest in one or more 
other entities seeking one or more space station licenses, the pending 
applications and licensed-but-unbuilt satellite systems filed by those 
other entities will be counted as filed by the applicant for purposes of 
the limits on the number of pending space station applications and 
licensed-but-unbuilt satellite systems in this paragraph. For purposes 
of this paragraph, an applicant has an ``attributable interest'' in 
another entity if:
    (1) It holds equity (including all stockholdings, whether voting or 
nonvoting, common or preferred) and debt interest or interests, in the 
aggregate, exceed thirty-three (33) percent of the total asset value 
(defined as the aggregate of all equity plus all debt) of that entity, 
or
    (2) It holds a controlling interest in that entity, or is the 
subsidiary of a party holding a controlling interest in that entity, 
within the meaning of 47 CFR 1.2110(b)(2).
    (3) For purposes of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, 
ownership interests shall be calculated on a fully diluted basis, i.e., 
all agreements, such as warrants, stock options, and convertible 
debentures, will generally be treated as if the rights thereunder 
already have been fully exercised.

[[Page 213]]

    (d) In the event that a licensee misses three or more milestones 
within any three-year period, the Commission will presume that the 
licensee obtained one or more of those licenses for speculative 
purposes. Unless the licensee rebuts this presumption, it will not be 
permitted to apply for a GSO-like satellite or an NGSO-like satellite 
system in any frequency band if it has two or more satellite 
applications pending, or two licensed-but-unbuilt satellite systems of 
any kind. This limit will remain in effect until the licensee provides 
adequate information to demonstrate that it is very likely to construct 
its licensed facilities if it were allowed to file more applications.
    (e) For purposes of this section, ``frequency band'' means one of 
the paired frequency bands available for satellite service listed in 
Sec. 25.202.

<R05>
Sec. 25.160  Administrative sanctions.

    (a) A forfeiture may be imposed for failure to operate in 
conformance with the Communications Act, license specifications, any 
conditions imposed on an authorization, or any of the Commission's rules 
and regulations; or for failure to comply with Commission requests for 
information needed to complete international coordination or for failure 
to cooperate in Commission investigations with respect to international 
coordination.
    (b) A forfeiture will be imposed and the station license may be 
terminated for the malicious transmissions of any signal that causes 
harmful interference with any other radio communications or signals.

<R05>
Sec. 25.161  Automatic termination of station authorization.

    A station authorization shall be automatically terminated in whole 
or in part without further notice to the licensee upon:
    (a)(1) Failure to meet any applicable milestone for implementation 
of the licensed satellite system specified in Sec. Sec. 25.164(a) and/
or (b), without demonstrating that the failure was caused by 
circumstances beyond the licensee's control, or
    (2) If there are no applicable milestones for implementation of the 
licensed satellite system specified in Sec. Sec. 25.164(a) and/or (b), 
the expiration of the required date of completion of construction or 
other required action specified in the authorization, or after any

<R05>
Sec. 25.162  Cause for termination of interference protection.

    The protection from interference afforded by the registration of a 
receiving earth station shall be automatically terminated if:
    (a) The request for registration is not submitted to the Commission 
within 3 months of the completion of the frequency coordination process, 
except as provided for in Sec. 25.203;
    (b) The receiving earth station is not constructed and placed into 
service within 6 months after completion of coordination;

[[Page 214]]

    (c) The Commission finds that the station has been used less than 
50% of the time during any 12 month period;
    (d) The Commission finds that the station has been used for an 
unlawful purpose or otherwise in violation of the Commission's rules, 
regulations or policies;
    (e) The Commission finds that the actual use of the facility is 
inconsistent with what was set forth in the registrant's application; or
    (f) The Commission finds that the frequency coordination exhibit, 
upon which the granted registration is based, is incomplete or does not 
conform with established coordination procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 25.163  Reinstatement.

    (a) A station authorization terminated in whole or in part under the 
provisions of Sec. 25.161 may be reinstated if the Commission, in its 
discretion, determines that reinstatement would best serve the public 
interest, convenience and necessity. Petitions for reinstatement will be 
considered only if:

specified fixed point or within a specified area on land to provide a 
feeder link for the land mobile-satellite service. (RR)
    Baseline. The line from which maritime zones are measured, also 
known as the coast line. The baseline is a combination of the low-water 
line (``low-tide elevation'') and closing lines across the mouths of 
inland water bodies. The baseline is defined by a series of baseline 
points. The baseline points are not just the low-water marks of the 
shore of mainland but also includes islands and ``low-water elevations'' 
(i.e., natural rocks). Baseline points are ambulatory, and thus, require 
adjustment from time-to-time by the U.S. Department of State's Baseline 
Committee.
    C-band. For purposes of this part, the terms ``C-band'' and 
``conventional C-band'' refer specifically to the 3700-4200 MHz downlink 
and 5925-6425 MHz uplink frequency bands. These paired bands are 
allocated to the Fixed-Satellite Service and are also referred to as the 
4/6 GHz band(s).

    Equivalent diameter. When circular aperture reflector antennas are 
employed, the size of the antenna is generally expressed as the diameter 
of the antenna's main reflector. When non-reflector or non-circular 
aperture antennas are employed, an equivalent diameter can be computed 
for the antenna. The equivalent diameter is the diameter of a 
hypothetical circular aperture antenna with the same aperture area as 
the actual antenna. For example, an elliptical aperture antenna with 
major axis, a, and minor axis, b, will have an equivalent diameter of [a 
x b]<SUP>1/2</SUP>. A rectangular aperture antenna with length, l, and 
width, w, will have an equivalent diameter of [4(l x w)/
[pi]]<SUP>1/2</SUP>.

(EPFD) is the sum of the power flux-densities produced at a 
geostationary satellite orbit (GSO) receive earth or space station on 
the Earth's surface or in the geostationary satellite orbit, as 
appropriate, by all the transmit stations within a non-geostationary 
satellite orbit fixed-satellite service (NGSO FSS) system, taking into 
account the off-axis discrimination of a reference receiving antenna 
assumed to be pointing in its nominal direction. The equivalent power 
flux-density, in dB(W/m\2\) in the reference bandwidth, is calculated 
using the following formula:

the assigned frequency by more than 250 percent of the authorized 
bandwidth: An amount equal to 43 dB plus 10 times the logarithm (to the 
base 10) of the transmitter power in watts;
    (4) In any event, when an emission outside of the authorized 
bandwidth causes harmful interference, the Commission may, at its 
discretion, require greater attenuation than specified in paragraphs (f) 
(1), (2) and (3) of this section.
    (g) Telemetry, tracking and telecommand functions for U.S. domestic 
satellites shall be conducted at either or both edges of the allocated 
band(s). Frequencies, polarization and coding shall be selected to 
minimize interference into other satellite networks and within their own 
satellite system.
    (h) Out-of-band emission limitations for SDARS terrestrial 
repeaters. (1) Any SDARS terrestrial repeater operating at a power level 
greater than 2-watt average EIRP is required to attenuate its out-of-
band emissions below the transmitter power P by a factor of not less 
than 90 + 10 log (P) dB in a 1-megahertz bandwidth outside the 2320-2345 
MHz band, where P is average transmitter output power in watts.
    (2) Any SDARS terrestrial repeater operating at a power level equal 
to or less than 2-watt average EIRP is required to attenuate its out-of-
band emissions below the transmitter power P by a factor of not less 
than 75 + 10 log (P) dB in a 1-megahertz bandwidth outside the 2320-2345 
MHz band, where P is average transmitter output power in watts.
    (3) SDARS repeaters are permitted to attenuate out-of-band emissions 
less than the levels specified in paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2), of this 
section unless a potentially affected WCS licensee provides written 
notice that it intends to commence commercial service within the 
following 365 days. Starting 180 days after receipt of such written 
notice, SDARS repeaters within the area notified by the potentially 
affected WCS licensee must attenuate out-of-band emissions to the levels 
specified in paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section.
    (4) For the purpose of this section, a WCS licensee is potentially 
affected if it meets any of the following criteria:
    (i) The WCS licensee is authorized to operate a base station in the 
2305-2315 MHz or 2350-2360 MHz bands in the same Major Economic Area 
(MEA) as that in which a SDARS terrestrial repeater is located.
    (ii) The WCS licensee is authorized to operate a base station in the 
2315-2320 MHz or 2345-2350 MHz bands in the same Regional Economic Area 
Grouping (REAG) as that in which a SDARS terrestrial repeater is 
located.
    (iii) A SDARS terrestrial repeater is located within 5 kilometers of 
the boundary of an MEA or REAG in which the WCS licensee is authorized 
to operate a WCS base station.

application relevant technical details (both theoretical calculations 
and/or actual measurements) of any special techniques, such as the use 
of artificial site shielding, or operating procedures or restrictions at 
the proposed earth station which are to be employed to reduce the 
likelihood of interference, or of any particular characteristics of the 
earth station site which could have an effect on the calculation of the 
coordination distance.
    (c) Prior to the filing of its application, an applicant for 
operation of an earth station, other than an ESV or a VMES, shall 
coordinate the proposed frequency usage with existing terrestrial users 
and with applicants for terrestrial station authorizations with 
previously filed applications in accordance with the following 
procedure:
    (1) An applicant for an earth station authorization shall perform an 
interference analysis in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
Sec. 25.251 for each terrestrial station, for which a license or 
construction permit has been granted or for which an application has 
been accepted for filing, which is or is to be operated in a shared 
frequency band to be used by the proposed earth station and which is 
located within the great circle coordination distance contour(s) of the 
proposed earth station.
    (2) The earth station applicant shall provide each such terrestrial 
station licensee, permittee, and prior filed applicant with the 
technical details of the proposed earth station and the relevant 
interference analyses that were made. At a minimum, the earth station 
applicant shall provide the terrestrial user with the following 
technical information:
    (i) The geographical coordinates of the proposed earth station 
antenna(s),
    (ii) Proposed operating frequency band(s) and emission(s),

25.251 for earth stations operating with non-geostationary satellites,
    (viii) Minimum elevation angle,
    (ix) Maximum equivalent isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.) 
density in the main beam in any 4 kHz band, (dBW/4 kHz) for frequency 
bands below 15 GHz or in any 1 MHz band (dBW/MHz) for frequency band 
above 15 GHz,

[[Page 224]]

    (x) Maximum available RF transmit power density in any 1 MHz band 
and in any 4 kHz band at the input terminals of the antenna(s),
    (xi) Maximum permissible RF interference power level as determined 
in accordance with Sec. 25.251 for all applicable percentages of time, 
and
    (xii) A plot of great circle coordination distance contour(s) and 
rain scatter coordination distance contour(s) as determined by Sec. 
25.251.
    (3) The coordination procedures specified in Sec. 101.103 of this 
chapter and Sec. 25.251 shall be applicable except that the information 
to be provided shall be that set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, and that the 30-day period allowed for response to a request 
for coordination may be increased to a maximum of 45 days by mutual 
consent of the parties.
    (4) Where technical problems are resolved by an agreement or 
operating arrangement between the parties that would require special 
procedures be taken to reduce the likelihood of harmful interference 
(such as the use of artificial site shielding) or would result in 
lessened quality or capacity of either system, the details thereof shall 
be contained in the application.
    (5) The Commission may, in the course of examining any application, 
require the submission of additional showings, complete with pertinent 
data and calculations in accordance with Sec. 25.251, showing that 
harmful interference is not likely to result from the proposed 
operation.
    (d) An applicant for operation of an earth station, other than an 
ESV or a VMES, shall also ascertain whether the great circle 
coordination distance contours and rain scatter coordination distance 
contours, computed for those values of parameters indicated in Sec. 
25.251 (Appendix 7 of the ITU RR) for international coordination, cross 
the boundaries of another Administration. In this case, the applicant 
shall furnish the Commission copies of these contours on maps drawn to 
appropriate scale for use by the Commission in effecting coordination of 
the proposed earth station with the Administration(s) affected.
    (e) Protection for Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone, Boulder 
County, Colorado.
    (1) Applicants for a station authorization to operate in the 
vicinity of Boulder County, Colorado under this part are advised to give 
due consideration, prior to filing applications, to the need to protect 
the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone from harmful interference. These 
are the research laboratories of the Department of Commerce, Boulder 
County, Colorado. To prevent degradation of the present ambient radio 
signal level at the site, the Department of Commerce seeks to ensure 
that the field strengths of any radiated signals (excluding reflected 
signals) received on this 1800 acre site (in the vicinity of coordinates 
40[deg]07[min]50[sec] N Latitude, 105[deg]14[min]40[sec] W Longitude) 
resulting from new assignments (other than mobile stations) or from the 
modification or relocation of existing facilities do not exceed the 
following values:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                 In authorized bandwidth
                                                       of service
                                               -------------------------
                Frequency range                    Field      Power flux
                                                  strength   density \1\
                                                   (mV/m)     (dBW/m\2\)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Below 540 kHz.................................           10        -65.8
540 to 1600 kHz...............................           20        -59.8
1.6 to 470 MHz................................           10     \2\-65.8
470 to 890 MHz................................           30     \2\-56.2
Above 890 MHz.................................            1     \2\-85.8
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Equivalent values of power flux density are calculated assuming free
  space characteristic impedance of 376.7=120[pi] ohms.
\2\ Space stations shall conform to the power flux density limits at the
  earth's surface specified in appropriate parts of the FCC rules, but
  in no case should exceed the above levels in any 4 kHz band for all
  angles of arrival.

    (2) Advance consultation is recommended particularly for those 
applicants who have no reliable data which indicates whether the field 
strength or power flux density figures in the above table would be 
exceeded by their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In 
such instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining 
whether coordination is recommended:
    (i) All stations within 2.5 kilometers;
    (ii) Stations within 5 kilometers with 50 watts or more average 
effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of polarization in 
the azimuthal direction of the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone;

[[Page 225]]

    (iii) Stations within 15 kilometers with 1 kW or more average ERP in 
the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of Table 
Mountain Receiving Zone;
    (iv) Stations within 80 kilometers with 25 kW or more average ERP in 
the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of Table 
Mountain Receiving Zone.
    (3) Applicants concerned are urged to communicate with the Radio 
Frequency Management Coordinator, Department of Commerce, Research 
Support Services, NOAA R/E5X2, Boulder Laboratories, Boulder, CO 80303; 
telephone (303) 497-6548, in advance of filing their applications with 
the Commission.
    (4) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised 
that such consultation can avoid objections from the Department of 
Commerce or proceedings to modify any authorization which may be granted 
which, in fact, delivers a signal at the site in excess of the field 
strength specified herein.
    (f) Notification to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory: In 
order to minimize possible harmful interference at the National Radio 
Astronomy Observatory site located at Green Bank, Pocahontas County, W. 
Va., and at the Naval Radio Research Observatory site at Sugar Grove, 
Pendleton County, W. Va. any applicant for a station authorization other 
than mobile, temporary base, temporary fixed, Personal Radio, Civil Air 
Patrol, or amateur seeking a station license for a new station, a 
construction permit to construct a new station or to modify an existing 
station license in a manner which would change either the frequency, 
power, antenna height or directivity, or location of such a station 
within the area bounded by 39[deg]15[min] N. on the north, 
78[deg]30[min] W. on the east, 37[deg]30[min] N. on the south and 
80[deg]30[min] W. on the west shall, at the time of filing such 
application with the Commission, simultaneously notify the Director, 
National Radio Astronomy Observatory, P.O. Box No. 2, Green Bank, W. Va. 
24944, in writing, of the technical particulars of the proposed station. 
Such notification shall include the geographical coordinates of the 
antenna, antenna height, antenna directivity if any, proposed frequency, 
type of emission, and power. In addition, the applicant shall indicate 
in his application to the Commission the date notification was made to 
the observatory. After receipt of such applications, the Commission will 
allow a period of 20 days for comments or objections in response to the 
notifications indicated. If an objection to the proposed operation is 
received during the 20-day period from the National Radio Astronomy 
Observatory for itself or on behalf of the Naval Radio Research 
Observatory, the Commission will consider all aspects of the problem and 
take whatever action is deemed appropriate.
    (g) Protection for Federal Communications Commission monitoring 
stations:
    (1) Applicants in the vicinity of an FCC monitoring station for a 
radio station authorization to operate new transmitting facilities or 
changed transmitting facilities which would increase the field strength 
produced over the monitoring station over that previously authorized are 
advised to give consideration, prior to filing applications, to the 
possible need to protect the FCC stations from harmful interference. 
Geographical coordinates of the facilities which require protection are 
listed in Sec. 0.121(c) of the Commission's Rules. Applications for 
stations (except mobile stations) which will produce on any frequency a 
direct wave fundamental field strength of greater than 10 mV/m in the 
authorized bandwidth of service (-65.8 dBW/m\2\ power flux density 
assuming a free space characteristic impedance of 120 ohms) at the 
referenced coordinates, may be examined to determine extent of possible 
interference. Depending on the theoretical field strength value and 
existing root-sum-square or other ambient radio field signal levels at 
the indicated coordinates, a clause protecting the monitoring station 
may be added to the station authorization.
    (2) In the event that calculated value of expected field exceeds 10 
mV/m (-65.8 dBW/m\2\) at the reference coordinates, or if there is any 
question

[[Page 226]]

whether field strength levels might exceed the threshold value, advance 
consultation with the FCC to discuss any protection necessary should be 
considered. Prospective applicants may communicate with: Chief, 
Compliance and Information Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, 
Washington, DC 20554, Telephone (202) 632-6980.
    (3) Advance consultation is suggested particularly for those 
applicants who have no reliable data which indicates whether the field 
strength or power flux density figure indicated would be exceeded by 
their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In such 
instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining whether an 
applicant should coordinate:
    (i) All stations within 2.5 kilometers;
    (ii) Stations within 5 kilometers with 50 watts or more average 
effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of polarization in 
the azimuthal direction of the Monitoring Station;
    (iii) Stations within 15 kilometers with 1 kW or more average ERP in 
the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the 
Monitoring Station;
    (iv) Stations within 80 kilometers with 25 kW or more average ERP in 
the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the 
Monitoring Station.
    (4) Advance coordination for stations operating above 1000 MHz is 
recommended only where the proposed station is in the vicinity of a 
monitoring station designated as a satellite monitoring facility in 
Sec. 0.121(c) of the Commission's Rules and also meets the criteria 
outlined in paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section.
    (5) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether 
advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised 
that such consultation can avoid objections from the Federal 
Communications Commission or modification of any authorization which 
will cause harmful interference.
    (h) Sites and frequencies for GSO and NGSO earth stations, operating 
in a frequency band where both have a co-primary allocation, shall be 
selected to avoid earth station antenna mainlobe-to-satellite antenna 
mainlobe coupling, between NGSO systems and between NGSO and GSO 
systems, in order to minimize the possibility of harmful interference 
between these services. Prior to filing an earth station application, in 
bands with co-primary allocations to NGSO and GSO earth stations, the 
applicant shall coordinate the proposed site and frequency usage with 
existing earth station licensees and with current earth station 
authorization applicants.
    (i) Any applicant for a new permanent transmitting fixed earth 
station authorization to be located on the islands of Puerto Rico, 
Desecheo, Mona, Vieques, and Culebra, or for a modification of an 
existing authorization which would change the frequency, power, antenna 
height, directivity, or location of such station on these islands and 
would increase the likelihood of the authorized facility causing 
interference, shall notify the Interference Office, Arecibo Observatory, 
HC3 Box 53995, Arecibo, Puerto Rico 00612, in writing or electronically, 
of the technical parameters of the proposal. Applicants may wish to 
consult interference guidelines, which will be provided by Cornell 
University. Applicants who choose to transmit information electronically 
should e-mail to: prcz@naic.edu.
    (1) The notification to the Interference Office, Arecibo Observatory 
shall be made prior to, or simultaneously with, the filing of the 
application with the Commission. The notification shall state the 
geographical coordinates of the antenna (NAD-83 datum), antenna height 
above ground, ground elevation at the antenna, antenna directivity and 
gain, proposed frequency and FCC Rule Part, type of emission, effective 
radiated power, and whether the proposed use is itinerant. Generally, 
submission of the information in the technical portion of the FCC 
license application is adequate notification. In addition, the applicant 
shall indicate in its application to the Commission the date 
notification was made to the Arecibo Observatory.
    (2) After receipt of such applications, the Commission will allow 
the Arecibo Observatory a period of 20 days for comments or objections 
in response to

[[Page 227]]

the notification indicated. The applicant will be required to make 
reasonable efforts in order to resolve or mitigate any potential 
interference problem with the Arecibo Observatory and to file either an 
amendment to the application or a modification application, as 
appropriate. If the Commission determines that an applicant has 
satisfied its responsibility to make reasonable efforts to protect the 
Observatory from interference, its application may be granted.
    (3) The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to operations that 
transmit on frequencies above 15 GHz.
    (j) Applicants for non-geostationary 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile-Satellite 
Service/ Radiodetermination satellite service feeder links in the bands 
17.7-20.2 GHz and 27.5-30.0 GHz shall indicate the frequencies and 
spacecraft antenna gain contours towards each feeder-link earth station 
location and will coordinate with licensees of other fixed-satellite 
service and terrestrial-service systems sharing the band to determine 
geographic protection areas around each non-geostationary mobile-
satellite service/radiodetermination satellite service feeder-link earth 
station.
    (k) An applicant for operation of an earth station, other than an 
ESV or a VMES, that will operate with a geostationary satellite or non-
geostationary satellite in a shared frequency band in which the non-
geostationary system is (or is proposed to be) licensed for feeder 
links, shall demonstrate in its applications that its proposed earth 
station will not cause unacceptable interference to any other satellite 
network that is authorized to operate in the same frequency band, or 
certify that the operations of its earth station shall conform to 
established coordination agreements between the operator(s) of the space 
station(s) with which the earth station is to communicate and the 
operator(s) of any other space station licensed to use the band.
    (l) Applicants for feeder link earth station facilities operating in 
the 25.05-25.25 GHz band may be licensed only in Economic Areas where no 
existing FS licensee has been authorized, and shall coordinate their 
operations with 24 GHz fixed service operations if the power flux 
density of their transmitted signal at the boundary of the fixed service 
license area is equal to or greater than -114 dBW/m\2\ in any 1 MHz.
    (1) When uplink adaptive power control is used, the EIRP used for 
calculation of the power flux density level should be the maximum 
possible, taking into account the adaptive power increase.
    (2) The power flux density levels should be calculated based on the 
actual off-axis gain characteristics of the earth station antenna, and 
should assume free space propagation conditions.
    (3) When determining whether the power flux density threshold limit 
is exceeded at the 24 GHz FS licensing boundary, a feeder link earth 
station applicant must take into account not only the transmissions from 
its own antenna(s), but also those from any previously authorized feeder 
link earth stations. Thus, if the cumulative power flux density level at 
the FS license boundary is in excess of -114 dBW/m\2\/MHz, the earth 
station applicant must either modify its proposed operations such that 
this value is not exceeded, or enter into coordination with the affected 
FS licensee.

Sec. 25.204  Power limits.

    (a) In bands shared coequally with terrestrial radio communication 
services, the equivalent isotropically radiated power transmitted in any 
direction towards the horizon by an earth station, other than an ESV, 
operating in frequency bands between 1 and 15 GHz, shall not exceed the 
following limits except as provided for in paragraph (c) of this 
section:

+40 dBW in any 4 kHz band for [thetas] <= 0[deg]
+40 + 3[thetas] dBW in any 4 kHz band for 0[deg] < [thetas] <= 5[deg]

where [thetas] is the angle of elevation of the horizon viewed from the 
center of radiation of the antenna of the earth station and measured in 
degrees as positive above the horizontal plane and negative below it.

[[Page 228]]

    (b) In bands shared coequally with terrestrial radiocommunication 
services, the equivalent isotropically radiated power transmitted in any 
direction towards the horizon by an earth station operating in frequency 
bands above 15 GHz shall not exceed the following limits except as 
provided for in paragraph (c) of this section:

+64 dBW in any 1 MHz band for [thetas] <= 0[deg]
+64 + 3 [thetas] dBW in any 1 MHz band for 0[deg] < [thetas] <= 5[deg]

where [thetas] is as defined in paragraph (a) of this section.

    (c) For angles of elevation of the horizon greater than 5[deg] there 
shall be no restriction as to the equivalent isotropically radiated 
power transmitted by an earth station towards the horizon.
    (d) Notwithstanding the e.i.r.p. and e.i.r.p. density limits 
specified in the station authorization, each earth station transmission 
shall be conducted at the lowest power level that will provide the 
required signal quality as indicated in the application and further 
amended by coordination agreements.
    (e) For operations at frequencies above 10 GHz, earth station 
operators may exceed the uplink e.i.r.p. and e.i.r.p. density limits 
specified in the station authorization under the conditions of uplink 
fading due to precipitation by an amount not to exceed 1 dB above the 
actual amount of monitored excess attenuation over clear sky propagation 
conditions. The e.i.r.p. levels shall be returned to normal as soon as 
the attenuating weather pattern subsides. The maximum power level for 
power control purposes shall be coordinated between and among adjacent 
satellite operators.
    (f) In the band 13.75-14 GHz, an earth station in the fixed-
satellite service shall have a minimum antenna diameter of 4.5 m and the 
e.i.r.p. of any emission should be at least 68 dBW and should not exceed 
85 dBW. The e.i.r.p. density of emissions from any earth station in the 
FSS operating with a space station in geostationary-satellite orbit 
shall not exceed 71 dBW in any 6 MHz band from 13.77 to 13.78 GHz. The 
e.i.r.p. density of emissions from any earth station in the FSS 
operating with a space station in non-geostationary-satellite orbit 
shall not exceed 51 dBW in any 6 MHz band from 13.77 to 13.78 GHz. 
Automatic power control may be used to increase the e.i.r.p. density in 
the 6 MHz band in this frequency range to compensate for rain 
attenuation, to the extent that the power flux-density at the FSS space 
station does not exceed the value resulting from use by an earth station 
of an e.i.r.p. of 71 dBW or 51 dBW, as appropriate, in the 6 MHz band in 
clear-sky conditions.
    (g) All earth stations in the Fixed Satellite Service in the 20/30 
GHz band, and feeder link earth stations operating in the 24.75-25.25 
GHz band (Earth-to-space) and providing service to geostationary 
satellites in the 17/24 GHz BSS, shall employ uplink adaptive power 
control or other methods of fade compensation such that the earth 
station transmissions shall be conducted at the power level required to 
meet the desired link performance while reducing the level of mutual 
interference between networks.
    (h) ESV transmissions in the 5925-6425 MHz (Earth-to-space) band 
shall not exceed an e.i.r.p. spectral density towards the radio-horizon 
of 17 dBW/MHz, and shall not exceed an e.i.r.p. towards the radio-
horizon of 20.8 dBW. The ESV network shall shut-off the ESV transmitter 
if the e.i.r.p. spectral density towards the radio-horizon or e.i.r.p. 
towards the radio-horizon are exceeded.
    (i) Within 125 km of the TDRSS sites identified in Sec. 25.222(d), 
ESV transmissions in the 14.0-14.2 GHz (Earth-to-space) band shall not 
exceed an e.i.r.p. spectral density towards the horizon of 12.5 dBW/MHz, 
and shall not exceed an e.i.r.p. towards the horizon of 16.3 dBW.
    (j) Within 125 km of the Tracking and Data Relay System Satellite 
(TDRSS) sites identified in Sec. 25.226(c), VMES transmissions in the 
14.0-14.2 GHz (Earth-to-space) band shall not exceed an EIRP spectral 
density towards the horizon of 12.5 dBW/MHz, and shall not

[[Page 229]]

exceed an EIRP towards the horizon of 16.3 dBW.

Sec. 25.205  Minimum angle of antenna elevation.

    (a) Earth station antennas shall not normally be authorized for 
transmission at angles less than 5[deg] measured from the horizontal 
plane to the direction of maximum radiation. However, upon a showing 
that the transmission path will be seaward and away from land masses or 
upon special showing of need for lower angles by the applicant, the 
Commission will consider authorizing transmissions at angles between 
3[deg] and 5[deg] in the pertinent directions. In certain instances, it 
may be necessary to specify minimum angles greater than 5[deg] because 
of interference considerations.
    (b) ESVs making a special showing requesting angles of elevation 
less than 5[deg] measured from the horizontal plane to the direction of 
maximum radiation pursuant to (a) of this section must still meet the 
effective isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.) and e.i.r.p. density 
towards the horizon limits contained in Sec. 25.204(h) and (i).
    (c) VMESs making a special showing requesting angles of elevation 
less than 5[deg] measured from the horizontal plane to the direction of 
maximum radiation pursuant to (a) of this section must still meet the 
EIRP and EIRP density towards the horizon limits contained in Sec. 
25.204(j).

plane.
    (3) -105 dB (W/m\2\) in any 1 MHz band for angles of arrival between

section, the power flux-density across the 200 MHz band 18.6-18.8 GHz 
produced at the Earth's surface by emissions from a space station under 
assumed free-space propagation conditions shall not exceed -95 dB (W/
m\2\) for all angles of arrival. This limit may be exceeded by up to 3 
dB for no more than 5% of the time.

    (q) In the band 37.5-40.0 GHz, the power flux-density at the Earth's 
surface produced by emissions from a geostationary space station for all

system raises power to compensate for rain-fade conditions at the FSS 
Earth station:

exceed the power flux-density limits for normal free space propagation 
described in paragraph (p)(1) to compensate for the effects of rain

    (a) Downlink analog video transmissions in the band 3700-4200 MHz 
shall be transmitted only on a center frequency of 3700+20N MHz, where 
N=1 to 24. The corresponding uplink frequency shall be 2225 MHz higher.
    (b) All 4/6 GHz analog video transmissions shall contain an energy 
dispersal signal at all times with a minimum peak-to-peak bandwidth set 
at whatever value is necessary to meet the power flux density limits 
specified in Sec. 25.208(a) and successfully coordinated 
internationally and accepted by adjacent U.S. satellite operators based 
on the use of state of the art space and earth station facilities. 
Further, all transmissions operating in frequency bands described in 
Sec. 25.208 (b) and (c) shall also contain an energy dispersal signal 
at all times with a minimum peak-to-peak bandwidth set at whatever value 
is necessary to meet the power flux density limits specified in Sec. 
25.208(b) and (c) and successfully coordinated internationally and 
accepted by adjacent U.S. satellite operators based on the use of state 
of the art space and earth station facilities. The

[[Page 245]]

transmission of an unmodulated carrier at a power level sufficient to 
saturate a transponder is prohibited, except by the space station 
licensee to determine transponder performance characteristics. All 12/14 
GHz video transmissions for TV/FM shall identify the particular carrier 
frequencies for necessary coordination with adjacent U.S. satellite 
systems and affected satellite systems of other administrations.
    (c) All initial analog video transmissions shall be preceded by a 
video test transmission at an uplink e.i.r.p. at least 10 dB below the 
normal operating level. The earth station operator shall not increase 
power until receiving notification from the satellite network control 
center that the frequency and polarization alignment are satisfactory 
pursuant to the procedures specified in Sec. 25.272. The stationary 
earth station operator that has successfully transmitted an initial 
video test signal to a satellite pursuant to this paragraph is not 
required to make subsequent video test transmissions if subsequent 
transmissions are conducted using exactly the same parameters as the 
initial transmission.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided by this part, criteria for 
unacceptable levels of interference caused by other satellite networks 
shall be established on the basis of nominal operating conditions and 
with the objective of minimizing orbital separations between satellites.
    (b) Emissions with an occupied bandwidth of less than 2 MHz are not 
protected from interference from wider bandwidth transmissions if the 
r.f. carrier frequency of the narrowband signal is within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>1 MHz of one of the frequencies specified in Sec. 
25.211(a).
    (c) In the 14.0 through 14.5 GHz band, an earth station with an

licensed for transmission of narrowband analog services with bandwidths 
up to 200 kHz if the maximum input power spectral density into the 
antenna does not exceed -8 dBW/4 kHz and the maximum transmitted 
satellite carrier EIRP density does not exceed 17 dBW/4 kHz. Such earth 
stations may be routinely licensed for transmission of narrowband and/or 
wideband digital services, including digital video services, if the 
maximum input spectral power density into the antenna does not exceed -
14 dBW/4 kHz, and the maximum transmitted satellite carrier EIRP density 
does not exceed +10.0 dBW/4 kHz. Antennas transmitting in the 14.0

    (iii) Out-of-band emissions of a mobile earth station licensed to 
operate within the 1610.0-1626.5 MHz band shall be attenuated so that 
the power flux density it produces in the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz band at any 
radio astronomy site listed in paragraph (a)(1) (i) or (ii) of this 
section shall not exceed the emissions of a mobile earth station 
operating within the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz band

[[Page 247]]

at the edge of the protection zone applicable for that site. As an 
alternative, a mobile earth station shall not operate during radio 
astronomy observations within the 1613.8-1615.8 MHz band within 100 km 
of the radio astronomy sites listed in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this 
section, and within 30 km of the sites listed in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of 
this section, there being no restriction on a mobile earth station 
operating within the 1615.8-1626.5 MHz band.
    (iv) For airborne mobile earth stations operating in the 1610.0-
1626.5 MHz band, the separation distance shall be the larger of the 
distances specified in paragraph (a)(1) (i), (ii) or (iii) of this 
section, as applicable, or the distance, d, as given by the formula:

d (km) = 4.1 square root of (h)

where h is the altitude of the aircraft in meters above ground level.

    (v) Smaller geographic protection zones may be used in lieu of the 
areas specified in paragraphs (a)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this 
section if agreed to by the Mobile-Satellite Service licensee and the 
Electromagnetic Spectrum Management Unit (ESMU), National Science 
Foundation, Washington, D.C. upon a showing by the Mobile-Satellite 
Service licensee that the operation of a mobile earth station will not 
cause harmful interference to a radio astronomy observatory during 
periods of observation.
    (vi) The ESMU shall notify Mobile-Satellite Service space station 
licensees authorized to operate mobile earth terminals in the 1610.0-
1626.5 MHz band of periods of radio astronomy observations. The mobile-
satellite systems shall be capable of terminating operations within the 
frequency bands and protection zones specified in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) 
through (iv) of this section, as applicable, after the first position 
fix of the mobile earth terminal either prior to transmission or, based 
upon its location within the protection zone at the time of initial 
transmission of the mobile earth terminal. Once the mobile-satellite 
system determines that a mobile earth terminal is located within an RAS 
protection zone, the mobile-satellite system shall immediately initiate 
procedures to relocate the mobile earth terminal operations to a non-RAS 
frequency.
    (vii) A beacon-actuated protection zone may be used in lieu of fixed 
protection zones in the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz band if a coordination 
agreement is reached between a mobile-satellite system licensee and the 
ESMU on the specifics of beacon operations.
    (viii) Additional radio astronomy sites, not located within 100 
miles of the 100 most populous urbanized areas as defined by the United 
States Census Bureau at the time, may be afforded similar protection one 
year after notice to the mobile-satellite system licensees by issuance 
of a public notice by the Commission.
    (2) Mobile-Satellite Service space stations transmitting in the 
1613.8-1626.5 MHz band shall take whatever steps necessary to avoid 
causing harmful interference to the radio astronomy facilities listed in 
paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section during periods of 
observation.
    (3) Mobile-Satellite Service space stations operating in the 2483.5-
2500 MHz frequency band shall limit spurious emission levels in the 
4990-5000 MHz band so as not to exceed -241 dB (W/m\2\/Hz) at the 
surface of the Earth.
    (4) The Radioastronomy Service shall avoid scheduling radio 
astronomy observations during peak MSS/RDSS traffic periods to the 
greatest extent practicable.
    (b) If a Mobile-Satellite Service space station operator in the 
2496-2500 MHz band intends to operate at powers levels that exceed the 
PFD limits in Sec. 25.208(v), or if actual operations routinely exceed 
these PFD limits, we require the Mobile-Satellite Service operator to 
receive approval from each operational BRS system in the affected 
geographical region.

Sec. 25.214  Technical requirements for space stations in the satellite digital audio radio service and associated terrestrial repeaters.

    (a) Definitions.
    (1) Allocated bandwidth. The term ``allocated bandwidth'' refers to 
the

[[Page 248]]

entry in the Table of Frequency Allocations of a given frequency band 
for the purpose of its use by one or more terrestrial or space 
radiocommunication services under specified conditions. This term shall 
be applied to the 2310-2360 MHz band for satellite DARS.
    (2) Frequency Assignment. The term ``frequency assignment'' refers 
to the authorization given by the Commission for a radio station to use 
a radio frequency or radio frequency channel under specified conditions. 
This term shall be applied to the two frequency bands (A) 2320.0-2332.5 
MHz and (B) 2332.5-2340.0 MHz for satellite DARS.
    (b) Each system authorized under this section will be conditioned 
upon construction, launch and operation milestones as outlined in Sec. 
25.144(b). The failure to meet any of the milestones contained in an 
authorization will result in its cancellation, unless such failure is 
due to circumstances beyond the licensee's control or unless otherwise 
determined by the Commission upon proper showing by the licensee in any 
particular case.
    (c) Frequency assignments will be made for each satellite DARS 
system as follows:
    (1) Exclusive satellite DARS licenses are limited to the 2320-2345 
MHz band segment of the allocated bandwidth for satellite DARS;
    (2) Two, 12.5 MHz frequency assignments are available for satellite 
DARS: 2320.0-2332.5 MHz and 2332.5-2345.0 MHz;
    (3) Satellite DARS licensees may reduce their assigned bandwidth 
occupancy to provide telemetry beacons in their exclusive frequency 
assignments;
    (4) Each licensee may employ cross polarization within its exclusive 
frequency assignment and/or may employ cross polarized transmissions in 
frequency assignments of other satellite DARS licensees under mutual 
agreement with those licensees. Licensees who come to mutual agreement 
to use cross-polarized transmissions shall apply to the Commission for 
approval of the agreement before coordination is initiated with other 
administrations by the licensee of the exclusive frequency assignment; 
and
    (5) Feeder uplink networks are permitted in the following Fixed-
Satellite Service frequency bands: 7025-7075 MHz and 6725-7025 MHz 
(101[deg] W.L. orbital location only).
    (d) Power limit for SDARS terrestrial repeaters. (1) SDARS 
terrestrial repeaters must be operated at a power level less than or 
equal to 12-kW average EIRP, with a maximum peak-to-average power ratio 
of 13 dB.
    (2) SDARS repeaters are permitted to operate at power levels above 
12-kW average EIRP, unless a potentially affected WCS licensee provides 
written notice that it intends to commence commercial service within the 
following 365 days. Starting 180 days after receipt of such written 
notice, SDARS repeaters within the area notified by the potentially 
affected WCS licensee must be operated at a power level less than or 
equal to 12-kW average EIRP, with a maximum peak-to-average power ratio 
of 13 dB.
    (3) For the purpose of this section, a WCS licensee is potentially 
affected if it meets any of the following criteria:
    (i) The WCS licensee is authorized to operate a base station in the 
2305-2315 MHz or 2350-2360 MHz bands in the same Major Economic Area 
(MEA) as that in which a SDARS terrestrial repeater is located.
    (ii) The WCS licensee is authorized to operate a base station in the 
2315-2320 MHz or 2345-2350 MHz bands in the same Regional Economic Area 
Grouping (REAG) as that in which a SDARS terrestrial repeater is 
located.
    (iii) An SDARS terrestrial repeater is located within 5 kilometers 
of the boundary of an MEA or REAG in which the WCS licensee is 
authorized to operate a WCS base station.

Sec. 25.218  Off-axis EIRP envelopes for FSS earth station operations.

    (a) This section applies to all earth station applications, except 
for:
    (1) ESV and VMES applications,
    (2) Analog video earth station applications,
    (3) Applications for feeder-link earth stations in the 17/24 GHz 
BSS.
    (b) Earth station applications subject to this section are eligible 
for routine processing if they meet the applicable off-axis EIRP 
envelope set forth in this section below. For purposes of this section, 
the term ``extended Ku-band'' is the 10.7 through 11.7 GHz, 12.75 
through 13.25 GHz, and 13.75 through 14.0 GHz band. The term 
``conventional Ku-band'' is defined in Sec. 25.201 of this chapter.
    (c) C-band analog earth station operations. (1) In the plane of the 
geostationary satellite orbit as it appears at the particular earth 
station location:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

where [thetas] is the angle in degrees from the line connecting the 
focal point of the antenna to the target satellite, and the 
geostationary orbit plane is determined by the focal point of the 
antenna and the line tangent to the arc of the geostationary satellite 
orbit at the position of the target satellite. For the purposes of this 
section, the peak EIRP of an individual sidelobe may not exceed the 
envelope defined above for [thetas] between 1.5[deg] and 7.0[deg]. For 
[thetas] greater than 7.0[deg], the envelope may be exceeded by no more 
than 10% of the sidelobes, provided no individual sidelobe exceeds the 
envelope given above by more than 3 dB.

<R05>
Sec. 25.221  Blanket Licensing provisions for Earth Stations on Vessels

(ESVs) receiving in the 3700-4200 MHz (space-to-Earth) frequency band and transmitting 
          in the 5925-6425 MHz (Earth-to-space) frequency band, 
          operating with Geostationary Satellite Orbit (GSO) Satellites 
          in the Fixed-Satellite Service.

    (a) The following ongoing requirements govern all ESV licensees and 
operations in the 3700-4200 MHz (space-to-Earth) and 5925-6425 MHz 
(Earth-to-space) bands transmitting to GSO satellites in the fixed-
satellite service. ESV licensees must comply with the requirements in 
either paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section and all of the 
requirements set forth in paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(12) of this 
section. Paragraph (b) of this section identifies items that must be 
included in the application for ESV operations to demonstrate that these 
ongoing requirements will be met.
    (1) The following requirements shall apply to an ESV that uses 
transmitters with off-axis effective isotropically radiated power (EIRP) 
spectral-densities lower than or equal to the levels in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i) of this section. An ESV, or ESV system, operating under this 
section shall provide a detailed demonstration as described in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section. The ESV transmitter must also comply with the 
antenna pointing and cessation of emission requirements in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (i) An ESV system shall not exceed the off-axis EIRP spectral-
density limits and conditions defined in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) through 
(a)(1)(i)(D) of this section.
    (A) The off-axis EIRP spectral-density emitted from the ESV, in the 
plane of the GSO as it appears at the particular earth station location, 
shall not exceed the following values:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26.3 - 10log(N) - 25log[thetas]...  dBW/4 kHz............  for................  1.5[deg] <= [thetas] <= 7[deg]
5.3 -10log(N).....................  dBW/4 kHz............  for................  7[deg] < [thetas] <= 9.2[deg]
29.3 -10log(N) - 25log[thetas]....  dBW/4 kHz............  for................  9.2[deg] < [thetas] <= 48[deg]
-12.7 -10log(N)...................  dBW/4 kHz............  for................  48[deg] < [thetas] <= 180[deg]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Where theta ([thetas]) is the angle in degrees from the line connecting 
the focal point of the antenna to the orbital location of the target 
satellite, the plane of the GSO is determined by the focal point of the 
antenna and the line tangent to the arc of the GSO at the orbital 
location of the target satellite. For an ESV network using frequency 
division multiple access (FDMA) or time division multiple access (TDMA) 
techniques, N is equal to one. For ESV networks using multiple co-
frequency transmitters that have the same EIRP, N is the maximum 
expected number of co-frequency simultaneously transmitting ESV earth 
stations in the same satellite receiving beam. For the purpose of this 
section, the peak EIRP of an individual sidelobe may not exceed the 
envelope defined above for [thetas] between 1.5[deg] and 7.0[deg]. For 
[thetas] greater than 7.0[deg], the envelope may be exceeded by no more 
than 10% of the sidelobes, provided no individual sidelobe exceeds

[[Page 257]]

the envelope given above by more than 3 dB.
    (B) In all directions other than along the GSO, the off-axis EIRP 
spectral-density for co-polarized signals emitted from the ESV shall not 
exceed the following values:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
29.3 - 10log(N) - 25log[thetas]...  dBW/4 kHz............  for................  3.0[deg] <= [thetas] <= 48[deg]
-12.7 - 10log(N)..................  dBW/4 kHz............  for................  48[deg] < [thetas] <= 180[deg]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Where [thetas] and N are defined in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this 
section. This off-axis EIRP spectral-density applies in any plane that 
includes the line connecting the focal point of the antenna to the 
orbital location of the target satellite with the exception of the plane 
of the GSO as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section. For the 
purpose of this section, the envelope may be exceeded by no more than 
10% of the sidelobes provided no individual sidelobe exceeds the gain 
envelope given above by more than 6 dB. The region of the main reflector 
spillover energy is to be interpreted as a single lobe and shall not 
exceed the envelope by more than 6 dB.
    (C) In all directions, the off-axis EIRP spectral-density for cross-
polarized signals emitted from the ESV shall not exceed the following 
values:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.3 - 10log(N) - 25log[thetas]...  dBW/4 kHz............  for................  1.8[deg] <= [thetas] <= 7.0[deg]
-4.7 - 10log(N)...................  dBW/4 kHz............  for................  7.0[deg] < [thetas] <= 9.2[deg]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Where [thetas] and N are defined as set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) 
of this section. This EIRP spectral-density applies in any plane that 
includes the line connecting the focal point of the antenna to the 
orbital location of the target satellite.
    (D) For non-circular ESV antennas, the major axis of the antenna 
will be aligned with the tangent to the arc of the GSO at the orbital 
location of the target satellite, to the extent required to meet the 
specified off-axis EIRP spectral-density criteria.
    (ii) Each ESV transmitter must meet one of the following antenna 
pointing requirements:
    (A) Each ESV transmitter shall maintain a pointing error of less 
than or equal to 0.2[deg] between the orbital location of the target 
satellite and the axis of the main lobe of the ESV antenna, or
    (B) Each ESV transmitter shall maintain the declared maximum antenna 
pointing error that may be greater than 0.2[deg] provided that the ESV 
does not exceed the off-axis EIRP spectral-density limits in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i) of this section, taking into account the antenna pointing 
error.
    (iii) Each ESV transmitter must meet one of the following cessation 
of emission requirements:
    (A) For ESVs operating under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this 
section, all emissions from the ESV shall automatically cease within 100 
milliseconds if the angle between the orbital location of the target 
satellite and the axis of the main lobe of the ESV antenna exceeds 
0.5[deg], and transmission will not resume until such angle is less than 
or equal to 0.2[deg], or
    (B) For ESV transmitters operating under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of 
this section, all emissions from the ESV shall automatically cease 
within 100 milliseconds if the angle between the orbital location of the 
target satellite and the axis of the main lobe of the ESV antenna 
exceeds the declared maximum antenna pointing error and shall not resume 
transmissions until such angle is less than or equal to the declared 
maximum antenna pointing error.
    (2) The following requirements shall apply to an ESV that uses off-
axis EIRP spectral-densities in excess of the

[[Page 258]]

levels in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. An ESV, or ESV system, 
operating under this section shall file certifications and provide a 
detailed demonstration as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (i) The ESV shall transmit only to the target satellite system(s) 
referred to in the certifications required by paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (ii) If a good faith agreement cannot be reached between the target 
satellite operator and the operator of a future satellite that is 
located within 6 degrees longitude of the target satellite, the ESV 
operator shall accept the power-density levels that would accommodate 
that adjacent satellite.
    (iii) The ESV shall operate in accordance with the off-axis EIRP 
spectral-densities that the ESV supplied to the target satellite 
operator in order to obtain the certifications listed in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section. The ESV shall automatically cease emissions 
within 100 milliseconds if the ESV transmitter exceeds the off-axis EIRP 
spectral-densities supplied to the target satellite operator.
    (3) There shall be a point of contact in the United States, with 
phone number and address, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 
with authority and ability to cease all emissions from the ESVs, either 
directly or through the facilities of a U.S. Hub or a Hub located in 
another country with which the United States has a bilateral agreement 
that enables such cessation of emissions.
    (4) For each ESV transmitter, a record of the ship location (i.e., 
latitude/longitude), transmit frequency, channel bandwidth and satellite 
used shall be time annotated and maintained for a period of not less 
than 1 year. Records will be recorded at time intervals no greater than 
every 20 minutes while the ESV is transmitting. The ESV operator will 
make this data available upon request to a coordinator, fixed system 
operator, fixed-satellite system operator, or the Commission within 24 
hours of the request.
    (5) ESV operators communicating with vessels of foreign registry 
must maintain detailed information on each vessel's country of registry 
and a point of contact for the relevant administration responsible for 
licensing ESVs.
    (6) ESV operators shall control all ESVs by a Hub earth station 
located in the United States, except that an ESV on U.S.-registered 
vessels may operate under control of a Hub earth station location 
outside the United States provided the ESV operator maintains a point of 
contact within the United States that will have the capability and 
authority to cause an ESV on a U.S.-registered vessel to cease 
transmitting if necessary.
    (7) ESV operators transmitting in the 5925-6425 MHz (Earth-to-space) 
frequency bands to GSO satellites in the fixed-satellite service (FSS) 
shall not seek to coordinate, in any geographic location, more than 36 
megahertz of uplink bandwidth on each of no more than two GSO FSS 
satellites.
    (8) ESVs shall not operate in the 5925-6425 MHz (Earth-to-space) and 
3700-4200 MHz (space-to-Earth) frequency bands on vessels smaller than 
300 gross tons.
    (9) ESVs, operating while docked, that complete coordination with 
terrestrial stations in the 3700-4200 MHz band in accordance with Sec. 
25.251, shall receive protection from such terrestrial stations in 
accordance with the coordination agreements, for 180 days, renewable for 
180 days.
    (10) ESVs in motion shall not claim protection from harmful 
interference from any authorized terrestrial stations or lawfully 
operating satellites to which frequencies are either already assigned, 
or may be assigned in the future in the 3700-4200 MHz (space-to-Earth) 
frequency band.
    (11) ESVs operating within 200 km from the baseline of the United 
States, or within 200 km from a U.S.-licensed fixed service offshore 
installation, shall complete coordination with potentially affected 
U.S.-licensed fixed service operators prior to operation. The 
coordination method and the interference criteria objective shall be 
determined by the frequency coordinator. The details of the coordination 
shall be maintained and available at the frequency coordinator, and 
shall be filed with the Commission to be placed

[[Page 259]]

on public notice. Operation of each individual ESV may commence 
immediately after the public notice is released that identifies the 
notification sent to the Commission. Continuance of operation of that 
ESV for the duration of the coordination term shall be dependent upon 
successful completion of the normal public notice process. If, prior to 
the end of the 30-day comment period of the public notice, any 
objections are received from U.S.-licensed fixed service operators that 
have been excluded from coordination, the ESV licensee shall immediately 
cease operation of that particular station on frequencies used by the 
affected U.S.-licensed fixed service station until the coordination 
dispute is resolved and the ESV licensee informs the Commission of the 
resolution.
    (12) ESV operators must automatically cease transmission if the ESV 
operates in violation of the terms of its coordination agreement, 
including, but not limited to, conditions related to speed of the vessel 
or if the ESV travels outside the coordinated area, if within 200 km 
from the baseline of the United States, or within 200 km from a U.S.-
licensed fixed service offshore installation. Transmissions may be 
controlled by the ESV network. The frequency coordinator may decide 
whether ESV operators should automatically cease transmissions if the 
vessel falls below a prescribed speed within a prescribed geographic 
area.
    (b) Applications for ESV operation in the 5925-6425 MHz (Earth-to-
space) band to GSO satellites in the fixed-satellite service must 
include, in addition to the particulars of operation identified on Form 
312, and associated Schedule B, the applicable technical demonstrations 
in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section and the documentation 
identified in paragraphs (b)(3) through (b)(5) of this section.
    (1) An ESV applicant proposing to implement a transmitter under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section must demonstrate that the transmitter 
meets the off-axis EIRP spectral-density limits contained in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i) of this section. To provide this demonstration, the 
application shall include the tables described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of 
this section or the certification described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of 
this section. The ESV applicant also must provide the value N described 
in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section. An ESV applicant proposing to 
implement a transmitter under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section 
must provide the certifications identified in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of 
this section. An ESV applicant proposing to implement a transmitter 
under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section must provide the

    (i) Any ESV applicant filing an application pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section must file three tables showing the off-axis EIRP 
level of the proposed earth station antenna in the direction of the 
plane of the GSO; the co-polarized EIRP in the elevation plane, that is, 
the plane perpendicular to the plane of the GSO; and cross polarized 
EIRP. In each table, the EIRP level must be provided at increments of 
0.1[deg] for angles between 0[deg] and 10[deg] off-axis, and at 
increments of 5[deg] for angles between 10[deg] and 180[deg] off-axis.

the off-axis angle is the angle in degrees from the line connecting the 
focal point of the antenna to the orbital position of the target 
satellite, and the plane of the GSO is determined by the focal point of 
the antenna and the line tangent to the arc of the GSO at the orbital 
position of the target satellite.
    (B) For purposes of the off-axis co-polarized EIRP table in the 
elevation plane, the off-axis angle is the angle in degrees from the 
line connecting the focal point of the antenna to the orbital position 
of the target satellite, and the elevation plane is defined as the plane 
perpendicular to the plane of the GSO defined in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) 
of this section.
    (C) For purposes of the cross-polarized EIRP table, the off-axis 
angle is the angle in degrees from the line connecting the focal point 
of the antenna to the orbital position of the target satellite and the 
plane of the GSO as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section 
will be used.
    (ii) A certification, in Schedule B, that the ESV antenna conforms 
to the gain pattern criteria of Sec. 25.209(a) and

[[Page 260]]

(b), that, combined with the maximum input power density calculated from 
the EIRP density less the antenna gain, which is entered in Schedule B, 
demonstrates that the off-axis EIRP spectral density envelope set forth 
in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) through (a)(1)(i)(C) of this section will be 
met under the assumption that the antenna is pointed at the target 
satellite.
    (iii) An ESV applicant proposing to implement a transmitter under 
paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, must provide a certification 
from the equipment manufacturer stating that the antenna tracking system 
will maintain a pointing error of less than or equal to 0.2[deg] between 
the orbital location of the target satellite and the axis of the main 
lobe of the ESV antenna and that the antenna tracking system is capable 
of ceasing emissions within 100 milliseconds if the angle between the 
orbital location of the target satellite and the axis of the main lobe 
of the ESV antenna exceeds 0.5[deg].
    (iv) An ESV applicant proposing to implement a transmitter under 
paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section must:
    (A) Declare, in its application, a maximum antenna pointing error 
and demonstrate that the maximum antenna pointing error can be achieved 
without exceeding the off-axis EIRP spectral-density limits in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i) of this section; and
    (B) Demonstrate that the ESV transmitter can detect if the 
transmitter exceeds the declared maximum antenna pointing error and can 
cease transmission within 100 milliseconds if the angle between the 
orbital location of the target satellite and the axis of the main lobe 
of the ESV antenna exceeds the declared maximum antenna pointing error, 
and will not resume transmissions until the angle between the orbital 
location of the target satellite and the axis of the main lobe of the 
ESV antenna is less than or equal to the declared maximum antenna 
pointing error.
    (2) An ESV applicant proposing to implement a transmitter under 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section and using off-axis EIRP spectral-
densities in excess of the levels in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section 
shall provide the following certifications and demonstration as exhibits 
to its earth station application:
    (i) A statement from the target satellite operator certifying that 
the proposed operation of the ESV has the potential to create harmful 
interference to satellite networks adjacent to the target satellite(s) 
that may be unacceptable.
    (ii) A statement from the target satellite operator certifying that 
the power-density levels that the ESV applicant provided to the target 
satellite operator are consistent with the existing coordination 
agreements between its satellite(s) and the adjacent satellite systems

Sec. 25.222  Blanket Licensing provisions for Earth Stations on Vessels 

(ESVs) receiving in the 10.95-11.2 GHz (space-to-Earth), 11.45-11.7 GHz (space-to-
          Earth), 11.7-12.2 GHz (space-to-Earth) frequency bands and 
          transmitting in the 14.0-14.5 GHz (Earth-to-space) frequency 
          band, operating with Geostationary Orbit (GSO) Satellites in 
          the Fixed-Satellite Service.

    (a) The following ongoing requirements govern all ESV licensees and 
operations in the 10.95-11.2 GHz (space-to-Earth), 11.45-11.7 GHz 
(space-to-Earth), 11.7-12.2 GHz (space-to-Earth) frequency bands and 
14.0-14.5 GHz (Earth-to-space) bands transmitting to GSO satellites in 
the fixed-satellite service. ESV licensees must comply with the 
requirements in either paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section and 
all of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(7) of 
this section. Paragraph (b) of this section identifies items that must 
be included in the application for ESV operations to demonstrate that 
these ongoing requirements will be met.
    (1) The following requirements shall apply to an ESV that uses 
transmitters with off-axis effective isotropically radiated power (EIRP) 
spectral-densities lower than or equal to the levels in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i)(A) of this section. An ESV, or ESV system, operating under 
this section shall provide a detailed demonstration as described in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The ESV transmitter also must comply 
with the antenna pointing and cessation of emission requirements in 
paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (i) An ESV system shall not exceed the off-axis EIRP spectral-
density limits and conditions defined in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) through 
(a)(1)(i)(D) of this section.
    (A) The off-axis EIRP spectral-density emitted from the ESV, in the 
plane of the GSO as it appears at the particular earth station location, 
shall not exceed the following values:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15-10log(N)-25log[thetas].........  dBW/4 kHz............  for................  1.5[deg] <= [thetas] <= 7[deg]
-6 -10log(N)......................  dBW/4 kHz............  for................  7[deg] < [thetas] <= 9.2[deg]
18 -10log(N)-25log[thetas]........  dBW/4 kHz............  for................  9.2[deg] < [thetas] <= 48[deg]
-24 -10log(N).....................  dBW/4 kHz............  for................  48[deg] < [thetas] <= 85[deg]
-14 -10log(N).....................  dBW/4 kHz............  for................  85[deg] < [thetas] <= 180[deg]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Where theta ([thetas]) is the angle in degrees from the line 
connecting the focal point of the antenna to the orbital location of the 
target satellite, the plane of the GSO is determined by the focal point 
of the antenna and the line tangent to the arc of the GSO at the orbital 
location of the target satellite. For ESV networks using frequency 
division multiple access (FDMA) or time division multiple access (TDMA) 
techniques, N is equal to one. For ESV networks using multiple co-
frequency transmitters that have the same EIRP, N is the maximum 
expected number of co-frequency simultaneously transmitting ESV earth 
stations in the same satellite receiving beam. For the purpose of this 
section, the peak EIRP of an individual sidelobe may not exceed the 
envelope defined above for [thetas] between 1.5[deg] and 7.0[deg]. For 
[thetas] greater than 7.0[deg], the envelope may be exceeded by no more 
than 10% of the sidelobes, provided no individual sidelobe exceeds the 
envelope given above by more than 3 dB.
    (B) In all directions other than along the GSO, the off-axis EIRP 
spectral-density for co-polarized signals emitted from the ESV shall not 
exceed the following values:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18-10log(N)-25log[thetas].........  dBW/4 kHz............  for................  3.0[deg] <= [thetas] <= 48[deg]
-24-10log(N)......................  dBW/4 kHz............  for................  48[deg] < [thetas] <= 85[deg]
-14-10log(N)......................  dBW/4 kHz............  for................  85[deg] < [thetas] <= 180[deg]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[[Page 262]]

    Where [thetas] and N are defined in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this 
section. This off-axis EIRP spectral-density applies in any plane that 
includes the line connecting the focal point of the antenna to the 
orbital location of the target satellite with the exception of the plane 
of the GSO as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section. For the 
purpose of this section, the envelope may be exceeded by no more than 
10% of the sidelobes provided no individual sidelobe exceeds the gain 
envelope given above by more than 6 dB. The region of the main reflector 
spillover energy is to be interpreted as a single lobe and shall not 
exceed the envelope by more than 6 dB.
    (C) In all directions, the off-axis EIRP spectral-density for cross-
polarized signals emitted from the ESV shall not exceed the following 
values:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5-10log(N)-25log[thetas]..........  dBW/4 kHz............  for................  1.8[deg] <= [thetas] <= 7.0[deg]
-16-10log(N)......................  dBW/4 kHz............  for................  7.0[deg] < [thetas] <= 9.2[deg]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Where [thetas] and N are defined as set forth in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i)(A) of this section. This EIRP spectral-density applies in any 
plane that includes the line connecting the focal point of the antenna 
to the target satellite.
    (D) For non-circular ESV antennas, the major axis of the antenna 
will be aligned with the tangent to the arc of the GSO at the orbital 
location of the target satellite, to the extent required to meet the 
specified off-axis EIRP spectral-density criteria.
    (ii) Each ESV transmitter must meet one of the following antenna 
pointing requirements:
    (A) Each ESV transmitter shall maintain a pointing error of less 
than or equal to 0.2[deg] between the orbital location of the target 
satellite and the axis of the main lobe of the ESV antenna, or
    (B) Each ESV transmitter shall declare a maximum antenna pointing 
error that may be greater than 0.2[deg] provided that the ESV does not 
exceed the off-axis EIRP spectral-density limits in paragraph (a)(1)(i) 
of this section, taking into account the antenna pointing error.
    (iii) Each ESV transmitter must meet one of the following cessation 
of emission requirements:
    (A) For ESVs operating under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this 
section, all emissions from the ESV shall automatically cease within 100 
milliseconds if the angle between the orbital location of the target 
satellite and the axis of the main lobe of the ESV antenna exceeds 
0.5[deg], and transmission will not resume until such angle is less than 
or equal to 0.2[deg], or
    (B) For ESV transmitters operating under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of 
this section, all emissions from the ESV shall automatically cease 
within 100 milliseconds if the angle between the orbital location of the 
target satellite and the axis of the main lobe of the ESV antenna 
exceeds the declared maximum antenna pointing error and shall not resume 
transmissions until such angle is less than or equal to the declared 
maximum antenna pointing error.
    (2) The following requirements shall apply to an ESV that uses off-
axis EIRP spectral-densities in excess of the levels in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i) of this section. An ESV, or ESV system, operating under this 
section shall file certifications and provide a detailed demonstration 
as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (i) The ESV shall transmit only to the target satellite system(s) 
referred to in the certifications required by paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (ii) If a good faith agreement cannot be reached between the target 
satellite operator and the operator of a future satellite that is 
located within 6 degrees longitude of the target satellite, the ESV 
operator shall accept the power-density levels that would accommodate 
that adjacent satellite.
    (iii) The ESV shall operate in accordance with the off-axis EIRP 
spectral-densities that the ESV supplied to the target satellite 
operator in order to obtain the certifications listed in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section. The ESV shall automatically cease emissions 
within 100 milliseconds if the ESV transmitter exceeds the off-axis EIRP

[[Page 263]]

spectral-densities supplied to the target satellite operator.
    (3) There shall be a point of contact in the United States, with 
phone number and address, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 
with authority and ability to cease all emissions from the ESVs, either 
directly or through the facilities of a U.S. Hub or a Hub located in 
another country with which the United States has a bilateral agreement 
that enables such cessation of emissions.
    (4) For each ESV transmitter, a record of the ship location (i.e., 
latitude/longitude), transmit frequency, channel bandwidth and satellite 
used shall be time annotated and maintained for a period of not less 
than 1 year. Records will be recorded at time intervals no greater than 
every 20 minutes while the ESV is transmitting. The ESV operator will 
make this data available upon request to a coordinator, fixed system 
operator, fixed-satellite system operator, NTIA, or the Commission 
within 24 hours of the request.
    (5) ESV operators communicating with vessels of foreign registry 
must maintain detailed information on each vessel's country of registry 
and a point of contact for the relevant administration responsible for 
licensing ESVs.
    (6) ESV operators shall control all ESVs by a Hub earth station 
located in the United States, except that an ESV on U.S.-registered 
vessels may operate under control of a Hub earth station location 
outside the United States provided the ESV operator maintains a point of 
contact within the United States that will have the capability and 
authority to cause an ESV on a U.S.-registered vessel to cease 
transmitting if necessary.
    (7) In the 10.95-11.2 GHz (space-to-Earth) and 11.45-11.7 GHz 
(space-to-Earth) frequency bands ESVs shall not claim protection from 
interference from any authorized terrestrial stations to which 
frequencies are either already assigned, or may be assigned in the 
future.
    (b) Applications for ESV operation in the 14.0-14.5 GHz (Earth-to-
space) band to GSO satellites in the fixed-satellite service must 
include, in addition to the particulars of operation identified on Form 
312, and associated Schedule B, the applicable technical demonstrations 
in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section and the documentation

and will not resume transmissions until the angle between the orbital 
location of the target satellite and the axis of the main lobe of the 
ESV antenna is less than or equal to the declared maximum antenna 
pointing error.

are subject to coordination through the National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration (NTIA) Interdepartment Radio Advisory 
Committee (IRAC). When NTIA seeks to provide similar protection to 
future TDRSS sites that have been coordinated through the IRAC Frequency 
Assignment Subcommittee process, NTIA will notify the Commission that 
the site is nearing operational status. Upon public notice from the 
Commission, all Ku-band ESV operators must cease operations in the 14.0-
14.2 GHz band within 125 km of the new TDRSS site until after NTIA/IRAC 
coordination for the new TDRSS facility is complete. ESV operations will 
then again be permitted to operate in the 14.0-14.2 GHz band within 125

levels greater than 6 dB in excess of the limits defined above shall be 
permitted.
    (d) Licensees authorized pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section 
shall bear the burden of coordinating with any future applicants or 
licensees whose proposed compliant operations at 10 degrees or smaller 
orbital spacing, as defined by paragraph (b) of this section, is 
potentially or actually adversely affected by the operation of the non-
compliant licensee. If no good faith agreement can be reached, however, 
the non-compliant licensee shall reduce its earth station EIRP spectral 
density levels to be compliant with those specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (e) For earth stations employing uplink power control, the values in

amount of such increase in excess of the actual amount of monitored 
excess attenuation over clear sky propagation conditions shall not 
exceed 1.5 dB or 15% of the actual amount of monitored excess 
attenuation in dB, whichever is larger, with a confidence level of 90 
percent except over transient periods accounting for no more than 0.5% 
of the time during which the excess is no more than 4.0 dB.

    (a) Each operator of a 17/24 GHz BSS space station that is used to 
provide video programming directly to consumers in the 48 contiguous 
United States (CONUS) must provide comparable service to Alaska and 
Hawaii, unless such service is not technically feasible or not 
economically reasonable from the authorized orbital location.
    (b) Each operator of a 17/24 GHz BSS space station subject to 
paragraph (a) of this section must design and configure its space 
station to be capable of providing service to Alaska and Hawaii, that is 
comparable to the service that such satellites will provide to CONUS 
subscribers, from any orbital location capable of providing service to 
either Alaska or Hawaii to which it may be located or relocated in the

Sec. 25.226  Blanket licensing provisions for domestic, U.S. Vehicle-Mounted 

Earth Stations (VMESs) receiving in the 10.95-11.2 GHz (space-to-Earth), 11.45-
          11.7 GHz (space-to-Earth), and 11.7-12.2 GHz (space-to-Earth) 
          frequency bands and transmitting in the 14.0-14.5 GHz (Earth-
          to-space) frequency band, operating with Geostationary 
          Satellites in the Fixed-Satellite Service.

    (a) The following ongoing requirements govern all VMES licensees and 
operations in the 10.95-11.2 GHz (space-to-Earth), 11.45-11.7 GHz 
(space-to-Earth), 11.7-12.2 GHz (space-to-Earth) and 14.0-14.5 GHz 
(Earth-to-space) frequency bands receiving from and transmitting to 
geostationary orbit satellites in the fixed-satellite service. VMES 
licensees shall comply with the requirements in either paragraph (a)(1), 
(a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section and all of the requirements set forth 
in paragraphs (a)(4) through (a)(9) and paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of 
this section. Paragraph (b) of this section identifies items that shall 
be included in the application for VMES operations to demonstrate that 
these ongoing requirements will be met.
    (1) The following requirements shall apply to a VMES that uses 
transmitters with off-axis EIRP spectral-densities lower than or equal 
to the levels in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. A VMES, or VMES 
system, operating under this section shall provide a detailed 
demonstration as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The VMES 
transmitter also shall comply with the antenna pointing and cessation of 
emission requirements in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this 
section.
    (i) A VMES system shall not exceed the off-axis EIRP spectral-
density limits and conditions defined in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) through 
(D) of this section.
    (A) The off-axis EIRP spectral-density emitted from the VMES, in the 
plane of the geostationary satellite orbit (GSO) as it appears at the 
particular earth station location, shall not exceed the following 
values:
15-10log(N)-25log[thetas] dBW/4kHz for 1.5[deg] <= [thetas] <= 7[deg]
-6 -10log(N) dBW/4kHz for 7[deg] < [thetas] <= 9.2[deg]
18 -10log(N)-25log[thetas] dBW/4kHz for 9.2[deg] < [thetas] <= 48[deg]
-24 -10log(N) dBW/4kHz for 48[deg] < [thetas] <= 85[deg]
-14 -10log(N) dBW/4kHz for 85[deg] < [thetas] <= 180[deg]
where theta ([thetas]) is the angle in degrees from the line connecting 
the focal point of the antenna to the orbital location of the target 
satellite, the plane of the GSO is determined by the focal point of the 
antenna and the line tangent to the arc of the GSO at the orbital 
location of the target satellite. For VMES networks using frequency 
division multiple access (FDMA) or time division multiple access (TDMA) 
techniques, N is equal to one. For VMES networks using multiple co-
frequency transmitters that have the same EIRP, N is the maximum 
expected number of co-frequency simultaneously transmitting VMES earth 
stations in the

[[Page 269]]

same satellite receiving beam. For the purpose of this section, the peak 
EIRP of an individual sidelobe shall not exceed the envelope defined 
above for [thetas] between 1.5[deg] and 7.0[deg]. For [thetas] greater 
than 7.0[deg], the envelope shall be exceeded by no more than 10% of the 
sidelobes, provided no individual sidelobe exceeds the envelope given 
above by more than 3 dB.

    (B) In all directions other than along the GSO, the off-axis EIRP 
spectral-density for co-polarized signals emitted from the VMES shall 
not exceed the following values:

18-10log(N)-25log[thetas] dBW/4kHz for 3.0[deg] <= [thetas] <= 48[deg]
-24-10log(N) dBW/4kHz for 48[deg] < [thetas] <= 85[deg]
-14-10log(N) dBW/4kHz for 85[deg] < [thetas] <= 180[deg]

where [thetas] and N are defined in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this 
section. This off-axis EIRP spectral-density applies in any plane that 
includes the line connecting the focal point of the antenna to the 
orbital location of the target satellite with the exception of the plane 
of the GSO as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section. For the 
purpose of this subsection, the envelope shall be exceeded by no more 
than 10% of the sidelobes provided no individual sidelobe exceeds the 
gain envelope given above by more than 6 dB. The region of the main 
reflector spillover energy is to be interpreted as a single lobe and 
shall not exceed the envelope by more than 6 dB.

    (C) In all directions, the off-axis EIRP spectral-density for cross-
polarized signals emitted from the VMES shall not exceed the following 
values:

5-10log(N)-25log[thetas] dBW/4kHz for 1.8[deg] <= [thetas] <= 7.0[deg]
-16-10log(N) dBW/4kHz for 7.0[deg] < [thetas] <= 9.2[deg]

where [thetas] and N are defined as set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) 
of this section. This EIRP spectral-density applies in any plane that 
includes the line connecting the focal point of the antenna to the 
target satellite.

    (D) For non-circular VMES antennas, the major axis of the antenna 
shall be aligned with the tangent to the arc of the GSO at the orbital 
location of the target satellite, to the extent required to meet the 
specified off-axis EIRP spectral-density criteria.
    (ii) Each VMES transmitter shall meet one of the following antenna 
pointing requirements:
    (A) Each VMES transmitter shall maintain a pointing error of less 
than or equal to 0.2[deg] between the orbital location of the target 
satellite and the axis of the main lobe of the VMES antenna, or
    (B) Each VMES transmitter shall declare a maximum antenna pointing 
error that may be greater than 0.2[deg] provided that the VMES does not 
exceed the off-axis EIRP spectral-density limits in paragraph (a)(1)(i) 
of this section, taking into account the antenna pointing error.
    (iii) Each VMES transmitter shall meet one of the following 
cessation of emission requirements:
    (A) For VMESs operating under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this 
section, all emissions from the VMES shall automatically cease within 
100 milliseconds if the angle between the orbital location of the target 
satellite and the axis of the main lobe of the VMES antenna exceeds 
0.5[deg], and transmission shall not resume until such angle is less 
than or equal to 0.2[deg], or
    (B) For VMES transmitters operating under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of 
this section, all emissions from the VMES shall automatically cease 
within 100 milliseconds if the angle between the orbital location of the 
target satellite and the axis of the main lobe of the VMES antenna 
exceeds the declared maximum antenna pointing error and shall not resume 
transmissions until such angle is less than or equal to the declared 
maximum antenna pointing error.
    (2) The following requirements shall apply to a VMES that uses off-
axis EIRP spectral-densities in excess of the levels in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i) of this section. A VMES, or VMES system, operating under this 
subsection shall file certifications and provide a detailed 
demonstration as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (i) The VMES shall transmit only to the target satellite system(s) 
referred to in the certifications required by paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (ii) If a good faith agreement cannot be reached between the target 
satellite operator and the operator of a future satellite that is 
located within 6 degrees longitude of the target satellite, the VMES 
operator shall accept the power-density levels that would accommodate 
that adjacent satellite.

[[Page 270]]

    (iii) The VMES shall operate in accordance with the off-axis EIRP 
spectral-densities that the VMES supplied to the target satellite 
operator in order to obtain the certifications listed in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section. The VMES shall automatically cease emissions 
within 100 milliseconds if the VMES transmitter exceeds the off-axis 
EIRP spectral-densities supplied to the target satellite operator.
    (3) The following requirements shall apply to a VMES system that 
uses variable power-density control of individual simultaneously 
transmitting co-frequency VMES earth stations in the same satellite 
receiving beam. A VMES system operating under this subsection shall file 
certifications and provide a detailed demonstration as described in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (i) Except as defined under paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, 
the effective aggregate EIRP-density from all terminals shall be at 
least 1 dB below the off-axis EIRP-density limits defined in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section. In this context the term 
``effective'' means that the resultant co-polarized and cross-polarized 
EIRP-density experienced by any GSO or non-GSO satellite shall not 
exceed that produced by a single VMES transmitter operating 1 dB below 
the limits defined in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this 
section. A VMES system operating under this section shall file 
certifications and provide a detailed demonstration as described in 
paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(iii) of this section.

axis EIRP spectral-densities in excess of the levels in paragraph 
(a)(3)(i) of this section. A VMES system operating under this section 
shall file certifications and provide a detailed demonstration as 
described in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (b)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (A) If a good faith agreement cannot be reached between the target 
satellite operator and the operator of a future satellite that is 
located within 6 degrees longitude of the target satellite, the VMES 
shall operate at an EIRP-density defined in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this 
section.
    (B) The VMES shall operate in accordance with the off-axis EIRP 
spectral-densities that the VMES supplied to the target satellite 
operator in order to obtain the certifications listed in paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii) of this section. The individual VMES terminals shall 
automatically cease emissions within 100 milliseconds if the VMES 
transmitter exceeds the off-axis EIRP spectral-densities supplied to the 
target satellite operator. The overall system shall be capable of 
shutting off an individual transmitter or the entire system if the 
aggregate off-axis EIRP spectral-densities exceed those supplied to the 
target satellite operator.
    (C) The VMES shall transmit only to the target satellite system(s) 
referred to in the certifications required by paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section.
    (iii) The VMES shall file a report one year following license 
issuance detailing the effective aggregate EIRP-density levels resulting 
from its operation, in compliance with paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this 
section.
    (4) An applicant filing to operate a VMES terminal or system and 
planning to use a contention protocol shall certify that its contention 
protocol use will be reasonable.
    (5) There shall be a point of contact in the United States, with 
phone number and address, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 
with authority and ability to cease all emissions from the VMESs.
    (6) For each VMES transmitter, a record of the vehicle location 
(i.e., latitude/longitude), transmit frequency, channel bandwidth and 
satellite used shall be time annotated and maintained for a period of 
not less than one (1) year. Records shall be recorded at time intervals 
no greater than every five (5) minutes while the VMES is transmitting. 
The VMES operator shall make this data available upon request to a 
coordinator, fixed system operator, fixed-satellite system operator, 
NTIA, or the Commission within 24 hours of the request.
    (7) In the 10.95-11.2 GHz (space-to-Earth) and 11.45-11.7 GHz 
(space-to-Earth) frequency bands VMESs shall not claim protection from 
interference from any authorized terrestrial stations to which 
frequencies are either

[[Page 271]]

already assigned, or may be assigned in the future.
    (8) A VMES terminal receiving in the 10.95-11.2 GHz (space-to-
Earth), 11.45-11.7 GHz (space-to-Earth) and 11.7-12.2 GHz (space-to-
Earth) bands shall receive protection from interference caused by space 
stations other than the target space station only to the degree to which 
harmful interference would not be expected to be caused to an earth 
station employing an antenna conforming to the referenced patterns 
defined in Sec. 25.209(a) and (b) and stationary at the location at 
which any interference occurred.
    (9) Each VMES terminal shall automatically cease transmitting within 
100 milliseconds upon loss of reception of the satellite downlink 
signal.
    (b) Applications for VMES operation in the 14.0-14.5 GHz (Earth-to-
space) band to GSO satellites in the fixed-satellite service shall 
include, in addition to the particulars of operation identified on Form 
312, and associated Schedule B, the applicable technical demonstrations 
in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section and the 
documentation identified in paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(8) of this 
section.
    (1) A VMES applicant proposing to implement a transmitter under

of the target satellite, and the elevation plane is defined as the plane 
perpendicular to the plane of the GSO defined in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) 
of this section.
    (C) For purposes of the cross-polarized EIRP table, the off-axis 
angle is the angle in degrees from the line connecting the focal point

will be used.
    (ii) A VMES applicant shall include a certification, in Schedule B, 
that the VMES antenna conforms to the gain pattern criteria of Sec. 
25.209(a) and (b), that, combined with the maximum input power density 
calculated from the EIRP density less the antenna gain, which is entered 
in Schedule B, demonstrates that the off-axis EIRP spectral density 
envelope set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) through (a)(1)(i)(C) of 
this section will be met under the assumption that the antenna is 
pointed at the target satellite.
    (iii) A VMES applicant proposing to implement a transmitter under 
paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section shall provide a certification 
from the equipment manufacturer stating that the antenna tracking system

transmitter exceeds the declared maximum antenna pointing error and can 
cease transmission within 100 milliseconds if the angle between the 
orbital location of the target satellite and the axis of the main lobe 
of the VMES antenna exceeds the declared maximum antenna pointing error, 
and will not resume transmissions until the angle between the orbital 
location of the target satellite and the axis of the main lobe of the 
VMES antenna is less than or equal to the declared maximum antenna 
pointing error.
    (2) A VMES applicant proposing to implement a transmitter under 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section and using off-axis EIRP spectral-
densities in excess of the levels in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section 
shall provide the following certifications and demonstration as exhibits 
to its earth station application:

the proposed operation of the VMES has the potential to create harmful 
interference to satellite networks adjacent to the target satellite(s) 
that may be unacceptable.
    (ii) A statement from the target satellite operator certifying that 
the power density levels that the VMES applicant provided to the target 
satellite operator are consistent with the existing coordination

all simultaneously transmitting co-frequency terminals operating with 
the same satellite transponder at least 1 dB below the EIRP-density 
limits defined in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section. 
In this context the term ``effective'' means that the resultant co-
polarized and cross-polarized EIRP-density experienced by any GSO or 
non-GSO satellite shall not exceed that produced by a single VMES 
transmitter operating at 1 dB below the limits defined in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section. The International Bureau will

milliseconds when an individual transmitter exceeds the off-axis EIRP 
spectral-densities supplied to the target satellite operator and that 
the overall system is capable of shutting off an individual transmitter 
or the entire system if the aggregate off-axis EIRP spectral-densities 
exceed those supplied to the target satellite operator.
    (F) An identification of the specific satellite or satellites with 
which the VMES system will operate.
    (iii) The applicant shall acknowledge that it will maintain

whether VMES terminals, or classes of terminals, will produce power 
densities that will exceed the Commission's radio frequency exposure 
criteria. VMES applicants with VMES terminals that will exceed the 
guidelines in Sec. 1.1310 of this chapter for radio frequency radiation 
exposure shall provide, with their environmental assessment, a plan for 
mitigation of radiation exposure to the extent required to meet those 
guidelines. All VMES licensees shall ensure installation of VMES 
terminals on vehicles by qualified installers who have an understanding 
of the antenna's radiation environment and the measures best suited to 
maximize protection of the general public and persons operating the 
vehicle and equipment. A VMES terminal exhibiting radiation exposure

Committee (IRAC). Licensees shall notify the International Bureau once 
they have completed coordination. Upon receipt of such notification from 
a licensee, the International Bureau will issue a public notice stating 
that the licensee may commence operations within the coordination zone 
in 30 days if no party has opposed the operations.
    (2) When NTIA seeks to provide similar protection to future TDRSS 
sites that have been coordinated through the IRAC Frequency Assignment 
Subcommittee process, NTIA will notify the Commission's International 
Bureau that the site is nearing operational status. Upon public notice 
from the International Bureau, all Ku-band VMES licensees shall cease 
operations in the 14.0-14.2 GHz band within 125 km of the new TDRSS site 
until the licensees complete coordination with NTIA/IRAC for the new 
TDRSS facility. Licensees shall notify the International Bureau once 
they have completed coordination for the new TDRSS site. Upon receipt of 
such notification from a licensee, the International Bureau will issue a 
public notice stating that the licensee may commence operations within 
the coordination zone in 30 days if no party has opposed the operations. 
The VMES licensee then will be permitted to commence operations in the 
14.0-14.2 GHz band within 125 km of the new TDRSS site, subject to any 
operational constraints developed in the coordination process.
    (d)(1) Operations of VMESs in the 14.47-14.5 GHz (Earth-to-space) 
frequency band in the vicinity of radio astronomy service (RAS) 
observatories observing in the 14.47-14.5 GHz band are subject to 
coordination with the National Science Foundation (NSF). The appropriate 
NSF contact point to initiate coordination is Electromagnetic Spectrum 
Manager, NSF, 4201 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1045, Arlington VA 22203, fax 
703-292-9034, e-mail esm@nsf.gov. Licensees shall notify the 
International Bureau once they have completed coordination. Upon receipt 
of the coordination agreement from a licensee, the International Bureau 
will issue a public notice stating that the licensee may commence 
operations within the coordination zone in 30 days if no party has 
opposed the operations.

    (3) When NTIA seeks to provide similar protection to future RAS 
sites that have been coordinated through the

[[Page 275]]

IRAC Frequency Assignment Subcommittee process, NTIA will notify the 
Commission's International Bureau that the site is nearing operational 
status. Upon public notice from the International Bureau, all Ku-band 
VMES licensees shall cease operations in the 14.47-14.5 GHz band within 
the relevant geographic zone (160 kms for single-dish radio 
observatories and Very Large Array antenna systems and 50 kms for Very 
Long Baseline Array antenna systems) of the new RAS site until the 
licensees complete coordination for the new RAS facility. Licensees 
shall notify the International Bureau once they have completed 
coordination for the new RAS site and shall submit the coordination 
agreement to the Commission. Upon receipt of such notification from a 
licensee, the International Bureau will issue a public notice stating 
that the licensee may commence operations within the coordination zone 
in 30 days if no party opposed the operations. The VMES licensee then 
will be permitted to commence operations in the 14.47-14.5 GHz band 
within the relevant coordination distance around the new RAS site, 
subject to any operational constraints developed in the coordination 
process.
    (e) VMES licensees shall use Global Positioning Satellite-related or 
other similar position location technology to ensure compliance with 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.

Sec. 25.252  Special requirements for ancillary terrestrial components operating in the 2000-2020 MHz/2180-2200 MHz bands.

    (a) Applicants for an ancillary terrestrial component in these bands 
must demonstrate that ATC base stations shall not:
    (1) Exceed an EIRP of -100.6 dBW/4 kHz for out-of-channel emissions 
at the edge of the MSS licensee's selected assignment.
    (2) Exceed a peak EIRP of 27 dBW in 1.23 MHz.
    (3) Exceed an EIRP toward the physical horizon (not to include man-
made structures) of 25.5 dBW in 1.23 MHz.
    (4) Be located less than 190 meters from all airport runways and 
aircraft stand areas, including takeoff and landing paths.
    (5) Exceed an aggregate power flux density of -51.8 dBW/m\2\ in a 
1.23 MHz bandwidth at all airport runways and aircraft stand areas, 
including takeoff and landing paths and all ATC base station antennas 
shall have an overhead gain suppression according to the following.

[[Page 276]]

    (6) Be located less than 820 meters from a U.S. Earth Station 
facility operating in the 2200-2290 MHz band. In its MSS ATC 
application, the MSS licensee should request a list of operational 
stations in the 2200-2290 MHz band.
    (7) Generate EIRP density, averaged over any two millisecond active 
transmission interval, greater than -70 dBW/MHz in the 1559-1610 MHz 
band. The EIRP, measured over any two millisecond active transmission 
interval, of discrete out-of-band emissions of less than 700 Hz 
bandwidth from such base stations, shall not exceed -80 dBW in the 1559-
1610 MHz band. A root-mean-square detector function with a resolution 
bandwidth of one megahertz or equivalent and no less video bandwidth 
shall be used to measure wideband EIRP density for purposes of this 
rule, and narrowband EIRP shall be measured with a root-mean-square 
detector function with a resolution bandwidth of one kilohertz or 
equivalent.
    (8) Use ATC base station antennas that have a gain greater than 17 
dBi and must have an overhead gain suppression according to the 
following:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Angle from direction of maximum gain,
    in vertical plane, above antenna      Antenna discrimination pattern
               (degrees)                               (dB)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0......................................  Gmax
2......................................  Not to Exceed Gmax -14
8 to 180...............................  Not to Exceed Gmax -25
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where: Gmax is the maximum gain of the base station antenna in dBi.

    (b) Applicants for an ancillary terrestrial component in these bands 
must demonstrate that ATC mobile terminals shall:
    (1) Observe a peak EIRP limit of 1.0 dBW in 1.23 MHz.
    (2) Limit out-of-channel emissions at the edge of a MSS licensee's 
selected assignment to an EIRP density of -67 dBW/4 kHz.
    (3) Not generate EIRP density, averaged over any two-millisecond 
active transmission interval, greater than -70 dBW/MHz in the 1559-1610 
MHz band. The EIRP, measured over any two-millisecond active 
transmission interval, of discrete out-of-band emissions of less than 
700 Hz bandwidth from such mobile terminals shall not exceed -80 dBW in 
the 1559-1610 MHz band. The EIRP density of carrier-off-state emissions 
from such mobile terminals shall not exceed -80 dBW/MHz in the 1559-1610 
MHz band, averaged over a two-millisecond interval. A root-mean-square 
detector function with a resolution bandwidth of one megahertz or 
equivalent and no less video bandwidth shall be used to measure wideband 
EIRP density for purposes of this rule, and narrowband EIRP shall be 
measured with a root-mean-square detector function with a resolution 
bandwidth of one kilohertz or equivalent.
    (c) For ATC operations in the 2000-2020 MHz band, the power of any 
emission outside the licensee's frequency band(s) of operation shall be 
attenuated below the transmitter power (P) within the licensed band(s) 
of operation, measured in watts, in accordance with the following:
    (1) On any frequency within the 2000 to 2020 MHz band outside the 
licensee's frequency band(s) of operations, emissions shall be 
attenuated by at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB.
    (2) Emissions on frequencies lower than 1995 MHz and higher than 
2025 MHz shall be attenuated by at least 70 + 10 log P. Emissions in the 
bands 1995-2000 MHz and 2020-2025 MHz shall be attenuated by at least a 
value as determined by linear interpolation from 70 + 10 log P at 1995 
MHz or 2025 MHz, to 43 + 10 log P dB at the nearest MSS band edge at 
2000 MHz or 2020 MHz respectively.
    (3) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes 
harmful interference, the Commission may, in its discretion, require 
greater attenuation than specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this 
section.
    (4) Compliance with these provisions is based on the use of 
measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 1 
megahertz or greater.

[[Page 277]]

    Note to Sec. 25.252: The preceding rules of Sec. 25.252 are based 
on cdma2000 system architecture. To the extent that a 2 GHz MSS licensee 
is able to demonstrate that the use of a different system architecture 
would produce no greater potential interference than that produced as a 
result of implementing the rules of this section, an MSS licensee is 
permitted to apply for ATC authorization based on another system 
architecture.

    (a) An ancillary terrestrial component in these bands shall:
    (1) In any band segment coordinated for the exclusive use of an MSS 
applicant within the land area of the U.S., where there is no other L-
Band MSS satellite making use of that band segment within the visible 
portion of the geostationary arc as seen from the ATC coverage area, the 
ATC system will be limited by the in-band and out-of-band emission 
limitations contained in this section and the requirement to maintain a 
substantial MSS service.
    (2) In any band segment that is coordinated for the shared use of 
the applicant's MSS system and another MSS operator, where the 
coordination agreement existed prior to February 10, 2005 and permits a 
level of interference to the other MSS system of less than 6% [Delta]T/
T, the applicant's combined ATC and MSS operations shall increase the 
system noise level of the other MSS to no more then 6% [Delta]T/T. Any 
future coordination agreement between the parties governing ATC 
operation will supersede this paragraph.
    (3) In any band segment that is coordinated for the shared use of 
the applicant's MSS system and another MSS operator, where a 
coordination agreement existed prior to February 10, 2005 and permits a 
level of interference to the other MSS system of 6% [Delta]T/T or 
greater, the applicant's ATC operations may increase the system noise 
level of the other MSS system by no more than an additional 1% [Delta]T/
T. Any future coordination agreement between the parties governing ATC 
operations will supersede this paragraph.
    (4) In a band segment in which the applicant has no rights under a 
coordination agreement, the applicant may not implement ATC in that 
band.
    (b) ATC base stations shall not exceed an out-of-channel emissions 
measurement of -57.9 dBW/MHz at the edge of a MSS licensee's authorized 
and internationally coordinated MSS frequency assignment.
    (c) An applicant for an ancillary terrestrial component in these

the aeronautical mobile-satellite en-route service (AMS(R)S) and the 
global maritime distress and safety system (GMDSS).
    (2) Coordinate with the terrestrial CMRS operators prior to 
initiating ATC transmissions when co-locating ATC base stations with 
terrestrial commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) base stations that 
make use of Global Positioning System (GPS) time-based receivers.

demonstrate the ATC system conforms to the [Delta]T/T requirements in 
paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, if a coordination 
agreement that incorporates the ATC operations does not exist with other 
MSS operators.
    (d) Applicants for an ancillary terrestrial component in these bands 
must demonstrate that ATC base stations shall not:
    (1) Exceed a peak EIRP of 31.9-10*log (number of carriers) dBW/

sum of all power flux density values associated with all carriers in a 
sector in the 1525-1559 MHz frequency band, expressed in dB(Watts/m\2\/
200 kHz). Free-space loss must be assumed if this requirement is 
demonstrated via calculation;
    (6) Exceed a total power flux density level of -56.6 dBW/ m\2\/200

demonstrated via calculation;
    (7) Exceed a total power flux density level of -64.6 dBW/ m\2\/200 
kHz at the water's edge of any navigable waterway from all carriers 
operating in the 1541.5-1547.5 MHz frequency band. The total power flux 
density here is the sum of all power flux density values associated with 
all carriers in a sector in the 1541.5-1547.5 MHz frequency band, 
expressed in dB(Watts/m\2\/200 kHz). Free-space loss must be assumed if 
this requirement is demonstrated via calculation;
    (8) Exceed a peak antenna gain of 16 dBi;
    (9) Generate EIRP density, averaged over any two-millisecond active

band or greater than a level determined by linear interpolation in the 
1605-1610 MHz band, from -70 dBW/MHz at 1605 MHz to -46 dBW/MHz at 1610 
MHz. The EIRP, averaged over any two-millisecond active transmission 
interval, of discrete out-of-band emissions of less than 700 Hz 
bandwidth from such base stations shall not exceed -80 dBW in the 1559-
1605 MHz band or exceed a level determined by linear interpolation in

A root-mean-square detector function with a resolution bandwidth of one 
megahertz or equivalent and no less video bandwidth shall be used to

resolution bandwidth of one kilohertz or equivalent.
    (e) Applicants for an ancillary terrestrial component in these bands 
must demonstrate, at the time of the application, that ATC base stations 
shall use left-hand-circular polarization antennas with a maximum gain

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Angle from direction of maximum
  gain, in vertical plane, above    Antenna discrimination pattern (dB)
        antenna (degrees)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0................................  Gmax
5................................  Not to Exceed Gmax -5
10...............................  Not to Exceed Gmax -19
15 to 55.........................  Not to Exceed Gmax -27
55 to 145........................  Not to Exceed Gmax -30
145 to 180.......................  Not to Exceed Gmax -26
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Where: Gmax is the maximum gain of the base station antenna in dBi.
    (f) Prior to operation, ancillary terrestrial component licensees 
shall:
    (1) Provide the Commission with sufficient information to complete 
coordination of ATC base stations with Search-and-Rescue Satellite-Aided 
Tracking (SARSAT) earth stations operating in the 1544-1545 MHz band for 
any ATC base station located either within 27 km of a SARSAT station, or

[[Page 279]]

within radio horizon of the SARSAT station, whichever is less.
    (2) Take all practicable steps to avoid locating ATC base stations 
within radio line of sight of Mobile Aeronautical Telemetry (MAT) 
receive sites in order to protect U.S. MAT systems consistent with ITU-R 
Recommendation ITU-R M.1459. MSS ATC base stations located within radio 
line of sight of a MAT receiver must be coordinated with the Aerospace 
and Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council (AFTRCC) for non-Government 
MAT receivers on a case-by-case basis prior to operation. For government 
MAT receivers, the MSS licensee shall supply sufficient information to 
the Commission to allow coordination to take place. A listing of current 
and planned MAT receiver sites can be obtained from AFTRCC for non-
Government sites and through the FCC's IRAC Liaison for Government MAT 
receiver sites.
    (g) ATC mobile terminals shall:
    (1) Be limited to a peak EIRP level of 0 dBW and an out-of-channel 
emissions of -67 dBW/4 kHz at the edge of an MSS licensee's authorized 
and internationally coordinated MSS frequency assignment.
    (2) Be operated in a fashion that takes all practicable steps to 
avoid causing interference to U.S. radio astronomy service (RAS) 
observations in the 1660-1660.5 MHz band.
    (3) Not generate EIRP density, averaged over any two-millisecond 
active transmission interval, greater than -70 dBW/MHz in the 1559-1605 
MHz band or greater than a level determined by linear interpolation in 
the 1605-1610 MHz band, from -70 dBW/MHz at 1605 MHz to -46 dBW/MHz at 
1610 MHz. The EIRP, averaged over any two-millisecond active 
transmission interval, of discrete out-of-band emissions of less than 
700 Hz bandwidth from such mobile terminals shall not exceed -80 dBW in 
the 1559-1605 MHz band or exceed a level determined by linear 
interpolation in the 1605-1610 MHz band, from -80 dBW at 1605 MHz to -56 
dBW at 1610 MHz. The EIRP density of carrier-off-state emissions from 
such mobile terminals shall not exceed -80 dBW/MHz in the 1559-1610 MHz 
band, averaged over a two-millisecond interval. A root-mean-square 
detector function with a resolution bandwidth of one megahertz or 
equivalent and no less video bandwidth shall be used to measure wideband 
EIRP density for purposes of this rule, and narrowband EIRP shall be 
measured with a root-mean-square detector function with a resolution 
bandwidth of one kilohertz or equivalent.
    (h) When implementing multiple base stations and/or base stations 
using multiple carriers, where any third-order intermodulation product 
of these base stations falls on an L-band MSS band coordinated for use 
by another MSS operator with rights to the coordinated band, the MSS ATC 
licensee must notify the MSS operator. The MSS operator may request 
coordination to modify the base station carrier frequencies, or to 
reduce the maximum base station EIRP on the frequencies contributing to 
the third-order intermodulation products. The threshold for this 
notification and coordination is when the sum of the calculated signal 
levels received by an MSS receiver exceeds -70 dBm. The MSS receiver 
used in these calculations can be assumed to have an antenna with 0 dBi 
gain. Free-space propagation between the base station antennas and the 
MSS terminals can be assumed and actual signal polarizations for the ATC 
signals and the MSS system may be used.

shall be used to measure wideband EIRP density for purposes of this 
rule, and narrowband EIRP shall be measured with a root-mean-square 
detector function with a resolution bandwidth of one kilohertz or 
equivalent.
    (b) An applicant for an ancillary terrestrial component in these 
bands must demonstrate that mobile terminals shall:
    (1) Meet the requirements contained in Sec. 25.213 to protect radio 
astronomy service (RAS) observations in the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz band from

    (4) ATC mobile terminals operating in assigned frequencies in the 
1610-1626.5 MHz band shall not generate EIRP density, averaged over any 
two-millisecond active transmission interval, greater than -70 dBW/MHz 
in the 1559-1605 MHz band or greater than a level determined by linear 
interpolation in the 1605-1610 MHz band, from -70 dBW/MHz at 1605 MHz to

    (d) To avoid interference to an adjacent channel licensee in the 
Broadband Radio Service (BRS), the power of any ATC base station 
emission above 2495 MHz shall be attenuated below the transmitter power 
(P) measured in watts in accordance with the standards below. If these 
measures do not resolve a documented interference complaint received 
from the adjacent channel

[[Page 281]]

BRS licensee, the provisions of Sec. 25.255 shall apply.
    (1) For base stations, the attenuation shall be not less than 43 + 
10 log (P) dB at the upper edge of the authorized ATC band, unless a 
documented interference complaint is received from an adjacent channel 
licensee in the BRS. Provided that a documented interference complaint 
cannot be mutually resolved between the parties, the following 
additional attenuation requirements set forth in subsections (2)-(5) 
shall apply:
    (2) If a pre-existing BRS base station suffers harmful interference 
from emissions caused by a new or modified ATC base station located 1.5 
km or more away, within 24 hours of the receipt of a documented 
interference complaint the ATC licensee must attenuate its emissions by 
at least 67 + 10 log (P) dB measured at 3 megahertz above the edge of 
the authorized ATC band, and shall immediately notify the complaining 
licensee upon implementation of the additional attenuation.
    (3) If a pre-existing BRS base station suffers harmful interference 
from emissions caused by a new or modified ATC base station located less 
than 1.5 km away, within 24 hours of the receipt of a documented 
interference complaint the ATC licensee must attenuate its emissions by 
at least 67 + 10 log (P) -20 log(D<INF>km</INF>/1.5) dB measured at 3 
megahertz above the edge of the authorized ATC band, or if both base 
stations are co-located, limit its undesired signal level at the pre-
existing BRS base station receiver(s) to no more than -107 dBm measured 
in a 5.5 megahertz bandwidth and shall immediately notify the 
complaining licensee upon such reduction in the undesired signal level.
    (4) If a new or modified BRS base station suffers harmful 
interference from emissions caused by a pre-existing ATC base station 
located 1.5 km or more away, within 60 days of receipt of a documented 
interference complaint the licensee of the ATC base station must 
attenuate its base station emissions by at least 67 + 10 log (P) dB 
measured at 3 megahertz above the edge of the authorized ATC band.
    (5) If a new or modified BRS base station suffers harmful 
interference from emissions caused by a pre-existing ATC base station 
located less than 1.5 km away, within 60 days of receipt of a documented 
interference complaint:
    (i) the ATC licensee must attenuate its base station emissions by at 
least 67 + 10 log (P) -20 log(D<INF>km</INF>/1.5) dB measured 3 
megahertz above the edge of the authorized ATC band, or
    (ii) if both base stations are co-located, the ATC licensee must 
limit its undesired signal level at the new or modified BRS base station 
receiver(s) to no more than -107 dBm measured in a 5.5 megahertz 
bandwidth.
    (6) Compliance with these rules is based on the use of measurement 
instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz or greater. 
However, in the 1 MHz bands immediately above and adjacent to the 2495 
MHz a resolution bandwidth of at least one percent of the emission 
bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the transmitter may be 
employed. A narrower resolution bandwidth is permitted in all cases to 
improve measurement accuracy, provided the measured power is integrated 
over the full required measurement bandwidth (i.e., 1 MHz or 1 percent 
of emission bandwidth, as specified). The emission bandwidth is defined 
as the width of the signal between two points, one below the carrier 
center frequency and one above the carrier center frequency, outside of 
which all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter 
power. When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes 
harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require 
greater attenuation than specified in this section.

    Note to Sec. 25.254: The preceding rules of Sec. 25.254 are based 
on cdma2000 and IS-95 system architecture. To the extent that a Big LEO 
MSS licensee is able to demonstrate that the use of different system 
architectures would produce no greater potential interference than that 
produced as a result of implementing the rules of this section, an MSS 
licensee is permitted to apply for ATC authorization based on another 
system architecture.

Sec. 25.259  Time sharing between NOAA meteorological satellite systems 

and non-voice, non-geostationary satellite systems in the 137-138 MHz band.

    (a) A non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service system 
licensee (``NVNG licensee'') time-sharing spectrum in the 137-138 MHz 
frequency band shall not transmit signals into the ``protection areas'' 
of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (``NOAA'') satellite 
systems. When calculating the protection areas for a NOAA satellite in 
the 137.333-137.367 MHz, 137.485-137.515 MHz, 137.605-137.635 MHz and 
137.753-137.787 MHz bands, a NVNG licensee shall use an earth station 
elevation angle of five degrees towards the NOAA satellite and will 
cease its transmissions prior to the NVNG licensee's service area, based 
on an elevation angle of zero degrees towards the NVNG licensee's 
satellite, overlapping the NOAA protection area. When calculating the 
protection areas for a NOAA satellite in the 137.025-137.175 MHz and 
137.825-138 MHz bands, a NVNG licensee shall use an earth station 
elevation angle of zero degrees, or less if reasonably necessary, 
towards the NOAA satellite and will cease its transmissions prior to the 
NVNG licensee's service area, based on an elevation angle of zero 
degrees towards the NVNG licensee's satellite, overlapping the NOAA 
protection area. A NVNG licensee is responsible for obtaining the 
necessary ephemeris data. This information shall be updated system-wide 
on at least a weekly basis. A NVNG licensee shall use an orbital 
propagator algorithm with an accuracy equal to or greater than the NORAD 
propagator used by NOAA.
    (b) A NVNG licensee time sharing spectrum in the 137-138 MHz band 
shall establish a 24-hour per day contact person and telephone number so 
that claims of harmful interference into NOAA earth station users and 
other operational issues can be reported and resolved expeditiously. 
This contact information shall be made available to NOAA or its 
designee. If the National Telecommunications and Information 
Administration (``NTIA'') notifies the Commission that NOAA is receiving 
unacceptable interference from a NVNG licensee, the Commission will 
require such NVNG licensee to terminate its interfering operations 
immediately unless it demonstrates to the Commission's reasonable 
satisfaction, and that of NTIA, that it is not responsible for causing 
harmful interference into the worldwide NOAA system. A NVNG licensee 
assumes the risk of any liability or damage that it and its directors, 
officers, employees, affiliates, agents and subcontractors may incur or 
suffer in connection with an interruption of its non-voice, non-
geostationary mobile-satellite service, in whole or in part, arising 
from or relating to its compliance or noncompliance with the 
requirements of this paragraph (b). The Commission will not hesitate to 
impose sanctions on a NVNG licensee time-sharing spectrum in the 137-138 
MHz band with NOAA, including monetary forfeitures and license 
revocations, when appropriate.
    (c) Each satellite in a NVNG licensee's system time-sharing spectrum 
with NOAA in the 137-138 MHz band shall automatically turn off and cease 
satellite transmissions if, after 72 consecutive hours, no reset signal 
is received from the NVNG licensee's gateway earth station and verified 
by the satellite. All satellites in such NVNG licensee's system shall be 
capable of instantaneous shutdown on any sub-band upon command from such 
NVNG licensee's gateway earth station.

Sec. 25.260  Time sharing between DoD meteorological satellite systems and 

non-voice, non-geostationary satellite systems in the 400.15-401 MHz band.

    (a) A non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service system 
licensee (``NVNG licensee'') time-sharing spectrum in the 400.15-401.0 
MHz band shall not transmit signals into the ``protection areas'' of 
Department of Defense (``DoD''). When calculating the protection areas 
for a DoD satellite in the 400.15-401 MHz band, a NVNG licensee shall 
use an earth station elevation angle of five degrees towards the DoD 
satellite and will shut off its transmissions prior to the NVNG 
licensee's service area, based on an elevation angle of zero degrees 
towards the NVNG licensee's satellite, overlapping the DoD protection 
area. A NVNG licensee is responsible for obtaining the necessary 
ephemeris data. This information shall be updated system-wide at least 
once per week. A NVNG licensee shall use an orbital propagator algorithm 
with an accuracy equal to or greater than the NORAD propagator used by 
DoD.
    (b) A NVNG licensee time sharing spectrum in the 400.15-401 MHz band 
shall establish a 24-hour per day contact person and telephone number so 
that claims of harmful interference into DoD earth station users and 
other operational issues can be reported and resolved expeditiously. 
This contact information shall be made available to DoD or its designee. 
If the National Telecommunications and Information Administration 
(``NTIA'') notifies the Commission that DoD is receiving unacceptable 
interference from a NVNG licensee, the Commission will require such NVNG 
licensee to terminate its interfering operations immediately unless it 
demonstrates to the Commission's reasonable satisfaction, and that of 
NTIA, that it is not responsible for causing harmful interference into 
the worldwide DoD system. A NVNG licensee assumes the risk of any 
liability or damage that it and its directors, officers, employees, 
affiliates, agents and subcontractors may incur or suffer in connection 
with an interruption of its non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-
satellite service, in whole or in part, arising from or relating to its 
compliance or noncompliance with the requirements of this paragraph (b). 
The Commission will not hesitate to impose sanctions on a NVNG licensee 
time-sharing spectrum in the 400.15-401 MHz band with DoD, including 
monetary forfeitures and license revocations, when appropriate.
    (c) Each satellite in a NVNG licensee's system time-sharing spectrum 
with DoD in the 400.15-401 MHz band shall automatically turn off and 
cease satellite transmissions if, after 72 consecutive hours, no reset 
signal is received from the NVNG licensee's gateway earth station and 
verified by the satellite. All satellites in such NVNG licensee's system 
shall be capable of instantaneous shutdown on any sub-band upon command 
from such NVNG licensee's gateway earth station.
    (d) Initially, a NVNG licensee time-sharing spectrum with DoD in the 
400.15-401 MHz band shall be able to change the frequency on which its 
system satellites are operating within 125 minutes of receiving 
notification from a DoD required frequency change in the 400.15-401 MHz 
band. Thereafter, when a NVNG licensee constructs additional gateway 
earth stations located outside of North and South America, it shall use 
its best efforts to decrease to 90 minutes the time required to 
implement a DoD required frequency change. A NVNG licensee promptly 
shall notify the Commission and NTIA of any decrease in the time it 
requires to implement a DoD required frequency change.
    (e) Once a NVNG licensee time-sharing spectrum with DoD in the 
400.15-401 MHz band demonstrates to DoD that it is capable of 
implementing a DoD required frequency change within the time required 
under paragraph (d) of this section, thereafter, such NVNG licensee 
shall demonstrate its capability to implement a DoD required frequency 
change only once per year at the instruction of DoD. Such demonstrations 
shall occur during off-peak hours, as determined by the NVNG licensee, 
unless otherwise agreed by the NVNG licensee and DoD. Such NVNG licensee 
will coordinate with DoD in establishing a plan for such a 
demonstration. In the event that a NVNG licensee fails to demonstrate to 
DoD

[[Page 285]]

that it is capable of implementing a DoD required frequency change in 
accordance with a demonstration plan established by DoD and the NVNG 
licensee, upon the Commission's receipt of a written notification from 
NTIA describing such failure, the Commission shall impose additional 
conditions or requirements on the NVNG licensee's authorization as may 
be necessary to protect DoD operations in the 400.15-401 MHz downlink 
band until the Commission is notified by NTIA that the NVNG licensee has 
successfully demonstrated its ability to implement a DoD required 
frequency change. Such additional conditions or requirements may 
include, but are not limited to, requiring such NVNG licensee 
immediately to terminate its operations interfering with the DoD system.

Sec. 25.261  Procedures for avoidance of in-line interference events for 

Non Geostationary Satellite Orbit (NGSO) Satellite Network Operations in the Fixed 
          Satellite Service (FSS) Bands.

    (a) Applicable NGSO FSS Bands. The coordination procedures in this 
section apply to non-Federal-Government NGSO FSS satellite networks 
operating in the following assigned frequency bands: The 28.6-29.1 GHz 
or 18.8-19.3 GHz frequency bands.
    (b) Definition of ``In-line interference events.'' For purposes of 
this section, an ``in-line interference event'' is defined as the 
interference associated with an occurrence of any physical alignment of 
space stations of two or more satellite networks with an operating Earth 
station of one of these networks in such a way that the angular 
separation between operational links of the two networks is less than 
10[deg] as measured at the Earth station.
    (c) Default procedure. If no agreed coordination exists between two 
or more satellite networks, then the bands will be divided among the 
affected satellite networks involved in an in-line interference event in 
accordance with the following procedure:
    (1) Each of n (number of) satellite networks involved in a 
particular in-line interference event shall select 1/n of the assigned 
spectrum available in each frequency band for its home base spectrum. 
The selection order for each satellite network shall be determined by 
and be in accordance with the date that the first space station in each 
satellite network is launched and operating;
    (2) The affected space station(s) of the respective satellite 
networks shall only operate in the selected (1/n) spectrum associated 
with its satellite network, its home base spectrum, for the duration of 
the in-line interference event;
    (3) All affected space station(s) may resume operations throughout 
the assigned frequency bands once the angular separation between the 
affected space stations in the in-line interference event is again 
greater than 10[deg].
    (d) Coordination procedure. Any coordination procedure agreed among 
the affected operating satellite networks, which allows operations of 
the satellite networks when each network's respective space stations are 
within the 10 degree avoidance angle associated with an in-line 
interference event, shall supersede the default procedure of paragraph 
(c) of this section. Coordination may be effected using information 
relating to the space stations and the parameters of one or more typical 
earth stations. All parties are required to coordinate in good faith.

    (a) Except as described in paragraphs (b), (c) or (e) of this 
section, applicants seeking to operate a space station in the 17/24 GHz 
BSS must locate that space station at one of the orbital positions 
described in Appendix F of the Report and Order adopted May 2, 2007, IB 
Docket No. 06-123, FCC 07-76.
    (b) An applicant may be authorized to operate a 17/24 GHz BSS space 
station at an orbital location described in appendix F as set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section, or at a location with a geocentric 
angular separation of one degree or less from an appendix F location, 
and may operate at the maximum power flux density limits defined in 
Sec. Sec. 25.208(c) and (w) of this part, without

[[Page 286]]

coordinating its power flux density levels with adjacent licensed or 
permitted operators, only if there is no licensed 17/24 GHz BSS space 
station or prior-filed application at a location less than four degrees 
from the offset orbital location at which the applicant proposes to 
operate.
    (c)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, licensees and 
permittees will be allowed to apply for a license or authorization for a 
replacement satellite that will be operated at the same power level and 
interference protection as the satellite to be replaced.
    (2) In addition, applicants for licenses or authority for a 
satellite to be operated at an orbit location that was made available 
after a previous 17/24 GHz BSS license was cancelled or surrendered will 
be permitted to apply for authority to operate a satellite at the same 
power level and interference protection as the previous licensee at that 
orbit location, to the extent that their proposed operations are 
consistent with the provisions of this part. Such applications will be 
considered pursuant to the first-come, first-served procedures set forth 
in Sec. 25.158 of this part.
    (d) Any U.S. licensee or permittee using a 17/24 GHz BSS space 
station that is located less than four degrees away from a prior-
authorized 17/24 GHz BSS space station that is authorized to operate in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section:
    (1) may not cause any more interference to the adjacent satellite 
network than would be caused if the adjacent 17/24 GHz BSS space station 
were located four degrees away from the proposed space station; and
    (2) must accept any increased interference that results from the

Sec. 25.263  Information sharing requirements for SDARS terrestrial repeater operators.

    This section requires SDARS licensees in the 2320-2345 MHz band to 
share information regarding the location and operation of terrestrial 
repeaters with WCS licensees in the 2305-2320 MHz and 2345-2360 MHz 
bands. Section 27.72 of this chapter requires WCS licensees to share 
information regarding the location and operation of base stations in the 
2305-2320 MHz and 2345-2360 MHz bands with SDARS licensees in the 2320-
2345 MHz band.
    (a) SDARS licensees must select terrestrial repeater sites and 
frequencies,

[[Page 287]]

to the extent practicable, to minimize the possibility of harmful 
interference to WCS base station operations in the 2305-2320 MHz and 
2345-2360 MHz bands.
    (b) Notice requirements. SDARS licensees that intend to operate a 
new terrestrial repeater must, before commencing such operation, provide 
10 business days prior notice to all potentially affected WCS licensees. 
SDARS licensees that intend to modify an existing repeater must, before 
commencing such modified operation, provide 5 business days prior notice 
to all potentially affected WCS licensees.
    (1) For purposes of this section, a ``potentially affected WCS 
licensee'' is a WCS licensee that:
    (i) Is authorized to operate a base station in the 2305-2315 MHz or 
2350-2360 MHz bands in the same Major Economic Area (MEA) as that in 
which the terrestrial repeater is to be located;
    (ii) Is authorized to operate a base station in the 2315-2320 MHz or 
2345-2350 MHz bands in the same Regional Economic Area Grouping (REAG) 
as that in which the terrestrial repeater is to be located.
    (iii) In addition to the WCS licensees identified in paragraphs 
(b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, in cases in which the SDARS licensee 
plans to deploy or modify a terrestrial repeater within 5 kilometers of 
the boundary of an MEA or REAG in which the terrestrial repeater is to 
be located, a potentially affected WCS licensee is one that is 
authorized to operate a WCS base station in that neighboring MEA or REAG 
within 5 kilometers of the location of the terrestrial repeater.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, a business day is defined by 
Sec. 1.4(e)(2) of this chapter.
    (c) Contents of notice. (1) Notification must be written (e.g., 
certified letter, fax, or e-mail) and include the licensee's name, and 
the name, address, and telephone number of its coordination 
representative, unless the SDARS licensee and all potentially affected 
WCS licensees reach a mutual agreement to provide notification by some 
other means. WCS licensees and SDARS licensees may establish such a 
mutually agreeable alternative notification mechanism without prior 
Commission approval, provided that they comply with all other 
requirements of this section.
    (2) Regardless of the notification method, notification must specify 
relevant technical details, including, at a minimum:
    (i) The coordinates of the proposed repeater to an accuracy of no 
less than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq> 1 second latitude and longitude;
    (ii) The proposed operating power(s), frequency band(s), and 
emission(s);
    (iii) The antenna center height above ground and ground elevation 
above mean sea level, both to an accuracy of no less than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>1 meter;
    (iv) The antenna gain pattern(s) in the azimuth and elevation planes 
that include the peak of the main beam; and
    (v) The antenna downtilt angle(s).
    (3) An SDARS licensee operating terrestrial repeaters must maintain 
an accurate and up-to-date inventory of its terrestrial repeaters 
operating above 2 watts average EIRP, including the information set 
forth in Sec. 25.263(c)(2), which shall be available upon request by 
the Commission.
    (d) Calculation of Notice Period. Notice periods are calculated from 
the date of receipt by the licensee being notified. If notification is 
by mail, the date of receipt is evidenced by the return receipt on 
certified mail. If notification is by fax, the date of receipt is 
evidenced by the notifying party's fax transmission confirmation log. If 
notification is by e-mail, the date of receipt is evidenced by a return 
e-mail receipt. If the SDARS licensee and all potentially affected WCS 
licensees reach a mutual agreement to provide notification by some other 
means, that agreement must specify the method for determining the 
beginning of the notice period.
    (e) Duty to cooperate. SDARS licensees must cooperate in good faith 
in the selection and use of new repeater sites to reduce interference 
and make the most effective use of the authorized facilities. Licensees 
of stations suffering or causing harmful interference must cooperate in 
good faith and resolve such problems by mutually satisfactory 
arrangements. If the licensees are unable to do so, the International 
Bureau, in consultation with the Office of Engineering and Technology 
and the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau,

[[Page 288]]

may impose restrictions on SDARS licensees, including specifying the 
transmitter power, antenna height, or area or hours of operation of the 
stations.

Sec. 25.272  General inter-system coordination procedures.

    (a) Each space station licensee in the Fixed-Satellite Service shall 
establish a satellite network control center which will have the 
responsibility to monitor space-to-Earth transmissions in its system. 
This would indirectly monitor uplink earth station transmissions in its 
system and to coordinate transmissions in its satellite system with 
those of other systems to prevent harmful interference incidents or, in 
the event of a harmful interference incident, to identify the source of 
the interference and correct the problem promptly.
    (b) Each space station licensee shall maintain on file with the 
Commission and with its Columbia Operations Center in Columbia, 
Maryland, a current listing of the names, titles, addresses and 
telephone numbers of the points of contact for resolution of 
interference

[[Page 289]]

problems. Contact personnel should include those responsible for 
resolution of short term, immediate interference problems at the system 
control center, and those responsible for long term engineering and 
technical design issues.
    (c) The transmitting earth station licensee shall provide the 
operator(s) of the satellites, on which the licensee is authorized to 
transmit, contact telephone numbers for the control center of the earth 
station and emergency telephone numbers for key personnel; a current 
file of these contacts shall be maintained at each satellite system 
control center.
    (d) An earth station licensee shall ensure that each of its 
authorized earth stations complies with the following:
    (1) The earth station licensee shall ensure that there is 
continuously available means of communications between the satellite 
network control center and the earth station operator or its remote 
control point as designated by the licensee.
    (2) The earth station operator shall notify the satellite network 
control center and receive permission from the control center before 
transmitting to the satellite or changing the basic characteristics of a 
transmission.
    (3) The earth station operator shall keep the space station licensee 
informed of all actual and planned usage.
    (4) Upon approval of the satellite network control center, the earth 
station operator may radiate an RF carrier into the designated 
transponder. Should improper illumination of the transponder or undue 
adjacent transponder interference be observed by the satellite network 
control center, the earth station operator shall immediately take 
whatever measures are needed to eliminate the problem.
    (5) The space station licensee may delegate the responsibility and 
duties of the satellite network control center to a technically 
qualified user or group of users, but the space station licensee shall 
remain ultimately responsible for the performance of those duties.

<R05>
Sec. 25.273  Duties regarding space communications transmissions.

    (a) No person shall:
    (1) Transmit to a satellite unless the specific transmission is 
first authorized by the satellite network control center;
    (2) Conduct transmissions over a transponder unless the operator is 
authorized by the satellite licensee or the satellite licensee's 
successor in interest to transmit at that time; or
    (3) Transmit in any manner that causes unacceptable interference to 
the authorized transmission of another licensee.
    (b) Satellite operators shall provide upon request by the Commission 
and by earth station licensees authorized to transmit on their 
satellites relevant information needed to avoid unacceptable 
interference to other users, including the polarization angles for 
proper illumination of a given transponder.
    (c) Space station licensees are responsible for maintaining complete 
and accurate technical details of current and planned transmissions over 
their satellites, and shall require that authorized users of 
transponders on their satellites, whether by tariff or contract, provide 
any necessary technical information in this regard including that 
required by Sec. 25.272. Based on this information, space station 
licensees shall exchange among themselves general technical information 
concerning current and planned transmission parameters as needed to 
identify and promptly resolve any potential cases of unacceptable 
interference between their satellite systems.
    (d) Space stations authorized after May 10, 1993 which do not 
satisfy the requirements of Sec. 25.210 may be required to accept 
greater constraints in resolving interference problems than complying 
ones. The extent of these constraints shall be determined on a case-by-
case basis.


<R05>
Sec. 25.274  Procedures to be followed in the event of harmful interference.

    (a) The earth station operator whose transmission is suffering 
harmful interference shall first check the earth station equipment to 
ensure that the equipment is functioning properly.
    (b) The earth station operator shall then check all other earth 
stations in the licensee's network that could be

[[Page 290]]

causing the harmful interference to ensure that none of the licensee's 
earth stations are the source of the interference and to verify that the 
source of interference is not from a local terrestrial source.
    (c) After the earth station operator has determined that the source 
of the interference is not another earth station operating in the same 
network or from a terrestrial source, the earth station operator shall 
contact the satellite system control center and advise the satellite 
operator of the problem. The control center operator shall observe the 
interference incident and make reasonable efforts to determine the 
source of the problem. A record shall be maintained by the control 
center operator and the earth station operator of all harmful 
interference incidents and their resolution. These records shall be made 
available to an FCC representative on request.
    (d) Where the suspected source of the interference incident is the 
operation of an earth station licensed to operate on one or more of the 
satellites in the satellite operator's system, the control center 
operator shall advise the offending earth station of the harmful 
interference incident and assist in the resolution of the problem where 
reasonably possible.
    (e) The earth station licensee whose operations are suspected of 
causing harmful interference to the operations of another earth station 
shall take reasonable measures to determine whether its operations are 
the source of the harmful interference problem. Where the operations of 
the suspect earth station are the source of the interference, the 
licensee of that earth station shall take all measures necessary to 
resolve the interference.
    (f) Where the earth station suspected of causing harmful 
interference to the operations of another earth station cannot be 
identified or is identified as an earth station operating on a satellite 
system other than the one on which the earth station suffering harmful 
interference is operating, it is the responsibility of a representative 
of the earth station suffering harmful interference to contact the 
control center of other satellite systems. The operator of the earth 
station suffering harmful interference is free to choose any 
representative to make this contact, including but not limited to the 
operator of the satellite system on which the earth station is 
operating. The operator of the earth station suffering harmful 
interference is also free to contact the control center of the other 
satellite systems directly.
    (g) At any point, the system control center operator may contact the 
Commission's Columbia Operations Center in Columbia, Maryland, to assist 
in resolving the matter. This office specializes in the resolution of 
satellite interference problems. All licensees are required to cooperate 
fully with the Commission in any investigation of interference problems.

authorization, the licensee is authorized to transmit any number of r.f. 
carriers on any discrete frequencies within an authorized frequency band 
in accordance with the other terms and conditions of the authorization 
and the requirements of this part. Specific r.f. carrier frequencies 
within the authorized frequency band shall be selected by the licensee 
to avoid unacceptable levels of interference being caused to other 
earth, space or terrestrial stations. Any coordination agreements, both 
domestic and international, concerning specific frequency usage 
constraints, including non-use of any particular frequencies within the 
frequency bands listed in the station authorization, are considered to 
be conditions of the station authorization.
    (c) A license for a transmitting earth station will normally specify 
only the r.f. carriers having the highest e.i.r.p. density, the 
narrowest bandwidth, and the largest bandwidth authorized for 
transmission from that station. Unless otherwise specified in the 
station authorization, the licensee is authorized

[[Page 291]]

to transmit any other type of carrier not specifically listed which does 
not exceed the highest e.i.r.p., e.i.r.p. density and bandwidth 
prescribed for any listed emission.
    (d) Only the most sensitive emission(s) for which protection is 
being afforded from interference in the authorized receive frequency 
band(s) will be specified in the station authorization.


<R05>

frequency bands allocated for use by the inter-satellite service that 
are also authorized for use by agencies of the federal government, the 
federal use of frequencies in the inter-satellite service frequency 
bands is under the regulatory jurisdiction of the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).
    (ii) The Commission will use its existing procedures to reach 
agreement with NTIA to achieve compatible operations between federal 
government users under the jurisdiction of NTIA and inter-satellite 
service systems through frequency assignment and coordination practice 
established by NTIA and the Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee 
(IRAC). In order to facilitate such frequency assignment and 
coordination, applicants shall provide the Commission with sufficient 
information to evaluate electromagnetic compatibility with the federal 
government users of the spectrum, and any additional information 
requested by the Commission. As part of the coordination process, 
applicants shall show that they will not cause interference to 
authorized federal government users, based upon existing system 
information provided by the government. The frequency assignment and 
coordination of the satellite system shall be completed prior to grant 
of construction authorization.
    (2) Coordination among inter-satellite service systems. Applicants 
for authority to establish inter-satellite service are encouraged to 
coordinate their proposed frequency usage with existing permittees and 
licensees in the inter-satellite service whose facilities could be 
affected by the new proposal in terms of frequency interference or 
restricted system capacity. All affected applicants, permittees, and 
licensees, shall at the direction of the Commission, cooperate fully and 
make every reasonable effort to resolve technical problems and conflicts 
that may inhibit effective and efficient use of the radio spectrum; 
however, the permittee or licensee being coordinated with is not 
obligated to suggest changes or re-engineer an applicant's proposal in 
cases involving conflicts.

    (ii) A telephone number providing immediate access to personnel 
capable of resolving ongoing interference or coordination problems with 
the station;
    (iii) A unique ten digit serial number of random number code 
programmed into the ATIS device in a permanent manner such that it 
cannot be readily changed by the operator on duty;
    (iv) Additional information may be included within the ATIS data 
stream provided the total message length, including ATIS, does not 
exceed 30 seconds.

Sec. 25.283  End-of-life disposal.

    (a) Geostationary orbit space stations. Unless otherwise explicitly 
specified in an authorization, a space station authorized to operate in 
the geostationary satellite orbit under this part shall be relocated, at 
the end of its useful life, barring catastrophic failure of satellite 
components, to an orbit with a perigee with an altitude of no less than:

36,021 km + (1000[middot]C<INF>R[middot]</INF>A/m)

where C<INF>R</INF> is the solar pressure radiation coefficient of the 
spacecraft, and A/m is the Area to mass ratio, in square meters per 
kilogram, of the spacecraft.

    (b) A space station authorized to operate in the geostationary 
satellite orbit under this part may operate using its authorized 
tracking, telemetry and control frequencies, and outside of its assigned 
orbital location, for the purpose of removing the satellite from the 
geostationary satellite orbit at the end of its useful life, provided 
that the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section are met, and on the 
condition that the space station's tracking, telemetry and control 
transmissions are planned so as to avoid electrical interference to 
other space stations, and coordinated with any potentially affected 
satellite networks.
    (c) All space stations. Upon completion of any relocation authorized 
by paragraph (b) of this section, or any relocation at end-of-life 
specified in an authorization, or upon a spacecraft otherwise completing 
its authorized mission, a space station licensee shall ensure, unless 
prevented by technical failures beyond its control, that all stored 
energy sources on board the satellite are discharged, by venting excess 
propellant, discharging batteries, relieving pressure vessels, and other 
appropriate measures.
    (d) The minimum perigee requirement of paragraph (a) of this section 
shall not apply to space stations launched prior to March 18, 2002.

<R04>
                  Subpart J_Public Interest Obligations


<R05>
Sec. 25.701  Public interest obligations.

    (a) DBS providers are subject to the public interest obligations set 
forth in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this section. As used 
in this section, DBS providers are any of the following:
    (1) Entities licensed to operate satellites in the 12.2 to 12.7 GHz 
DBS frequency bands; or
    (2) Entities licensed to operate satellites in the Ku band fixed 
satellite service and that sell or lease capacity to a video programming 
distributor that offers service directly to consumers providing a 
sufficient number of channels so that four percent of the total 
applicable programming channels

[[Page 296]]

yields a set aside of at least one channel of non commercial programming 
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, or
    (3) Non U.S. licensed satellite operators in the Ku band that offer 
video programming directly to consumers in the United States pursuant to 
an earth station license issued under part 25 of this title and that 
offer a sufficient number of channels to consumers so that four percent 
of the total applicable programming channels yields a set aside of one 
channel of noncommercial programming pursuant to paragraph (e) of this 
section, or
    (4) Entities licensed to operate satellites in the 17/24 GHz BSS 
that offer video programming directly to consumers or that sell or lease 
capacity to a video programming distributor that offers service directly 
to consumers providing a sufficient number of channels so that four 
percent of the total applicable programming channels yields a set aside 
of at least one channel of noncommercial programming pursuant to 
paragraph (e) of this section, or
    (5) Non U.S. licensed satellite operators in the 17/24 GHz BSS that 
offer video programming directly to consumers in the United States or 
that sell or lease capacity to a video programming distributor that 
offers service directly to consumers in the United States pursuant to an 
earth station license issued under part 25 of this title and that offer 
a sufficient number of channels to consumers so that four percent of the 
total applicable programming channels yields a set aside of one channel 
of noncommercial programming pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.
    (b) Political broadcasting requirements--
    (1) Legally qualified candidates for public office for purposes of 
this section are as defined in Sec. 73.1940 of this chapter.
    (2) DBS origination programming is defined as programming (exclusive 
of broadcast signals) carried on a DBS facility over one or more 
channels and subject to the exclusive control of the DBS provider.
    (3) Reasonable access. (i) DBS providers must comply with section 
312(a)(7) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, by allowing 
reasonable access to, or permitting purchase of reasonable amounts of 
time for, the use of their facilities by a legally qualified candidate 
for federal elective office on behalf of his or her candidacy.
    (ii) Weekend access. For purposes of providing reasonable access, 
DBS providers shall make facilities available for use by federal 
candidates on the weekend before the election if the DBS provider has 
provided similar access to commercial advertisers during the year 
preceding the relevant election period. DBS providers shall not 
discriminate between candidates with regard to weekend access.
    (4) Use of facilities; equal opportunities. DBS providers must 
comply with section 315 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 
by providing equal opportunities to legally qualified candidates for DBS 
origination programming.
    (i) General requirements. Except as otherwise indicated in Sec. 
25.701(b)(3), no DBS provider is required to permit the use of its 
facilities by any legally qualified candidate for public office, but if 
a DBS provider shall permit any such candidate to use its facilities, it 
shall afford equal opportunities to all other candidates for that office 
to use such facilities. Such DBS provider shall have no power of 
censorship over the material broadcast by any such candidate. Appearance 
by a legally qualified candidate on any:
    (A) Bona fide newscast;
    (B) Bona fide news interview;
    (C) Bona fide news documentary (if the appearance of the candidate 
is incidental to the presentation of the subject or subjects covered by 
the news documentary); or
    (D) On the spot coverage of bona fide news events (including, but 
not limited to political conventions and activities incidental thereto) 
shall not be deemed to be use of a DBS provider's facility. (Section 
315(a) of the Communications Act.)
    (ii) Uses. As used in this section and Sec. 25.701(c), the term 
``use'' means a candidate appearance (including by voice or picture) 
that is not exempt under paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (b)(3)(i)(D) of 
this section.

[[Page 297]]

    (iii) Timing of request. A request for equal opportunities must be 
submitted to the DBS provider within 1 week of the day on which the 
first prior use giving rise to the right of equal opportunities 
occurred: Provided, however, That where the person was not a candidate 
at the time of such first prior use, he or she shall submit his or her 
request within 1 week of the first subsequent use after he or she has 
become a legally qualified candidate for the office in question.
    (iv) Burden of proof. A candidate requesting equal opportunities of 
the DBS provider or complaining of noncompliance to the Commission shall 
have the burden of proving that he or she and his or her opponent are 
legally qualified candidates for the same public office.
    (v) Discrimination between candidates. In making time available to 
candidates for public office, no DBS provider shall make any 
discrimination between candidates in practices, regulations, facilities, 
or services for or in connection with the service rendered pursuant to 
this part, or make or give any preference to any candidate for public 
office or subject any such candidate to any prejudice or disadvantage; 
nor shall any DBS provider make any contract or other agreement that 
shall have the effect of permitting any legally qualified candidate for 
any public office to use DBS origination programming to the exclusion of 
other legally qualified candidates for the same public office.
    (c) Candidate rates--(1) Charges for use of DBS facilities. The 
charges, if any, made for the use of any DBS facility by any person who 
is a legally qualified candidate for any public office in connection 
with his or her campaign for nomination for election, or election, to 
such office shall not exceed:
    (i) During the 45 days preceding the date of a primary or primary 
runoff election and during the 60 days preceding the date of a general 
or special election in which such person is a candidate, the lowest unit 
charge of the DBS provider for the same class and amount of time for the 
same period.
    (A) A candidate shall be charged no more per unit than the DBS 
provider charges its most favored commercial advertisers for the same 
classes and amounts of time for the same periods. Any facility practices 
offered to commercial advertisers that enhance the value of advertising 
spots must be disclosed and made available to candidates upon equal 
terms. Such practices include but are not limited to any discount 
privileges that affect the value of advertising, such as bonus spots, 
time sensitive make goods, preemption priorities, or any other factors 
that enhance the value of the announcement.
    (B) The Commission recognizes non preemptible, preemptible with 
notice, immediately preemptible and run of schedule as distinct classes 
of time.
    (C) DBS providers may establish and define their own reasonable 
classes of immediately preemptible time so long as the differences 
between such classes are based on one or more demonstrable benefits 
associated with each class and are not based solely upon price or 
identity of the advertiser. Such demonstrable benefits include, but are 
not limited to, varying levels of preemption protection, scheduling 
flexibility, or associated privileges, such as guaranteed time sensitive 
make goods. DBS providers may not use class distinctions to defeat the 
purpose of the lowest unit charge requirement. All classes must be fully 
disclosed and made available to candidates.
    (D) DBS providers may establish reasonable classes of preemptible 
with notice time so long as they clearly define all such classes, fully 
disclose them and make them available to candidates.
    (E) DBS providers may treat non preemptible and fixed position as 
distinct classes of time provided that they articulate clearly the 
differences between such classes, fully disclose them, and make them 
available to candidates.
    (F) DBS providers shall not establish a separate, premium priced 
class of time sold only to candidates. DBS providers may sell higher 
priced non preemptible or fixed time to candidates if such a class of 
time is made available on a bona fide basis to both candidates and 
commercial advertisers, and provided such class is not functionally 
equivalent to any lower priced

[[Page 298]]

class of time sold to commercial advertisers.
    (G) [Reserved]
    (H) Lowest unit charge may be calculated on a weekly basis with 
respect to time that is sold on a weekly basis, such as rotations 
through particular programs or dayparts. DBS providers electing to 
calculate the lowest unit charge by such a method must include in that 
calculation all rates for all announcements scheduled in the rotation, 
including announcements aired under long term advertising contracts. DBS 
providers may implement rate increases during election periods only to 
the extent that such increases constitute ``ordinary business 
practices,'' such as seasonal program changes or changes in audience 
ratings.
    (I) DBS providers shall review their advertising records 
periodically throughout the election period to determine whether 
compliance with this section requires that candidates receive rebates or 
credits. Where necessary, DBS providers shall issue such rebates or 
credits promptly.
    (J) Unit rates charged as part of any package, whether individually 
negotiated or generally available to all advertisers, must be included 
in the lowest unit charge calculation for the same class and length of 
time in the same time period. A candidate cannot be required to purchase 
advertising in every program or daypart in a package as a condition for 
obtaining package unit rates.
    (K) DBS providers are not required to include non cash promotional 
merchandising incentives in lowest unit charge calculations; provided, 
however, that all such incentives must be offered to candidates as part 
of any purchases permitted by the system. Bonus spots, however, must be 
included in the calculation of the lowest unit charge calculation.
    (L) Make goods, defined as the rescheduling of preempted 
advertising, shall be provided to candidates prior to election day if a 
DBS provider has provided a time sensitive make good during the year 
preceding the pre election periods, respectively set forth in paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section, to any commercial advertiser who purchased 
time in the same class.
    (M) DBS providers must disclose and make available to candidates any 
make good policies provided to commercial advertisers. If a DBS provider 
places a make good for any commercial advertiser or other candidate in a 
more valuable program or daypart, the value of such make good must be 
included in the calculation of the lowest unit charge for that program 
or daypart.
    (ii) At any time other than the respective periods set forth in 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, DBS providers may charge legally 
qualified candidates for public office no more than the charges made for 
comparable use of the facility by commercial advertisers. The rates, if 
any, charged all such candidates for the same office shall be uniform 
and shall not be rebated by any means, direct or indirect. A candidate 
shall be charged no more than the rate the DBS provider would charge for 
comparable commercial advertising. All discount privileges otherwise 
offered by a DBS provider to commercial advertisers must be disclosed 
and made available upon equal terms to all candidates for public office.
    (2) If a DBS provider permits a candidate to use its facilities, it 
shall make all discount privileges offered to commercial advertisers, 
including the lowest unit charges for each class and length of time in 
the same time period and all corresponding discount privileges, 
available on equal terms to all candidates. This duty includes an 
affirmative duty to disclose to candidates information about rates, 
terms, conditions and all value enhancing discount privileges offered to 
commercial advertisers, as provided herein. DBS providers may use 
reasonable discretion in making the disclosure; provided, however, that 
the disclosure includes, at a minimum, the following information:
    (i) A description and definition of each class of time available to 
commercial advertisers sufficiently complete enough to allow candidates 
to identify and understand what specific attributes differentiate each 
class;
    (ii) A description of the lowest unit charge and related privileges 
(such as priorities against preemption and make goods prior to specific 
deadlines)

[[Page 299]]

for each class of time offered to commercial advertisers;
    (iii) A description of the DBS provider's method of selling 
preemptible time based upon advertiser demand, commonly known as the 
``current selling level,'' with the stipulation that candidates will be 
able to purchase at these demand generated rates in the same manner as 
commercial advertisers;
    (iv) An approximation of the likelihood of preemption for each kind 
of preemptible time; and
    (v) An explanation of the DBS provider's sales practices, if any, 
that are based on audience delivery, with the stipulation that 
candidates will be able to purchase this kind of time, if available to 
commercial advertisers.
    (3) Once disclosure is made, DBS providers shall negotiate in good 
faith to actually sell time to candidates in accordance with the 
disclosure.
    (d) Political file. Each DBS provider shall keep and permit public 
inspection of a complete and orderly political file and shall 
prominently disclose the physical location of the file, and the 
telephonic and electronic means to access the file.
    (1) The political file shall contain, at a minimum:
    (i) A record of all requests for DBS origination time, the 
disposition of those requests, and the charges made, if any, if the 
request is granted. The ``disposition'' includes the schedule of time 
purchased, when spots actually aired, the rates charged, and the classes 
of time purchased; and
    (ii) A record of the free time provided if free time is provided for 
use by or on behalf of candidates.
    (2) DBS providers shall place all records required by this section 
in a file available to the public as soon as possible and shall be 
retained for a period of four years until December 31, 2006, and 
thereafter for a period of two years.
    (3) DBS providers shall make available, by fax, e-mail, or by mail 
upon telephone request, photocopies of documents in their political 
files and shall assist callers by answering questions about the contents 
of their political files. Provided, however, that if a requester prefers 
access by mail, the DBS provider shall pay for postage but may require 
individuals requesting documents to pay for photocopying. To the extent 
that a DBS provider places its political file on its Web site, it may 
refer the public to the Web site in lieu of mailing photocopies. Any 
material required by this section to be maintained in the political file 
must be made available to the public by either mailing or Web site 
access or both.
    (e) Commercial limits in children's programs. (1) No DBS provider 
shall air more than 10.5 minutes of commercial matter per hour during 
children's programming on weekends, or more that 12 minutes of 
commercial matter per hour on week days.
    (2) This rule shall not apply to programs aired on a broadcast 
television channel which the DBS provider passively carries, or to 
channels over which the DBS provider may not exercise editorial control, 
pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 335(b)(3).
    (3) DBS providers airing children's programming must maintain 
records sufficient to verify compliance with this rule and make such 
records available to the public. Such records must be maintained for a 
period sufficient to cover the limitations period specified in 47 U.S.C. 
503(b)(6)(B).

    Note 1 to paragraph (e): Commercial matter means airtime sold for 
purposes of selling a product or service.
    Note 2 to paragraph (e): For purposes of this section, children's 
programming refers to programs originally produced and broadcast 
primarily for an audience of children 12 years old and younger.

    (f) Carriage obligation for noncommercial programming--
    (1) Reservation requirement. DBS providers shall reserve four 
percent of their channel capacity exclusively for use by qualified 
programmers for noncommercial programming of an educational or 
informational nature. Channel capacity shall be determined annually by 
calculating, based on measurements taken on a quarterly basis, the 
average number of channels available for video programming on all 
satellites licensed to the provider during the previous year. DBS 
providers may use this reserved capacity for any purpose until such time 
as it is used for

[[Page 300]]

noncommercial educational or informational programming.
    (2) Qualified programmer. For purposes of these rules, a qualified 
programmer is:
    (i) A noncommercial educational broadcast station as defined in 
section 397(6) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended,
    (ii) A public telecommunications entity as defined in section 
397(12) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended,
    (iii) An accredited nonprofit educational institution or a 
governmental organization engaged in the formal education of enrolled 
students (A publicly supported educational institution must be 
accredited by the appropriate state department of education; a privately 
controlled educational institution must be accredited by the appropriate 
state department of education or the recognized regional and national 
accrediting organizations), or
    (iv) A nonprofit organization whose purposes are educational and 
include providing educational and instructional television material to 
such accredited institutions and governmental organizations.
    (v) Other noncommercial entities with an educational mission.
    (3) Editorial control. (i) A DBS operator will be required to make 
capacity available only to qualified programmers and may select among 
such programmers when demand exceeds the capacity of their reserved 
channels.
    (ii) A DBS operator may not require the programmers it selects to 
include particular programming on its channels.
    (iii) A DBS operator may not alter or censor the content of the 
programming provided by the qualified programmer using the channels 
reserved pursuant to this section.
    (4) Non-commercial channel limitation. A DBS operator cannot 
initially select a qualified programmer to fill more than one of its 
reserved channels except that, after all qualified entities that have 
sought access have been offered access on at least one channel, a 
provider may allocate additional channels to qualified programmers 
without having to make additional efforts to secure other qualified 
programmers.
    (5) Rates, terms and conditions. (i) In making the required reserved 
capacity available, DBS providers cannot charge rates that exceed costs 
that are directly related to making the capacity available to qualified 
programmers. Direct costs include only the cost of transmitting the 
signal to the uplink facility and uplinking the signal to the satellite.
    (ii) Rates for capacity reserved under paragraph (a) of this section 
shall not exceed 50 percent of the direct costs as defined in this 
section.
    (iii) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit DBS 
providers from negotiating rates with qualified programmers that are 
less than 50 percent of direct costs or from paying qualified 
programmers for the use of their programming.
    (iv) DBS providers shall reserve discrete channels and offer these 
to qualifying programmers at consistent times to fulfill the reservation 
requirement described in these rules.
    (6) Public file. (i) In addition to the political file requirements 
in Sec. 25.701(d), each DBS provider shall keep and permit public 
inspection of a complete and orderly record of:
    (A) Quarterly measurements of channel capacity and yearly average 
calculations on which it bases its four percent reservation, as well as 
its response to any capacity changes;
    (B) A record of entities to whom noncommercial capacity is being 
provided, the amount of capacity being provided to each entity, the 
conditions under which it is being provided and the rates, if any, being 
paid by the entity;
    (C) A record of entities that have requested capacity, disposition 
of those requests and reasons for the disposition.
    (ii) All records required by this paragraph shall be placed in a 
file available to the public as soon as possible and shall be retained 
for a period of two years.
    (7) Effective date. DBS providers are required to make channel 
capacity available pursuant to this section upon the effective date. 
Programming provided pursuant to this rule must be

[[Page 301]]

available to the public no later than six months after the effective 
date.

to the entire bandwidth of the medium during its interval. This implies 
that one transmitter uses one channel to send several bit streams of 
information.
    Unattended operation. Operation of a station by automatic means 
whereby the transmitter is turned on and off and performs its functions 
without attention by a designated person.
    Universal Licensing System. The Universal Licensing System (ULS) is 
the consolidated database, application filing system, and processing 
system for all Wireless Radio Services. ULS supports electronic filing 
of all applications and related documents by applicants and licensees in

    Note to paragraph (i)(2): No 125 kHz channels are provided for 
channels in operation in this service. The 125 kHz channels previously 
associated with these channels have been reallocated to Channel G3 in 
the upper band segment.

    (3) During the transition (see Sec. Sec. 27.1230-27.1239) EBS and 
BRS licensees may exchange channels to effectuate the transition of the 
2.5 GHz band in a given BTA.
    (4) A temporary fixed broadband station may use any available 
broadband channel on a secondary basis, except that operation of 
temporary fixed broadband stations is not allowed within 56.3 km (35 
miles) of Canada.
    (5)(i) A point-to-point EBS station on the E and F-channel 
frequencies, may be involuntarily displaced by a BRS applicant or 
licensee, provided that suitable alternative spectrum is available and 
that the BRS entity bears the expenses of the migration. Suitability of 
spectrum will be determined on a case-by-base basis; at a minimum, the 
alternative spectrum must be licensable by broadband operators on a 
primary basis (although it need not be specifically allocated to the 
broadband service), and must provide a signal that is equivalent to the 
prior signal in picture quality and reliability, unless the broadband 
licensee will accept an inferior signal. Potential expansion of the BRS 
licensee may be considered in determining whether alternative available 
spectrum is suitable.
    (ii) If suitable alternative spectrum is located pursuant to 
paragraph (h)(6)(i) of this section, the initiating party must prepare 
and file the appropriate application for the new spectrum, and must 
simultaneously serve a copy of the application on the EBS licensee to be 
moved. The initiating party will be responsible for all costs connected 
with the migration, including purchasing, testing and installing

[[Page 310]]

new equipment, labor costs, reconfiguration of existing equipment, 
administrative costs, legal and engineering expenses necessary to 
prepare and file the migration application, and other reasonable 
documented costs. The initiating party must secure a bond or establish 
an escrow account to cover reasonable incremental increase in ongoing 
expenses that may fall upon the migrated licensee. The bond or escrow 
account should also account for the possibility that the initiating 
party subsequently becomes bankrupt. If it becomes necessary for the 
Commission to assess the sufficiency of a bond or escrow amount, it will 
take into account such factors as projected incremental increase in 
electricity or maintenance expenses, or relocation expenses, as relevant 
in each case.
    (iii) The EBS licensee to be moved will have a 60-day period in 
which to oppose the involuntary migration. The broadband party should 
state its opposition to the migration with specificity, including 
engineering and other challenges, and a comparison of the present site 
and the proposed new site. If involuntary migration is granted, the new 
facilities must be operational before the initiating party will be 
permitted to begin its new or modified operations. The migration must 
not disrupt the broadband licensee's provision of service, and the 
broadband licensee has the right to inspect the construction or 
installation work.

that initial authorizations for a Part 27 licensee that provides 
broadcast services, whether exclusively or in combination with other 
services, will not exceed eight years. Initial authorizations for the 
775-776 MHz and 805-806 MHz bands shall not exceed April 27, 2015. 
Licensees that initiate the provision of a broadcast service, whether 
exclusively or in combination with other services, may not provide this 
service for more than eight years or beyond the end of the license term 
if no broadcast service had been provided, whichever period is shorter 
in length.
    (c) 1390-1392 MHz band. Initial authorizations for the 1390-1392 MHz 
band will have a term not to exceed ten years from the date of initial 
issuance or renewal.
    (d) The paired 1392-1395 and 1432-1435 MHz bands. Initial WCS 
authorizations for the paired 1392-1395 MHz and 1432-1435 MHz bands will 
have a term not to exceed ten years from the date of initial issuance or 
renewal.
    (e) 1670-1675 MHz band. Initial authorizations for the 1670-1675 MHz 
band will have a term not to exceed ten years from the date of initial 
issuance or renewal.

<R05>
Sec. 27.14  Construction requirements; Criteria for renewal.

    (a) AWS and WCS licensees, with the exception of WCS licensees 
holding authorizations for Block A in the 698-704 MHz and 728-734 MHz 
bands, Block B in the 704-710 MHz and 734-740 MHz bands, Block E in the 
722-728 MHz band, Block C, C1, or C2 in the 746-757 MHz and 776-787 MHz 
bands, Block D in the 758-763 MHz and 788-793 MHz bands, Block A in the 
2305-2310 MHz and 2350-2355 MHz bands, Block B in the 2310-2315 MHz and 
2355-2360 MHz bands, Block C in the 2315-2320 MHz band, and Block D in 
the 2345-2350 MHz band, must, as a performance requirement, make a 
showing of ``substantial service'' in their license area within the 
prescribed license term set forth in Sec. 27.13. ``Substantial 
service'' is defined as service which is sound, favorable and 
substantially above a level of mediocre service which just might 
minimally warrant renewal. Failure by any licensee to meet this 
requirement will result in forfeiture of the license and the licensee 
will be ineligible to regain it.
    (b) A renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding 
shall receive a preference, commonly referred to as a renewal 
expectancy, which is the most important comparative factor to be 
considered in the proceeding, if its past record for the relevant 
license period demonstrates that:
    (1) The renewal applicant has provided ``substantial'' service 
during its past license term; and
    (2) The renewal applicant has substantially complied with applicable 
FCC rules, policies and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
    (c) In order to establish its right to a renewal expectancy, a WCS 
renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding must 
submit a showing explaining why it should receive a renewal expectancy. 
At a minimum, this showing must include:
    (1) A description of its current service in terms of geographic 
coverage and population served;
    (2) An explanation of its record of expansion, including a timetable 
of new construction to meet changes in demand for service;
    (3) A description of its investments in its WCS system; and
    (4) Copies of all FCC orders finding the licensee to have violated 
the Communications Act or any FCC rule or policy; and a list of any 
pending proceedings that relate to any matter described in this 
paragraph.
    (d) In making its showing of entitlement to a renewal expectancy, a 
renewal applicant may claim credit for any system modification 
applications that were pending on the date it filed its renewal 
application. Such credit will not be allowed if the modification 
application is dismissed or denied.
    (e) Comparative renewal proceedings do not apply to WCS licensees 
holding authorizations for Block A in the 698-704 MHz, 728-734 MHz 
bands, Block B in the 704-710 MHz and 734-740 MHz bands, Block C in the 
710-716 MHz and 740-746 MHz bands, Block D in the 716-722 MHz band, 
Block E in the 722-728 MHz band, Block C, C1, or C2 in the 746-757 MHz 
and 776-787 MHz bands, or Block D in the 758-763 MHz and 788-793 MHz 
bands. Each of these licensees must file a renewal application in 
accordance with the provisions set forth in Sec. 1.949, and must make a 
showing of substantial service, independent of its performance 
requirements, as a condition for renewal at the end of each license 
term.
    (f) Comparative renewal proceedings do not apply to WCS licensees 
holding authorizations for the 698-746 MHz, 747-762 MHz, and 777-792 MHz 
bands. These licensees must file a renewal application in accordance 
with the provisions set forth in Sec. 1.949 of this chapter.
    (g) WCS licensees holding EA authorizations for Block A in the 698-
704 MHz and 728-734 MHz bands, cellular market authorizations for Block 
B in the 704-710 MHz and 734-740 MHz bands, or EA authorizations for 
Block E in the 722-728 MHz band, if the results of the first

[[Page 317]]

auction in which licenses for such authorizations are offered satisfy 
the reserve price for the applicable block, shall provide signal 
coverage and offer service over at least 35 percent of the geographic 
area of each of their license authorizations no later than June 13, 2013 
(or within four years of initial license grant if the initial 
authorization in a market is granted after June 13, 2009), and shall 
provide such service over at least 70 percent of the geographic area of 
each of these authorizations by the end of the license term. In applying 
these geographic benchmarks, licensees are not required to include land 
owned or administered by government as a part of the relevant service 
area. Licensees may count covered government land for purposes of 
meeting their geographic construction benchmark, but are required to add 
the covered government land to the total geographic area used for 
measurement purposes. Licensees are required to include those populated 
lands held by tribal governments and those held by the Federal 
Government in trust or for the benefit of a recognized tribe.
    (1) If an EA or CMA licensee holding an authorization in these 
particular blocks fails to provide signal coverage and offer service 
over at least 35 percent of the geographic area of its license 
authorization by no later than June 13, 2013 (or within four years of 
initial license grant, if the initial authorization in a market is 
granted after June 13, 2009), the term of that license authorization 
will be reduced by two years and such licensee may be subject to 
enforcement action, including forfeitures. In addition, an EA or CMA 
licensee that provides signal coverage and offers service at a level 
that is below this interim benchmark may lose authority to operate in 
part of the remaining unserved areas of the license.
    (2) If any such EA or CMA licensee fails to provide signal coverage 
and offer service to at least 70 percent of the geographic area of its 
license authorization by the end of the license term, that licensee's 
authorization will terminate automatically without Commission action for 
those geographic portions of its license in which the licensee is not 
providing service, and those unserved areas will become available for 
reassignment by the Commission. Such licensee may also be subject to 
enforcement action, including forfeitures. In addition, an EA or CMA 
licensee that provides signal coverage and offers service at a level 
that is below this end-of-term benchmark may be subject to license 
termination. In the event that a licensee's authority to operate in a 
license area terminates automatically without Commission action, such 
areas will become available for reassignment pursuant to the procedures 
in paragraph (j) of this section.
    (3) For licenses under paragraph (g) of this section, the geographic 
service area to be made available for reassignment must include a 
contiguous area of at least 130 square kilometers (50 square miles), and 
areas smaller than a contiguous area of at least 130 square kilometers 
(50 square miles) will not be deemed unserved.
    (h) WCS licensees holding REAG authorizations for Block C in the 
746-757 MHz and 776-787 MHz bands or REAG authorizations for Block C2 in 
the 752-757 MHz and 782-787 MHz bands shall provide signal coverage and 
offer service over at least 40 percent of the population in each EA 
comprising the REAG license area no later than June 13, 2013 (or within 
four years of initial license grant, if the initial authorization in a 
market is granted after June 13, 2009), and shall provide such service 
over at least 75 percent of the population of each of these EAs by the 
end of the license term. For purposes of compliance with this 
requirement, licensees should determine population based on the most 
recently available U.S. Census Data.
    (1) If a licensee holding a Block C authorization fails to provide 
signal coverage and offer service over at least 40 percent of the 
population in each EA comprising the REAG license area by no later than 
June 13, 2013 (or within four years of initial license grant if the 
initial authorization in a market is granted after June 13, 2009), the 
term of the license authorization will be reduced by two years and such 
licensee may be subject to enforcement action, including forfeitures. In 
addition, a licensee that provides signal coverage and offers service at 
a level that is

[[Page 318]]

below this interim benchmark may lose authority to operate in part of 
the remaining unserved areas of the license.
    (2) If a licensee holding a Block C authorization fails to provide 
signal coverage and offer service over at least 75 percent of the 
population in any EA comprising the REAG license area by the end of the 
license term, for each such EA that licensee's authorization will 
terminate automatically without Commission action for those geographic 
portions of its license in which the licensee is not providing service. 
Such licensee may also be subject to enforcement action, including 
forfeitures. In the event that a licensee's authority to operate in a 
license area terminates automatically without Commission action, such 
areas will become available for reassignment pursuant to the procedures 
in paragraph (j) of this section. In addition, a REAG licensee that 
provides signal coverage and offers service at a level that is below 
this end-of-term benchmark within any EA may be subject to license 
termination within that EA.
    (3) For licenses under paragraph (h), the geographic service area to 
be made available for reassignment must include a contiguous area of at 
least 130 square kilometers (50 square miles), and areas smaller than a 
contiguous area of at least 130 square kilometers (50 square miles) will 
not be deemed unserved.
    (i) WCS licensees holding EA authorizations for Block A in the 698-
704 MHz and 728-734 MHz bands, cellular market authorizations for Block 
B in the 704-710 MHz and 734-740 MHz bands, or EA authorizations for 
Block E in the 722-728 MHz band, if the results of the first auction in 
which licenses for such authorizations in Blocks A, B, and E are offered 
do not satisfy the reserve price for the applicable block, as well as EA 
authorizations for Block C1 in the 746-752 MHz and 776-782 MHz bands, 
are subject to the following:
    (1) If a licensee holding a cellular market area or EA authorization 
subject to this paragraph (i) fails to provide signal coverage and offer 
service over at least 40 percent of the population in its license area 
by no later than June 13, 2013 (or within four years of initial license 
grant, if the initial authorization in a market is granted after June 
13, 2009), the term of that license authorization will be reduced by two 
years and such licensee may be subject to enforcement action, including 
forfeitures. In addition, such licensee that provides signal coverage 
and offers service at a level that is below this interim benchmark may 
lose authority to operate in part of the remaining unserved areas of the 
license. For purposes of compliance with this requirement, licensees 
should determine population based on the most recently available U.S. 
Census Data.
    (2) If a licensee holding a cellular market area or EA authorization 
subject to this paragraph (i) fails to provide signal coverage and offer 
service over at least 75 percent of the population in its license area 
by the end of the license term, that licensee's authorization will 
terminate automatically without Commission action for those geographic 
portions of its license in which the licensee is not providing service, 
and those unserved areas will become available for reassignment by the 
Commission. Such licensee may also be subject to enforcement action, 
including forfeitures. In the event that a licensee's authority to 
operate in a license area terminates automatically without Commission 
action, such areas will become available for reassignment pursuant to 
the procedures in paragraph (j) of this section. In addition, such a 
licensee that provides signal coverage and offers service at a level 
that is below this end-of-term benchmark may be subject to license 
termination. For purposes of compliance with this requirement, licensees 
should determine population based on the most recently available U.S. 
Census Data.
    (3) For licenses under paragraph (i), the geographic service area to 
be made available for reassignment must include a contiguous area of at 
least 130 square kilometers (50 square miles), and areas smaller than a 
contiguous area of at least 130 square kilometers (50 square miles) will 
not be deemed unserved.

[[Page 319]]

    (j) In the event that a licensee's authority to operate in a license 
area terminates automatically under paragraphs (g), (h), or (i) of this 
section, such areas will become available for reassignment pursuant to 
the following procedures:
    (1) The Wireless Telecommunications Bureau is delegated authority to 
announce by public notice that these license areas will be made 
available and establish a 30-day window during which third parties may 
file license applications to serve these areas. During this 30-day 
period, licensees that had their authority to operate terminate 
automatically for unserved areas may not file applications to provide 
service to these areas. Applications filed by third parties that propose 
areas overlapping with other applications will be deemed mutually 
exclusive, and will be resolved through an auction. The Wireless 
Telecommunications Bureau, by public notice, may specify a limited 
period before the filing of short-form applications (FCC Form 175) 
during which applicants may enter into a settlement to resolve their 
mutual exclusivity, subject to the provisions of Sec. 1.935 of this 
chapter.
    (2) Following this 30-day period, the original licensee and third 
parties can file license applications for remaining unserved areas where 
licenses have not been issued or for which there are no pending 
applications. If the original licensee or a third party files an 
application, that application will be placed on public notice for 30 
days. If no mutually exclusive application is filed, the application 
will be granted, provided that a grant is found to be in the public 
interest. If a mutually exclusive application is filed, it will be 
resolved through an auction. The Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, by 
public notice, may specify a limited period before the filing of short-
form applications (FCC Form 175) during which applicants may enter into 
a settlement to resolve their mutual exclusivity, subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 1.935 of this chapter.
    (3) The licensee will have one year from the date the new license is 
issued to complete its construction and provide signal coverage and 
offer service over 100 percent of the geographic area of the new license 
area. If the licensee fails to meet this construction requirement, its 
license will automatically terminate without Commission action and it 
will not be eligible to apply to provide service to this area at any 
future date.
    (k) WCS licensees holding authorizations in the spectrum blocks 
enumerated in paragraphs (g), (h), or (i), including any licensee that 
obtained its license pursuant to the procedures set forth in subsection 
(j), shall demonstrate compliance with performance requirements by 
filing a construction notification with the Commission, within 15 days 
of the expiration of the applicable benchmark, in accordance with the 
provisions set forth in Sec. 1.946(d). The licensee must certify 
whether it has met the applicable performance requirements. The licensee 
must file a description and certification of the areas for which it is 
providing service. The construction notifications must include 
electronic coverage maps, supporting technical documentation and any 
other information as the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau may 
prescribe by public notice.
    (l) WCS licensees holding authorizations in the spectrum blocks 
enumerated in paragraphs (g), (h), or (i) of this section, excluding any 
licensee that obtained its license pursuant to the procedures set forth 
in subsection (j) of this section, shall file reports with the 
Commission that provide the Commission, at a minimum, with information 
concerning the status of their efforts to meet the performance 
requirements applicable to their authorizations in such spectrum blocks 
and the manner in which that spectrum is being utilized. The information 
to be reported will include the date the license term commenced, a 
description of the steps the licensee has taken toward meeting its 
construction obligations in a timely manner, including the technology or 
technologies and service(s) being provided, and the areas within the 
license area in which those services are available. Each of these 
licensees shall file its first report with the Commission no later than 
June 13, 2011 and no sooner than 30 days prior to this date. Each 
licensee that meets its interim benchmarks shall file a second report 
with

[[Page 320]]

the Commission no later than June 13, 2016 and no sooner than 30 days 
prior to this date. Each licensee that does not meet its interim 
benchmark shall file this second report no later than on June 13, 2015 
and no sooner than 30 days prior to this date.
    (m) The WCS licensee holding the authorization for the D Block in 
the 758-763 MHz and 788-793 MHz bands (the Upper 700 MHz D Block 
licensee) shall comply with the following construction requirements.
    (1) The Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee shall provide a signal 
coverage and offer service over at least 75 percent of the population of 
the nationwide Upper 700 MHz D Block license area within four years from 
June 13, 2009, 95 percent of the population of the nationwide license 
area within seven years, and 99.3 percent of the population of the 
nationwide license area within ten years.
    (2) The Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee may modify, to a limited 
degree, its population-based construction benchmarks with the agreement 
of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and the prior approval of the 
Commission, where such a modification would better serve to meet 
commercial and public safety needs.
    (3) The Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee shall meet the population 
benchmarks based on a performance schedule specified in the Network 
Sharing Agreement, taking into account performance pursuant to Sec. 
27.1327 as appropriate under that rule, and using the most recently 
available U.S. Census Data. The network and signal levels employed to 
meet these benchmarks must be adequate for public safety use, as defined 
in the Network Sharing Agreement, and the services made available must 
include those appropriate for public safety entities that operate in 
those areas. The schedule shall include coverage for major highways and 
interstates, as well as such additional areas that are necessary to 
provide coverage for all incorporated communities with a population in 
excess of 3,000, unless the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and the 
Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee jointly determine, in consultation with a 
relevant community, that such additional coverage will not provide 
significant public benefit.
    (4) The Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee shall demonstrate compliance 
with performance requirements by filing a construction notification with 
the Commission within 15 days of the expiration of the applicable 
benchmark, in accordance with the provisions set forth in Sec. 1.946(d) 
of this chapter. The licensee must certify whether it has met the 
applicable performance requirement and must file a description and 
certification of the areas for which it is providing service. The 
construction notifications must include the following:
    (i) Certifications of the areas that were scheduled for construction 
and service by that date under the Network Sharing Agreement for which 
it is providing service, the type of service it is providing for each 
area, and the type of technology it is utilizing to provide this 
service.
    (ii) Electronic coverage maps and supporting technical documentation 
providing the assumptions used by the licensee to create the coverage 
maps, including the propagation model and the signal strength necessary 
to provide service.
    (n) At the end of its license term, the Upper 700 MHz D Block 
licensee must, in order to renew its license, make a showing of its 
success in meeting the material requirements set forth in the Network 
Sharing Agreement as well as all other license conditions, including the 
performance benchmark requirements set forth in this section.
    (o) BRS and EBS licensees originally issued a BRS or EBS license 
prior to November 6, 2009 must make a showing of substantial service no 
later than May 1, 2011. With respect to initial BRS licenses issued on 
or after November 6, 2009, the licensee must make a showing of 
substantial service within four years from the date of issue of the 
license. Incumbent BRS licensees that are required to demonstrate 
substantial service by May 1, 2011 must file their substantial service 
showings with their renewal applications. ``Substantial service'' is 
defined as service which is sound, favorable, and substantially above a 
level of mediocre service which just might minimally warrant renewal.

[[Page 321]]

Substantial service for BRS and EBS licensees is satisfied if a licensee 
meets the requirements of paragraph (o)(1), (o)(2), or (o)(3) of this 
section. If a licensee has not met the requirements of paragraph (o)(1), 
(o)(2), or (o)(3) of this section, then demonstration of substantial 
service shall proceed on a case-by-case basis. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (o)(4) and (o)(5) of this section, all substantial service 
determinations will be made on a license-by-license basis. Failure by 
any licensee to demonstrate substantial service will result in 
forfeiture of the license and the licensee will be ineligible to regain 
it.
    (1) A BRS or EBS licensee has provided ``substantial service'' by:
    (i) Constructing six permanent links per one million people for 
licensees providing fixed point-to-point services;
    (ii) Providing coverage of at least 30 percent of the population of 
the licensed area for licensees providing mobile services or fixed 
point-to-multipoint services;
    (iii) Providing service to ``rural areas'' (a county (or equivalent) 
with a population density of 100 persons per square mile or less, based 
upon the most recently available Census data) and areas with limited 
access to telecommunications services:
    (A) For mobile service, where coverage is provided to at least 75% 
of the geographic area of at least 30% of the rural areas within its 
service area; or
    (B) for fixed service, where the BRS or EBS licensee has constructed 
at least one end of a permanent link in at least 30% of the rural areas 
within its licensed area.
    (iv) Providing specialized or technologically sophisticated service 
that does not require a high level of coverage to benefit consumers; or
    (v) Providing service to niche markets or areas outside the areas 
served by other licensees.
    (2) An EBS licensee has provided ``substantial service'' when:
    (i) The EBS licensee is using its spectrum (or spectrum to which the 
EBS licensee's educational services are shifted) to provide educational 
services within the EBS licensee's GSA;
    (ii) the EBS licensee's license is actually being used to serve the 
educational mission of one or more accredited public or private schools, 
colleges or universities providing formal educational and cultural 
development to enrolled students; or
    (iii) the level of service provided by the EBS licensee meets or 
exceeds the minimum usage requirements specified in Sec. 27.1214.
    (3) An EBS or BRS licensee may be deemed to provide substantial 
service through a leasing arrangement if the lessee is providing 
substantial service under paragraph (o)(1) of this section. The EBS 
licensee must also be otherwise in compliance with this Chapter 
(including the programming requirements in Sec. 27.1203 of this 
subpart).
    (4) If the GSA of a licensee is less than 1924 square miles in size, 
and there is an overlapping co-channel station licensed or leased by the 
licensee or its affiliate, substantial service may be demonstrated by 
meeting the requirements of paragraph (o)(1) or (o)(2) of this section 
with respect to the combined GSAs of both stations.
    (5) If the GSA of a BTA authorization holder, is less than one-half 
of the area within the BTA for every BRS channel, substantial service 
may be demonstrated for the licenses in question by meeting the 
requirements of paragraph (o)(1) or (o)(2) of this section with respect 
to the combined GSAs of the BTA authorization holder, together with any 
incumbent authorizations licensed or leased by the licensee or its 
affiliates.
    (p) This section enumerates performance requirements for licensees 
holding authorizations for Block A in the 2305-2310 MHz and 2350-2355 
MHz bands, Block B in the 2310-2315 MHz and 2355-2360 MHz bands, Block C 
in the 2315-2320 MHz band, and Block D in the 2345-2350 MHz band.
    (1) For mobile or point-to-multipoint systems, a licensee must 
provide reliable signal coverage and offer service to at least 40 
percent of the license area's population by March 4, 2014, and to at 
least 75 percent of the license area's population by September 1, 2016. 
If, when filing the construction notification required under Sec. 
1.946(d) of this chapter, a WCS licensee demonstrates that 25 percent or 
more of the license area's population for Block A, B or D is

[[Page 322]]

within a coordination zone as defined by Sec. 27.73(a) of the rules, 
the foregoing population benchmarks are reduced to 25 and 50 percent, 
respectively. The percentage of a license area's population within a 
coordination zone equals the sum of the Census Block Centroid 
Populations within the area, divided by the license area's total 
population.
    (2) For point-to-point fixed systems, except those deployed in the 
Gulf of Mexico license area, a licensee must construct and operate a 
minimum of 15 point-to-point links per million persons (one link per 
67,000 persons) in a license area by March 4, 2014, and 30 point-to-
point links per million persons (one link per 33,500 persons) in a 
licensed area by September 1, 2016. The exact link requirement is 
calculated by dividing a license area's total population by 67,000 and 
33,500 for the respective milestones, and then rounding upwards to the 
next whole number. For a link to be counted towards these benchmarks, 
both of its endpoints must be located in the license area. If only one 
endpoint of a link is located in a license area, it can be counted as a 
one- half link towards the benchmarks.
    (3) For point-to-point fixed systems deployed on any spectrum block 
in the Gulf of Mexico license area, a licensee must construct and 
operate a minimum of 15 point-to-point links by March 4, 2014, and a 
minimum of 15 point-to-point links by September 1, 2016.
    (4) Under paragraph (p)(2) and (p)(3) of this section, each fixed 
link must provide a minimum bit rate, in bits per second, equal to or 
greater than the bandwidth specified by the emission designator in Hertz 
(e.g., equipment transmitting at a 5 Mb/s rate must not require a 
bandwidth of greater than 5 MHz).
    (5) If an initial authorization for a license area is granted after 
September 1, 2010, then the applicable benchmarks in paragraphs (p)(1), 
(p)(2) and (p)(3) of this section must be met within 42 and 72 months, 
respectively, of the initial authorization grant date.
    (6) Licensees must use the most recently available U.S. Census Data 
at the time of measurement to meet these performance requirements.
    (7) Licensees must certify compliance with the applicable 
performance requirements by filing a construction notification with the 
Commission, within 15 days of the expiration of the relevant performance 
milestone, pursuant to Sec. 1.946(d) of this chapter. Each construction 
notification must include electronic coverage maps, supporting technical 
documentation, and any other information as the Wireless 
Telecommunications Bureau may prescribe by public notice. Electronic 
coverage maps must accurately depict the boundaries of each license area 
(Regional Economic Area Grouping, REAG, or Major Economic Area, MEA) in 
the licensee's service territory. Further, REAG maps must depict MEA 
boundaries and MEA maps must depict Economic Area boundaries. If a 
licensee does not provide reliable signal coverage to an entire license 
area, its map must accurately depict the boundaries of the area or areas 
within each license area not being served. Each licensee also must file 
supporting documentation certifying the type of service it is providing 
for each REAG or MEA within its service territory and the type of 
technology used to provide such service. Supporting documentation must 
include the assumptions used to create the coverage maps, including the 
propagation model and the signal strength necessary to provide reliable 
service with the licensee's technology.
    (8) If a licensee fails to meet any applicable performance 
requirement, its authorization will terminate automatically without 
further Commission action as of the applicable performance milestone and 
the licensee will be ineligible to regain it.

Sec. 27.15  Geographic partitioning and spectrum disaggregation.

    (a) Eligibility. (1) Parties seeking approval for partitioning and 
disaggregation shall request from the Commission an authorization for 
partial assignment of a license pursuant to Sec. 1.948.
    (2) AWS and WCS licensees may apply to partition their licensed 
geographic service area or disaggregate their licensed spectrum at any 
time following the grant of their licenses.
    (b) Technical Standards--(1) Partitioning. In the case of 
partitioning, applicants and licensees must file FCC Form 603 pursuant 
to section 1.948 and list the partitioned service area on a schedule to 
the application. The geographic coordinates must be specified in 
degrees, minutes, and seconds to the nearest second of latitude and 
longitude and must be based upon the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83).
    (2) Disaggregation. Spectrum may be disaggregated in any amount.
    (3) Combined partitioning and disaggregation. The Commission will 
consider requests for partial assignment of licenses that propose 
combinations of partitioning and disaggregation.
    (4) Signal levels. For purposes of partitioning and disaggregation, 
part 27 systems must be designed so as not to exceed the signal level 
specified for the particular spectrum block in Sec. 27.55 at the 
licensee's service area boundary, unless the affected adjacent service 
area licensees have agreed to a different signal level.
    (c) License term. The license term for a partitioned license area 
and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original 
licensee's license term as provided for in Sec. 27.13.
    (d) Compliance with construction requirements--(1) Partitioning. (i) 
Except for WCS licensees holding authorizations for Block A in the 698-
704 MHz and 728-734 MHz bands, Block B in the 704-710 MHz and 734-740 
MHz bands, Block E in the 722-728 MHz band, Blocks C, C1, or C2 in the 
746-757 MHz and 776-787 MHz bands, or Block D in the 758-763 MHz and 
788-793 MHz bands, the following rules apply to WCS and AWS licensees 
holding authorizations for purposes of implementing the construction 
requirements set forth in Sec. 27.14. Parties to partitioning 
agreements have two options for satisfying the construction requirements 
set forth in Sec. 27.14. Under the first option, the partitioner and 
partitionee each certifies that it will independently satisfy the 
substantial service requirement for its respective partitioned area. If 
a licensee subsequently fails to meet its substantial service 
requirement, its license will be subject to automatic cancellation 
without further Commission action. Under the section option, the 
partitioner certifies that it has met or will meet the substantial 
service requirement for the entire, pre-partitioned geographic service 
area. If the partitioner subsequently fails to meet its substantial 
service requirement, only its license will be subject to automatic 
cancellation without further Commission action.
    (ii) For WCS licensees holding authorizations for Block A in the 
698-704 MHz and 728-734 MHz bands, Block B in the 704-710 MHz and 734-
740 MHz bands, Block E in the 722-728 MHz band, or Blocks C, C1, and C2 
in the 746-757 MHz and 776-787 MHz bands, the following rules apply for 
purposes of implementing the construction requirements set forth in 
Sec. 27.14. Parties to partitioning agreements have two options for 
satisfying the construction requirements set forth in Sec. 27.14. Under 
the first option, the partitioner and partitionee each certifies that 
they will collectively share responsibility for meeting the construction 
requirement for the entire pre-partition geographic license area. If the 
partitioner and partitionee collectively fail to meet the construction 
requirement, then both the partitioner and partitionee will be subject 
to the consequences enumerated in Sec. 27.14(g) and (h) for this 
failure. Under the second option, the partitioner and partitionee each 
certifies that it will independently meet the construction requirement 
for its respective partitioned license area. If the partitioner or

[[Page 324]]

partitionee fails to meet the construction requirement for its 
respective partitioned license area, then the consequences for this 
failure shall be those enumerated in Sec. 27.14(g) and (h).
    (2) Disaggregation. (i) Except for WCS licensees holding 
authorizations for Block A in the 698-704 MHz and 728-734 MHz bands, 
Block B in the 704-710 MHz and 734-740 MHz bands, Block E in the 722-728 
MHz band, Blocks C, C1, or C2 in the 746-757 MHz and 776-787 MHz bands, 
or Block D in the 758-763 MHz and 788-793 MHz bands, the following rules 
apply to WCS and AWS licensees holding authorizations for purposes of 
implementing the construction requirements set forth in Sec. 27.14. 
Parties to disaggregation agreements have two options for satisfying the 
construction requirements set forth in Sec. 27.14. Under the first 
option, the disaggregator and disaggregatee each certifies that it will 
share responsibility for meeting the substantial service requirement for 
the geographic service area. If the parties choose this option and 
either party subsequently fails to satisfy its substantial service 
responsibility, both parties' licenses will be subject to forfeiture 
without further Commission action. Under the second option, both parties 
certify either that the disaggregator or the disaggregatee will meet the 
substantial service requirement for the geographic service area. If the 
parties choose this option, and the party responsible subsequently fails 
to meet the substantial service requirement, only that party's license 
will be subject to forfeiture without further Commission action.
    (ii) For WCS licensees holding authorizations for Block A in the 
698-704 MHz and 728-734 MHz bands, Block B in the 704-710 MHz and 734-
740 MHz bands, Block E in the 722-728 MHz band, and Blocks C, C1, or C2 
in the 746-757 MHz and 776-787 MHz bands, the following rules apply for 
purposes of implementing the construction requirements set forth in 
Sec. 27.14. If either the disaggregator or the disaggregatee meets the 
construction requirements set forth in Sec. 27.14, then these 
requirements will be considered to be satisfied for both parties. If 
neither the disaggregator nor the disaggregatee meets the construction 
requirements, then both parties will be subject to the consequences 
enumerated in Sec. 27.14(g) and (h) for this failure.

Sec. 27.16  Network access requirements for Block C in the 746-757 and 776-787 MHz bands.

    (a) Applicability. This section shall apply only to the 
authorizations for Block C in the 746-757 and 776-787 MHz bands assigned 
and only if the results of the first auction in which licenses for such 
authorizations are offered satisfied the applicable reserve price.
    (b) Use of devices and applications. Licensees offering service on 
spectrum subject to this section shall not deny, limit, or restrict the 
ability of their customers to use the devices and applications of their 
choice on the licensee's C Block network, except:
    (1) Insofar as such use would not be compliant with published 
technical standards reasonably necessary for the management or 
protection of the licensee's network, or
    (2) As required to comply with statute or applicable government 
regulation.
    (c) Technical standards. For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section:
    (1) Standards shall include technical requirements reasonably 
necessary for third parties to access a licensee's network via devices 
or applications without causing objectionable interference to other 
spectrum users or jeopardizing network security. The potential for 
excessive bandwidth demand alone shall not constitute grounds for 
denying, limiting or restricting access to the network.
    (2) To the extent a licensee relies on standards established by an 
independent standards-setting body which is open to participation by 
representatives of service providers, equipment

[[Page 325]]

manufacturers, application developers, consumer organizations, and other 
interested parties, the standards will carry a presumption of 
reasonableness.
    (3) A licensee shall publish its technical standards, which shall be 
non-proprietary, no later than the time at which it makes such standards 
available to any preferred vendors, so that the standards are readily 
available to customers, equipment manufacturers, application developers, 
and other parties interested in using or developing products for use on 
a licensee's networks.
    (d) Access requests. (1) Licensees shall establish and publish clear 
and reasonable procedures for parties to seek approval to use devices or 
applications on the licensees' networks. A licensee must also provide to 
potential customers notice of the customers' rights to request the 
attachment of a device or application to the licensee's network, and 
notice of the licensee's process for customers to make such requests, 
including the relevant network criteria.
    (2) If a licensee determines that a request for access would violate 
its technical standards or regulatory requirements, the licensee shall 
expeditiously provide a written response to the requester specifying the 
basis for denying access and providing an opportunity for the requester 
to modify its request to satisfy the licensee's concerns.
    (e) Handset locking prohibited. No licensee may disable features on 
handsets it provides to customers, to the extent such features are 
compliant with the licensee's standards pursuant to paragraph (b)of this 
section, nor configure handsets it provides to prohibit use of such 
handsets on other providers' networks.
    (f) Burden of proof. Once a complainant sets forth a prima facie 
case that the C Block licensee has refused to attach a device or 
application in violation of the requirements adopted in this section, 
the licensee shall have the burden of proof to demonstrate that it has 
adopted reasonable network standards and reasonably applied those 
standards in the complainant's case. Where the licensee bases its 
network restrictions on industry-wide consensus standards, such 
restrictions would be presumed reasonable.

Sec. 27.20  Digital television transition education reports.

    (a) The requirements of this section shall apply only with regard to 
WCS license authorizations in Block A in the 698-704 MHz and 728-734 MHz 
bands, Block B in the 704-710 MHz and 734-740 MHz bands, Block E in the 
722-728 MHz band, Block C, C1, or C2 in the 746-757 MHz and 776-787 MHz 
bands, and Block D in the 758-763 MHz and 788-793 MHz bands.
    (b) By the tenth day of the first calendar quarter after the initial 
grant of a WCS license authorization subject to the requirements of this 
section--and on a quarterly basis thereafter as specified in paragraph 
(c) of this section--the licensee holding such authorization must file a 
report with the Commission indicating whether, in the previous quarter, 
it has taken any outreach efforts to educate consumers about the 
transition from analog broadcast television service to digital broadcast 
television service (DTV) and, if so, what specific efforts were 
undertaken. Thus, for example, if the license authorization is granted 
during the April-June quarter of 2008, the licensee must file its first 
report by July 10, 2008. Each quarterly report, either paper or 
electronic, must be filed with the Commission in Docket Number 07-148. 
If the quarterly report is a paper filing, the cover sheet must clearly 
state ``Report,'' whereas if the report is filed electronically using 
the Commission's Electronic Comment File System (ECFS), the ``Document 
Type'' on the cover sheet should indicate ``REPORT.''
    (c) The reporting requirements under this section cover the 
remaining period of the DTV transition. Accordingly, once the licensee 
files its quarterly report covering the second quarter of 2009, the 
requirements of this section terminate.

complies with the provisions of Sec. 27.55(b). The antenna height for 
such stations is limited only to the extent required to satisfy the 
requirements of Sec. 27.55(b).
    (8) Licensees intending to operate a base or fixed station at a 
power level permitted under the provisions of paragraph (c)(6) of this 
section must provide advanced notice of such operation to the Commission 
and to licensees authorized in their area of operation. Licensees who 
must be notified are all licensees authorized under this part to operate

commencement of station operation.
    (9) Control and mobile stations are limited to 30 watts ERP;
    (10) Portable stations (hand-held devices) are limited to 3 watts 
ERP; and
    (11) Licensees may employ equipment operating in compliance with

instances, equipment employed must be authorized in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 27.51.
    (d) The following power and antenna height requirements apply to 
stations transmitting in the 1710-1755 MHz and 2110-2155 MHz bands:
    (1) The power of each fixed or base station transmitting in the 
2110-2155 MHz band and located in any county with population density of 
100 or fewer persons per square mile, based upon the most recently 
available population statistics from the Bureau of the Census, is 
limited to:
    (A) an equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) of 3280 watts 
when transmitting with an emission bandwidth of 1 MHz or less;
    (B) an EIRP of 3280 watts/MHz when transmitting with an emission 
bandwidth greater than 1 MHz.
    (2) The power of each fixed or base station transmitting in the

    (A) an equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) of 1640 watts 
when transmitting with an emission bandwidth of 1 MHz or less;
    (B) an EIRP of 1640 watts/MHz when transmitting with an emission 
bandwidth greater than 1 MHz.
    (3) A licensee operating a base or fixed station in the 2110-2155 
MHz band utilizing a power greater than 1640 watts EIRP and greater than 
1640 watts/MHz EIRP must coordinate such operations in advance with all 
Government and non-Government satellite entities in the 2025-2110 MHz 
band. Operations with power greater than 1640 watts EIRP and greater 
than 1640 watts/MHz EIRP must be coordinated in advance with the 
following licensees authorized to operate within 120 kilometers (75 
miles) of the base or fixed station operating in this band: all 
Broadband Radio Service (BRS) licensees authorized under part 27 in the 
2155-2160 MHz band and all advanced wireless services (AWS) licensees 
authorized to operate on adjacent frequency blocks in the 2110-2155 MHz 
band.
    (4) Fixed, mobile, and portable (hand-held) stations operating in 
the 1710-1755 MHz band are limited to 1 watt EIRP. Fixed stations 
operating in this band are limited to a maximum antenna height of 10 
meters above ground. Mobile and portable stations operating in this band 
must employ a means for limiting power to the minimum necessary for 
successful communications.
    (5) Equipment employed must be authorized in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 24.51. Power measurements for transmissions by 
stations authorized under this section may be made either in accordance 
with a Commission-approved average power technique or in compliance with 
paragraph (d)(6) of

[[Page 330]]

this section. In measuring transmissions in this band using an average 
power technique, the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of the transmission may 
not exceed 13 dB.
    (6) Peak transmit power must be measured over any interval of 
continuous transmission using instrumentation calibrated in terms of an 
rms-equivalent voltage. The measurement results shall be properly 
adjusted for any instrument limitations, such as detector response 
times, limited resolution bandwidth capability when compared to the 
emission bandwidth, sensitivity, etc., so as to obtain a true peak 
measurement for the emission in question over the full bandwidth of the 
channel.
    (e) The following power limits apply to the paired 1392-1395 MHz and 
1432-1435 MHz bands as well as the unpaired 1390-1392 MHz band (1.4 GHz 
band):
    (1) Fixed stations transmitting in the 1390-1392 MHz and 1432-1435 
MHz bands are limited to 2000 watts EIRP peak power. Fixed stations 
transmitting in the 1392-1395 MHz band are limited to 100 watts EIRP 
peak power.
    (2) Mobile stations transmitting in the 1390-1392 MHz and 1432-1435 
MHz bands are limited to 4 watts EIRP peak power. Mobile stations 
transmitting in the1392-1395 MHz band are limited to 1 watt EIRP peak 
power.
    (f) The following power limits apply to the 1670-1675 MHz band:
    (1) Fixed and base stations are limited to 2000 watts EIRP peak 
power.
    (2) Mobile stations are limited to 4 watts EIRP peak power.
    (g) [Reserved]
    (h) The following power limits shall apply in the BRS and EBS:
    (1) Main, booster and base stations. (i) The maximum EIRP of a main, 
booster or base station shall not exceed 33 dBW + 10log(X/Y) dBW, where 
X is the actual channel width in MHz and Y is either 6 MHz if prior to 
transition or the station is in the MBS following transition or 5.5 MHz 
if the station is in the LBS and UBS following transition, except as 
provided in paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) If a main or booster station sectorizes or otherwise uses one 
or more transmitting antennas with a non-omnidirectional horizontal 
plane radiation pattern, the maximum EIRP in dBW in a given direction 
shall be determined by the following formula: EIRP = 33 dBW + 10 log(X/
Y) dBW + 10 log(360/beamwidth) dBW, where X is the actual channel width 
in MHz, Y is either (i) 6 MHz if prior to transition or the station is 
in the MBS following transition or (ii) 5.5 MHz if the station is in the 
LBS and UBS following transition, and beamwidth is the total horizontal 
plane beamwidth of the individual transmitting antenna for the station 
or any sector measured at the half-power points.
    (2) Mobile and other user stations. Mobile stations are limited to 
2.0 watts EIRP. All user stations are limited to 2.0 watts transmitter 
output power.
    (3) For television transmission, the peak power of the accompanying 
aural signal must not exceed 10 percent of the peak visual power of the 
transmitter. The Commission may order a reduction in aural signal power 
to diminish the potential for harmful interference.
    (4) For main, booster and response stations utilizing digital 
emissions with non-uniform power spectral density (e.g. unfiltered 
QPSK), the power measured within any 100 kHz resolution bandwidth within 
the 6 MHz channel occupied by the non-uniform emission cannot exceed the 
power permitted within any 100 kHz resolution bandwidth within the 6 MHz 
channel if it were occupied by an emission with uniform power spectral 
density, i.e., if the maximum permissible power of a station utilizing a 
perfectly uniform power spectral density across a 6 MHz channel were 
2000 watts EIRP, this would result in a maximum permissible power flux 
density for the station of 2000/60 = 33.3 watts EIRP per 100 kHz 
bandwidth. If a non-uniform emission were substituted at the station, 
station power would still be limited to a maximum of 33.3 watts EIRP 
within any 100 kHz segment of the 6 MHz channel, irrespective of the 
fact that this would result in a total 6 MHz channel power of less than 
2000 watts EIRP.
    (i) Peak transmit power shall be measured over any interval of 
continuous transmission using instrumentation calibrated in terms of 
rms-equivalent voltage. The measurement results

[[Page 331]]

shall be properly adjusted for any instrument limitations, such as 
detector response times, limited resolution bandwidth capability when 
compared to the emission bandwidth, etc., so as to obtain a true peak 
measurement for the emission in question over the full bandwidth of the 
channel.

    (iii) By a factor of not less than: 43 + 10 log (P) dB at 2360 MHz 
and 70 + 10 log (P) dB above 2365 MHz.
    (4) For mobile and portable stations operating in the 2305-2317.5 
MHz and 2347.5-2360 MHz bands:
    (i) By a factor of not less than: 43 + 10 log (P) dB on all 
frequencies between 2305 and 2317.5 MHz and on all frequencies between 
2347.5 and 2360 MHz that are outside the licensed band of operation, not 
less than 55 + 10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2320 and 2324 
MHz and on all frequencies between 2341 and 2345 MHz, not less than 61 + 
10 log (P) dB on all frequencies between 2324 and 2328 MHz and on all 
frequencies between 2337 and 2341 MHz, not less than 67 + 10 log (P) dB 
on all frequencies between 2328 and 2337 MHz.
    (ii) By a factor of not less than 43 + 10 log (P) dB at 2305 MHz, 55 
+ 10 log (P) dB at 2300 MHz, 61 + 10 log (P) dB at 2296 MHz, 67 + 10 log

    (iii) By a factor of not less than: 43 + 10 log (P) dB at 2360 MHz 
and 70 + 10 log (P) dB above 2365 MHz.
    (5) Measurement procedure. Compliance with these rules is based on 
the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth 
of 1 MHz or greater. However, in the 1-MHz bands immediately outside and 
adjacent to the channel blocks at 2305, 2310, 2315, 2320, 2345, 2350, 
2355, and 2360 MHz, a resolution bandwidth of at least 1 percent of the 
emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the transmitter may be 
employed. A narrower resolution bandwidth is permitted in all cases to 
improve measurement accuracy provided the measured power is integrated 
over the full required measurement bandwidth (i.e. 1 MHz or 1 percent of 
emission bandwidth, as specified). The emission bandwidth is defined as 
the width of the signal between two points, one below the carrier center 
frequency and one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which 
all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power. 
With respect to television operations, measurements must be made of the 
separate visual and aural operating powers at sufficiently frequent 
intervals to ensure compliance with the rules.

    (7) The measurements of emission power can be expressed in peak or 
average values, provided they are expressed in the same parameters as 
the transmitter power;
    (8) Waiver requests of any of the out-of-band emission limits in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section shall be entertained 
only if interference protection equivalent to that afforded by the 
limits is shown;
    (9) [Reserved]
    (10) The out-of-band emissions limits in paragraphs (a)(1) through 
(a)(3) of this section may be modified by the private contractual 
agreement of all affected licensees, who must maintain a copy of the 
agreement in their station files and disclose it to prospective 
assignees, transferees, or spectrum lessees and, upon request, to the 
Commission.
    (b) For WCS Satellite DARS operations: The limits set forth in Sec.

    (c) For operations in the 746-758 MHz band and the 776-788 MHz band, 
the power of any emission outside the licensee's frequency band(s) of 
operation shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) within the 
licensed band(s) of operation, measured in watts, in accordance with the 
following:
    (1) On any frequency outside the 746-758 MHz band, the power of any 
emission shall be attenuated outside the band below the transmitter 
power (P) by at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB;

factor not less than 76 + 10 log (P) dB in a 6.25 kHz band segment, for 
base and fixed stations;
    (4) On all frequencies between 763-775 MHz and 793-805 MHz, by a 
factor not less than 65 + 10 log (P) dB in a 6.25 kHz band segment, for 
mobile and portable stations;
    (5) Compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) 
of this section is based on the use of measurement instrumentation 
employing a resolution bandwidth of 100 kHz or greater. However, in the 
100 kHz bands immediately outside and adjacent to the frequency block, a 
resolution bandwidth of at least 30 kHz may be employed;
    (6) Compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) 
of this section is based on the use of measurement instrumentation such 
that the reading taken with any resolution bandwidth setting should be 
adjusted to indicate spectral energy in a 6.25 kHz segment.
    (d) For operations in the 758-763 MHz and 788-793 MHz bands, the 
power of any emission outside the licensee's frequency bands of 
operation shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) within the 
licensed band(s) of operation, measured in watts, in accordance with the 
following:
    (1) On all frequencies between 769-775 MHz and 799-805 MHz, by a 
factor not less than 76 + 10 log (P) dB in a 6.25 kHz band segment, for 
base and fixed stations;
    (2) On all frequencies between 769-775 MHz and 799-805 MHz, by a

    (5) Compliance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a 
resolution bandwidth of 100 kHz or greater. However, in the 100 kHz 
bands immediately outside and adjacent to the frequency block, a 
resolution bandwidth of at least 30 kHz may be employed.
    (e) For operations in the 775-776 MHz and 805-806 MHz bands, 
transmitters must comply with either paragraphs

    (7) ACP measurement procedure. The following procedures are to be 
followed for making ACP transmitter measurements. For time division 
multiple access (TDMA) systems, the measurements are to be made under 
TDMA operation only during time slots when the transmitter is on. All 
measurements must be made at the input to the transmitter's antenna. 
Measurement bandwidth used below implies an instrument that measures the 
power in many narrow bandwidths (e.g., 300 Hz) and integrates these 
powers across a larger band to determine power in the measurement 
bandwidth.
    (i) Setting reference level. Using a spectrum analyzer capable of 
ACP measurements, set the measurement bandwidth to the channel size. For 
example, for a 6.25 kHz transmitter, set the measurement bandwidth to 
6.25 kHz; for a 150 kHz transmitter, set the measurement bandwidth to 
150 kHz. Set the frequency offset of the measurement bandwidth to zero 
and adjust the center frequency of the spectrum analyzer to give the 
power level in the measurement bandwidth. Record this power level in dBm 
as the ``reference power level''.
    (ii) Non-swept power measurement. Using a spectrum analyzer capable 
of ACP measurements, set the measurement bandwidth as shown in the 
tables above. Measure the ACP in dBm. These

[[Page 337]]

measurements should be made at maximum power. Calculate the coupled 
power by subtracting the measurements made in this step from the 
reference power measured in the previous step. The absolute ACP values 
must be less than the values given in the table for each condition 
above.
    (iii) Swept power measurement. Set a spectrum analyzer to 30 kHz 
resolution bandwidth, 1 MHz video bandwidth and sample mode detection. 
Sweep <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>MHz from the carrier frequency. Set the 
reference level to the RMS value of the transmitter power and note the 
absolute power. The response at frequencies greater than 600 kHz must be 
less than the values in the tables above.
    (8) Out-of-band emission limit. On any frequency outside of the 
frequency ranges covered by the ACP tables in this section, the power of 
any emission must be reduced below the unmodulated carrier power (P) by 
at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB.
    (9) Authorized bandwidth. Provided that the ACP requirements of this 
section are met, applicants may request any authorized bandwidth that 
does not exceed the channel size.
    (f) For operations in the 746-763 MHz, 775-793 MHz, and 805-806 MHz 
bands, emissions in the band 1559-1610 MHz shall be limited to -70 dBW/
MHz equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) for wideband signals, 
and -80 dBW EIRP for discrete emissions of less than 700 Hz bandwidth. 
For the purpose of equipment authorization, a transmitter shall be 
tested with an antenna that is representative of the type that will be 
used with the equipment in normal operation.
    (g) For operations in the 698-746 MHz band, the power of any 
emission outside a licensee's frequency band(s) of operation shall be 
attenuated below the transmitter power (P) within the licensed band(s) 
of operation, measured in watts, by at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB. 
Compliance with this provision is based on the use of measurement 
instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 100 kilohertz or 
greater. However, in the 100 kilohertz bands immediately outside and 
adjacent to a licensee's frequency block, a resolution bandwidth of at 
least 30 kHz may be employed.
    (h) For operations in the 1710-1755 MHz and 2110-2155 MHz bands, the 
power of any emission outside a licensee's frequency block shall be 
attenuated below the transmitter power (P) by at least 43 + 10 
log<INF>10</INF> (P) dB.
    (1) Compliance with this provision is based on the use of 
measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 1 
megahertz or greater. However, in the 1 megahertz bands immediately 
outside and adjacent to the licensee's frequency block, a resolution 
bandwidth of at least one percent of the emission bandwidth of the 
fundamental emission of the transmitter may be employed. The emission 
bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal between two points, one 
below the carrier center frequency and one above the carrier center 
frequency, outside of which all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB 
below the transmitter power.
    (2) When measuring the emission limits, the nominal carrier 
frequency shall be adjusted as close to the licensee's frequency block 
edges, both upper and lower, as the design permits.
    (3) The measurements of emission power can be expressed in peak or 
average values, provided they are expressed in the same parameters as 
the transmitter power.
    (i) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes 
harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require 
greater attenuation than specified in this section.
    (j) For operations in the unpaired 1390-1392 MHz band and the paired 
1392-1395 MHz and 1432-1435 MHz bands, the power of any emission outside 
the licensee's frequency band(s) of operation shall be attenuated below 
the transmitter power (P) by at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB. Compliance 
with these provisions is based on the procedures described in paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section.
    (k) For operations in the 1670-1675 MHz band, the power of any 
emission outside the licensee's frequency band(s) of operation shall be 
attenuated below the transmitter power (P) by at least 43 + 10 log (P) 
dB. Compliance with these provisions is based on the procedures 
described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

[[Page 338]]

    (l) [Reserved]
    (m) For BRS and EBS stations, the power of any emissions outside the 
licensee's frequency bands of operation shall be attenuated below the 
transmitter power (P) measured in watts in accordance with the standards 
below. If a licensee has multiple contiguous channels, out-of-band 
emissions shall be measured from the upper and lower edges of the 
contiguous channels.
    (1) Prior to the transition, and thereafter, solely within the MBS, 
for analog operations with an EIRP in excess of -9 dBW, the signal shall 
be attenuated at the channel edges by at least 38 dB relative to the 
peak visual carrier, then linearly sloping from that level to at least 
60 dB of attenuation at 1 MHz below the lower band edge and 0.5 MHz 
above the upper band edge, and attenuated at least 60 dB at all other 
frequencies.
    (2) For digital base stations, the attenuation shall be not less 
than 43 + 10 log (P) dB, unless a documented interference complaint is 
received from an adjacent channel licensee with an overlapping 
Geographic Service Area. Mobile Satellite Service licensees operating on 
frequencies below 2495 MHz may also submit a documented interference 
complaint against BRS licensees operating on channel BRS No. 1 on the 
same terms and conditions as adjacent channel BRS or EBS licensees. 
Provided that a documented interference complaint cannot be mutually 
resolved between the parties prior to the applicable deadline, then the 
following additional attenuation requirements shall apply:
    (i) If a pre-existing base station suffers harmful interference from 
emissions caused by a new or modified base station located 1.5 km or 
more away, within 24 hours of the receipt of a documented interference 
complaint the licensee of the new or modified base station must 
attenuate its emissions by at least 67 + 10 log (P) dB measured at 3 
megahertz, above or below, from the channel edge of its frequency block 
and shall immediately notify the complaining licensee upon 
implementation of the additional attenuation. No later than 60 days 
after the implementation of such additional attenuation, the licensee of 
the complaining base station must attenuate its base station emissions 
by at least 67 + 10 log (P) dB measured at 3 megahertz, above or below, 
from the channel edge of its frequency block of the new or modified base 
station.
    (ii) If a pre-existing base station suffers harmful interference 
from emissions caused by a new or modified base station located less 
than 1.5 km away, within 24 hours of receipt of a documented 
interference complaint the licensee of the new or modified base station 
must attenuate its emissions by at least 67 + 10 log (P)-20 log (Dkm/
1.5) dB measured at 3 megahertz, above or below, from the channel edge 
of its frequency block of the complaining licensee, or if both base 
stations are co-located, limit its undesired signal level at the pre-
existing base station receiver(s) to no more than -107 dBm measured in a 
5.5 megahertz bandwidth and shall immediately notify the complaining 
licensee upon such reduction in the undesired signal level. No later 
than 60 days after such reduction in the undesired signal level, the 
complaining licensee must attenuate its base station emissions by at 
least 67 + 10 log (P) dB measured at 3 megahertz, above or below, from 
the channel edge of its frequency block of the new or modified base 
station.
    (iii) If a new or modified base station suffers harmful interference 
from emissions caused by a pre-existing base station located 1.5 km or 
more away, within 60 days of receipt of a documented interference 
complaint the licensee of each base station must attenuate its base 
station emissions by at least 67 + 10 log (P) dB measured at 3 
megahertz, above or below, from the channel edge of its frequency block 
of the other licensee.
    (iv) If a new or modified base station suffers harmful interference 
from emissions caused by a pre-existing base station located less than 
1.5 km away, within 60 days of receipt of a documented interference 
complaint: (a) The licensee of the new or modified base station must 
attenuate its OOBE by at least 67 + 10 log (P)-20 log (Dkm/1.5) measured 
3 megahertz above or below, from the channel edge of its frequency block 
of the other licensee, or if the base stations are co-located, limit its

[[Page 339]]

undesired signal level at the other base station receiver(s) to no more 
than -107 dBm measured in a 5.5-megahertz bandwidth; and (b) the 
licensee causing the interference must attenuate its emissions by at 
least 67 + 10 log (P) dB measured at 3 megahertz, above or below, from 
the channel edge of its frequency block of the new or modified base 
station.
    (v) For all fixed digital user stations, the attenuation factor 
shall be not less than 43 + 10 log (P) dB at the channel edge.
    (3) Prior to transition and thereafter solely within the MBS, and 
notwithstanding paragraph (l)(2) of this section, the maximum out-of-
band power of a digital transmitter operating on a single 6 MHz channel 
with an EIRP in excess of -9 dBW employing digital modulation for the 
primary purpose of transmitting video programming shall be attenuated at 
the 6 MHz channel edges at least 25 dB relative to the licensed average 
6 MHz channel power level, then attenuated along a linear slope to at 
least 40 dB at 250 kHz beyond the nearest channel edge, then attenuated 
along a linear slope from that level to at least 60 dB at 3 MHz above 
the upper and below the lower licensed channel edges, and attenuated at 
least 60 dB at all other frequencies.
    (4) For mobile digital stations, the attenuation factor shall be not 
less than 43 + 10 log (P) dB at the channel edge and 55 + 10 log (P) dB 
at 5.5 megahertz from the channel edges. Mobile Satellite Service 
licensees operating on frequencies below 2495 MHz may also submit a 
documented interference complaint against BRS licensees operating on BRS 
Channel 1 on the same terms and conditions as adjacent channel BRS or 
EBS licensees.
    (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (l)(2) and (l)(4) 
of this section, prior to transition, a licensee may continue to operate 
facilities deployed as of January 10, 2005 provided that such facilities 
operate in compliance with the emission mask applicable to those 
services prior to January 10, 2005.
    (6) Measurement procedure. Compliance with these rules is based on 
the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth 
of 1 MHz or greater. However, in the 1 MHz bands immediately outside and 
adjacent to the frequency block a resolution bandwidth of at least one 
percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the 
transmitter may be employed. A narrower resolution bandwidth is 
permitted in all cases to improve measurement accuracy provided the 
measured power is integrated over the full required measurement 
bandwidth (i.e. 1 MHz or 1 percent of emission bandwidth, as specified). 
The emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal between two 
points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above the carrier 
center frequency, outside of which all emissions are attenuated at least 
26 dB below the transmitter power. With respect to television 
operations, measurements must be made of the separate visual and aural 
operating powers at sufficiently frequent intervals to ensure compliance 
with the rules.
    (7) Alternative out of band emission limit. Licensees in this 
service may establish an alternative out of band emission limit to be 
used at specified band edge(s) in specified geographical areas, in lieu 
of that set forth in this section, pursuant to a private contractual 
arrangement of all affected licensees and applicants. In this event, 
each party to such contract shall maintain a copy of the contract in 
their station files and disclose it to prospective assignees or 
transferees and, upon request, to the FCC.
    (n) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes 
harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require 
greater attenuation than specified in this section.

Sec. 27.55  Power strength limits.

    (a) Field strength limits. For the following bands, the predicted or 
measured median field strength at any location on the geographical 
border of a licensee's service area shall not exceed the value specified 
unless the adjacent affected service area licensee(s) agree(s) to a 
different field strength. This value applies to both the initially 
offered service areas and to partitioned service areas.
    (1) 2110-2155, 2305-2320 and 2345-2360 MHz bands: 47 dB[micro]V/m.
    (2) 698-758 and 775-787 MHz bands: 40 dB[micro]V/m.
    (3) The paired 1392-1395 MHz and 1432-1435 MHz bands and the 
unpaired 1390-1392 MHz band (1.4 GHz band): 47 dB[micro]V/m.
    (4) BRS and EBS: The predicted or measured median field strength at 
any location on the geographical border of a licensee's service area 
shall not exceed the value specified unless the adjacent affected 
service area licensee(s) agree(s) to a different field strength. This 
value applies to both the initially offered services areas and to 
partitioned services areas. Licensees may exceed this signal level where 
there is no affected licensee that is constructed and providing service. 
Once the affected licensee is providing service, the original licensee 
will be required to take whatever steps necessary to comply with the 
applicable power level at its GSA boundary, absent consent from the 
affected licensee.
    (i) Prior to transition, the signal strength at any point along the 
licensee's GSA boundary does not exceed the greater of that permitted 
under the licensee's Commission authorizations as of January 10, 2005 or 
47 dB[micro]V/m.
    (ii) Following transition, for stations in the LBS and UBS, the 
signal strength at any point along the licensee's GSA boundary must not 
exceed 47 dB[micro]V/m. This field strength is to be measured at 1.5 
meters above the ground over the channel bandwidth (i.e., each 5.5 MHz 
channel for licensees that hold a full channel block, and for the 5.5 
MHz channel for licensees that hold individual channels).
    (iii) Following transition, for stations in the MBS, the signal 
strength at any point along the licensee's GSA boundary must not exceed 
the greater of -73.0 + 10 log(X/6) dBW/m\2\, where X is the bandwidth in 
megahertz of the channel, or for facilities that are substantially 
similar to the licensee's pre-transition facilities (including 
modifications that do not alter the fundamental nature or use of the 
transmissions), the signal strength at such point that resulted from the 
station's operations immediately prior to the transition, provided that 
such operations complied with paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section.
    (b) Power flux density limit for stations operating in the 698-746 
MHz bands. For base and fixed stations operating in the 698-746 MHz band 
in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 27.50(c)(6), the power flux 
density that would be produced by such stations through a combination of 
antenna height and vertical gain pattern must not exceed 3000 microwatts 
per square meter on the ground over the area extending to 1 km from the 
base of the antenna mounting structure.
    (c) Power flux density limit for stations operating in the 746-757 
MHz, 758-763 MHz, 776-787 MHz, and 788-793 MHz bands. For base and fixed 
stations operating in the 746-757 MHz, 758-763 MHz, 776-787 MHz, and 
788-793 MHz bands in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 
27.50(b)(6), the power flux density that would be produced by such 
stations through a combination of antenna height and vertical gain 
pattern must not exceed 3000 microwatts per square meter on the ground 
over the area extending to 1 km from the base of the antenna mounting 
structure.

Sec. 27.56  Antenna structures; air navigation safety.

    A licensee that owns its antenna structure(s) must not allow such 
antenna structure(s) to become a hazard to air navigation. In general, 
antenna structure owners are responsible for registering antenna 
structures with the FCC if required by part 17 of this chapter, and for 
installing and maintaining any required marking and

[[Page 341]]

lighting. However, in the event of default of this responsibility by an 
antenna structure owner, the FCC permittee or licensee authorized to use 
an affected antenna structure will be held responsible by the FCC for 
ensuring that the antenna structure continues to meet the requirements 
of part 17 of this chapter. See Sec. 17.6 of this chapter.
    (a) Marking and lighting. Antenna structures must be marked, lighted 
and maintained in accordance with part 17 of this chapter and all 
applicable rules and requirements of the Federal Aviation 
Administration. For any construction or alteration that would exceed the 
requirements of section 17.7 of this chapter, licensees must notify the 
appropriate Regional Office of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA 
Form 7460-1) and file a request for antenna height clearance and 
obstruction marking and lighting specifications (FCC Form 854) with the 
FCC, WTB, 1270 Fairfield Road, Gettysburg, PA 17325.
    (b) Maintenance contracts. Antenna structure owners (or licensees 
and permittees, in the event of default by an antenna structure owner) 
may enter into contracts with other entities to monitor and carry out 
necessary maintenance of antenna structures. Antenna structure owners 
(or licensees and permittees, in the event of default by an antenna 
structure owner) that make such contractual arrangements continue to be 
responsible for the maintenance of antenna structures in regard to air 
navigation safety.

Sec. 27.57  International coordination.

    (a) WCS operations in the border areas shall be subject to 
coordination with those countries and provide protection to non-U.S. 
operations in the 2305-2320 and 2345-2360 MHz bands as appropriate. In 
addition, satellite DARS operations in WCS spectrum shall be subject to 
international satellite coordination procedures.
    (b) Operation in the 698-763 MHz, 775-793 MHz, and 805-806 MHz bands 
is subject to international agreements between Mexico and Canada. Unless 
otherwise modified by international treaty, licenses must not cause 
interference to, and must accept harmful interference from, television 
broadcast operations in Mexico and Canada.
    (c) Operation in the 1710-1755 MHz and 2110-2155 MHz bands is

Sec. 27.60  TV/DTV interference protection criteria.

    Base, fixed, control, and mobile transmitters in the 698-763 MHz, 
775-793 MHz, and 805-806 MHz frequency bands must be operated only in 
accordance with the rules in this section to reduce the potential for 
interference to public reception of the signals of existing TV and DTV 
broadcast stations transmitting on TV Channels 51 through 68.
    (a) D/U ratios. Licensees must choose site locations that are a 
sufficient distance from co-channel and adjacent channel TV and DTV 
stations, and/or must use reduced transmitting power or transmitting 
antenna height such that the following minimum desired signal-to-
undesired signal ratios (D/U ratios) are met.
    (1) The minimum D/U ratio for co-channel stations is:
    (i) 40 dB at the hypothetical Grade B contour (64 dB[micro]V/m) 
(88.5 kilometers (55 miles)) of the TV station;
    (ii) For transmitters operating in the 698-746 MHz frequency band, 
23 dB at the equivalent Grade B contour (41 dB[micro]V/m) (88.5 
kilometers (55 miles)) of the DTV station; or
    (iii) For transmitters operating in the 746-763 MHz, 775-793 MHz, 
and 805-806 MHz frequency bands, 17 dB at the equivalent Grade B contour 
(41 dB[micro]V/m) (88.5 kilometers (55 miles)) of the DTV station.
    (2) The minimum D/U ratio for adjacent channel stations is 0 dB at 
the hypothetical Grade B contour (64 dB[micro]V/m) (88.5 kilometers (55 
miles)) of the TV station or -23 dB at the equivalent Grade B contour 
(41 dB[micro]V/m) (88.5 kilometers (55 miles)) of the DTV station.
    (b) TV stations and calculation of contours. The methods used to 
calculate TV contours and antenna heights above average terrain are 
given in Sec. Sec. 73.683 and 73.684 of this chapter. Tables to 
determine the necessary minimum distance from the 698-763 MHz, 775-793 
MHz, and 805-806 MHz station to the TV/DTV station, assuming that the 
TV/DTV station has a hypothetical or equivalent Grade B contour of 88.5 
kilometers (55 miles), are located in Sec. 90.309 of this chapter and 
labeled as Tables B, D, and E. Values between those given in the tables 
may be determined by linear interpolation. Distances for station 
parameters greater than those indicated in the tables should be 
calculated in accordance with the required D/U ratios, as provided in 
paragraph (a) of this section. The locations of existing and proposed 
TV/DTV stations during the period of transition from analog to digital 
TV service are given in part 73 of this chapter and in the final 
proceedings of MM Docket No. 87-268.
    (1) Licensees of stations operating within the ERP and HAAT limits 
of Sec. 27.50 must select one of four methods to meet the TV/DTV 
protection requirements, subject to Commission approval:
    (i) Utilize the geographic separation specified in Tables B, D, and 
E of Sec. 90.309 of this chapter, as appropriate;
    (ii) When station parameters are greater than those indicated in the 
tables, calculate geographic separation in accordance with the required 
D/U ratios, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section;
    (iii) Submit an engineering study justifying the proposed 
separations based on the parameters of the land mobile station and the 
parameters, including authorized and/or applied for facilities, of the 
TV/DTV station(s) it is trying to protect; or,
    (iv) Obtain written concurrence from the applicable TV/DTV 
station(s). If this method is chosen, a copy of the agreement must be 
submitted with the application.
    (2) The following is the method for geographic separations. (i) Base 
and fixed stations that operate in the 746-763 MHz, 775-787 MHz, and 
788-793 MHz bands having an antenna height (HAAT) less than 152 m. (500 
ft.) shall afford protection to co-channel and adjacent channel TV/DTV 
stations in accordance with the values specified in Table B (co-channel 
frequencies based

[[Page 343]]

on 40 dB protection) and Table E (adjacent channel frequencies based on 
0 dB protection) in Sec. 90.309 of this chapter. Base and fixed 
stations that operate in the 698-746 MHz band having an antenna height 
(HAAT) less than 152 m. (500 ft.) shall afford protection to adjacent 
channel DTV stations in accordance with the values specified in Table E 
in Sec. 90.309 of this chapter, shall afford protection to co-channel 
DTV stations by providing 23 dB protection to such stations' equivalent 
Grade B contour (41 dB[micro]V/m), and shall afford protection to co-
channel and adjacent channel TV stations in accordance with the values 
specified in Table B (co-channel frequencies based on 40 dB protection) 
and Table E (adjacent channel frequencies based on 0 dB protection) in 
Sec. 90.309 of this chapter. For base and fixed stations having an 
antenna height (HAAT) between 152-914 meters (500-3,000 ft.) the 
effective radiated power must be reduced below 1 kilowatt in accordance 
with the values shown in the power reduction graph in Figure B in Sec. 
90.309 of this chapter. For heights of more than 152 m. (500 ft.) above 
average terrain, the distance to the radio path horizon will be 
calculated assuming smooth earth. If the distance so determined equals 
or exceeds the distance to the hypothetical or equivalent Grade B 
contour of a co-channel TV/DTV station (i.e., it exceeds the distance 
from the appropriate Table in Sec. 90.309 of this chapter to the 
relevant TV/DTV station), an authorization will not be granted unless it 
can be shown in an engineering study (see paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this 
section) that actual terrain considerations are such as to provide the 
desired protection at the actual Grade B contour (64 dB[micro]V/m for TV 
and 41 dB[micro]V/m for DTV stations) or unless the effective radiated 
power will be further reduced so that, assuming free space attenuation, 
the desired protection at the actual Grade B contour (64 dB[micro]V/m 
for TV and 41 dB[micro]V/m coverage contour for DTV stations) will be 
achieved. Directions for calculating powers, heights, and reduction 
curves are listed in Sec. 90.309 of this chapter for land mobile 
stations. Directions for calculating coverage contours are listed in 
Sec. 73.683 through 73.685 of this chapter for TV stations and in Sec. 
73.625 of this chapter for DTV stations.
    (ii) Control, fixed, and mobile stations (including portables) that 
operate in the 787-788 MHz and 805-806 MHz bands and control and mobile 
stations (including portables) that operate in the 698-757 MHz, 758-763 
MHz, 776-787 MHz, and 788-793 MHz bands are limited in height and power 
and therefore shall afford protection to co-channel and adjacent channel 
TV/DTV stations in the following manner:
    (A) For control, fixed, and mobile stations (including portables) 
that operate in the 787-788 MHz and 805-806 MHz bands and control and 
mobile stations (including portables) that operate in the 746-757 MHz, 
758-763 MHz, 776-787 MHz, and 788-793 MHz bands, co-channel protection 
shall be afforded in accordance with the values specified in Table D 
(co-channel frequencies based on 40 dB protection for TV stations and 17 
dB for DTV stations) in Sec. 90.309 of this chapter.
    (B) For control and mobile stations (including portables) that 
operate in the 698-746 MHz band, co-channel protection shall be afforded 
to TV stations in accordance with the values specified in Table D (co-
channel frequencies based on 40 dB protection) and to DTV stations by 
providing 23 dB protection to such stations' equivalent Grade B contour 
(41 dB[micro]V/m).
    (C) For control, fixed, and mobile stations (including portables) 
that operate in the 787-788 MHz and 805-806 MHz bands and control and 
mobile stations (including portables) that operate in the 698-757 MHz, 
758-763 MHz, 776-787 MHz, and 788-793 MHz bands, adjacent channel 
protection shall be afforded by providing a minimum distance of 8 
kilometers (5 miles) from all adjacent channel TV/DTV station 
hypothetical or equivalent Grade B contours (adjacent channel 
frequencies based on 0 dB protection for TV stations and -23 dB for DTV 
stations).
    (D) Since control, fixed, and mobile stations may affect different 
TV/DTV stations than the associated base or fixed station, particular 
care must be taken by applicants/licensees to ensure that all 
appropriate TV/DTV stations are considered (e.g., a base station may be 
operating within TV Channel 62 and

[[Page 344]]

the mobiles within TV Channel 67, in which case TV Channels 61, 62, 63, 
66, 67 and 68 must be protected). Control, fixed, and mobile stations 
shall keep a minimum distance of 96.5 kilometers (60 miles) from all 
adjacent channel TV/DTV stations. Since mobiles and portables are able 
to move and communicate with each other, licensees must determine the 
areas where the mobiles can and cannot roam in order to protect the TV/
DTV stations.

    Note to Sec. 27.60: The 88.5 km (55mi) Grade B service contour (64 
dB[micro]V/m) is based on a hypothetical TV station operating at an 
effective radiated power of one megawatt, a transmitting antenna height 
above average terrain of 610 meters (2000 feet) and the Commission's R-
6602 F(50,50) curves. See Sec. 73.699 of this chapter. Maximum 
facilities for TV stations operating in the UHF band are 5 megawatts 
effective radiated power at an antenna HAAT of 610 meters (2,000 feet). 
See Sec. 73.614 of this chapter. The equivalent contour for DTV 
stations is based on a 41 dB[micro]V/m signal strength and the distance 
to the F(50,90) curve. See Sec. 73.625 of this chapter.

Sec. 27.63  Disturbance of AM broadcast station antenna patterns.

    AWS and WCS licensees that construct or modify towers in the 
immediate vicinity of AM broadcast stations are responsible for measures 
necessary to correct disturbance of the AM station antenna pattern which 
causes operation outside of the radiation parameters specified by the 
FCC for the AM station, if the disturbance occurred as a result of such 
construction or modification.
    (a) Non-directional AM stations. If tower construction or 
modification is planned within 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) of a non-
directional AM broadcast station tower, the AWS or WCS licensee must 
notify the licensee of the AM broadcast station in advance of the 
planned construction or modification. Measurements must be made to 
determine whether the construction or modification would affect the AM 
station antenna pattern. The AWS or WCS licensee is responsible for the 
installation and continued maintenance of any detuning apparatus 
necessary to restore proper non-directional performance of the AM 
station tower.
    (b) Directional AM stations. If tower construction or modification 
is planned within 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) of a directional AM broadcast 
station array, the AWS or WCS licensee must notify the licensee of the 
AM broadcast station in advance of the planned construction or 
modification. Measurements must be made to determine whether the 
construction or modification would affect the AM station antenna 
pattern. The AWS or WCS licensee is responsible for the installation and 
continued maintenance of any detuning apparatus necessary to restore 
proper performance of the AM station array.

Sec. 27.64  Protection from interference.

    Wireless Communications Service (WCS) stations operating in full 
accordance with applicable FCC rules and the terms and conditions of 
their authorizations are normally considered to be non-interfering. If 
the FCC determines, however, that interference which significantly 
interrupts or degrades a radio service is being caused, it may, after 
notice and an opportunity for a hearing, require modifications to any 
WCS station as necessary to eliminate such interference.
    (a) Failure to operate as authorized. Any licensee causing 
interference to the service of other stations by failing to operate its 
station in full accordance with its authorization and applicable FCC 
rules shall discontinue all transmissions, except those necessary for 
the immediate safety of life or property, until it can bring its station 
into full compliance with the authorization and rules.
    (b) Intermodulation interference. Licensees should attempt to 
resolve such interference by technical means.
    (c) Situations in which no protection is afforded. Except as 
provided elsewhere in this part, no protection from interference is 
afforded in the following situations:
    (1) Interference to base receivers from base or fixed transmitters. 
Licensees should attempt to resolve such interference by technical means 
or operating arrangements.

[[Page 345]]

    (2) Interference to mobile receivers from mobile transmitters. No 
protection is provided against mobile-to-mobile interference.
    (3) Interference to base receivers from mobile transmitters. No 
protection is provided against mobile-to-base interference.
    (4) Interference to fixed stations. Licensees should attempt to 
resolve such interference by technical means or operating arrangements.
    (5) Anomalous or infrequent propagation modes. No protection is 
provided against interference caused by tropospheric and ionospheric 
propagation of signals.


<R05>
Sec. 27.66  Discontinuance, reduction, or impairment of service.

    (a) Involuntary act. If the service provided by a fixed common 
carrier licensee, or a fixed common carrier operating on spectrum 
licensed to a Guard Band Manager, is involuntarily discontinued, 
reduced, or impaired for a period exceeding 48 hours, the licensee must 
promptly notify the Commission, in writing, as to the reasons for 
discontinuance, reduction, or impairment of service, including a 
statement when normal service is to be resumed. When normal service is 
resumed, the licensee must promptly notify the Commission.
    (b) Voluntary act by common carrier. If a fixed common carrier 
licensee, or a fixed common carrier operating on spectrum licensed to a 
Guard Band Manager, voluntarily discontinues, reduces, or impairs 
service to a community or part of a community, it must obtain prior 
authorization as provided under Sec. 63.71 of this chapter. An 
application will be granted within 31 days after filing if no objections 
have been received.
    (c) Voluntary act by non-common carrier. If a fixed non-common 
carrier licensee, or a fixed non-common carrier operating on spectrum 
licensed to a Guard Band Manager, voluntarily discontinues, reduces, or 
impairs service to a community or part of a community, it must given 
written notice to the Commission within seven days.
    (d) Notifications and requests. Notifications and requests 
identified in paragraphs(a) through (c) of this section should be sent 
to: Federal Communications Commission, Common Carrier Radio Services, 
1270 Fairfield Road, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, 17325.

Sec. 27.70  Information exchange.

    (a) Prior notification. Public safety licensees authorized to 
operate in the 763-775 MHz and 793-805 MHz bands may notify any licensee 
authorized to operate in the 746-757, 758-763, 776-787, or 788-793 MHz 
bands that they wish to receive prior notification of the activation or 
modification of the licensee's base or fixed stations in their area. 
Thereafter, the 746-757, 758-763, 776-787, or 788-793 MHz band licensee 
must provide the following information to the public safety licensee at 
least 10 business days before a new base or fixed station is activated 
or an existing base or fixed station is modified:
    (1) Location;
    (2) Effective radiated power;
    (3) Antenna height; and
    (4) Channels available for use.
    (b) Purpose of prior notification. The prior coordination of base or 
fixed stations is for informational purposes only. Public safety 
licensees are not afforded the right to accept or reject the activation 
of a proposed base or fixed station or to unilaterally require changes 
in its operating parameters. The principal purposes of notification are 
to:
    (1) Allow a public safety licensee to advise the 746-757, 758-763, 
776-787, or 788-793 MHz band licensee whether it believes a proposed 
base or fixed station will generate unacceptable interference;
    (2) Permit 746-757, 758-763, 776-787, and 788-793 MHz band licensees 
to make voluntary changes in base or fixed station parameters when a 
public safety licensee alerts them to possible interference; and,
    (3) Rapidly identify the source if interference is encountered when 
the base or fixed station is activated.

Sec. 27.72  Information sharing requirements.

    This section requires WCS licensees in the 2305-2320 MHz and 2345-
2360 MHz bands to share information regarding the location and operation 
of base stations with Satellite Digital Audio Radio Service (SDARS) 
licensees in the 2320-2345 MHz band. Section 25.263 of this chapter 
requires SDARS licensees in the 2320-2345 MHz band to share information 
regarding the location and operation of terrestrial repeaters with WCS 
licensees in the 2305-2320 MHz and 2345-2360 MHz bands.
    (a) Sites and frequency selections. WCS licensees must select base 
station sites and frequencies, to the extent practicable, to minimize 
the possibility of harmful interference to operations in the SDARS 2320-
2345 MHz band.
    (b) Prior notice periods. WCS licensees that intend to operate a 
base station must, before commencing such operation, provide 10 business 
days prior notice to all SDARS licensees. WCS licensees that intend to 
modify an existing base station must, before commencing such modified 
operation, provide 5 business days prior notice to all SDARS licensees. 
For the purposes of this section, a business day is defined by Sec. 
1.4(e)(2) of this chapter.
    (c) Contents of notice. (1) Notification must be written (e.g., 
certified letter, fax, or e-mail) and include the licensee's name, and 
the name, address, and telephone number of its coordination 
representative, unless the SDARS licensee and all potentially affected 
WCS licensees reach a mutual agreement to provide notification by some 
other means. WCS licensees and SDARS licensees may establish such a 
mutually agreeable alternative notification mechanism without prior 
Commission approval, provided that they comply with all other 
requirements of this section.
    (2) Regardless of the notification method, it must specify relevant 
technical details, including, at a minimum:
    (i) The coordinates of the proposed base station to an accuracy of 
no less than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq> 1 second latitude and longitude;
    (ii) The proposed operating power(s), frequency band(s), and 
emission(s);
    (iii) The antenna center height above ground and ground elevation 
above mean sea level, both to an accuracy of no less than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq> 1 meter;
    (iv) The antenna gain pattern(s) in the azimuth and elevation planes 
that include the peak of the main beam; and
    (v) The antenna downtilt angle(s).
    (3) A WCS licensee operating base stations must maintain an accurate 
and up-to-date inventory of its base stations, including the information 
set forth in Sec. 27.72(c)(2), which shall be available upon request by 
the Commission.
    (d) Calculation of notice period. Notice periods are calculated from 
the date of receipt by the licensee being notified. If notification is 
by mail, the date of receipt is evidenced by the return receipt on 
certified mail. If notification is by fax, the date of receipt is 
evidenced by the notifying party's fax transmission confirmation log. If 
notification is by e-mail, the date of receipt is evidenced by a return 
e-mail receipt. If the SDARS licensee and all potentially affected WCS 
licensees reach a mutual agreement to provide notification by some other 
means, that agreement must specify the method for determining the 
beginning of the notice period.
    (e) Duty to cooperate. WCS licensees must cooperate in good faith in 
the selection and use of new station sites and new frequencies to reduce 
interference and make the most effective use of the authorized 
facilities. WCS licensees should provide SDARS licensees as much lead 
time as practicable to provide ample time to conduct analyses and 
opportunity for prudent base station site selection prior to WCS 
licensees entering into real estate and tower leasing or purchasing 
agreements. WCS licensees must have sufficient operational flexibility 
in their network design to implement one or more technical solutions to 
remedy harmful interference. Licensees of stations suffering or causing 
harmful interference must cooperate in good faith and resolve such 
problems by mutually satisfactory arrangements. If the licensees are 
unable to do so, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, in consultation 
with the Office of Engineering and Technology and the International 
Bureau, will consider the actions taken by the parties to mitigate the 
risk of

[[Page 347]]

and remedy any alleged interference. In determining the appropriate 
action, the Bureau will take into account the nature and extent of the 
interference and act promptly to remedy the interference. The Bureau may 
impose restrictions on WCS licensees, including specifying the 
transmitter power, antenna height, or other technical or operational 
measures to remedy the interference, and will take into account previous 
measures by the licensees to mitigate the risk of interference.

Sec. 27.73  WCS, AMT, and Goldstone coordination requirements.

    This section requires Wireless Communications Services (WCS) 
licensees in the 2345-2360 MHz band to coordinate the deployment of base 
stations with Aeronautical Mobile Telemetry (AMT) facilities in the 
2360-2395 MHz band; and to take all practicable steps necessary to 
minimize the risk of harmful interference to AMT facilities.
    (a) Wireless Communications Service (WCS) licensees operating base 
stations in the 2345-2360 MHz band shall, prior to operation of such 
base stations, achieve a mutually satisfactory coordination agreement 
with the Aerospace and Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council (AFTRCC) 
for any AMT receiver facility within 45 kilometers or the radio line of 
sight, whichever distance is larger, of the intended WCS base station 
location. This coordination is necessary to protect AMT receive systems 
consistent with Recommendation ITU-R M.1459. The locations of the 
current and planned Federal and non-Federal AMT receiver sites may be 
obtained from AFTRCC.
    (b) WCS licensees operating base stations in the 2305-2320 MHz band 
shall, prior to operation of such base stations, achieve a mutually 
satisfactory coordination agreement with the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration (NASA) within 145 kilometers of the Goldstone, CA 
earth station site (35[deg]25[min]33[sec] N, 116[deg]53[min]23[sec] W).
    (c) After base station operations commence, upon receipt of a 
complaint of harmful interference, the WCS licensee(s) receiving the 
complaint, no matter the distance from the NASA Goldstone, CA earth 
station or from an AMT site, operating in the 2305-2320 or 2345-2360 MHz 
bands, respectively, shall take all practicable steps to immediately 
eliminate the interference.
    (d) Duty to cooperate. WCS licensees, AFTRCC, and NASA must 
cooperate in good faith in the coordination and deployment of new 
facilities. WCS licensees must also cooperate in good faith in the 
selection and use of new station sites and new frequencies when within 
radio line of site of AMT receiver facilities to reduce the risk of 
harmful interference and make the most effective use of the authorized 
facilities. Licensees of stations suffering or causing harmful 
interference must cooperate in good faith and resolve such problems by 
mutually satisfactory arrangements. If the licensees are unable to do 
so, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, in consultation with the 
Office of Engineering and Technology and the National Telecommunications 
and Information Administration may impose restrictions including 
specifying the transmitter power, antenna height, or area or hours of 
operation of the stations.

Sec. 27.302  Eligibility.

    (a) General. Authorizations will be granted upon proper application 
if:
    (1) The applicant is qualified under the applicable laws and the 
regulations, policies and decisions issued under those laws, including 
Sec. 27.12;
    (2) There are frequencies available to provide satisfactory service; 
and
    (3) The public interest, convenience or necessity would be served by 
a grant.
    (b) Alien Ownership. A WCS authorization may not be granted to or 
held by an entity not meeting the requirements of section 310 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. section 310 insofar as

<R05>
Sec. 27.303  Upper 700 MHz commercial and public safety coordination zone.

    (a) General. CMRS operators are required, prior to commencing 
operations on fixed or base station transmitters on the 776-787 MHz and 
788-793 MHz bands that are located within 500 meters of existing or 
planned public safety base station receivers, to submit a description of 
their proposed facility to a Commission-approved public safety 
coordinator.
    (1) The description must include, at a minimum;
    (i) The frequency or frequencies on which the facility will operate;
    (ii) Antenna location and height;
    (iii) Type of emission;
    (iv) Effective radiated power;
    (v) A description of the area served and the operator's name.
    (2) It is the CMRS operator's responsibility to determine whether 
referral is required for stations constructed in its area of license. 
Public safety base stations are considered ``planned'' when public 
safety operators have notified, or initiated coordination with, a 
Commission-approved public safety coordinator.
    (b) CMRS operators must wait at least 10 business days after 
submission of the required description before commencing operations on 
the referenced facility, or implementing modifications to an existing 
facility.
    (c) The potential for harmful interference between the CMRS and 
public safety facilities will be evaluated by the public safety 
coordinator.
    (1) With regard to existing public safety facilities, the 
coordinator's determination to disapprove a proposed CMRS facility (or 
modification) to be located within 500 meters of the public safety 
facilities will be presumed correct, but the CMRS operator may seek 
Commission review of such determinations. Pending Commission review, the 
CMRS operator will not activate the facility or implement proposed 
modifications.
    (2) With regard to proposed public safety facilities, the 
coordinator's determination to disapprove a proposed

[[Page 349]]

CMRS facility (or modification) to be located within 500 meters of the 
public safety facilities will be presumed correct, but the CMRS operator 
may seek Commission review and, pending completion of review, operate 
the facility during construction of the public safety facilities. If 
coordination or Commission review has not been completed when the public 
safety facilities are ready to operate, the CMRS operator must cease 
operations pending completion of coordination or Commission review. Such 
interim operation of the CMRS facility within the coordination zone (or 
implementation of modifications) will not be relied on by the Commission 
in its subsequent review and determination of measures necessary to 
control interference, including relocation or modification of the CMRS 
facility.
    (d) If, in the event of harmful interference between facilities 
located within 500 meters proximity, the parties are unable, with the 
involvement of the coordinator, to resolve the problem by mutually 
satisfactory arrangements, the Commission may impose restrictions on the 
operations of any of the parties involved.

                   Protection of Incumbent Operations


<R05>
Sec. 27.1131  Protection of Part 101 operations.

    All AWS licensees, prior to initiating operations from any base or 
fixed station, must coordinate their frequency usage with co-channel and 
adjacent channel incumbent, Part 101 fixed-point-to-point microwave 
licensees operating in the 2110-2155 MHz band. Coordination shall be 
conducted in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 24.237 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1132  Protection of incumbent operations in the 2150-2160/62 MHz band.

    All AWS licensees, prior to initiating operations from any base or 
fixed station, shall follow the provisions of Sec. 27.1255 of this 
part.

[71 FR 29835, May 24, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 27.1133  Protection of Part 74 and Part 78 operations.

    AWS operators must protect previously licensed Broadcast Auxiliary 
Service (BAS) or Cable Television Radio Service (CARS) operations in the 
adjacent 2025-2110 MHz band. In satisfying this requirement AWS 
licensees must, before constructing and operating any base or fixed 
station, determine the location and licensee of all BAS or CARS stations 
authorized in

[[Page 355]]

their area of operation, and coordinate their planned stations with 
those licensees. In the event that mutually satisfactory coordination 
agreements cannot be reached, licensees may seek the assistance of the 
Commission, and the Commission may, at its discretion, impose 
requirements on one or both parties.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1134  Protection of Federal Government operations.

    (a) Protection of Department of Defense operations in the 1710-1755 
MHz band. The Department of Defense (DoD) operates communications 
systems in the 1710-1755 MHz band at 16 protected facilities, 
nationwide. AWS licensees must accept any interference received from 
these facilities and must protect the facilities from interference. AWS 
licensees shall protect the facilities from interference by restricting 
the operation of their base and fixed stations from any locations that 
could potentially permit AWS mobile, fixed, and portable stations 
transmitting in the 1710-1755 MHz band to cause interference to 
government operations within the radii of operation of the 16 facilities 
(the radii of operation of each facility is indicated in the third 
column of Table 1 immediately following paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section). In addition, AWS licensees shall be required to coordinate any 
operations that could permit mobile, fixed, and portable stations to 
operate in the specified areas of the 16 facilities, as defined in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Protection of these facilities in this 
manner shall take place under the following conditions:
    (1) At the Yuma, Arizona and Cherry Point, North Carolina 
facilities, all operations shall be protected indefinitely.
    (2) At the remaining 14 facilities, airborne and military test range 
operations shall be protected until such time as these systems are 
relocated to other spectrum, and precision guided munitions (PGM) 
operations shall be protected until such time as these systems are 
relocated to other spectrum or until PGM inventory at each facility is 
exhausted, whichever occurs first.
    (3) AWS licensees whose transmit operations in the 1710-1755 MHz 
band consist of fixed or mobile operations with nominal transmit EIRP 
values of 100 mW or less and antenna heights of 1.6 meters above ground 
or less shall coordinate their services around the 16 sites at the 
distance specified in row a. of Table 2. AWS licensees whose transmit 
operations in the 1710-1755 MHz band consist of fixed or mobile 
operations with nominal transmit EIRP values of 1 W or less and antenna 
heights of 10 meters above ground or less shall coordinate their 
services around the 16 sites at the distance specified in row b. of 
Table 2. These coordination distances shall be measured from the edge of 
the operational distances indicated in the third column of Table 1, and 
coordination with each affected DoD facility shall be accomplished 
through the Commander of the facility.

Sec. 27.1135  Protection of non-Federal Government Meteorological-Satellite operations.

    AWS licensees operating fixed stations in the 1710-1755 MHz band, if 
notified that such stations are causing interference to meteorological-

Cost-Sharing Policies Governing Microwave Relocation From the 2110-2150 
                       MHz and 2160-2200 MHz Bands

    Source: Sections 27.1160 through 27.1174 appear at 71 FR 29835, May 
24, 2006, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1160  Cost-sharing requirements for AWS.

    Frequencies in the 2110-2150 MHz and 2160-2180 MHz bands listed in 
Sec. 101.147 of this chapter have been reallocated from Fixed Microwave 
Services (FMS) to use by AWS (as reflected in Sec. 2.106) of this 
chapter. In accordance with procedures specified in Sec. 22.602 and 
Sec. Sec. 101.69 through 101.82 of this chapter, AWS entities are 
required to relocate the existing microwave licensees in these bands if 
interference to the existing

[[Page 357]]

microwave licensee would occur. All AWS entities that benefit from the 
clearance of this spectrum by other AWS entities or by a voluntarily 
relocating microwave incumbent must contribute to such relocation costs. 
AWS entities may satisfy their reimbursement requirement by entering 
into private cost-sharing agreements or agreeing to terms other than 
those specified in Sec. 27.1164. However, AWS entities are required to 
reimburse other AWS entities or voluntarily relocating microwave 
incumbents that incur relocation costs and are not parties to the 
alternative agreement. In addition, parties to a private cost-sharing 
agreement may seek reimbursement through the clearinghouse (as discussed 
in Sec. 27.1162) from AWS entities or other Emerging Technologies (ET) 
entities, including Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) operators (for 
Ancillary Terrestrial Component (ATC) base stations), that are not 
parties to the agreement. The cost-sharing plan is in effect during all 
phases of microwave relocation specified in Sec. 22.602 and 101.69 of 
this chapter. If an AWS licensee enters into a spectrum leasing 
arrangement (as set forth in part 1, subpart X of this chapter) and the 
spectrum lessee triggers a cost-sharing obligation, the licensee is the 
AWS entity responsible for satisfying the cost-sharing obligations under 
Sec. Sec. 27.1160-27.1174.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1162  Administration of the Cost-Sharing Plan.

    The Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, under delegated authority, 
will select one or more entities to operate as a neutral, not-for-profit 
clearinghouse(s). This clearinghouse(s) will administer the cost-sharing 
plan by, inter alia, determining the cost-sharing obligation of AWS and 
other ET entities for the relocation of FMS incumbents from the 2110-
2150 MHz and 2160-2200 MHz bands. The clearinghouse filing requirements 
(see Sec. Sec. 27.1166(a), 27.1170) will not take effect until an 
administrator is selected.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1164  The cost-sharing formula.

    An AWS relocator who relocates an interfering microwave link, i.e., 
one that is in all or part of its market area and in all or part of its 
frequency band or a voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent, is 
entitled to pro rata reimbursement based on the following formula:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR24MY06.007

    (a) RN equals the amount of reimbursement.
    (b) C equals the actual cost of relocating the link(s). Actual 
relocation costs include, but are not limited to, such items as: Radio 
terminal equipment (TX and/or RX--antenna, necessary feed lines, MUX/
Modems); towers and/or modifications; back-up power equipment; 
monitoring or control equipment; engineering costs (design/path survey); 
installation; systems testing; FCC filing costs; site acquisition and 
civil works; zoning costs; training; disposal of old equipment; test 
equipment (vendor required); spare equipment; project management; prior 
coordination notification under Sec. 101.103(d) of this chapter; site 
lease renegotiation; required antenna upgrades for interference control; 
power plant

[[Page 358]]

upgrade (if required); electrical grounding systems; Heating Ventilation 
and Air Conditioning (HVAC) (if required); alternate transport 
equipment; and leased facilities. Increased recurring costs represent 
part of the actual cost of relocation and, even if the compensation to 
the incumbent is in the form of a commitment to pay five years of 
charges, the AWS or MSS/ATC relocator is entitled to seek immediate 
reimbursement of the lump sum amount based on present value using 
current interest rates, provided it has entered into a legally binding 
agreement to pay the charges. C also includes voluntarily relocating 
microwave incumbent's independent third party appraisal of its 
compensable relocation costs and incumbent transaction expenses that are 
directly attributable to the relocation, subject to a cap of two percent 
of the ``hard'' costs involved. Hard costs are defined as the actual 
costs associated with providing a replacement system, such as equipment 
and engineering expenses. C may not exceed $250,000 per paired link, 
with an additional $150,000 permitted if a new or modified tower is 
required.
    (c) N equals the number of AWS and MSS/ATC entities that have 
triggered a cost-sharing obligation. For the AWS relocator, N=1. For the 
next AWS entity triggering a cost-sharing obligation, N=2, and so on. In 
the case of a voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent, N=1 for the 
first AWS entity triggering a cost-sharing obligation. For the next AWS 
or MSS/ATC entity triggering a cost-sharing obligation, N=2, and so on.
    (d) Tm equals the number of months that have elapsed between the 
month the AWS or MSS/ATC relocator or voluntarily relocating microwave 
incumbent obtains reimbursement rights for the link and the month in 
which an AWS entity triggers a cost-sharing obligation. An AWS or MSS/
ATC relocator obtains reimbursement rights for the link on the date that 
it signs a relocation agreement with a microwave incumbent. A 
voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent obtains reimbursement rights 
for the link on the date that the incumbent notifies the Commission that 
it intends to discontinue, or has discontinued, the use of the link, 
pursuant to Sec. 101.305 of the Commission's rules.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1166  Reimbursement under the Cost-Sharing Plan.

    (a) Registration of reimbursement rights. Claims for reimbursement 
under the cost-sharing plan are limited to relocation expenses incurred 
on or after the date when the first AWS license is issued in the 
relevant AWS band (start date). If a clearinghouse is not selected by 
that date (see Sec. 27.1162) claims for reimbursement (see Sec. 
27.1166) and notices of operation (see Sec. 27.1170) for activities 
that occurred after the start date but prior to the clearinghouse 
selection must be submitted to the clearinghouse within 30 calendar days 
of the selection date.
    (1) To obtain reimbursement, an AWS relocator or MSS/ATC relocator 
must submit documentation of the relocation agreement to the 
clearinghouse within 30 calendar days of the date a relocation agreement 
is signed with an incumbent. In the case of involuntary relocation, an 
AWS relocator or MSS/ATC relocator must submit documentation of the 
relocated system within 30 calendar days after the end of the 
relocation.
    (2) To obtain reimbursement, a voluntarily relocating microwave 
incumbent must submit documentation of the relocation of the link to the 
clearinghouse within 30 calendar days of the date that the incumbent 
notifies the Commission that it intends to discontinue, or has 
discontinued, the use of the link, pursuant to Sec. 101.305 of the 
Commission's rules.
    (b) Documentation of expenses. Once relocation occurs, the AWS 
relocator, MSS/ATC relocator, or the voluntarily relocating microwave 
incumbent, must submit documentation itemizing the amount spent for 
items specifically listed in Sec. 27.1164(b), as well as any 
reimbursable items not specifically listed in Sec. 27.1164(b) that are 
directly attributable to actual relocation costs. Specifically, the AWS 
relocator, MSS/ATC relocator, or the voluntarily relocating microwave 
incumbent must submit, in the first instance, only the uniform

[[Page 359]]

cost data requested by the clearinghouse along with a copy, without 
redaction, of either the relocation agreement, if any, or the third 
party appraisal described in (b)(1), if relocation was undertaken by the 
microwave incumbent. AWS relocators, MSS/ATC relocators and voluntarily 
relocating microwave incumbents must maintain documentation of cost-
related issues until the applicable sunset date and provide such 
documentation upon request, to the clearinghouse, the Commission, or 
entrants that trigger a cost-sharing obligation. If an AWS relocator 
pays a microwave incumbent a monetary sum to relocate its own 
facilities, the AWS relocator must estimate the costs associated with 
relocating the incumbent by itemizing the anticipated cost for items 
listed in Sec. 27.1164(b). If the sum paid to the incumbent cannot be 
accounted for, the remaining amount is not eligible for reimbursement.
    (1) Third party appraisal. The voluntarily relocating microwave 
incumbent, must also submit an independent third party appraisal of its 
compensable relocation costs. The appraisal should be based on the 
actual cost of replacing the incumbent's system with comparable 
facilities and should exclude the cost of any equipment upgrades or 
items outside the scope of Sec. 27.1164(b).
    (2) Identification of links. The AWS relocator, MSS/ATC relocator, 
or the voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent, must identify the 
particular link associated with appropriate expenses (i.e., costs may 
not be averaged over numerous links). Where the AWS relocator, MSS/ATC 
relocator, or voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent relocates both 
paths of a paired channel microwave link (e.g., 2110-2130 MHz with 2160-
2180 MHz and 2130-2150 MHz with 2180-2200 MHz), the AWS relocator, MSS/
ATC relocator, or voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent must 
identify the expenses associated with each paired microwave link.
    (c) Full Reimbursement. An AWS relocator who relocates a microwave 
link that is either fully outside its market area or its licensed 
frequency band may seek full reimbursement through the clearinghouse of 
compensable costs, up to the reimbursement cap as defined in Sec. 
27.1164(b). Such reimbursement will not be subject to depreciation under 
the cost-sharing formula.
    (d) Good Faith Requirement. New entrants and incumbent licensees are 
expected to act in good faith in satisfying the cost-sharing obligations 
under Sec. Sec. 27.1160 through 27.1174. The requirement to act in good 
faith extends to, but is not limited to, the preparation and submission 
of the documentation required in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) MSS Participation in the Clearinghouse. MSS operators are not 
required to submit reimbursements to the clearinghouse for links 
relocated due to interference from MSS space-to-Earth downlink 
operations, but may elect to do so, in which case the MSS operator must 
identify the reimbursement claim as such and follow the applicable 
procedures governing reimbursement in part 27. MSS reimbursement rights 
and cost-sharing obligations for space-to-Earth downlink operations are 
governed by Sec. 101.82 of this chapter.
    (f) Reimbursement for Self-relocating FMS links in the 2130-2150 MHz 
and 2180-2200 MHz bands. Where a voluntarily relocating microwave 
incumbent relocates a paired microwave link with paths in the 2130-2150 
MHz and 2180-2200 MHz bands, it may not seek reimbursement from MSS 
operators (including MSS/ATC operators), but is entitled to partial 
reimbursement from the first AWS beneficiary, equal to fifty percent of 
its actual costs for relocating the paired link, or half of the 
reimbursement cap in Sec. 27.1164(b), whichever is less. This amount is 
subject to depreciation as specified Sec. 27.1164(b). An AWS licensee 
who is obligated to reimburse relocation costs under this rule is 
entitled to obtain reimbursement from other AWS beneficiaries in 
accordance with Sec. Sec. 27.1164 and 27.1168. For purposes of applying 
the cost-sharing formula relative to other AWS licensees that benefit 
from the self-relocation, the fifty percent attributable to the AWS 
entrant shall be treated as the entire cost of the link relocation, and 
depreciation shall run from the date on which the clearinghouse issues 
the notice of an obligation to reimburse the

[[Page 360]]

voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent. The cost-sharing obligations 
for MSS operators in the 2180-2200 MHz band are governed by Sec. 101.82 
of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1168  Triggering a Reimbursement Obligation.

    (a) The clearinghouse will apply the following test to determine 
when an AWS entity or MSS/ATC entity has triggered a cost-sharing 
obligation and therefore must pay an AWS relocator, MSS relocator 
(including MSS/ATC), or a voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent in 
accordance with the formula detailed in Sec. 27.1164:
    (1) All or part of the relocated microwave link was initially co-
channel with the licensed AWS band(s) of the AWS entity or the selected 
assignment of the MSS operator that seeks and obtains ATC authority (see 
Sec. 25.149(a)(2)(i) of this chapter);
    (2) An AWS relocator, MSS relocator (including MSS/ATC) or a 
voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent has paid the relocation costs 
of the microwave incumbent; and
    (3) The AWS or MSS entity is operating or preparing to turn on a 
fixed base station (including MSS/ATC) at commercial power and the fixed 
base station is located within a rectangle (Proximity Threshold) 
described as follows:
    (i) The length of the rectangle shall be x where x is a line 
extending through both nodes of the microwave link to a distance of 48 
kilometers (30 miles) beyond each node. The width of the rectangle shall 
be y where y is a line perpendicular to x and extending for a distance 
of 24 kilometers (15 miles) on both sides of x. Thus, the rectangle is 
represented as follows:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR24MY06.008

    (ii) If the application of the Proximity Threshold Test indicates 
that a reimbursement obligation exists, the clearinghouse will calculate 
the reimbursement amount in accordance with the cost-sharing formula and 
notify the AWS or MSS/ATC entity of the total amount of its 
reimbursement obligation.
    (b) Once a reimbursement obligation is triggered, the AWS or MSS/ATC 
entity may not avoid paying its cost-sharing obligation by 
deconstructing or modifying its facilities.

[[Page 361]]


<R05>
Sec. 27.1170  Payment Issues.

    Prior to initiating operations for a newly constructed site or 
modified existing site, an AWS entity or MSS/ATC entity is required to 
file a notice containing site-specific data with the clearinghouse. The 
notice regarding the new or modified site must provide a detailed 
description of the proposed site's spectral frequency use and geographic 
location, including but not limited to the applicant's name and address, 
the name of the transmitting base station, the geographic coordinates 
corresponding to that base station, the frequencies and polarizations to 
be added, changed or deleted, and the emission designator. If a prior 
coordination notice (PCN) under Sec. 101.103(d) of this chapter is 
prepared, AWS entities can satisfy the site-data filing requirement by 
submitting a copy of their PCN to the clearinghouse. AWS entities or 
MSS/ATC entities that file either a notice or a PCN have a continuing 
duty to maintain the accuracy of the site-specific data on file with the 
clearinghouse. Utilizing the site-specific data, the clearinghouse will 
determine if any reimbursement obligation exists and notify the AWS 
entity or MSS/ATC entity in writing of its repayment obligation, if any. 
When the AWS entity or MSS/ATC entity receives a written copy of such 
obligation, it must pay directly to the relocator the amount owed within 
30 calendar days.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1172  Dispute Resolution Under the Cost-Sharing Plan.

    (a) Disputes arising out of the cost-sharing plan, such as disputes 
over the amount of reimbursement required, must be brought, in the first 
instance, to the clearinghouse for resolution. To the extent that 
disputes cannot be resolved by the clearinghouse, parties are encouraged 
to use expedited Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) procedures, such 
as binding arbitration, mediation, or other ADR techniques.
    (b) Evidentiary requirement. Parties of interest contesting the 
clearinghouse's determination of specific cost-sharing obligations must 
provide evidentiary support to demonstrate that their calculation is 
reasonable and made in good faith. Specifically, these parties are 
expected to exercise due diligence to obtain the information necessary 
to prepare an independent estimate of the relocation costs in question 
and to file the independent estimate and supporting documentation with 
the clearinghouse.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1174  Termination of Cost-Sharing Obligations.

    The cost-sharing plan will sunset for all AWS and MSS (including 
MSS/ATC) entities on the same date on which the relocation obligation 
for the subject AWS band (i.e., 2110-2150 MHz, 2160-2175 MHz, or 2175-
2180 MHz) in which the relocated FMS link was located terminates. AWS or 
MSS (including MSS/ATC) entrants that trigger a cost-sharing obligation 
prior to the sunset date must satisfy their payment obligation in full.

Cost-Sharing Policies Governing Broadband Radio Service Relocation From 
                        the 2150-2160/62 MHz Band

    Source: Sections 27.1176 through 27.1190 appear at 71 FR 29835, May 
24, 2006, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1176  Cost-sharing requirements for AWS in the 2150-2160/62 MHz band.

    (a) Frequencies in the 2150-2160/62 MHz band have been reallocated 
from the Broadband Radio Service (BRS) to AWS. All AWS entities who 
benefit from another AWS entity's clearance of BRS incumbents from this 
spectrum, including BRS incumbents occupying the 2150-2162 MHz band on a 
primary basis, must contribute to such relocation costs. Only AWS 
entrants that relocate BRS incumbents are entitled to such 
reimbursement.
    (b) AWS entities may satisfy their reimbursement requirement by 
entering into private cost-sharing agreements or agreeing to terms other 
than those specified in Sec. 27.1180. However, AWS entities are 
required to reimburse other AWS entities that incur relocation costs and 
are not parties to the alternative agreement. In addition, parties to a 
private cost-sharing agreement may seek reimbursement through the 
clearinghouse (as discussed in Sec. 27.1178) from AWS entities that are 
not parties

[[Page 362]]

to the agreement. The cost-sharing plan is in effect during all phases 
of BRS relocation until the end of the period specified in Sec. 
27.1190. If an AWS licensee enters into a spectrum leasing arrangement 
and the spectrum lessee triggers a cost-sharing obligation, the licensee 
is the AWS entity responsible for satisfying cost-sharing obligations 
under these rules.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1178  Administration of the Cost-Sharing Plan.

    The Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, under delegated authority, 
will select one or more entities to operate as a neutral, not-for-profit 
clearinghouse(s). This clearinghouse(s) will administer the cost-sharing 
plan by, inter alia, determining the cost-sharing obligations of AWS 
entities for the relocation of BRS incumbents from the 2150-2162 MHz 
band. The clearinghouse filing requirements (see Sec. Sec. 27.1182(a), 
27.1186) will not take effect until an administrator is selected.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1180  The cost-sharing formula.

    (a) An AWS licensee that relocates a BRS system with which it 
interferes is entitled to pro rata reimbursement based on the cost-
sharing formula specified in Sec. 27.1164, except that the depreciation 
factor shall be [180-T<INF>m</INF>]/180, and the variable C shall be 
applied as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) C is the actual cost of relocating the system, and includes, but 
is not limited to, such items as: Radio terminal equipment (TX and/or 
RX--antenna, necessary feed lines, MUX/Modems); towers and/or 
modifications; back-up power equipment; monitoring or control equipment; 
engineering costs (design/path survey); installation; systems testing; 
FCC filing costs; site acquisition and civil works; zoning costs; 
training; disposal of old equipment; test equipment (vendor required); 
spare equipment; project management; site lease renegotiation; required 
antenna upgrades for interference control; power plant upgrade (if 
required); electrical grounding systems; Heating Ventilation and Air 
Conditioning (HVAC) (if required); alternate transport equipment; leased 
facilities; and end user units served by the base station that is being 
relocated. In addition to actual costs, C may include the cost of an 
independent third party appraisal conducted pursuant to Sec. 
27.1182(a)(3) and incumbent transaction expenses that are directly 
attributable to the relocation, subject to a cap of two percent of the 
``hard'' costs involved. Hard costs are defined as the actual costs 
associated with providing a replacement system, such as equipment and 
engineering expenses. There is no cap on the actual costs of relocation.
    (c) An AWS system shall be considered an interfering system for 
purposes of this rule if the AWS system is in all or part of the BRS 
frequency band and operates within line of sight to BRS operations under 
the applicable test specified in Sec. 27.1184. An AWS relocator that 
relocates a BRS system with which it does not interfere is entitled to 
full reimbursement, as specified in Sec. 27.1182(c).


<R05>
Sec. 27.1182  Reimbursement under the Cost-Sharing Plan.

    (a) Registration of reimbursement rights. (1) To obtain 
reimbursement, an AWS relocator must submit documentation of the 
relocation agreement to the clearinghouse within 30 calendar days of the 
date a relocation agreement is signed with an incumbent. In the case of 
involuntary relocation, an AWS relocator must submit documentation of 
the relocated system within 30 calendar days after the end of the one-
year trial period.
    (2) Registration of any BRS system shall include:
    (i) A description of the system's frequency use;
    (ii) If the system exclusively provides one-way transmissions to 
subscribers, the Geographic Service Area of the system; and
    (iii) If the system does not exclusively provide one-way 
transmission to subscribers, the system hub antenna's geographic 
location and the above ground level height of the system's receiving 
antenna centerline.
    (3) The AWS relocator must also include with its system registration 
an independent third party appraisal of the compensable relocation 
costs. The appraisal should be based on the actual

[[Page 363]]

cost of replacing the incumbent's system with comparable facilities and 
should exclude the cost of any equipment upgrades that are not necessary 
to the provision of comparable facilities. An AWS relocator may submit 
registration without a third party appraisal if it consents to binding 
resolution by the clearinghouse of any good faith cost disputes 
regarding the reimbursement claim, under the following standard: The 
relocator shall bear the burden of proof, and be required to demonstrate 
by clear and convincing evidence that its request does not exceed the 
actual cost of relocating the relevant BRS system or systems to 
comparable facilities. Failure to satisfy this burden of proof will 
result in loss of rights to subsequent reimbursement of the disputed 
costs from any AWS licensee.
    (b) Documentation of expenses. Once relocation occurs, the AWS 
relocator must submit documentation itemizing the amount spent for items 
specifically listed in Sec. 27.1180(b), as well as any reimbursable 
items not specifically listed in Sec. 27.1180(b) that are directly 
attributable to actual relocation costs. Specifically, the AWS relocator 
must submit, in the first instance, only the uniform cost data requested 
by the clearinghouse along with copies, without redaction, of the 
relocation agreement, if any, and the third party appraisal described in 
(a)(3), of this section, if prepared. The AWS relocator must identify 
the particular system associated with appropriate expenses (i.e., costs 
may not be averaged over numerous systems). If an AWS relocator pays a 
BRS incumbent a monetary sum to relocate its own facilities in whole or 
in part, the AWS relocator must itemize the actual costs to the extent 
determinable, and otherwise must estimate the actual costs associated 
with relocating the incumbent and itemize these costs. If the sum paid 
to the incumbent cannot be accounted for, the remaining amount is not 
eligible for reimbursement. All AWS relocators seeking reimbursement 
through the clearinghouse have an ongoing duty to maintain all relevant 
records of BRS relocation-related expenses until the sunset of cost-
sharing obligations, and to provide, upon request, such documentation, 
including a copy of the independent appraisal if one was conducted, to 
the clearinghouse, the Commission, or AWS entrants that trigger a cost-
sharing obligation.
    (c) Full reimbursement. An AWS relocator who relocates a BRS system 
that is either:
    (1) Wholly outside its frequency band; or
    (2) Not within line of sight of the relocator's transmitting base 
station may seek full reimbursement through the clearinghouse of 
compensable costs. Such reimbursement will not be subject to 
depreciation under the cost-sharing formula.
    (d) Good Faith Requirement. New entrants and incumbent licensees are 
expected to act in good faith in satisfying the cost-sharing obligations 
under Sec. Sec. 27.1176 through 27.1190. The requirement to act in good 
faith extends to, but is not limited to, the preparation and submission 
of the documentation required in paragraph (b) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1184  Triggering a reimbursement obligation.

    (a) The clearinghouse will apply the following test to determine 
when an AWS entity has triggered a cost-sharing obligation and therefore 
must pay an AWS relocator of a BRS system in accordance with the formula 
detailed in Sec. 27.1180:
    (1) All or part of the relocated BRS system was initially co-channel 
with the licensed AWS band(s) of the AWS entity;
    (2) An AWS relocator has paid the relocation costs of the BRS 
incumbent; and
    (3) The other AWS entity has turned on or is preparing to turn on a 
fixed base station at commercial power and the incumbent BRS system 
would have been within the line of sight of the AWS entity's fixed base 
station, defined as follows.
    (i) For a BRS system using the 2150-2160/62 MHz band exclusively to 
provide one-way transmissions to subscribers, the clearinghouse will 
determine whether there is an unobstructed signal path (line of sight) 
to the incumbent licensee's geographic service area (GSA), based on the 
following criteria:

[[Page 364]]

use of 9.1 meters (30 feet) for the receiving antenna height, use of the 
actual transmitting antenna height and terrain elevation, and assumption 
of 4/3 Earth radius propagation conditions. Terrain elevation data must 
be obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 3-second database. 
All coordinates used in carrying out the required analysis shall be 
based upon use of NAD-83.
    (ii) For all other BRS systems using the 2150-2160/62 MHz band, the 
clearinghouse will determine whether there is an unobstructed signal 
path (line of sight) to the incumbent licensee's receive station hub 
using the method prescribed in ``Methods for Predicting Interference 
from Response Station Transmitters and to Response Station Hubs and for 
Supplying Data on Response Station Systems. MM Docket 97-217,'' in 
Amendment of 47 CFR parts 1, 21 and 74 to Enable Multipoint Distribution 
Service and Instructional Television Fixed Service Licensees to Engage 
in Fixed Two-Way Transmissions, MM Docket No. 97-217, Report and Order 
on Further Reconsideration and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 15 
FCC Rcd 14566 at 14610, appendix D.
    (b) If the application of the trigger test described in paragraphs 
(a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, indicates that a reimbursement 
obligation exists, the clearinghouse will calculate the reimbursement 
amount in accordance with the cost-sharing formula and notify the 
subsequent AWS entity of the total amount of its reimbursement 
obligation.
    (c) Once a reimbursement obligation is triggered, the AWS entity may 
not avoid paying its cost-sharing obligation by deconstructing or 
modifying its facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1186  Payment issues.

    Payment of cost-sharing obligations for the relocation of BRS 
systems in the 2150-60/62 MHz band is subject to the rules set forth in 
Sec. 27.1170. If an AWS licensee is initiating operations for a newly 
constructed site or modified existing site in licensed bands overlapping 
the 2150-2160/62 MHz band, the AWS licensee must file with the 
clearinghouse, in addition to the site-specific data required by Sec. 
27.1170, the above ground level height of the transmitting antenna 
centerline. AWS entities have a continuing duty to maintain the accuracy 
of the site-specific data on file with the clearinghouse.

[At 71 FR 29835, May 24, 2006, as amended at 72 FR 41939, Aug. 1, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 27.1188  Dispute resolution under the Cost-Sharing Plan.

    (a) Disputes arising out of the cost-sharing plan, such as disputes 
over the amount of reimbursement required, must be brought, in the first 
instance, to the clearinghouse for resolution. To the extent that 
disputes cannot be resolved by the clearinghouse, parties are encouraged 
to use expedited Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) procedures, such 
as binding arbitration, mediation, or other ADR techniques.
    (b) Evidentiary requirement. Parties of interest contesting the 
clearinghouse's determination of specific cost-sharing obligations must 
provide evidentiary support to demonstrate that their calculation is 
reasonable and made in good faith. Specifically, these parties are 
expected to exercise due diligence to obtain the information necessary 
to prepare an independent estimate of the relocation costs in question 
and to file the independent estimate and supporting documentation with 
the clearinghouse.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1190  Termination of cost-sharing obligations.

    The plan for cost-sharing in connection with BRS relocation will 
sunset for all AWS entities fifteen years after the relocation sunset 
period for BRS relocation commences, i.e., fifteen years after the first 
AWS licenses are issued in any part of the 2150-2162 MHz band. AWS 
entrants that trigger a cost-sharing obligation prior to the sunset date 
must satisfy their payment obligation in full.

<R05>
Sec. 27.1200  Change to BRS and EBS.

    (a) As of January 10, 2005, licensees assigned to the Multipoint 
Distribution Service (MDS) and the Multichannel Multipoint Distribution 
Service (MMDS) shall be reassigned to the Broadband Radio Service (BRS) 
and licensees in the Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS) shall 
be reassigned to the Educational Broadband Service (EBS).


<R05>
Sec. 27.1201  EBS eligibility.

    (a) A license for an Educational Broadband Service station will be 
issued only to an accredited institution or to a governmental 
organization engaged in the formal education of enrolled students or to 
a nonprofit organization whose purposes are educational and include 
providing educational and instructional television material to such 
accredited institutions and governmental organizations, and which is 
otherwise qualified under the statutory provisions of the Communications 
Act of 1934, as amended.
    (1) A publicly supported educational institution must be accredited 
by the appropriate State department of education.
    (2) A privately controlled educational institution must be 
accredited by the appropriate State department of education or the 
recognized regional and national accrediting organizations.
    (3) Those applicant organizations whose eligibility is established 
by service to accredited institutional or governmental organizations 
must submit documentation from proposed receive sites demonstrating that 
they will receive and use the applicant's educational usage. In place of 
this documentation, a State educational television (ETV) commission may 
demonstrate that the public schools it proposes to serve are required to 
use its proposed educational usage. Documentation from proposed receive 
sites which are to establish the eligibility of an entity not serving 
its own enrolled students for credit should be in letter form, written 
and signed by an administrator or authority who is responsible for the 
receive site's curriculum planning. No receive site more than 35 miles 
from the proposed station's central reference point, or outside the 
applicants' proposed GSA, shall be used to establish basic eligibility. 
Where broadband or data services are proposed, the letter should 
indicate that the data services will be used in furtherance of the 
institution's educational mission and will be provided to enrolled 
students, faculty and staff in a manner and in a setting conducive to 
educational usage. Where traditional educational or instructional video 
services are proposed, the letter should indicate that the applicant's 
program offerings have been viewed and that such programming will be 
incorporated in the site's curriculum. Where educational or 
instructional video services are proposed, the letter should discuss the 
types of programming and hours per week of formal and informal 
programming expected to be used and the site's involvement in the 
planning, scheduling and production of programming. If other levels of 
authority must be obtained before a firm commitment to utilize the 
service can be made, the nature and extent of such additional 
authorization(s) must be provided.
    (4) Nonlocal applicants, in addition to submitting letters from 
proposed receive sites, must demonstrate the establishment of a local 
program committee in each community where they apply. Letters submitted 
on behalf of a nonlocal entity must confirm that a member of the receive 
site's staff will serve on the local program committee and demonstrate a 
recognition of the composition and power of the committee. The letter 
should show that the staff member will aid in the selection, scheduling 
and production of the programming received over the system.
    (b) No numerical limit is placed on the number of stations which may 
be licensed to a single licensee. A single license may be issued for 
more than one transmitter if they are to be located at a common site and 
operated by the same licensee. Applicants are expected to accomplish the 
proposed operation by the use of the smallest number of channels 
required to provide the needed service.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) This paragraph applies to EBS licensees and applications 
licensed or filed pursuant to the provisions of

[[Page 366]]

Sec. 27.1201(c) contained in the edition of 47 CFR parts 20 through 39, 
revised as of October 1, 2005, or Sec. Sec. 74.990 through 74.992 
contained in the edition of 47 CFR parts 70 through 79, revised as of 
October 1, 2004, and that do not meet the eligibility requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section. Such licensees may continue to operate 
pursuant to the terms of their existing licenses, and their licenses may 
be renewed, assigned, or transferred, so long as the licensee is 
otherwise in compliance with this chapter. Applications filed pursuant 
to the provisions of Sec. 27.1201(c) contained in the edition of 47 CFR 
parts 20 through 39, revised as of October 1, 2005 or Sec. Sec. 74.990 
through 74.992 contained in the edition of 47 CFR parts 70 through 79, 
revised as of October 1, 2004 may be processed and granted, so long as 
such applications were filed prior to July 19, 2006. The provisions of 
Sec. Sec. 27.1203(b) through (d) and 27.1214 of this subpart do not 
apply to licenses governed by this paragraph.

<R05>
Sec. 27.1202  Cable/BRS cross-ownership.

    (a) Initial or modified authorizations for BRS stations may not be 
granted to a cable operator if a portion of the BRS station's protected 
services area is within the portion of the franchise area actually 
served by the cable operator's cable system and the cable operator will 
be using the BRS station as a multichannel video programming distributor 
(as defined in Sec. 76.64(d) of this chapter). No cable operator may 
acquire such authorization either directly, or indirectly through an 
affiliate owned, operated, or controlled by or under common control with 
a cable operator if the cable operator will use the BRS station as a 
multichannel video programming distributor.
    (b) No licensee of a station in this service may lease transmission 
time or capacity to a cable operator either directly, or indirectly 
through an affiliate owned, operated, controlled by, or under common 
control with a cable operator, if a portion of the BRS station's 
protected services area is within the portion of the franchise area 
actually served by the cable operator's cable system the cable operator 
will use the BRS station as a multichannel video programming 
distributor.
    (c) Applications for new stations, station modifications, 
assignments or transfers of control by cable operators of BRS stations 
shall include a showing that no portion of the GSA of the BRS station is 
within the portion of the franchise area actually served by the cable 
operator's cable system, or of any entity indirectly affiliated, owned, 
operated, controlled by, or under common control with the cable 
operator. Alternatively, the cable operator may certify that it will not 
use the BRS station to distribute multichannel video programming.
    (d) In applying the provisions of this section, ownership and other 
interests in BRS licensees or cable television systems will be 
attributed to their holders and deemed cognizable pursuant to the 
following criteria:
    (1) Except as otherwise provided herein, partnership and direct 
ownership interests and any voting stock interest amounting to 5% or 
more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate BRS licensee or 
cable television system will be cognizable;
    (2) Investment companies, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3, insurance 
companies and banks holding stock through their trust departments in 
trust accounts will be considered to have a cognizable interest only if 
they hold 20% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate BRS 
licensee or cable television system, or if any of the officers or 
directors of the BRS licensee or cable television system are 
representatives of the investment company, insurance company or bank 
concerned. Holdings by a bank or insurance company will be aggregated if 
the bank or insurance company has any right to determine how the stock 
will be voted. Holdings by investment companies will be aggregated if 
under common management.
    (3) Attribution of ownership interests in a BRS licensee or cable 
television system that are held indirectly by any party through one or 
more intervening corporations will be determined by successive 
multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in the

[[Page 367]]

vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution 
benchmark to the resulting product, except that wherever the ownership 
percentage for any link in the chain exceeds 50%, it shall not be 
included for purposes of this multiplication. For purposes of paragraph 
(d)(9) of this section, attribution of ownership interests in a BRS 
licensee or cable television system that are held indirectly by any 
party through one or more intervening organizations will be determined 
by successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link 
in the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant 
attribution benchmark to the resulting product, and the ownership 
percentage for any link in the chain that exceeds 50% shall be included 
for purposes of this multiplication. For example, except for purposes of 
paragraph (d)(9) of this section, if A owns 10% of company X, which owns 
60% of company Y, which owns 25% of ``Licensee,'' then X's interest in 
``Licensee'' would be 25% (the same as Y's interest because X's interest 
in Y exceeds 50%), and A's interest in ``Licensee'' would be 2.5% (0.1 x 
0.25). Under the 5% attribution benchmark, X's interest in ``Licensee'' 
would be cognizable, while A's interest would not be cognizable. For 
purposes of paragraph (d)(9) of this section, X's interest in 
``Licensee'' would be 15% (0.6 x 0.25) and A's interest in ``Licensee'' 
would be 1.5% (0.1 x 0.6 x 0.25). Neither interest would be attributed 
under paragraph (d)(9) of this section.
    (4) Voting stock interests held in trust shall be attributed to any 
person who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, to any person 
who has the sole power to sell such stock, and to any person who has the 
right to revoke the trust at will or to replace the trustee at will. If 
the trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business 
relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary, the grantor or 
beneficiary, as appropriate, will be attributed with the stock interests 
held in trust. An otherwise qualified trust will be ineffective to 
insulate the grantor or beneficiary from attribution with the trust's 
assets unless all voting stock interests held by the grantor or 
beneficiary in the relevant BRS licensee or cable television system are 
subject to said trust.
    (5) Subject to paragraph (d)(9) of this section, holders of non-
voting stock shall not be attributed an interest in the issuing entity. 
Subject to paragraph (d)(9) of this section, holders of debt and 
instruments such as warrants, convertible debentures, options or other 
non-voting interests with rights of conversion to voting interests shall 
not be attributed unless and until conversion is effected.
    (6)(i) A limited partnership interest shall be attributed to a 
limited partner unless that partner is not materially involved, directly 
or indirectly, in the management or operation of the BRS or cable 
television activities of the partnership and the licensee or system so 
certifies. An interest in a Limited Liability Company (``LLC'') or 
Registered Limited Liability Partnership (``RLLP'') shall be attributed 
to the interest holder unless that interest holder is not materially 
involved, directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of the 
BRS or cable television activities of the partnership and the licensee 
or system so certifies.
    (ii) For a licensee or system that is a limited partnership to make 
the certification set forth in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, it 
must verify that the partnership agreement or certificate of limited 
partnership, with respect to the particular limited partner exempt from 
attribution, establishes that the exempt limited partner has no material 
involvement, directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of 
the BRS or cable television activities of the partnership. For a 
licensee or system that is an LLC or RLLP to make the certification set 
forth in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, it must verify that the 
organizational document, with respect to the particular interest holder 
exempt from attribution, establishes that the exempt interest holder has 
no material involvement, directly or indirectly, in the management or 
operation of the BRS or cable television activities of the LLC or RLLP. 
Irrespective of the terms of the certificate of limited partnership or 
partnership agreement, or other organizational document in the case of 
an LLC or RLLP, however, no

[[Page 368]]

such certification shall be made if the individual or entity making the 
certification has actual knowledge of any material involvement of the 
limited partners, or other interest holders in the case of an LLC or 
RLLP, in the management or operation of the BRS or cable television 
businesses of the partnership or LLC or RLLP.
    (iii) In the case of an LLC or RLLP, the licensee or system seeking 
installation shall certify, in addition, that the relevant state statute 
authorizing LLCs permits an LLC member to insulate itself as required by 
our criteria.
    (7) Officers and directors of a BRS licensee or cable television 
system are considered to have a cognizable interest in the entity with 
which they are so associated. If any such entity engages in businesses 
in addition to its primary business of BRS or cable television service, 
it may request the Commission to waive attribution for any officer or 
director whose duties and responsibilities are wholly unrelated to its 
primary business. The officers and directors of a parent company of a 
BRS licensee or cable television system, with an attributable interest 
in any such subsidiary entity, shall be deemed to have a cognizable 
interest in the subsidiary unless the duties and responsibilities of the 
officer or director involved are wholly unrelated to the BRS licensee or 
cable television system subsidiary, and a statement properly documenting 
this fact is submitted to the Commission. The officers and directors of 
a sister corporation of a BRS licensee or cable television system shall 
not be attributed with ownership of these entities by virtue of such 
status.
    (8) Discrete ownership interests will be aggregated in determining 
whether or not an interest is cognizable under this section. An 
individual or entity will be deemed to have a cognizable investment if:
    (i) The sum of the interests held by or through ``passive 
investors'' is equal to or exceeds 20 percent; or
    (ii) The sum of the interests other than those held by or through 
``passive investors'' is equal to or exceeds 5 percent; or
    (iii) The sum of the interests computed under paragraph (d)(8)(i) of 
this section plus the sum of the interests computed under paragraph 
(d)(8)(ii) of this section equal to or exceeds 20 percent.
    (9) Notwithstanding paragraphs (d)(5) and (d)(6) of this section, 
the holder of an equity or debt interest or interests in a BRS licensee 
or cable television system subject to the BRS/cable cross-ownership rule 
(``interest holder'') shall have that interest attributed if:
    (i) The equity (including all stockholdings, whether voting or 
nonvoting, common or preferred) and debt interest or interests, in the 
aggregate, exceed 33 percent of the total asset value (all equity plus 
all debt) of that BRS licensee or cable television system; and
    (ii) The interest holder also holds an interest in a BRS licensee or 
cable television system that is attributable under this section (other 
than this paragraph) and which operates in any portion of the franchise 
area served by that cable operator's cable system.
    (10) The term ``area served by a cable system'' means any area 
actually passed by the cable operator's cable system and which can be 
connected for a standard connection fee.
    (11) As used in this section ``cable operator'' shall have the same 
definition as in Sec. 76.5 of this chapter.
    (e) The Commission will entertain requests to waive the restrictions 
in paragraph (a) of this section where necessary to ensure that all 
significant portions of the franchise area are able to obtain 
multichannel video service.
    (f) The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section 
will not apply to one BRS channel used to provide locally-produced 
programming to cable headends. Locally-produced programming is 
programming produced in or near the cable operator's franchise area and 
not broadcast on a television station available within that franchise 
area. A cable operator will be permitted one BRS channel for this 
purpose, and no more than one BRS channel may be used by a cable 
television company or its affiliate or lessor pursuant to this 
paragraph. The licensee for a cable operator providing local programming 
pursuant to a lease must include in a notice filed with the Wireless 
Telecommunications Bureau a cover letter explicitly identifying itself 
or its lessees as a local cable operator

[[Page 369]]

and stating that the lease was executed to facilitate the provision of 
local programming. The first application or the first lease notification 
in an area filed with the Commission will be entitled to the exemption. 
The limitations on one BRS channel per party and per area include any 
cable/BRS operations or cable/EBS operations. The cable operator must 
demonstrate in its BRS application that the proposed local programming 
will be provided within one year from the date its application is 
granted. Local programming service pursuant to a lease must be provided 
within one year of the date of the lease or one year of grant of the 
licensee's application for the leased channel, whichever is later. If a 
BRS license for these purposes is granted and the programming is 
subsequently discontinued, the license will be automatically forfeited 
the day after local programming service is discontinued.
    (g) Applications filed by cable television companies, or affiliates, 
for BRS channels prior to February 8, 1990, will not be subject to the 
prohibitions of this section. Applications filed on February 8, 1990, or 
thereafter will be returned. Lease arrangements between cable and BRS 
entities for which a lease or a firm agreement was signed prior to 
February 8, 1990, will also not be subject to the prohibitions of this 
section. Leases between cable television companies, or affiliates, and 
BRS station licensees, conditional licensees, or applicants executed on 
February 8, 1990, or thereafter, are invalid.
    (1) Applications filed by cable operators, or affiliates, for BRS 
channels prior to February 8, 1990, will not be subject to the 
prohibitions of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2)of 
this section, applications filed on February 8, 1990, or thereafter will 
be returned. Lease arrangements between cable and BRS entities for which 
a lease or a firm agreement was signed prior to February 8, 1990, will 
also not be subject to the prohibitions of this section. Except as 
provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, leases between cable 
operators, or affiliates, and BRS/EBS station licensees, conditional 
licensees, or applicants executed on or before February 8, 1990, or 
thereafter are invalid.
    (2) Applications filed by cable operators, or affiliates for BRS 
channels after February 8, 1990, and prior to October 5, 1992, will not 
be subject to the prohibition of this section, if, pursuant to the then 
existing overbuild or rural exceptions, the applications were allowed 
under the then existing cable/BRS cross-ownership prohibitions. Lease 
arrangements between cable operators and BRS entities for which a lease 
or firm agreement was signed after February 8, 1990, and prior to 
October 5, 1992, will not be subject to the prohibitions of this 
section, if, pursuant to the then existing rural and overbuild 
exceptions, the lease arrangements were allowed.
    (3) The limitations on cable television ownership in this section do 
not apply to any cable operator in any franchise area in which a cable 
operator is subject to effective competition as determined under section 
623(l) of the Communications Act.

<R05>
Sec. 27.1213  Designated entity provisions for BRS in Commission auctions commencing prior to January 1, 2004.

    (a) Eligibility for small business provisions. For purposes of 
Commission auctions commencing prior to January 1, 2004 for BRS 
licenses, a small business is an entity that together with its 
affiliates has average annual gross revenues that are not more than $40 
million for the preceding three calendar years.
    (b) Designated entities. As specified in this section, designated 
entities that

[[Page 372]]

are winning bidders in Commission auctions commencing prior to January 
1, 2004 for BTA service areas are eligible for special incentives in the 
auction process. See 47 CFR 1.2110.
    (c) Installment payments. Small businesses and small business 
consortia may elect to pay the full amount of their winning bids in 
Commission auctions commencing prior to January 1, 2004 for BTA service 
areas in installments over a ten (10) year period running from the date 
that their BTA authorizations are issued.
    (1) Upon issuance of a BTA authorization to a winning bidder in a 
Commission auction commencing prior to January 1, 2004 that is eligible 
for installment payments, the Commission will notify such eligible BTA 
authorization holder of the terms of its installment payment plan. For 
BRS, such installment payment plans will:
    (i) Impose interest based on the rate of ten (10) year U.S. Treasury 
obligations at the time of issuance of the BTA authorization, plus two 
and one half (2.5) percent;
    (ii) Allow installment payments for a ten (10) year period running 
from the date that the BTA authorization is issued;
    (iii) Begin with interest-only payments for the first two (2) years; 
and
    (iv) Amortize principal and interest over the remaining years of the 
ten (10) year period running from the date that the BTA authorization is 
issued.
    (2) Conditions and obligations. See Sec. 1.2110(g)(4) of this 
chapter.
    (3) Unjust enrichment. If an eligible BTA authorization holder that 
utilizes installment financing under this subsection seeks to partition, 
pursuant to applicable rules, a portion of its BTA containing one-third 
or more of the population of the area within its control in the licensed 
BTA to an entity not meeting the eligibility standards for installment 
payments, the holder must make full payment of the remaining unpaid 
principal and any unpaid interest accrued through the date of partition 
as a condition of approval.
    (d) Reduced upfront payments. For purposes of Commission auctions 
commencing prior to January 1, 2004 for BRS licenses, a prospective 
bidder that qualifies as a small business, or as a small business 
consortia, is eligible for a twenty-five (25) percent reduction in the 
amount of the upfront payment otherwise required. To be eligible to bid 
on a particular BTA, a small business will be required to submit an 
upfront payment equal to seventy-five (75) percent of the upfront 
payment amount specified for that BTA in the public notice listing the 
upfront payment amounts corresponding to each BTA service area being 
auctioned.
    (e) Bidding credits. For purposes of Commission auctions commencing 
prior to January 1, 2004 for BRS licenses, a winning bidder that 
qualifies as a small business, or as a small business consortia, may use 
a bidding credit of fifteen (15) percent to lower the cost of its 
winning bid on any of the BTA authorizations awarded in the Commission 
BRS auctions commencing prior to January 1, 2004.
    (f) Short-form application certification; Long-form application or 
statement of intention disclosure. A BRS applicant in a Commission 
auction commencing prior to January 1, 2004 claiming designated entity 
status shall certify on its short-form application that it is eligible 
for the incentives claimed. A designated entity that is a winning bidder 
for a BTA service area(s) shall, in addition to information otherwise 
required, file an exhibit to either its initial long-form application 
for a BRS station license, or to its statement of intention with regard 
to the BTA, which discloses the gross revenues for each of the past 
three years of the winning bidder and its affiliates. This exhibit shall 
describe how the winning bidder claiming status as a designated entity 
satisfies the designated entity eligibility requirements, and must list 
and summarize all agreements that affect designated entity status, such 
as partnership agreements, shareholder agreements, management agreements 
and other agreements, including oral agreements, which establish that 
the designated entity will have both de facto and de jure control of the 
entity. See 47 CFR 1.2110(i).
    (g) Records maintenance. All holders of BTA authorizations acquired 
in a Commission auction commencing prior

[[Page 373]]

to January 1, 2004 that claim designated entity status shall maintain, 
at their principal place of business or with their designated agent, an 
updated documentary file of ownership and revenue information necessary 
to establish their status. Holders of BTA authorizations or their 
successors in interest shall maintain such files for a ten (10) year 
period running from the date that their BTA authorizations are issued. 
The files must be made available to the Commission upon request.

Sec. 27.1214  EBS spectrum leasing arrangements and grandfathered leases.

    (a) A licensee in the EBS that is solely utilizing analog 
transmissions may enter into a spectrum leasing arrangement to transmit 
material other than the educational programming defined in Sec. 
27.1203(b) and (c) subject to the following conditions:
    (1) Before entering into a spectrum leasing arrangement involving 
material other than educational programming on any one channel, the 
licensee must provide at least 20 hours per week of EBS educational 
programming (as defined in Sec. 27.1203(b) and (c)) on that channel, 
except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section. An 
additional 20 hours per week per channel must be strictly reserved for 
EBS use and not used for non-EBS purposes, or reserved for recapture by 
the EBS licensee for its EBS educational usage, subject to one year's 
advance, written notification by the EBS licensee to its lessee and 
accounting for all recapture already exercised, with no economic or 
operational detriment to the licensee. These hours of recapture are not 
restricted as to time of day or day of the week, but may be established 
by negotiations between the EBS licensee and the lessee. The 20 hours 
per channel per week EBS educational usage requirement and the recapture 
and/or reservation requirement of an additional 20 hours per channel per 
week shall apply spectrally over the licensee's whole actual service 
area.
    (2) For the first two years of operation, an EBS entity may enter 
into a spectrum leasing arrangement involving material other than 
educational programming if it provides EBS educational usage for at 
least 12 hours per channel per week, provided that the entity does not 
employ channel loading technology.
    (3) The licensee may shift its requisite EBS educational usage onto 
fewer than its authorized number of channels, via channel mapping or 
channel loading technology, so that it can enter into a spectrum leasing 
arrangement involving full-time channel capacity on its EBS station and/
or associated EBS booster stations, subject to the condition that it 
provide a total average of at least 20 hours per channel per week of EBS 
educational usage on its authorized channels. The use of channel mapping 
or channel loading consistent with the Rules shall not be considered 
adversely to the EBS licensee in seeking a license renewal. The licensee 
also retains the unabridgeable right to recapture, subject to six 
months' advance written notification by the EBS licensee to the spectrum 
lessee, an average of an additional 20 hours per channel per week, 
accounting for all recapture already exercised. Regardless of whether 
the licensee has educational receive sites within its GSA, the licensee 
may lease booster stations in the entire GSA, provided that the licensee 
maintains the unabridgeable right to ready recapture at least 40 hours 
per channel per week for EBS educational usage. The licensee may agree 
to the transmission of this recapture time on channels not authorized to 
it, but which are included in the wireless system of which it is a part. 
A licensee under this paragraph which enters into a spectrum leasing 
arrangement on any one of its channels to an operator may ``channel 
shift'' pursuant to and under the conditions of paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section.
    (b) A licensee utilizing digital transmissions on any of its 
licensed channels may enter into a spectrum leasing arrangement to 
transmit material other than the educational programming defined in 
Sec. 27.1203(b) and (c), subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The licensee must reserve a minimum of 5% of the capacity of its 
channels for educational uses consistent

[[Page 374]]

with Sec. 27.1203 paragraphs (b) and (c), and may not enter into a 
spectrum leasing arrangement involving this reserved capacity. In 
addition, before leasing excess capacity, the licensee must provide at 
least 20 hours per licensed channel per week of EBS educational usage. 
This 5% reservation and this 20 hours per licensed channel per week EBS 
educational usage requirement shall apply spectrally over the licensee's 
whole actual service area. However, regardless of whether the licensee 
has an educational receive site within its GSA served by a booster, the 
licensee may lease excess capacity without making at least 20 hours per 
licensed channel per week of EBS educational usage, provided that the 
licensee maintains the unabridgeable right to recapture on one months' 
advance notice such capacity as it requires over and above the 5% 
reservation to make at least 20 hours per channel per week of EBS 
educational usage.
    (2) The licensee may shift its requisite EBS educational usage onto 
fewer than its authorized number of channels, via channel mapping or 
channel loading technology, and may shift its requisite EBS educational 
usage onto channels not authorized to it, but which are included in the 
wireless system of which it is a part (``channel shifting''), so that it 
can enter into a spectrum leasing arrangement involving full-time 
channel capacity on its EBS station, associated EBS booster stations, 
and/or EBS response stations and associated response station hubs, 
subject to the condition that it provide a total average of at least 20 
hours per licensed channel per week of EBS educational usage. The use of 
channel mapping, channel loading, and/or channel shifting consistent 
with the Rules shall not be considered adversely to the EBS licensee in 
seeking a license renewal. In addition, an EBS entity receiving 
interference protection will continue to receive such protection if it 
elects to swap channels with another EBS or BRS station.
    (c) All spectrum leasing arrangements involving EBS spectrum must 
afford the EBS licensee an opportunity to purchase or to lease the 
dedicated or common EBS equipment used for educational purposes, or 
comparable equipment in the event that the spectrum leasing arrangement 
is terminated.
    (d) All leases of current EBS spectrum entered into prior to January 
10, 2005 and in compliance with leasing rules formerly contained in part 
74 of this chapter may continue in force and effect, notwithstanding any 
inconsistency between such leases and the rules applicable to spectrum 
leasing arrangements set forth in this chapter. Such leases entered into 
pursuant to the former part 74 rules of this chapter may be renewed and 
assigned in accordance with the terms of such lease. All spectrum 
leasing arrangements leases entered into after January 10, 2005, 
pursuant to the rules set forth in part 1 and part 27 of this chapter, 
must comply with the rules in those parts.
    (e) The maximum permissible term of an EBS spectrum leasing 
arrangement entered into on or after July 19, 2006 (including the 
initial term and all renewal terms that commence automatically or at the 
sole option of the lessee) shall be 30 years. In furtherance of the 
educational purposes for which EBS spectrum is primarily allocated, any 
spectrum leasing arrangement in excess of 15 years that is entered into 
on or after July 19, 2006 must include terms which provide the EBS 
licensee on the 15th year and every 5 years thereafter, with an 
opportunity to review its educational use requirements in light of 
changes in educational needs, technology, and other relevant factors and 
to obtain access to such additional services, capacity, support, and/or 
equipment as the parties shall agree upon in the spectrum leasing 
arrangement to advance the EBS licensee's educational mission.

this chapter may continue in force and effect,

[[Page 375]]

notwithstanding any inconsistency between such leases and the rules

Sec. 27.1216  Grandfathered E and F group EBS licenses.

    (a) Except as noted in paragraph (b) of this section, grandfathered 
EBS licensees authorized to operate E and F group co-channel licenses 
are granted a geographic service area (GSA) on July 19, 2006. The GSA is 
the area bounded by a circle having a 35 mile radius and centered at the 
station's reference coordinates, and is bounded by the chord(s) drawn 
between intersection points of that circle and those of respective 
adjacent market, co-channel licensees.
    (b) If there is more than 50 percent overlap between the calculated 
GSA of a grandfathered EBS license and the protected service area of a 
co-channel BRS license, the licensees shall not be immediately granted a 
geographic service area. Instead, the grandfathered EBS license and the 
co-channel BRS licensee must negotiate in good faith to reach a solution 
that accommodates the communication needs of both licensees. If the co-
channel licensees reach a mutually agreeable solution on or before 
October 17, 2006, then the GSA of each co-channel license shall be as 
determined pursuant to the agreement of the parties. If a mutually 
agreeable solution between co-channel licensees is not reached on or 
before October 17, 2006, then each co-channel licensee shall receive a 
GSA determined pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section and Sec. 
27.1206(a).

                           Technical Standards


<R05>
Sec. 27.1220  Transmission standards.

    The width of a channel in the LBS and UBS is 5.5 MHz, with the 
exception of BRS channels 1 and 2 which are 6.0 MHz. The width of all 
channels in the MBS is 6 MHz. However, the licensee

[[Page 376]]

may subchannelize its authorized bandwidth, provided that digital 
modulation is employed and the aggregate power does not exceed the 
authorized power for the channel. The licensee may also, jointly with 
other licensees, transmit utilizing bandwidth in excess of its 
authorized bandwidth, provided that digital modulation is employed, all 
power spectral density requirements set forth in this part are met and 
the out-of-band emissions restrictions set forth in Sec. 27.53 are met 
at the edges of the channels employed.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1221  Interference protection.

    (a) Interference protection will be afforded to BRS and EBS on a 
station-by-station basis based on the heights of the stations in the LBS 
and UBS and also on height benchmarking, although the heights of 
antennas utilized are not restricted.
    (b) Height Benchmarking. Height benchmarking is defined for pairs of 
base stations, one in each of two proximate geographic service areas 
(GSAs). The height benchmark, which is defined in meters (hbm) for a 
particular base station relative to a base station in another GSA, is 
equal to the distance, in kilometers, from the base station along a 
radial to the nearest point on the GSA boundary of the other base 
station squared (Dkm\2\) and then divided by 17. That is, hb (m) = 
Dkm\2\/17. A base station antenna will be considered to be within its 
applicable height benchmark relative to another base station if the 
height in meters of its centerline of radiation above average elevation 
(HAAE) calculated along the straight line between the two base stations 
in accordance with Sec. Sec. 24.53(b) and (c) of this chapter does not 
exceed the height benchmark (hbm). A base station antenna will be 
considered to exceed its applicable height benchmark relative to another 
base station if the HAAE of its centerline of radiation calculated along 
the straight line between the two base stations in accordance with 
Sec. Sec. 24.53(b) and (c) of this chapter exceeds the height benchmark 
(hb<INF>m</INF>).
    (c) Protection for Receiving Antennas not Exceeding the Height 
Benchmark. Absent agreement between the two licensees to the contrary, 
if a transmitting antenna of one BRS/EBS licensee's base station exceeds 
its applicable height benchmark and such licensee is notified by another 
BRS/EBS licensee that it is generating an undesired signal level in 
excess of -107 dBm/5.5 megahertz at the receiver of a co-channel base 
station that is within its applicable height benchmark, then the 
licensee of the base station that exceeds its applicable height 
benchmark shall either limit the undesired signal at the receiver of the 
protected base station to -107dBm/5.5 megahertz or less or reduce the 
height of its transmission antenna to no more than the height benchmark. 
If the interfering base station has been modified to increase the EIRP 
transmitted in the direction of the protected base station, it shall be 
deemed to have commenced operations on the date of such modification. 
Such corrective action shall be completed no later than:
    (i) 24 hours after receiving such notification, if the base station 
that exceeds its height benchmark commenced operations after the station 
that is within its applicable height benchmark; or
    (ii) 90 days after receiving such notification, if the base station 
that exceeds its height commenced operations prior to the station that 
is within its applicable height benchmark. For purposes of this section, 
if the interfering base station has been modified to increase the EIRP 
transmitted in the direction of the victim base station, it shall be 
deemed to have commenced operations on the date of such modification.
    (d) No Protection from a Transmitting Antenna not Exceeding the 
Height Benchmark. The licensee of a base station transmitting antenna 
less than or equal to its applicable height benchmark shall not be 
required pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section to limit that 
antennas undesired signal level to -107dBm/5.5 megahertz or less at the 
receiver of any co-channel base station.
    (e) No Protection for a Receiving-Antenna Exceeding the Height 
Benchmark. The licensee of a base station receive antenna that exceeds 
its applicable height benchmark shall not be entitled pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section to insist that any co-channel base station 
limit its undesired signal level

[[Page 377]]

to -107dBm/5.5 megahertz or less at the receiver.
    (f) Information Exchange. A BRS/EBS licensee shall provide the 
geographic coordinates, the height above ground level of the center of 
radiation for each transmit and receive antenna, and the date 
transmissions commenced for each of the base stations in its GSA within 
30 days of receipt of a request from a co-channel BRS/EBS licensee with 
an operational base station located in a proximate GSA. Information 
shared pursuant to this section shall not be disclosed to other parties 
except as required to ensure compliance with this section.

<R05>
Sec. 27.1222  Operations in the 2568-2572 and 2614-2618 bands.

    All operations in the 2568-2572 and 2614-2618 MHz bands shall be 
secondary to adjacent-channel operations. Stations operating in the 
2568-2572 and 2614-2618 MHz must not cause interference to licensees in 
operation in the LBS, MBS, and UBS and must accept any interference from 
any station operating in the LBS, MBS, and UBS in compliance with the 
rules established in this subpart. Stations operating in the 2568-2572 
and 2614-2618 bands may cause interference to stations in operation in 
the LBS, MBS, and UBS if the affected licensees consent to such 
interference.

Sec. 27.1230  Conversion of the 2500-2690 MHz band.

    BRS and EBS licensees in the 2500-2690 MHz band on the pre-
transition A-I Channels will be transitioned from the frequencies 
assigned to them under Sec. 27.5(i)(1) to the frequencies assigned to 
them under Sec. 27.5(i)(2). The transition, which will be undertaken by 
one or more proponent(s), will occur in the following five phases: 
initiating the transition process (see Sec. 27.1231), planning the 
transition (see Sec. 27.1232), reimbursing transition costs (see 
Sec. Sec. 27.1233 and 27.1237-1239), terminating existing operations in 
transitioned markets that do not comport with Sec. 27.5(i)(2) (see 
Sec. 27.1234), and filing the post-transition notification (see Sec. 
27.1235). Licensees may also self-transition (see Sec. 27.1236).

<R05>
Sec. 27.1232  Planning the transition.

    (a) The Transition Planning Period. The Transition Planning Period 
is a 90-day period that commences on the day after the proponent(s) 
files the Initiation Plan with the Commission.
    (b) The Transition plan. The proponent(s) must provide to each BRS 
and EBS licensee within a BTA, a Transition Plan no later than 30 days 
prior to the conclusion of the Transition Planning Period.
    (1) The Transition Plan must:
    (i) Identify the call signs of the stations that are transitioning;
    (ii) Identify the specific channels that each licensee will receive 
following the transition;
    (iii) Identify the receive sites at which replacement downconverters 
will be installed (see Sec. 27.1233(a));
    (iv) Identify the video programming and data transmission tracks 
that will be migrated to the MBS and provide for the MBS channels to be 
authorized to operate with transmission parameters that are 
substantially similar to those of the licensee's operation prior to 
transition (see Sec. 27.1233(b));
    (v) Identify the technical configuration of the MBS facilities;
    (vi) Identify the approximate time line for effectuating the 
transition, which, unless dispute resolution procedures are used, may 
not exceed 18 months from the conclusion of the Transition Planning 
Period;
    (vii) Provide for the establishment of an escrow or other 
appropriate mechanism for ensuring completion of the transition in 
accordance with the Transition Plan.
    (2) The Transition Plan may provide for interruptions of EBS 
transmissions, so long as those interruptions are limited to a period of 
less than seven days at any reception site. The proponent(s)

[[Page 380]]

must coordinate with each EBS licensee to minimize the extent of any 
disruption.
    (3) The Transition Plan may provide for the shifting of an EBS 
licensee's program to alternative channels. Such shifting may not be 
considered an interruption, if the EBS licensee's receive sites are 
equipped to receive and internally distribute the channel to which the 
programming is shifted.
    (4) The Transition Plan may provide for the installation of an 
appropriate filter on an MBS transmitter if the proponent(s) determines 
that the installation of a filter will mitigate interference from 
transmissions in the MBS to operations outside the MBS.
    (c) Counterproposals. No later than 10 days before the conclusion of 
the Transition Planning Period, affected BRS and EBS licensees may 
submit a counterproposal to the proponent(s) if they believe that the 
Transition Plan is unreasonable. The proponent(s) may:
    (1) Accept the counterproposal, modify the Transition Plan 
accordingly, and send the modified Transition Plan to all EBS and BRS 
licensees in the BTA;
    (2) Invoke dispute resolution procedures for a determination of 
whether the Transition Plan is reasonable and take no action until a 
determination of reasonableness is made; or
    (3) Invoke dispute resolution procedures for a determination of 
whether the Transition Plan is reasonable, but may implement the 
transition immediately.
    (d) Safe harbors. An offer by a proponent(s) shall be reasonable if 
it meets one of the following safe harbors:
    (1) Safe harbor No. 1. This safe harbor applies when the default 
high-power channel assigned to each channel group is authorized to 
operate after the transition with the same transmission parameters 
(coordinates, antenna pattern, height of center radiation, EIRP) as the 
downstream facilities before the transition. If the proponent(s) does 
not propose a change in the geographic coordinates of the facilities 
(other than as necessary to conform the actual location with the 
Commission's Antenna Survey Branch database), the proponent may also 
propose the following to the extent consistent with this subpart:
    (i) An increase in the height of the center of radiation of the 
transmission antenna or a decrease in such height of no more than 8 
meters (provided that such change does not result in an increase in 
antenna support structure lease costs to the EBS licensee and the 
consent of the owner of the antenna support structure is obtained).
    (ii) A change in the EIRP of the transmission system of up to 1.5 dB 
in any direction.
    (iii) Digitization, precision frequency offset, or other upgrades to 
the EBS transmission or reception systems that allow the proponent(s) to 
invoke more advantageous interference protection requirements applicable 
to upgraded systems.
    (2) Safe harbor No. 2. This safe harbor applies when an EBS licensee 
has channel-shifted its single video programming or data transmission 
track to spectrum licensed to another licensee. Under Sec. 27.5(i)(2), 
that track must be on the high-power channel licensed to the EBS 
licensee upon completion of the transition. For example, before the 
transition, an A Group licensee might have shifted its EBS video 
programming to channel C1. If one of the pre-transition A Group channels 
is licensed with technical parameters substantially similar to those of 
pre-transition channel C1, the Transition Plan may provide for high-
power channel A4 to be licensed with the same technical parameters as 
the pre-transition channel C1. However, if the pre-transition A Group 
channels are licensed to operate with technical parameters materially 
different from those of pre-transition channel C1, the proponent(s) may:
    (i) Arrange a channel swap with the licensee of the C Group so that 
the A Group licensee will receive high-power channel C4 (which will 
automatically be licensed with the same transmission parameters as the 
pre-transition channel C1) in exchange for channel A4.
    (ii) Arrange for high-power channel A4 to operate with transmission 
parameters substantially similar to those of the pre-transition channel 
C1 (see paragraph (d)(1) of this section).
    (3) Safe harbor No. 3. This safe harbor applies when a four-channel 
group is

[[Page 381]]

shared among multiple licensees in a given geographic area. Absent an 
agreement otherwise, a proponent may:
    (i) Secure a 6 MHz MBS channel for each licensee in exchange for the 
non-MBS channels assigned to the group. Following the channel swap(s) 
necessary to secure those additional MBS channels, the Transition Plan 
can provide for the licensing of the remaining channels in the LBS, UBS, 
and Guard Bands on a pro rata basis (with channel(s) in each segment 
being disaggregated when and if necessary to provide each with its pro 
rata share of the spectrum in each segment);
    (ii) Provide for pro rata segmentation of the default MBS channel 
for the group, provided that the proponent commits to provide each of 
the licensees with the technology necessary for its EBS video 
programming or data transmissions to be digitized, transmitted and 
received utilizing the provided bandwidth. The non-MBS channels would be 
divided among the sharing licensees on a pro rata basis (with channel(s) 
in each segment being disaggregated when and if necessary to provide 
each with its pro rata share of the spectrum in each segment); or
    (iii) Assign the default MBS channel assigned to the channel group 
to one of the licensees, if that licensee is the only one that elects to 
migrate video programming or data transmission tracks to the MBS. The 
remaining spectrum assigned to the group may be allocated among the 
licensees on a pro rata basis, with the 6 MHz in the MBS counting 
against that licensee's portion. To the extent necessary, the non-MBS 
spectrum can be disaggregated when and if necessary to provide each with 
its pro rata share of the spectrum in each segment. If the proponent 
chooses to effectuate a channel swap to provide more than one channel in 
the MBS, the remaining channels assigned to the group (after considering 
that one or more LBS/UBS channels and associated Transition Band 
channels will have been swapped away to provide the additional MBS 
channel) can be allocated among the licensees on a pro rata basis (with 
channel(s) in each segment being disaggregated when and if necessary to 
provide each with its pro rata share of the spectrum in each segment).
    (4) Safe harbor No. 4. This safe harbor applies when an EBS licensee 
uses one or more of its channels for studio-to-transmitter links. The 
proponent may provide for one of the following options:
    (i) The use of the LBS and/or UBS band for the point-to-point 
transmission of the EBS video or data (through superchannelization of 
the licensee's contiguous LBS or UBS channels), provided the proponent 
commits to retune the existing point-to-point equipment to operate on 
those channels or to replace the existing equipment with new equipment 
tuned to operate on those channels and the proposal complies with the 
LBS/UBS technical and interference protection rules;
    (ii) The migration of the EBS programming to the MBS by retuning the 
existing point-to-point equipment to operate in the MBS or replacing it 
with equipment tuned to operate in the MBS; or
    (iii) The replacement of the point-to-point link with point-to-point 
equipment licensed to the EBS licensee in alternative spectrum, so long 
as the replacement facilities meet the definition of ``comparable 
facilities'' set out in Sec. 101.75(b) of this chapter.

    (b) Migration of Video Programming and Data Transmission Track. (1) 
The proponent(s) must provide, at its cost, to each EBS licensee that 
intends to continue downstream high-power, high-site educational video 
programming or data transmission services, with one programming track on 
the MBS channels for each EBS video or data transmission track the 
licensee is transmitting on a simultaneous basis before the transition.
    (i) To be eligible for migration, a program track must contain EBS 
programming that complies with Sec. 27.1203 (b) and (c).
    (ii) The proponent(s) must pay only the costs of migrating 
programming tracks being transmitted on December 31, 2002 or within six 
months prior thereto.
    (2) The proponent(s) must migrate each eligible programming track to 
spectrum in the MBS that will be licensed to the affected licensee at 
the conclusion of the transition.
    (3) After the transition, the desired-to-undesired signal level 
ratio at each of the receive sites securing a replacement downconverter 
must satisfy the following criteria:
    (i) Cochannel D/U Ratio. (A) When the post-transition desired signal

output of the reception antenna must be at least the lesser of 32 dB or 
the pre-transition D/U ratio less 1.5 dB.
    (C) Where in implementing the Transition Plan, the proponent(s) 
deploys precise frequency offset in an analog system, the minimum 
cochannel D/U ratio is reduced to 38 dB, provided that the transmitters 
have or are upgraded pursuant to the Transition Plan to have the 
appropriate ``plus,'' ``zero,'' or ``minus'' 10,010 Hertz precision 
frequency offset with a <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3 Hertz (or better) 
stability.
    (ii) Adjacent Channel D/U Ratio. The actual adjacent channel D/U 
must equal or exceed the lesser of 0 dB or the actual pre-transmission 
D/U ratio. However, in the event that the receive site uses receivers or 
is upgraded by the proponent(s) as part of the Transition Plan to use 
receivers that can tolerate negative adjacent channel D/U ratios, the 
actual adjacent channel D/U ratio at such receive site must equal or 
exceed -10 dB. Provided that the receive site receiver is not upgraded 
and cannot tolerate -10 dB, the adjacent channel D/U ratio would be 0dB.

           Relocation Procedures for the 2150-2160/62 MHz Band

    Source: Sections 27.1250 through 27.1255 appear at 71 FR 29840, May 
24, 2006, unless otherwise noted.

[[Page 386]]


<R05>
Sec. 27.1250  Transition of the 2150-2160/62 MHz band from the Broadband Radio Service to the Advanced Wireless Service.

    The 2150-2160/62 MHz band has been allocated for use by the Advanced 
Wireless Service (AWS). The rules in this section provide for a 
transition period during which AWS licensees may relocate existing 
Broadband Radio Service (BRS) licensees using these frequencies to their 
assigned frequencies in the 2496-2690 MHz band or other media.
    (a) AWS licensees and BRS licensees shall engage in mandatory 
negotiations for the purpose of agreeing to terms under which the BRS 
licensees would:
    (1) Relocate their operations to other frequency bands or other 
media; or alternatively
    (2) Accept a sharing arrangement with the AWS licensee that may 
result in an otherwise impermissible level of interference to the BRS 
operations.
    (b) If no agreement is reached during the mandatory negotiation 
period, an AWS licensee may initiate involuntary relocation procedures. 
Under involuntary relocation, the incumbent is required to relocate, 
provided that the AWS licensee meets the conditions of Sec. 27.1252.
    (c) Relocation of BRS licensees by AWS licensees will be subject to 
a three-year mandatory negotiation period. BRS licensees may suspend the 
running of the three-year negotiation period for up to one year if the 
BRS licensee cannot be relocated to comparable facilities at the time 
the AWS licensee seeks entry into the band.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1251  Mandatory Negotiations.

    (a) Once mandatory negotiations have begun, a BRS licensee may not 
refuse to negotiate and all parties are required to negotiate in good 
faith. Good faith requires each party to provide information to the 
other that is reasonably necessary to facilitate the relocation process. 
The BRS licensee is required to cooperate with an AWS licensee's request 
to provide access to the facilities to be relocated, other than the BRS 
customer location, so that an independent third party can examine the 
BRS system and prepare an appraisal of the costs to relocate the 
incumbent. In evaluating claims that a party has not negotiated in good 
faith, the FCC will consider, inter alia, the following factors:
    (1) Whether the AWS licensee has made a bona fide offer to relocate 
the BRS licensee to comparable facilities in accordance with Sec. 
27.1252(b);
    (2) If the BRS licensee has demanded a premium, the type of premium 
requested (e.g., whether the premium is directly related to relocation, 
such as analog-to-digital conversions, versus other types of premiums), 
and whether the value of the premium as compared to the cost of 
providing comparable facilities is disproportionate (i.e., whether there 
is a lack of proportion or relation between the two);
    (3) What steps the parties have taken to determine the actual cost 
of relocation to comparable facilities;
    (4) Whether either party has withheld information requested by the 
other party that is necessary to estimate relocation costs or to 
facilitate the relocation process.
    (b) Any party alleging a violation of our good faith requirement 
must attach an independent estimate of the relocation costs in question 
to any documentation filed with the Commission in support of its claim. 
An independent cost estimate must include a specification for the 
comparable facility and a statement of the costs associated with 
providing that facility to the incumbent licensee.
    (c) Mandatory negotiations will commence for each BRS licensee when 
the AWS licensee informs the BRS licensee in writing of its desire to 
negotiate. Mandatory negotiations will be conducted with the goal of 
providing the BRS licensee with comparable facilities, defined as 
facilities possessing the following characteristics:
    (1) Throughput. Communications throughput is the amount of 
information transferred within a system in a given amount of time. 
System is defined as a base station and all end user units served by 
that base station. If analog facilities are being replaced with analog, 
comparable facilities may

[[Page 387]]

provide a comparable number of channels. If digital facilities are being 
replaced with digital, comparable facilities provide equivalent data 
loading bits per second (bps).
    (2) Reliability. System reliability is the degree to which 
information is transferred accurately within a system. Comparable 
facilities provide reliability equal to the overall reliability of the 
BRS system. For digital systems, reliability is measured by the percent 
of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a desired value, and for analog 
or digital video transmission, it is measured by whether the end-to-end 
transmission delay is within the required delay bound. If an analog 
system is replaced with a digital system, only the resulting frequency 
response, harmonic distortion, signal-to-noise ratio and its reliability 
will be considered in determining comparable reliability.
    (3) Operating Costs. Operating costs are the cost to operate and 
maintain the BRS system. AWS licensees would compensate BRS licensees 
for any increased recurring costs associated with the replacement 
facilities (e.g., additional rental payments, and increased utility 
fees) for five years after relocation. AWS licensees could satisfy this 
obligation by making a lump-sum payment based on present value using 
current interest rates. Additionally, the maintenance costs to the BRS 
licensee would be equivalent to the replaced system in order for the 
replacement system to be comparable.
    (d) AWS licensees are responsible for the relocation costs of end 
user units served by the BRS base station that is being relocated. If a 
lessee is operating under a BRS license, the BRS licensee may rely on 
the throughput, reliability, and operating costs of facilities in use by 
a lessee in negotiating comparable facilities and may include the lessee 
in negotiations.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1252  Involuntary Relocation Procedures.

    (a) If no agreement is reached during the mandatory negotiation 
period, an AWS licensee may initiate involuntary relocation procedures 
under the Commission's rules. AWS licensees are obligated to pay to 
relocate BRS systems to which the AWS system poses an interference 
problem. Under involuntary relocation, the BRS licensee is required to 
relocate, provided that the AWS licensee:
    (1) Guarantees payment of relocation costs, including all 
engineering, equipment, site and FCC fees, as well as any legitimate and 
prudent transaction expenses incurred by the BRS licensee that are 
directly attributable to an involuntary relocation, subject to a cap of 
two percent of the ``hard'' costs involved. Hard costs are defined as 
the actual costs associated with providing a replacement system, such as 
equipment and engineering expenses. There is no cap on the actual costs 
of relocation. AWS licensees are not required to pay BRS licensees for 
internal resources devoted to the relocation process. AWS licensees are 
not required to pay for transaction costs incurred by BRS licensees 
during the mandatory period once the involuntary period is initiated, or 
for fees that cannot be legitimately tied to the provision of comparable 
facilities; and
    (2) Completes all activities necessary for implementing the 
replacement facilities, including engineering and cost analysis of the 
relocation procedure and, if radio facilities are used, identifying and 
obtaining, on the incumbents' behalf, new microwave frequencies and 
frequency coordination.
    (b) Comparable facilities. The replacement system provided to an 
incumbent during an involuntary relocation must be at least equivalent 
to the existing BRS system with respect to the following three factors:
    (1) Throughput. Communications throughput is the amount of 
information transferred within a system in a given amount of time. 
System is defined as a base station and all end user units served by 
that base station. If analog facilities are being replaced with analog, 
the AWS licensee is required to provide the BRS licensee with a 
comparable number of channels. If digital facilities are being replaced 
with digital, the AWS licensee must provide the BRS licensee with 
equivalent data loading bits per second (bps). AWS licensees must 
provide BRS licensees with enough throughput to satisfy the BRS 
licensee's system use at

[[Page 388]]

the time of relocation, not match the total capacity of the BRS system.
    (2) Reliability. System reliability is the degree to which 
information is transferred accurately within a system. AWS licensees 
must provide BRS licensees with reliability equal to the overall 
reliability of their system. For digital data systems, reliability is 
measured by the percent of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a 
desired value, and for analog or digital video transmissions, it is 
measured by whether the end-to-end transmission delay is within the 
required delay bound.
    (3) Operating costs. Operating costs are the cost to operate and 
maintain the BRS system. AWS licensees must compensate BRS licensees for 
any increased recurring costs associated with the replacement facilities 
(e.g., additional rental payments, increased utility fees) for five 
years after relocation. AWS licensees may satisfy this obligation by 
making a lump-sum payment based on present value using current interest 
rates. Additionally, the maintenance costs to the BRS licensee must be 
equivalent to the replaced system in order for the replacement system to 
be considered comparable.
    (c) AWS licensees are responsible for the relocation costs of end 
user units served by the BRS base station that is being relocated. If a 
lessee is operating under a BRS license, the AWS licensee shall on the 
throughput, reliability, and operating costs of facilities in use by a 
lessee at the time of relocation in determining comparable facilities 
for involuntary relocation purposes.
    (d) Twelve-month trial period. If, within one year after the 
relocation to new facilities, the BRS licensee demonstrates that the new 
facilities are not comparable to the former facilities, the AWS licensee 
must remedy the defects or pay to relocate the BRS licensee to one of 
the following: Its former or equivalent 2 GHz channels, another 
comparable frequency band, a land-line system, or any other facility 
that satisfies the requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section. This trial period commences on the date that the BRS licensee 
begins full operation of the replacement system. If the BRS licensee has 
retained its 2 GHz authorization during the trial period, it must return 
the license to the Commission at the end of the twelve months.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1253  Sunset Provisions.

    (a) BRS licensees will maintain primary status in the 2150-2160/62 
MHz band unless and until an AWS licensee requires use of the spectrum. 
AWS licensees are not required to pay relocation costs after the 
relocation rules sunset (i.e. fifteen years from the date the first AWS 
license is issued in the band). Once the relocation rules sunset, an AWS 
licensee may require the incumbent to cease operations, provided that 
the AWS licensee intends to turn on a system within interference range 
of the incumbent, as determined by Sec. 27.1255. AWS licensee 
notification to the affected BRS licensee must be in writing and must 
provide the incumbent with no less than six months to vacate the 
spectrum. After the six-month notice period has expired, the BRS 
licensee must turn its license back into the Commission, unless the 
parties have entered into an agreement which allows the BRS licensee to 
continue to operate on a mutually agreed upon basis.
    (b) If the parties cannot agree on a schedule or an alternative 
arrangement, requests for extension will be accepted and reviewed on a 
case-by-case basis. The Commission will grant such extensions only if 
the incumbent can demonstrate that:
    (1) It cannot relocate within the six-month period (e.g., because no 
alternative spectrum or other reasonable option is available); and
    (2) The public interest would be harmed if the incumbent is forced 
to terminate operations.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1254  Eligibility.

    (a) BRS licensees with primary status in the 2150-2162 MHz band as 
of June 23, 2006, will be eligible for relocation insofar as they have 
facilities that are constructed and in use as of this date.
    (b) Future Licensing and Modifications. After June 23, 2006, all 
major modifications to existing BRS systems in use in the 2150-2160/62 
MHz band will be authorized on a secondary basis to AWS

[[Page 389]]

systems, unless the incumbent affirmatively justifies primary status and 
the incumbent BRS licensee establishes that the modification would not 
add to the relocation costs of AWS licensees. Major modifications 
include the following:
    (1) Additions of new transmit sites or base stations made after June 
23, 2006;
    (2) Changes to existing facilities made after June 23, 2006, that 
would increase the size or coverage of the service area, or interference 
potential, and that would also increase the throughput of an existing 
system (e.g., sector splits in the antenna system). Modifications to 
fully utilize the existing throughput of existing facilities (e.g., to 
add customers) will not be considered major modifications even if such 
changes increase the size or coverage of the service area, or 
interference potential.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1255  Relocation Criteria for Broadband Radio Service Licensees in the 2150-2160/62 MHz band.

    (a) An AWS licensee in the 2150-2160/62 MHz band, prior to 
initiating operations from any base or fixed station that is co-channel 
to the 2150-2160/62 MHz band, must relocate any incumbent BRS system 
that is within the line of sight of the AWS licensee's base or fixed 
station. For purposes of this section, a determination of whether an AWS 
facility is within the line of sight of a BRS system will be made as 
follows:
    (1) For a BRS system using the 2150-2160/62 MHz band exclusively to 
provide one-way transmissions to subscribers, the AWS licensee will 
determine whether there is an unobstructed signal path (line of sight) 
to the incumbent licensee's geographic service area (GSA), based on the 
following criteria: use of 9.1 meters (30 feet) for the receiving 
antenna height, use of the actual transmitting antenna height and 
terrain elevation, and assumption of 4/3 Earth radius propagation 
conditions. Terrain elevation data must be obtained from the U.S. 
Geological Survey (USGS) 3-second database. All coordinates used in 
carrying out the required analysis shall be based upon use of NAD-83.
    (2) For all other BRS systems using the 2150-2160/62 MHz band, the 
AWS licensee will determine whether there is an unobstructed signal path 
(line of sight) to the incumbent licensee's receive station hub using 
the method prescribed in ``Methods for Predicting Interference from 
Response Station Transmitters and to Response Station Hubs and for 
Supplying Data on Response Station Systems. MM Docket 97-217,'' in 
Amendment of Parts 1, 21 and 74 to Enable Multipoint Distribution 
Service and Instructional Television Fixed Service Licensees to Engage 
in Fixed Two-Way Transmissions, MM Docket No. 97-217, Report and Order 
on Further Reconsideration and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 15 
FCC Rcd 14566 at 14610, appendix D.
    (b) Any AWS licensee in the 2110-2180 MHz band that causes actual 
and demonstrable interference to a BRS licensee in the 2150-2160/62 MHz 
band must take steps to eliminate the harmful interference, up to and 
including relocation of the BRS licensee, regardless of whether it would 
be required to do so under paragraph (a), of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 27.1307  Spectrum use in the network.

    (a) Spectrum use. The shared wireless broadband network developed by 
the 700 MHz Public/Private Partnership will operate using spectrum 
associated with the Upper 700 MHz D Block license in the 758-763 MHz and 
788-793 MHz bands and the Public Safety Broadband License in the 
adjacent 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands.
    (b) Access to spectrum in the 758-763 MHz and 788-793 MHz bands. The 
Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee shall lease the spectrum rights 
associated with the Upper 700 MHz D Block license to the Operating 
Company, pursuant to the Commission's spectrum leasing rules. The 
spectrum leasing arrangement shall be a long-term de facto transfer 
leasing arrangement for the entire remaining term of the Upper 700 MHz D 
Block license. If the Upper 700 MHz D Block license is renewed, the 
parties will be required to renew this spectrum leasing arrangement as 
well.
    (c) Access to spectrum in the 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands. The 
Public Safety Broadband Licensee, which holds the Public Safety 
Broadband License pursuant to part 90 rules, must lease the spectrum

manager leasing arrangement set forth in part 1 subpart X, to the Upper 
700 MHz D Block licensee and the Operating Company for the entire 
remaining term of the Public Safety Broadband License to effectuate the 
700 MHz Public/Private Partnership. The Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee 
and the Operating Company are the only entities that are eligible to 
lease the spectrum usage rights associated with the Public Safety 
Broadband License to operate on the 763-768 and 793-798 MHz bands. If 
the Upper 700 MHz D Block license is cancelled, this spectrum leasing 
arrangement will automatically terminate.
    (d) Commercial operations in the 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands. 
Commercial operations in the 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands through 
the spectrum manager leasing arrangement shall not cause harmful 
interference to primary users (i.e., public safety users) and cannot 
claim protection from harmful interference from the primary public 
safety operations in the 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands. The network 
providing commercial operations in the 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands 
through the spectrum manager leasing arrangement must be designed to 
automatically assign priority to public safety users, to the exclusion 
and/or immediate preemption of any commercial use on a dynamic, real-
time priority basis, and to guarantee that public safety users suffer no 
harmful interference or interruption or degradation of service due to 
commercial operations in the 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1308  Organization and structure of the 700 MHz public/private partnership.

    (a) The Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee, the Network Assets Holder 
and such other related entities as the Commission may require or allow 
shall be formed by the winning bidder of the Upper 700 MHz D Block

a minimum the first 30-day period. Beginning three months from the 
triggering of the six-month negotiation period, the winning bidder for 
the Upper 700 MHz D Block license and the Public Safety Broadband 
Licensee must jointly provide detailed reports, on a monthly basis and 
subject to a request for confidential treatment, on the progress of the 
negotiations throughout the remainder of the negotiations. These reports 
must include descriptions of all material issues that the parties have 
yet to resolve.
    (d) Submission of final agreement. As soon as the parties have 
reached an agreement on all the terms of the NSA, related agreements or 
documents, and such other agreements as the Commission may require or 
allow, but not later than five business days after the six-month period 
for negotiation has expired, they must submit the NSA together with all 
agreements and related documents referenced in the NSA, for review and 
approval by the full Commission. The Commission will act on the NSA 
within 60 days of receipt. The Commission may approve the NSA in its 
entirety, approve with modifications, or require the parties to address 
additional terms or re-draft existing terms within a specified 
timeframe. After the NSA is approved, the parties must execute the NSA 
and such other agreements as the Commission may require or allow, and 
submit executed copies to the Commission within 10 business days of 
approval.
    (e) Submission of disputed issues. If the parties have not reached 
agreement on all terms of the NSA and related agreements by the end of 
the six-month period, they must notify the Commission not later than 
five business days after the expiration of the six-month period of the 
terms on which they have agreed, the nature of the remaining issues, 
each party's position on each issue, whether additional negotiation is 
likely to produce an agreement, and, if so, a proposed deadline for 
reaching agreement on the NSA. Authority is delegated jointly to the 
Chiefs of the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and the Public Safety 
and Homeland Security Bureau to resolve any remaining disputes.
    (f) Resolution of disputes. Actions to resolve disputes may include, 
but are not limited to:
    (1) Granting additional time for negotiation;
    (2) Issuing a decision on the disputed issues and requiring the 
submission of a draft agreement consistent with the decision;
    (3) Directing the parties to further brief the remaining issues in 
full for immediate Commission decision; and/or
    (4) Immediate denial of the long-form application filed by the 
winning bidder for the Upper 700 MHz D Block license.
    (g) Default by winning bidder for Upper 700 MHz D Block license. If 
the winning bidder for the Upper 700 MHz D Block fails to comply with 
negotiation or dispute resolution requirements or fails to execute a 
Commission-approved NSA, its long form application will be denied. If 
the long form application of the winning bidder of the Upper 700 MHz D 
Block license is denied for any reason, including as a consequence of an 
action taken pursuant to paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, it will 
be deemed to have defaulted under Sec. 1.2109(c) of this

[[Page 394]]

chapter, and will be liable for the default payment specified in Sec. 
1.2104(g) of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1320  Failure to comply with the NSA or the Commission's rules.

    (a) Failure to comply with the Commission's rules or the terms of 
the NSA may warrant cancelling the Upper 700 MHz D Block license and 
awarding it to a new licensee. In the event the Upper 700 MHz D Block 
license is cancelled, the Commission shall issue an order cancelling the 
license and announcing the process for awarding rights to the spectrum 
to a new licensee. Pending the award to a new licensee, the Commission 
shall issue the Operating Company a special temporary authority to 
prevent interruption of services provided over the Shared Wireless 
Broadband Network. The Operating Company must continue to provide both 
commercial service and services to public safety during the transition. 
Upon grant of a new license, the Commission shall establish the terms 
and timing under which the special temporary authorization shall be 
cancelled and the new Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee assumes the 
construction and operation of the network.
    (b) If the Commission cancels or terminates the Upper 700 MHz D 
Block license, a fair market valuation of the shared wireless broadband 
network assets shall be performed immediately, pursuant to the fair 
market valuation methodology set forth in the NSA. In the event that the 
Upper 700 MHz D Block license is awarded to a new entity, the Public 
Safety Broadband Licensee's option to purchase the network and all 
network assets if and whenever the Upper 700 MHz D Block license is 
cancelled or terminated and its right of first refusal to purchase the 
network assets if and whenever such assets are otherwise to be sold 
shall be assigned to the new Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee and the new 
Network Assets Holder.


<R05>
Sec. 27.1325  Resolution of disputes after grant of the upper 700 MHz D block license.

    (a) The Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee, the Operating Company, the 
Network Assets Holder and the Public Safety Broadband Licensee may at 
any time bring a complaint to the Commission based on a claim that 
another party to the NSA has deviated from the terms of the NSA, or a 
petition for a declaratory ruling to resolve the proper interpretation 
of an NSA term or provision. The Commission also may at any time, on its 
own motion, determine to address any material breach or interpret any 
NSA term or provision.
    (b) The Commission shall have primary responsibility and 
jurisdiction for adjudicating disputes that arise following execution of 
the NSA. The Commission may, however, require the parties to first seek 
a settlement to the dispute or authorize the parties to resolve the 
dispute through litigation or other means. Breach of license terms, the 
NSA, or the Commission's rules may result in cancellation of the Upper 
700 MHz D Block license, the Public Safety Broadband License, or both.
    (c) The Chiefs of the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau and 
the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau are delegated joint 
responsibility for adjudicating disputes.

<R05>
Sec. 27.1330  Local public safety build-out and operation.

    (a) The Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee and the Operating Company 
through its lease arrangements shall, except in the two limited 
circumstances set forth herein, have the exclusive right to build and 
operate the Shared Wireless Broadband Network.
    (b) Rights to early build-out in areas with a build-out commitment. 
In an area where the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee has committed, in 
the NSA, to build out by a certain date, a public safety entity may, 
with the pre-approval of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and 
subject to the requirements set forth herein, construct a broadband 
network in that area at its

[[Page 395]]

own expense so long as the network is capable of operating on the Shared 
Wireless Broadband Network and meets all the requirements and 
specifications of the network required under the NSA.
    (1) Options for early build-out in areas with a build-out 
commitment. In order to obtain authorization to construct a broadband 
network as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the requesting 
public safety entity must agree to one of the following:
    (i) To, on its own, or through the Public Safety Broadband Licensee 
acting on its behalf, construct the network at its own expense, and upon 
completion of construction transfer the network to the Upper 700 MHz D 
Block licensee, which shall then integrate that network into the Shared 
Wireless Broadband Network constructed pursuant to the NSA; or
    (ii) To, in agreement with the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee, 
provide all funds necessary for the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee to 
complete the early construction of the network, including any and all 
additional resource and personnel costs, allowing the Upper 700 MHz D 
Block licensee at all times to own, operate, and manage the network as 
an integrated part of the Shared Wireless Broadband Network.
    (2) Negotiation of amendment to NSA. Under either early build out 
option set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Public Safety 
Broadband Licensee, the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee, and the public 
safety entity must, prior to any construction, negotiate an amendment to 
the NSA regarding this part of the network, specifying ownership rights, 
fees, and other terms, which may be distinct from the analogous terms 
governing the Shared Wireless Broadband Network, and such amendment must 
be approved by the Commission.
    (i) Such amendment must provide the terms under which the Upper 700 
MHz D Block licensee shall receive full ownership rights and shall 
compensate the public safety entity (or the Public Safety Broadband 
Licensee, where appropriate) for the construction of the network; and 
shall, absent agreement to the contrary, provide for such transfer and 
compensation to occur prior to the scheduled build out date for such 
network in the NSA.
    (ii) Any right to compensation from the Upper 700 MHz D Block 
licensee related to such early build-out shall be limited to the cost 
that would have been incurred had the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee 
constructed the network itself in accordance with the original terms and 
specifications of the NSA, as reasonably determined by the parties and 
negotiated as part of the NSA amendment required in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section. Such costs shall not include costs attributable solely to 
advancing the date of construction or otherwise expediting the 
construction process.
    (3) Operations. The public safety entity may not commence operations 
on the network until ownership of the network has been transferred to 
the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee. Further, no operations shall be 
allowed except those authorized and conducted pursuant to the authority 
of the Public Safety Broadband License.
    (4) Attribution of early build-out to national benchmarks. Upon 
completion of construction, transfer of ownership to the Upper 700 MHz D 
Block licensee, and compensation as required herein, if applicable, the 
Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee may include the network constructed 
pursuant to the early build-out provisions herein for purposes of 
determining whether it has met its national build-out benchmarks and the 
build-out requirements of the NSA.
    (5) Rights to build out and operate in areas without a build-out 
commitment. In areas for which the NSA does not require the Upper 700 
MHz D Block licensee to build out the Shared Wireless Broadband Network, 
a public safety entity may build out and operate a separate, exclusive 
network in the 700 MHz public safety broadband spectrum at any time, 
provided the public safety entity has received the written approval of 
the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and operates its independent 
network pursuant to a spectrum leasing arrangement into which the public 
safety entity has entered with the Public Safety Broadband Licensee.
    (i) Such leasing arrangement shall not require the approval or 
consent of the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee;

[[Page 396]]

however, the Public Safety Broadband Licensee must provide the Upper 700 
MHz D Block licensee with notice of the public safety entity's intent to 
construct in that area within 30 days of receipt of a request from a 
public safety entity seeking to exercise this option, and shall inform 
the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee of the public safety entity's 
anticipated build-out date(s).
    (ii) Should the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee, within 30 calendar 
days from receipt of notice of the public safety entity's intent to 
construct in that area, certify in writing to the Public Safety 
Broadband Licensee that it will build out the shared network in the area 
within a reasonable time of the anticipated build-out date(s), as 
determined by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, the Public Safety 
Broadband Licensee shall not allow the public safety entity to build and 
operate its own separate exclusive network in that area, provided that 
the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee and the Public Safety Broadband 
Licensee execute an amendment to the NSA indicating the Upper 700 MHz D 
Block licensee's commitment to build the network in that area. Such 
commitment shall become enforceable against the Upper 700 MHz D Block 
licensee as part of its overall build-out requirements.
    (iii) If the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee does not exercise its 
option to commit to build out the network in the requested area within 
30 calendar days of receipt of notice of the public safety entity's 
intent to construct in such area, the Public Safety Broadband Licensee 
and the public safety entity may proceed with a spectrum leasing 
arrangement, which must be filed with the Commission prior to the public 
safety entity commencing any operations. The spectrum leasing 
arrangement must take the form of a spectrum manager leasing arrangement 
under the rules specified in Sec. 1.9020 of this chapter, and 
incorporate the following conditions:
    (A) The network must provide broadband operations;
    (B) The network must be fully interoperable with the Shared Wireless 
Broadband Network;
    (C) The network must be available for use by any public safety 
entity in the area;
    (D) The network must satisfy any other terms or conditions required 
by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee; and
    (E) The public safety entity must construct and place into operation 
its network within one year of the effective date of the spectrum 
manager leasing arrangement. If the public safety entity fails to place 
the network into operation within one year, the Public Safety Broadband 
Licensee shall terminate the spectrum leasing arrangement pursuant to 
Sec. 1.9020(h)(3) of this chapter. The public safety entity may also 
seek extended implementation authority from the Commission pursuant to 
the requirements of Sec. 90.629 of this chapter.
    (6) Except as set forth herein, the separate network is not required 
to meet the other specifications of the Shared Wireless Broadband 
Network. Absent agreement of the public safety entity, the Public Safety 
Broadband Licensee, and the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee, the separate 
network may not operate using any spectrum associated with the Upper 700 
MHz D Block license.
    (7) The Public Safety Broadband Licensee must file with the 
Commission any spectrum manager leasing arrangement as specified in 
Sec. 1.9020(e) of this chapter; such filing shall identify the public 
safety entity leasing the spectrum, the particular areas of spectrum 
leased as part of this build-out option, and the specific network 
infrastructure and equipment deployed on such leased spectrum.

                            Subpart A_Preface


<R05>
Sec. 32.1  Background.

    The revised Uniform System of Accounts (USOA) is a historical 
financial accounting system which reports the results of operational and 
financial events in a manner which enables both management and 
regulators to assess these results within a specified accounting period. 
The USOA also provides the financial community and others with financial 
performance results. In order for an accounting system to fulfill these 
purposes, it must exhibit consistency and stability in financial 
reporting (including the results published for regulatory purposes). 
Accordingly, the USOA has been designed to reflect stable, recurring 
financial data based to the extent regulatory considerations permit upon 
the consistency of the well established body of accounting theories and 
principles commonly referred to as generally accepted accounting 
principles.


<R05>
Sec. 32.2  Basis of the accounts.

    (a) The financial accounts of a company are used to record, in 
monetary terms, the basic transactions which occur. Certain natural 
groupings of these transactions are called (in different contexts) 
transaction cycles, business processes, functions or activities. The 
concept, however, is the same in each case; i.e., the natural groupings 
represent what happens within the company on a consistent and continuing 
basis. This repetitive nature of the natural groupings, over long 
periods of time, lends an element of stability to the financial account 
structure.
    (b) Within the telecommunications industry companies, certain 
recurring functions (natural groupings) do take place in the course of 
providing products and services to customers. These accounts reflect, to 
the extent feasible, those functions. For example, the primary bases of 
the accounts containing the investment in telecommunications plant are 
the functions performed by the assets. In addition, because of the 
anticipated effects of future innovations,

[[Page 400]]

the telecommunications plant accounts are intended to permit 
technological distinctions. Similarly, the primary bases of plant 
operations, customer operations and corporate operations expense 
accounts are the functions performed by individuals. The revenue 
accounts, on the other hand, reflect a market perspective of natural 
groupings based primarily upon the products and services purchased by 
customers.
    (c) In the course of developing the bases for this account 
structure, several other alternatives were explored. It was, for 
example, determined that, because of the variety and continual changing 
of various cost allocation mechanisms, the financial accounts of a 
company should not reflect an a priori allocation of revenues, 
investments or expenses to products or services, jurisdictions or 
organizational structures. (Note also Sec. 32.14 (c) and (d) of subpart 
B.) It was also determined that costs (in the case of assets) should not 
be recorded based solely upon physical attributes such as location, 
description or size.
    (d) Care has been taken in this account structure to avoid confusing 
a function with an organizational responsibility, particularly as it 
relates to the expense accounts. Whereas in the past, specific 
organizations may have performed specific functions, the future 
environment with its increasing mechanization and other changes will 
result in entirely new or restructured organizations. Thus, any 
relationships drawn between organizations and accounts would become 
increasingly meaningless with the passage of time.
    (e) These accounts, then, are intended to reflect a functional and 
technological view of the telecommunications industry. This view will 
provide a stable and consistent foundation for the recording of 
financial data.
    (f) The financial data contained in the accounts, together with the 
detailed information contained in the underlying financial and other 
subsidiary records required by this Commission, will provide the 
information necessary to support separations, cost of service and 
management reporting requirements. The basic account structure has been 
designed to remain stable as reporting requirements change.


<R05>
Sec. 32.3  Authority.

    This Uniform System of Accounts has been prepared under the 
following authority: Section 4 of the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended, 47 U.S.C. section 154 (1984); sections 219, 220 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. sections 219, 220, 
(1984).


<R05>
Sec. 32.4  Communications Act.

    Attention is directed to the following extract from section 220 of 
the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. 220 (1984):

    (e) Any person who shall willfully make any false entry in the 
accounts of any book of accounts or in any record or memoranda kept by 
any such carrier, or who shall willfully destroy, mutilate, alter, or by 
any other means or device falsify any such account, record, or 
memoranda, or who shall willfully neglect or fail to make full, true, 
and correct entries in such accounts, records, or memoranda of all facts 
and transactions appertaining to the business of the carrier, shall be 
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be subject, upon conviction, 
to a fine of not less than $1,000 nor more than $5,000 or imprisonment 
for a term of not less than one year nor more than three years, or both 
such fine and imprisonment: Provided, that the Commission may in its 
discretion issue orders specifying such operating, accounting or 
financial papers, records, books, blanks, or documents which may, after 
a reasonable time, be destroyed, and prescribing the length of time such 
books, papers, or documents shall be preserved.


For regulations governing the periods for which records are to be 
retained, see part 42, Preservation of Records of Communications Common 
Carriers, of this chapter which relates to preservation of records.


<R04>
                     Subpart B_General Instructions


<R05>
Sec. 32.11  Classification of companies.

    (a) For purposes of this section, the term ``company'' or 
``companies'' means incumbent local exchange carrier(s) as defined in 
section 251(h) of the Communications Act, and any other carriers that 
the Commission designates by Order. Incumbent local

[[Page 401]]

exchange carriers' successor or assign companies, as defined in section 
251(h)(1)(B)(ii) of the Communications Act, that are found to be non-
dominant by the Commission, will not be subject to this Uniform System 
of Accounts.
    (b) For accounting purposes, companies are divided into classes as 
follows:
    (1) Class A. Companies having annual revenues from regulated 
telecommunications operations that are equal to or above the indexed 
revenue threshold.
    (2) Class B. Companies having annual revenues from regulated 
telecommunications operations that are less than the indexed revenue 
threshold.
    (c) Class A companies, except mid-sized incumbent local exchange 
carriers, as defined by Sec. 32.9000, shall keep all the accounts of 
this system of accounts which are applicable to their affairs and are 
designated as Class A accounts. Class A companies, which include mid-
sized incumbent local exchange carriers, shall keep Basic Property 
Records in compliance with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 32.2000(e) and 
(f).
    (d) Class B companies and mid-sized incumbent local exchange 
carriers, as defined by Sec. 32.9000, shall keep all accounts of this 
system of accounts which are applicable to their affairs and are 
designated as Class B accounts. Mid-sized incumbent local exchange 
carriers shall also maintain subsidiary record categories necessary to 
provide the pole attachment data currently provided in the Class A 
accounts. Class B companies shall keep Continuing Property Records in 
compliance with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 32.2000(e)(7)(i)(A) and 
32.2000(f).
    (e) Class B companies and mid-sized incumbent local exchange 
carriers, as defined by Sec. 32.9000 of this part, that desire more 
detailed accounting may adopt the accounts prescribed for Class A 
companies upon the submission of a written notification to the 
Commission.
    (f) The classification of a company shall be determined at the start 
of the calendar year following the first time its annual operating 
revenue from regulated telecommunications operations equals, exceeds, or 
falls below the indexed revenue threshold.

[67 FR 5679, Feb. 6, 2002, as amended at 69 FR 53648, Sept. 2, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 32.12  Records.

    (a) The company's financial records shall be kept in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles to the extent permitted by this 
system of accounts.
    (b) The company's financial records shall be kept with sufficient 
particularity to show fully the facts pertaining to all entries in these 
accounts. The detail records shall be filed in such manner as to be 
readily accessible for examination by representatives of this 
Commission.
    (c) The Commission shall require a company to maintain financial and 
other subsidiary records in such a manner that specific information, of 
a type not warranting disclosure as an account or subaccount, will be 
readily available. When this occurs, or where the full information is 
not otherwise recorded in the general books, the subsidiary records 
shall be maintained in sufficient detail to facilitate the reporting of 
the required specific information. The subsidiary records, in which the 
full details are shown, shall be sufficiently referenced to permit ready 
identification and examination by representatives of this Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 32.13  Accounts--general.

    (a) As a general rule, all accounts kept by reporting companies 
shall conform in numbers and titles to those prescribed herein. However, 
reporting companies may use different numbers for internal purposes when 
separate accounts (or subaccounts) maintained are consistent with the 
title and content of accounts and subaccounts prescribed in this system.
    (1) A company may subdivide any of the accounts prescribed. The 
titles of all such subaccounts shall refer by number or title to the 
controlling account.
    (2) A company may establish temporary or experimental accounts 
without prior notice to the Commission.
    (b) Exercise of the preceding options shall be allowed only if the 
integrity of the prescribed accounts is not impaired.
    (c) As of the date a company becomes subject to the system of 
accounts, the company is authorized to make any such subdivisions, 
reclassifications or

[[Page 402]]

consolidations of existing balances as are necessary to meet the 
requirements of this system of accounts.
    (d) Nothing contained in this part shall prohibit or excuse any 
company, receiver, or operating trustee of any carrier from subdividing 
the accounts hereby prescribed for the purpose of:
    (1) Complying with the requirements of the state commission(s) 
having jurisdiction; or
    (2) Securing the information required in the prescribed reports to 
such commission(s).
    (e) Where the use of subsidiary records is considered necessary in 
order to secure the information required in reports to any state 
commission, the company shall incorporate the following controls into 
their accounting system with respect to such subsidiary records:
    (1) Subsidiary records shall be reconciled to the company's general 
ledger or books of original entry, as appropriate.
    (2) The company shall adequately document the accounting procedures 
related to subsidiary records.
    (3) The subsidiary records shall be maintained at an adequate level 
of detail to satisfy state regulators.

FR 5679, Feb. 6, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 32.14  Regulated accounts.

    (a) In the context of this part, the regulated accounts shall be 
interpreted to include the investments, revenues and expenses associated 
with those telecommunications products and services to which the tariff 
filing requirements contained in Title II of the Communications Act of 
1934, as amended, are applied, except as may be otherwise provided by 
the Commission. Regulated telecommunications products and services are 
thereby fully subject to the accounting requirements as specified in 
Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and as detailed 
in subparts A through F of this part of the Commission's Rules and 
Regulations.
    (b) In addition to those amounts considered to be regulated by the 
provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, those telecommunications 
products and services to which the tariff filing requirements of the 
several state jurisdictions are applied shall be accounted for as 
regulated, except where such treatment is proscribed or otherwise 
excluded from the requirements pertaining to regulated 
telecommunications products and services by this Commission.
    (c) In the application of detailed accounting requirements contained 
in this part, when a regulated activity involves the common or joint use 
of assets and resources in the provision of regulated and nonregulated 
products and services, companies shall account for these activities 
within the accounts prescribed in this system for telephone company 
operations. Assets and expenses shall be subdivided in subsidiary 
records among amounts solely assignable to nonregulated activities, 
amounts solely assignable to regulated activities, and amounts related 
to assets used and expenses incurred jointly or in common, which will be 
allocated between regulated and nonregulated activities. Companies shall 
submit reports identifying regulated and nonregulated amounts in the 
manner and at the times prescribed by this Commission. Nonregulated 
revenue items not qualifying for incidental treatment, as provided in 
Sec. 32.4999(l), shall be recorded in Account 5280, Nonregulated 
operating revenue.
    (d) Other income items which are incidental to the provision of 
regulated products and services shall be accounted for as regulated 
activities.
    (e) All costs and revenues related to the offering of regulated 
products and services which result from arrangements for joint 
participation or apportionment between two or more telephone companies 
(e.g., joint operating agreements, settlement agreements, cost-pooling 
agreements) shall be recorded within the detailed accounts. Under joint 
operating agreements, the creditor will initially charge the entire 
expenses to the appropriate primary accounts. The proportion of such 
expenses borne by the debtor shall be credited by the creditor and 
charged by the debtor to the account initially charged. Any allowances 
for return on property used will be accounted for as

[[Page 403]]

provided in Account 5200, Miscellaneous revenue.
    (f) All items of nonregulated revenue, investment and expense that 
are not properly includible in the detailed, regulated accounts 
prescribed in subparts A through F of this part, as determined by 
paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section shall be accounted for and 
included in reports to this Commission as specified in Sec. 32.23 of 
this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 32.16  Changes in accounting standards.

    (a) The company's records and accounts shall be adjusted to apply 
new accounting standards prescribed by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board or successor authoritative accounting standard-setting 
groups, in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting 
principles. The change in an accounting standard will automatically take 
effect 90 days after the company informs this Commission of its 
intention to follow the new standard, unless the Commission notifies the 
company to the contrary. Any change adopted shall be disclosed in annual 
reports required by Sec. 43.21(f) of this chapter in the year of 
adoption.
    (b) The changes in accounting standards which this Commission 
approves will not necessarily be binding on the ratemaking practices of 
the various state commissions.

Sec. 32.18  Waivers.

    A waiver from any provision of this system of accounts shall be made 
by the Federal Communications Commission upon its own initiative or upon 
the submission of written request therefor from any telecommunications 
company, or group of telecommunications companies, provided that such a 
waiver is in the public interest and each request for waiver expressly 
demonstrates that: existing peculiarities or unusual circumstances 
warrant a departure from a prescribed procedure or technique; a 
specifically defined alternative procedure or technique will result in a 
substantially equivalent or more accurate portrayal of operating results 
or financial condition, consistent with the principles embodied in the 
provisions of this system of accounts; and the application of such 
alternative procedure will maintain or improve uniformity in substantive 
results as among telecommunications companies.


<R05>
Sec. 32.19  Address for reports and correspondence.

    Reports, statements, and correspondence submitted to the Federal 
Communications Commission in accordance with or relating to instructions

Sec. 32.21  Sequence of accounts.

    The order in which the accounts are presented in this system of 
accounts is not to be considered as necessarily indicative of the order 
in which they will be scheduled at all times in reports to this 
Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 32.22  Comprehensive interperiod tax allocation.

    (a) Companies shall apply interperiod tax allocation (tax 
normalization) to all book/tax temporary differences which would be 
considered material for published financial report purposes. 
Furthermore, companies shall also apply interperiod tax allocation if 
any item or group of similar items when aggregated would yield debit or 
credit entries which exceed or would exceed 5 percent of the gross 
deferred income tax expense debits or credits during any calendar year 
over the life of the temporary difference. The tax effects of book/tax 
temporary differences shall be normalized and the deferrals shall be 
included in the following accounts:

4100, Net Current Deferred Operating Income Taxes;
4110, Net Current Deferred Nonoperating Income Taxes;
4340, Net Noncurrent Deferred Operating Income Taxes;
4350, Net Noncurrent Deferred Nonoperating Income Taxes.

    In lieu of the accounting prescribed herein, any company shall treat 
the increase or reduction in current income taxes payable resulting from 
the use of flow through accounting in prior years as an increase or 
reduction in current tax expense.
    (b) Supporting documentation shall be maintained so as to separately 
identify the amount of deferred taxes which arise from the use of an 
accelerated method of depreciation.
    (c) Subsidiary records shall be used to reduce the deferred tax 
assets contained in the accounts specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section when it is likely that some portion or all of the deferred tax 
asset will not be realized. The amount recorded in the subsidiary record 
should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that 
is likely to be realized.
    (d) The records supporting the activity in the deferred income tax 
accounts shall be maintained in sufficient detail to identify the nature 
of the specific temporary differences giving rise to both the debits and 
credits to the individual accounts.
    (e) Any company that uses accelerated depreciation (or recognizes 
taxable income or losses upon the retirement of property) for income tax 
purposes shall normalize the tax differentials occasioned thereby as 
indicated in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.
    (1) With respect to the retirement of property the book/tax 
difference between (i) the recognition of proceeds as income and the 
accrual for salvage value and (ii) the book and tax capital recovery, 
shall be normalized.
    (2) Records shall be maintained so as to show the deferred tax 
amounts by vintage year separately for each class or subclass of 
eligible depreciable telephone plant for which an accelerated method of 
depreciation has been used for income tax purposes. When property is 
transferred to nonregulated activities, the associated deferred income 
taxes and unamortized investment tax credits shall also be identified 
and transferred to the appropriate nonregulated accounts.
    (f) The tax differentials to be normalized as specified in this 
section shall also encompass the additional effect of state and local 
income tax changes on Federal income taxes produced by the provision for 
deferred state and local income taxes for book/tax temporary differences 
related to such income taxes.
    (g) Companies that receive the tax benefits from the filing of a 
consolidated income tax return by the parent company, (pursuant to 
closing agreements with the Internal Revenue Service, effective January 
1, 1966) representing the deferred income taxes from the elimination of 
intercompany profits for income tax purposes on sales of regulated 
equipment, may credit such deferred taxes directly to the plant account 
which contains such intercompany profit rather than crediting such 
deferred taxes to the applicable accounts in paragraph (a) of this 
section. If the deferred income taxes

[[Page 405]]

are recorded as a reduction of the appropriate plant accounts, such 
reduction shall be treated as reducing the original cost of the plant 
and accounted for as such.

Sec. 32.23  Nonregulated activities.

    (a) This section describes the accounting treatment of activities 
classified for accounting purposes as ``nonregulated.'' Preemptively 
deregulated activities and activities (other than incidental activities) 
never subject to regulation will be classified for accounting purposes 
as ``nonregulated.'' Activities that qualify for incidental treatment 
under the policies of this Commission will be classified for accounting 
purposes as regulated activities. Activities that have been deregulated 
by a state will be classified for accounting purposes as regulated 
activities. Activities that have been deregulated at the interstate 
level, but not preemptively deregulated, will be classified for 
accounting purposes as regulated activities until such time as this 
Commission decides otherwise. The treatment of nonregulated activities 
shall differ depending on the extent of the common or joint use of 
assets and resources in the provision of both regulated and nonregulated 
products and services.
    (b) When a nonregulated activity does not involve the joint or 
common use of assets and resources in the provision of both regulated 
and nonregulated products and services, carriers shall account for these 
activities on a separate set of books consistent with instructions set 
forth in Sec. Sec. 32.1406 and 32.7990. Transfers of assets, and sales 
of products and services between the regulated activity and a 
nonregulated activity for which a separate set of books is maintained, 
shall be accounted for in accordance with the rules presented in Sec. 
32.27, Transactions with Affiliates. In the separate set of books, 
carriers may establish whatever detail they deem appropriate beyond what 
is necessary to provide this Commission with the information required in 
Sec. Sec. 32.1406 and 32.7990.
    (c) When a nonregulated activity does involve the joint or common 
use of assets and resources in the provision of regulated and 
nonregulated products and services, carriers shall account for these 
activities within accounts prescribed in this system for telephone 
company operations. Assets and expenses shall be subdivided in 
subsidiary records among amounts solely assignable to nonregulated 
activities, amounts solely assignable to regulated activities, and 
amounts related to assets and expenses incurred jointly or in common, 
which will be allocated between regulated and nonregulated activities. 
Carriers shall submit reports identifying regulated and nonregulated 
amounts in the manner and at the times prescribed by this Commission. 
Nonregulated revenue items not qualifying for incidental treatment as 
provided in Sec. 32.4999(l) of this part, shall be recorded in separate 
subsidiary record categories of Account 5280, Nonregulated operating 
revenue. Amounts assigned or allocated to regulated products or services 
shall be subject to part 36 of this chapter.

Sec. 32.24  Compensated absences.

    (a) Companies shall record a liability and charge the appropriate 
expense accounts for compensated absences (vacations, sick leave, etc.) 
in the year in which these benefits are earned by employees.
    (b) With respect to the liability that exists for compensated 
absences which is not yet recorded on the books as of the effective date 
of this part, the liability shall be recorded in Account 4130. Other 
current liabilities, with a corresponding entry to Account 1438, 
Deferred maintenance, retirements and other deferred charges. This 
deferred charge shall be amortized on a straight-line basis over a 
period of ten years.
    (c) Records shall be maintained so as to show that no more than ten 
percent of the deferred charge is being amortized each year.

    Extraordinary items, prior period adjustments, and contingent

prior Commission approval.

<R05>
Sec. 32.26  Materiality.

    Companies shall follow this system of accounts in recording all 
financial and statistical data irrespective of an individual item's 
materiality under GAAP, unless a waiver has been granted under the 
provisions of Sec. 32.18 of this subpart to do otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 32.27  Transactions with affiliates.

    (a) Unless otherwise approved by the Chief, Wireline Competition 
Bureau, transactions with affiliates involving asset transfers into or 
out of the regulated accounts shall be recorded by the carrier in its 
regulated accounts as provided in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this 
section.
    (b) Assets sold or transferred between a carrier and its affiliate 
pursuant to a tariff, including a tariff filed with a state commission, 
shall be recorded in the appropriate revenue accounts at the tariffed 
rate. Non-tariffed assets sold or transferred between a carrier and its 
affiliate that qualify for prevailing price valuation, as defined in 
paragraph (d) of this section, shall be recorded at the prevailing 
price. For all other assets sold by or transferred from a carrier to its 
affiliate, the assets shall be recorded at no less than the higher of 
fair market value and net book cost. For all other assets sold by or 
transferred to a carrier from its affiliate, the assets shall be 
recorded at no more than the lower of fair market value and net book 
cost.
    (1) Floor. When assets are sold by or transferred from a carrier to 
an affiliate, the higher of fair market value and net book cost 
establishes a floor, below which the transaction cannot be recorded. 
Carriers may record the transaction at an amount equal to or greater 
than the floor, so long as that action complies with the Communications 
Act of 1934, as amended, Commission rules and orders, and is not 
otherwise anti-competitive.
    (2) Ceiling. When assets are purchased from or transferred from an 
affiliate to a carrier, the lower of fair market value and net book cost 
establishes a ceiling, above which the transaction cannot be recorded. 
Carriers may record the transaction at an amount equal to or less than 
the ceiling, so long as that action complies with the Communications Act 
of 1934, as amended, Commission rules and orders, and is not otherwise 
anti-competitive.
    (3) Threshold. For purposes of this section carriers are required to 
make a good faith determination of fair market value for an asset when 
the total aggregate annual value of the asset(s) reaches or exceeds 
$500,000, per affiliate. When a carrier reaches or exceeds the $500,000 
threshold for a particular asset for the first time, the carrier must 
perform the market valuation and value the transaction on a going-
forward basis in accordance with the affiliate transactions rules on a 
going-forward basis. When the total aggregate annual value of the 
asset(s) does not reach or exceed $500,000, the asset(s) shall be 
recorded at net book cost.
    (c) Services provided between a carrier and its affiliate pursuant 
to a tariff, including a tariff filed with a state commission, shall be 
recorded in the appropriate revenue accounts at the tariffed rate. Non-
tariffed services provided between a carrier and its affiliate pursuant 
to publicly-filed agreements submitted to a state commission pursuant to 
section 252(e) of the Communications Act of 1934 or statements of 
generally available terms pursuant to section 252(f) shall be recorded 
using the charges appearing in such publicly-filed agreements or 
statements. Non-tariffed services provided between a carrier and its 
affiliate that qualify for prevailing price valuation, as defined in 
paragraph (d) of this section, shall be recorded at the prevailing 
price. For all other services sold by or transferred from a carrier to 
its affiliate, the services shall be recorded at no less than the higher 
of fair market value and fully distributed cost. For all other services 
sold by or transferred to a carrier from its affiliate, the services 
shall

[[Page 407]]

be recorded at no more than the lower of fair market value and fully 
distributed cost.
    (1) Floor. When services are sold by or transferred from a carrier 
to an affiliate, the higher of fair market value and fully distributed 
cost establishes a floor, below which the transaction cannot be 
recorded. Carriers may record the transaction at an amount equal to or 
greater than the floor, so long as that action complies with the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, Commission rules and orders, and 
is not otherwise anti-competitive.
    (2) Ceiling. When services are purchased from or transferred from an 
affiliate to a carrier, the lower of fair market value and fully 
distributed cost establishes a ceiling, above which the transaction 
cannot be recorded. Carriers may record the transaction at an amount 
equal to or less than the ceiling, so long as that action complies with 
the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, Commission rules and orders, 
and is not otherwise anti-competitive.
    (3) Threshold. For purposes of this section, carriers are required 
to make a good faith determination of fair market value for a service 
when the total aggregate annual value of that service reaches or exceeds 
$500,000, per affiliate. When a carrier reaches or exceeds the $500,000 
threshold for a particular service for the first time, the carrier must 
perform the market valuation and value the transaction in accordance 
with the affiliate transactions rules on a going-forward basis. All 
services received by a carrier from its affiliate(s) that exist solely 
to provide services to members of the carrier's corporate family shall 
be recorded at fully distributed cost.
    (d) In order to qualify for prevailing price valuation in paragraphs 
(b) and (c) of this section, sales of a particular asset or service to 
third parties must encompass greater than 25 percent of the total 
quantity of such product or service sold by an entity. Carriers shall 
apply this 25 percent threshold on an asset-by-asset and service-by-
service basis, rather than on a product-line or service-line basis. In 
the case of transactions for assets and services subject to section 272, 
a BOC may record such transactions at prevailing price regardless of 
whether the 25 percent threshold has been satisfied.
    (e) Income taxes shall be allocated among the regulated activities 
of the carrier, its nonregulated divisions, and members of an affiliated 
group. Under circumstances in which income taxes are determined on a 
consolidated basis by the carrier and other members of the affiliated 
group, the income tax expense to be recorded by the carrier shall be the 
same as would result if determined for the carrier separately for all 
time periods, except that the tax effect of carry-back and carry-forward 
operating losses, investment tax credits, or other tax credits generated 
by operations of the carrier shall be recorded by the carrier during the 
period in which applied in settlement of the taxes otherwise 
attributable to any member, or combination of members, of the affiliated 
group.
    (f) Companies that employ average schedules in lieu of actual costs 
are exempt from the provisions of this section. For other organizations, 
the principles set forth in this section shall apply equally to 
corporations, proprietorships, partnerships and other forms of business 
organizations.

Sec. 32.1500  Other jurisdictional assets--net.

    This account shall include the cumulative impact on assets of 
jurisdictional ratemaking practices which vary from those of this 
Commission. All entries recorded in this account shall be recorded net 
of any applicable income tax effects and shall be supported by 
subsidiary records where necessary as provided for in Sec. 32.13(e) of 
subpart B.


<R05>
Sec. 32.2000  Instructions for telecommunications plant accounts.

    (a) Purpose of telecommunications plant accounts. (1) The 
telecommunications plant accounts (2001 to 2007 inclusive) are designed 
to show the investment in the company's tangible and intangible 
telecommunications plant which ordinarily has a service life of more 
than one year, including such plant whether used by the company or 
others in providing telecommunications service.
    (2) The telecommunications plant accounts shall not include the cost 
or other value of telecommunications plant contributed to the company. 
Contributions in the form of money or its equivalent toward the 
construction of telecommunications plant shall be credited to the 
accounts charged with the cost of such construction. Amounts of non-
recurring reimbursements based on the cost of plant or equipment 
furnished in rendering service to a customer shall be credited to the 
accounts charged with the cost of the plant or equipment. Amounts 
received for construction which are ultimately to be repaid wholly or in 
part, shall be credited to Account 4300, Other long-term liabilities and 
deferred credits; when final determination has been made as to the 
amount to be returned, any unrefunded amounts shall be credited to the 
accounts charged with the cost of such construction. Amounts received 
for the construction of plant, the ownership of which rests with or will 
revert to others, shall be credited to the accounts charged with the 
cost of such construction. (Note also Account 7100, Other operating 
income and expense.)
    (3) When telecommunications plant ordinarily having a service life 
of more than one year is installed for temporary use in providing 
telecommunications service, it shall be accounted for in the same manner 
as plant having a service life of more than one year. This includes 
temporary installations of plant (such as poles, wire and cable) 
installed to maintain service during the progress of highway 
reconstruction or during interruptions due to storms or other 
casualties, equipment used for the training of operators, equipment used 
to provide intercepting positions in central offices to handle traffic 
for a short period following extensive system changes and similar 
installations of property used to provide telecommunications service.
    (4) The cost of the individual items of equipment, classifiable to 
Accounts 2112, Motor vehicles; 2113, Aircraft; 2114, Tools and other 
work equipment; 2122, Furniture; 2123, Office equipment; 2124, General 
purpose computers, costing $2,000 or less or having a life of less than 
one year shall be charged to the applicable expense accounts, except for 
personal computers falling within Account 2124. Personal computers 
classifiable to Account 2124, with a total cost for all components of 
$500 or less, shall be charged to the applicable Plant Specific 
Operations Expense accounts. The cost of tools and test equipment 
located in the central office, classifiable to central office asset 
accounts 2210-2232 costing $2,000 or less or having a life of less than 
one year shall be charged to the applicable Plant Specific Operations 
Expense accounts. If the aggregate investment in the items is relatively 
large at the time of acquisition, such amounts shall be maintained in an 
applicable material and supplies account until items are used.
    (b) Telecommunications plant acquired. (1) Property, plant and 
equipment acquired from an entity, whether or not affiliated with the 
accounting company, shall be accounted for at original cost, except that 
property, plant and

[[Page 414]]

equipment acquired from a nonaffiliated entity shall be accounted for at 
acquisition cost if the purchase price is less than $100,000 for Class A 
companies or $25,000 for Class B companies.
    (2) The accounting for property, plant and equipment to be recorded 
at original cost shall be as follows:
    (i) The amount of money paid (or current money value of any 
consideration other than money exchanged) for the property (together 
with preliminary expenses incurred in connection the acquisition) shall 
be charged to Account 1438, Deferred maintenance, retirements, and other 
deferred charges.
    (ii) The original cost, estimated if not known, of 
telecommunications plant, governmental franchises and other similar 
rights acquired shall be charged to the applicable telecommunications 
plant accounts, Telecommunications Plant Under Construction, and 
Property Held For Future Telecommunications Use, as appropriate, and 
credited to Account 1439. When the actual original cost cannot be 
determined and estimates are used, the company shall be prepared to 
furnish the Commission with the particulars of such estimates.
    (iii) Accumulated Depreciation and amortization balances related to 
plant acquired shall be credited to Account 3100, Accumulated 
depreciation, or Account 3200, Accumulated depreciation--held for future 
telecommunications use, or Account 3410, Accumulated amortization--
capitalized leases and debited to Account 1438. Accumulated amortization 
balances related to plant acquired which ultimately is recorded in 
Accounts 2005, Telecommunications plant adjustment, Account 2682, 
Leasehold improvements, or Account 2690, Intangibles shall be credited 
to these asset accounts, and debited to Account 1438.
    (iv) Any amount remaining in Account 1438, applicable to the plant 
acquired, shall, upon completion of the entries provided in paragraphs 
(b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(iii) of this section, be debited or credited, 
as applicable, to Account 2007, Goodwill, or to Account 2005, 
Telecommunications plant adjustment, as appropriate.
    (3) A memorandum record shall be kept showing the amount of 
contributions in aid of construction applicable to the property acquired 
as shown by the accounts of the previous owner.
    (c) Cost of construction. (1) Telecommunications plant represents an 
economic resource which will be used to provide future services, the 
cost of which will be allocated in a rational and systematic manner to 
the future periods in which it provides benefits. In accounting for 
construction costs, the utility shall charge to the telecommunications 
plant accounts, where applicable, all direct and indirect costs.
    (2) Direct and indirect costs shall include, but not be limited to:
    (i) ``Labor'' includes the wages and expenses of employees directly 
engaged in or in direct charge of construction work. It includes 
expenses directly related to an employee's wages, such as worker's 
compensation insurance, payroll taxes, benefits and other similar items 
of expense.
    (ii) ``Engineering'' includes the portion of the wages and expenses 
of engineers, draftsmen, inspectors, and their direct supervision 
applicable to construction work. It includes expenses directly related 
to an employee's wages, such as worker's compensation insurance, payroll 
taxes, benefits and other similar items of expense.
    (iii) ``Material and supplies'' includes the purchase price of 
material used at the point of free delivery plus the costs of 
inspection, loading and transportation, and an equitable portion of 
provisioning expense. In determining the cost of material used, proper 
allowance shall be made for unused material, for material recovered from 
temporary structures used in performing the work involved, and for 
discounts allowed and realized in the purchase of material. This item 
does not include construction material that is stolen or rendered 
unusable due to vandalism. Such material should be charged to the 
applicable plant specific operations expense accounts.
    (iv) ``Transportation'' includes the cost of transporting employees, 
material and supplies, tools and other work equipment to and from the 
physical construction location. It includes

[[Page 415]]

amounts paid therefor to other companies or individuals and the cost of 
using the company's own motor vehicles or other transportation 
equipment.
    (v) ``Contract work'' includes amounts paid for work performed under 
contract or other agreement by other companies, firms or individuals; 
engineering and supervision applicable to such work; cost incident to 
the award of contracts; and the inspection of such work. The cost of 
construction work performed by affiliated companies and other details 
relating thereto shall be available from the work in progress and 
supporting records.
    (vi) ``Protection'' includes the cost of protecting the company's 
property from fire or other casualties and the cost of preventing 
damages to others or the property of others.
    (vii) ``Privileges, Permits, and Rights of way'' includes such costs 
incurred in obtaining these privileges, permits, or rights of way in 
connection with construction work, such as for use of private property, 
streets or highways. The cost of such privileges and permits shall be 
included in the cost of the work for which the privileges or permits are 
obtained, except for costs includable in Account 2111, Land, and Account 
2690, Intangibles.
    (viii) ``Taxes'' includes taxes properly includable in construction 
costs before the facilities are completed for service, which taxes are 
assessed separately from taxes on operating property or under conditions 
that permit separate identification of the amount chargeable to 
construction.
    (ix) ``Special machine service'' includes the cost of labor 
expended, materials and supplies consumed and other expenses incurred in 
the maintenance, operation and use of special and other labor saving 
machines (other than transportation equipment (such as trenching 
equipment, cable plows and pole setting trucks. Also included are 
expenditures for rental, maintenance and operation of such machines 
owned by others. When a construction job requires the purchase of 
special machines, the cost thereof, less the appraised or salvage value 
at the time of release from the job, shall be included in the cost of 
construction.
    (x) Allowance for funds used during construction (``AFUDC'') 
provides for the cost of financing the construction of 
telecommunications plant. AFUDC shall be charged to Account 2003, 
Telecommunications plant under construction, and credited to Account 
7300, Nonoperating income and expense. The rate for calculating AFUDC 
shall be determined as follows: If financing plans associate a specific 
new borrowing with an asset, the rate on that borrowing may be used for 
the asset; if no specific new borrowing is associated with an asset or 
if the average accumulated expenditures for the asset exceed the amounts 
of specific new borrowing associated with it, the capitalization rate to 
be applied to such excess shall be the weighted average of the rates 
applicable to other borrowings of the enterprise. The amount of interest 
cost capitalized in an accounting period shall not exceed the total 
amount of interest cost incurred by the company in that period.
    (xi) ``Insurance'' includes premiums paid specifically for 
protection against loss and damage in connection with the construction 
of telecommunications plant due to fire or other casualty, injury to or 
death of employees or others, damages to property of others, 
defalcations of employees and agents and the non-performance of 
contractual obligations of others.
    (xii) ``Construction services'' include the cost of telephone, 
electricity, power, construction quarters, office space and equipment 
directly related to the construction project.
    (xiii) ``Indirect construction costs'' shall include indirect costs 
such as general engineering, supervision and support. Such costs, in 
addition to direct supervision, shall include indirect plant operations 
and engineering supervision up to, but not including, supervision by 
executive officers whose pay and expenses are chargeable to Account 
6720, General and administrative. The records supporting the entries for 
indirect construction costs shall be kept so as to show the nature of 
the expenditures, the individual jobs and accounts charged, and the 
bases of the distribution. The amounts charged to each plant account for 
indirect costs

[[Page 416]]

shall be readily determinable. The instructions contained herein shall 
not be interpreted as permitting the addition to plant of amounts to 
cover indirect costs based on arbitrary allocations.
    (xiv) The cost of construction shall not include any amounts 
classifiable as Corporate Operations Expense.
    (d) Telecommunications plant retired. (1) Telecommunications plant 
accounts shall at all times disclose the original cost of all property 
in service. When any item of property subject to plant retirement 
accounting is worn out, lost, sold, destroyed, abandoned, surrendered 
upon lapse of title, becomes permanently unserviceable, is withdrawn or 
for any other reason is retired from service, the plant accounts 
applicable to that item shall be credited with the original cost of the 
plant retired whether replaced or not (except as provided for minor 
items in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section). Normally, these 
retirement credits with respect to such plant as entire buildings, 
entire central offices, all plant abandoned and any large sections of 
plant withdrawn from service, shall be entered in the accounts for the 
month in which use of the property ceased. For any other plant withdrawn 
from service, the retirement credits shall be entered no later than the 
next succeeding month. Literal compliance with the provision for timing 
of entries with respect to property amounting to less than $50,000 
retired under any one project is not required if an unreasonable amount 
of recordkeeping and estimating of quantities, original costs and 
salvage is necessary. The retirement entry shall refer to the continuing 
property record, or records supplemental thereto, from which the cost 
was obtained (note also paragraph (d)(3) of this section). Every company 
shall establish procedures which will ensure compliance with these 
requirements.
    (2) To avoid undue refinement, depreciable telecommunications plant 
shall be accounted for as follows:
    (i) Retirement units: This group includes major items of property, a 
representative list of which shall be prescribed by this Commission. In 
lieu of the retirement units prescribed with respect to a particular 
account, a company may, after obtaining specific approval by this 
Commission, establish and maintain its own list of retirement units for 
a portion or all of the plant in any such account. For items included on 
the retirement units list, the original cost of any such items retired 
shall be credited to the plant account and charged to Account 3100 
Accumulated Depreciation, whether or not replaced. The original cost of 
retirement units installed in place of property retired shall be charged 
to the applicable telecommunications plant account.
    (ii) Minor items: This group includes any part or element of plant 
which is not designated as a retirement unit. The original cost of a 
minor item of property when included in the specific or average cost for 
a retirement unit or units requires no separate credit to the 
telecommunications plant account when such a minor item is retired. The 
cost of replacement shall be charged to the account applicable for the 
cost of repairs of the property. However, if the replacement effects a 
substantial betterment (the primary aim of which is to make the property 
affected more useful, of greater durability, of greater capacity or more 
economical in operation), the excess cost of such a replacement, over 
the estimated cost at the then current prices of replacement without 
betterment of the minor items being retired, shall be charged to the 
applicable telecommunications plant account.
    (3) The cost of property to be retired shall be the amount at which 
property is included in the telecommunications plant accounts. However, 
when it is impracticable to determine the cost of each item due to the 
relatively large number or small cost of such items, the average cost of 
all the items covered by an appropriate subdivision of the account shall 
be used in determining the cost to be assigned to such items when 
retired. The method used in determining average cost must give due 
regard to the quantity, vintage, size and kind of items, the area in 
which they were installed and their classification in other respects. 
Average cost may be applied in retirement of such items as poles, wire, 
cable, cable terminals, conduit and booths. Any company may use

[[Page 417]]

average cost of property installed in a year or band of years as 
approved by the Commission. It should be understood, however, that the 
use of average costs shall not relieve the company of the requirement 
for maintaining its continuing property records to show, where 
practicable, dates of installation and removal for purposes of mortality 
studies. (See Sec. 32.2000(f) of this subpart, Standard Practices for 
Establishing and Maintaining Continuing Property Records.)
    (4) The accounting for the retirement of property, plant and 
equipment shall be as provided above except that amounts in Account 
2111, Land, and amounts for works of art recorded in Account 2122, 
Furniture, shall be treated at disposition as a gain or loss and shall 
be credited or debited to Account 7100, Other operating income and 
expense, as applicable. If land or artwork is retained by the company 
and held for sale, the cost shall be charged to Account 2006, 
Nonoperating plant.
    (5) When the telecommunications plant is sold together with traffic 
associated therewith, the original cost of the property shall be 
credited to the applicable plant accounts and the estimated amounts 
carried with respect thereto in the accumulated depreciation and 
amortization accounts shall be charged to such accumulated accounts. The 
difference, if any, between the net amount of such debit and credit 
items and the consideration received (less commissions and other 
expenses of making the sale) for the property shall be included in 
Account 7300, Nonoperating income and expense. The accounting for 
depreciable telecommunications plant sold without the traffic associated 
therewith shall be in accordance with the accounting provided in Sec. 
32.3100(c).
    (e) Basic property records. (1) The basic property records are that 
portion of the total property accounting system which preserves the 
following detailed information:
    (i) The identity, vintage, location and original cost of units of 
property;
    (ii) Original and ongoing transactional data (plant account 
activity) in terms of such units; and
    (iii) Any other specific financial and cost accounting information 
not properly warranting separate disclosure as an account or subaccount 
but which is needed to support regulatory, cost, tax, management and 
other specific accounting information needs and requirements.
    (2) The basic property records must be: (i) Subject to internal 
accounting controls, (ii) auditable, (iii) equal in the aggregate to the 
total investment reflected in the financial property control accounts as 
well as the total of the cost allocations supporting the determination 
of cost-of-service at any particular point in time, and (iv) maintained 
throughout the life of the property.
    (3) The basic property records shall consist of (i) continuing 
property records and (ii) records supplemental thereto which together 
reveal clearly, by accounting area, the detailed and systematically 
summarized information necessary to meet fully the requirements of 
paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.
    (4) Companies shall establish and maintain basic property records 
for each class of property recorded in the several plant accounts which 
comprise the balance sheet Account 2001, Telecommunications Plant In 
Service, Account 2002, Property Held for Future Telecommunications Use, 
and Account 2006, Nonoperating Plant.
    (5) The company shall notify the Commission of a plan for the basic 
property record as follows:
    (i) Not later than June 30 of the year following that in which it 
becomes subject to this system of accounts, the company shall file with 
the Commission two (2) copies of a complete plan of the method to be 
used in the compilation of a basic property record with respect to each 
class of property. The plan shall include a list of proposed accounting 
areas accompanied by description of the boundaries of each area as 
defined in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 32.2000(f)(1) (i) 
and (ii) of this subpart. The plan shall also include a list of property 
record units proposed for use under each regulated plant account. These 
property record units shall be selected such that the requirements of 
Sec. 32.2000(f)(2) (i), (ii) and (iii) of this subpart can be 
satisfied.

[[Page 418]]

    (ii) The company shall submit to the Commission one copy of any 
major proposed changes in its basic property record plan at least 30 
days before the effective date of the proposed changes.
    (6) The company shall prepare and maintain the basic property record 
as follows:
    (i) Not later than June 30 of the year following that in which the 
company becomes subject to this system of accounts, begin the 
preparation of a basic property record.
    (ii) Complete within two years of the prescribed beginning date, 
basic property records for all property as of the end of the preceding 
calendar year.
    (iii) Promptly process in the basic property records all property 
changes affecting periods subsequent to initial establishment of the 
basic property record.
    (7) The basic property record components (see paragraph (c) of this 
section) shall be arranged in conformity with the regulated plant 
accounts prescribed in this section of accounts as follows:
    (i) The continuing property records shall be compiled on the basis 
of original cost (or other book cost consistent with this system of 
accounts). The continuing property records shall be maintained as 
prescribed in Sec. 32.2000(f)(2)(iii) of this subpart in such manner as 
will meet the following basic objectives:
    (A) Provide for the verification of property record units by 
physical examination.
    (B) Provide for accurate accounting for retirements.
    (C) Provide data for use in connection with depreciation studies.
    (ii) The records supplemental to the continuing property records 
shall disclose such service designations, usage measurement criteria, 
apportionment factors, or other data as may be prescribed by the 
Commission in this part or other parts of its Rules and Regulations. 
Such data are subject to the same general controls and standards for 
auditability and support as are all other elements of the basic property 
records.
    (f) Standard practices for establishing and maintaining continuing 
property records--(1) Accounting area. (i) The continuing property 
record, as related to each primary plant account, shall be established 
and maintained by subaccounts for each accounting area. An accounting 
area is the smallest territory of the company for which accounting 
records of investment are maintained for all plant accounts within the 
area. Areas already established for administrative, accounting, 
valuation, or other purposes may be adopted for this purpose when 
appropriate. In no case shall the boundaries of accounting areas cross 
either State lines or boundaries prescribed by the Commission.
    (ii) In determining the limit of each area, consideration shall be 
given to the quantities of property, construction conditions, operating 
districts, county and township lines, taxing district boundaries, city 
limits, and other political or geographical limits, in order that the 
area adopted may have maximum adaptability, within the confines of 
practicability, for both the company's purpose and those of Federal, 
State, and municipal authorities.
    (2) Property record units. (i) In each of the established accounting 
areas, the ``property record units'' which are to be maintained in the 
continuing property record shall be set forth separately, classified by 
size and type with the amount of original cost (or other appropriate 
book cost) associated with such units. When a list of property record 
units has been accepted by the Commission, they shall become the units 
referred to in this statement of standard practices. Such units shall 
apply to only the regulated portion of this system of accounts.
    (ii) When it is found necessary to revise this list because of the 
addition of units used in providing new types of service, or new units 
resulting from improvements in technology, or because of the grouping or 
elimination of units which no longer merit separate recognition as 
property record units, one copy of such changes shall be submitted to 
the Commission. Upon appropriate showing by the company, the Commission 
may specifically exempt the company from these filing requirements.
    (iii) The continuing property record shall reveal the description, 
location, date of placement, the essential details of construction, and 
the original cost (note also Sec. 32.2000(f)(3) of this subpart)

[[Page 419]]

of the property record units. The continuing property record and other 
underlying records of construction costs shall be so maintained that, 
upon retirement of one or more retirement units or of minor items 
without replacement when not included in the costs of retirement units, 
the actual cost or a reasonably accurate estimate of the cost of the 
plant retired can be determined.
    (3) Methods of determining original cost of property record units. 
The original cost of the property record units shall be determined by 
analyses of the construction costs incurred as shown by completion 
reports and other data, accumulated in the respective construction work 
orders or authorizations. Costs shall be allocated to and associated 
with the property record units to facilitate accounting for retirements. 
The original cost of property record units shall be determined by unit 
identification or averaging as described in paragraphs (f)(3) (i) and 
(ii) of this section.
    (i) Unit identification. Cost shall be identified and maintained by 
specific location for property record units contained within certain 
regulated plant accounts or account groupings such as Land, Buildings, 
Central Office Assets, Motor Vehicles, garage work equipment included in 
Account 2114, Tools and other work equipment, and Furniture. In 
addition, units involved in any unusual or special type of construction 
shall be recorded by their specific location costs (note also Sec. 
32.2000(f)(3)(ii)(B)).
    (ii) Averaging. (A) Average costs may be developed for plant 
consisting of a large number of similar units such as terminal 
equipment, poles, wire, cable, cable terminals, conduit, furniture, and 
work equipment. Units of similar size and type within each specified 
accounting area and regulated plant account may be grouped. Each such 
average cost shall be set forth in the continuing property record of the 
units with which it is associated.
    (B) The averaging of costs permitted under the provisions of the 
foregoing paragraph is restricted to plant installed in a particular 
vintage or band of years incurred within an accounting area. This 
paragraph does not permit the inclusion of the cost of units involved in 
any unusual or special type of construction. The units involved in such 
unusual or special type of construction shall be recorded at cost by 
location.
    (4) Estimates. In cases where the actual original cost of property 
cannot be ascertained, such as pricing an inventory for the initial 
entry of a continuing property record or the pricing of an acquisition 
for which a continuing property record has not been maintained, the 
original cost may be estimated. Any estimated original cost shall be 
consistent with the accounting practices in effect at the time the 
property was constructed.
    (5) Identification of property record units. There shall be shown in 
the continuing property record or in record supplements thereof, a 
complete description of the property records units in such detail as to 
identify such units. The description shall include the identification of 
the work order under which constructed, the year of installation (unless 
not determinable per Sec. 32.2000(f)(4) of this subpart, specific 
location of the property within each accounting area in such manner that 
it can be readily spot-checked for proof of physical existence, the 
accounting company's number or designation, and any other description 
used in connection with the determination of the original cost. 
Descriptions of units of similar size and type shall follow prescribed 
groupings.
    (6) Reinstalled units. When units to which average costs are not 
applied, i.e., specific and fixed location units, are removed or retired 
and subsequently reinstalled, the date when the unit was first charged 
to the appropriate plant account shall, when required for adequate 
service life studies and reasonably accurate retirement accounting, be 
shown in addition to the date of reinstallation.
    (7) Age and service life of property. The continuing property record 
shall disclose the age of existing property and the supporting records 
shall disclose the service life of property retired. Exceptions from 
this requirement for any property record unit shall be submitted to the 
Commission for approval.

[[Page 420]]

    (8) Reference to sources of information. There shall be shown by 
appropriate reference the source of all entries. All drawings, 
computations, and other detailed records which support quantities and 
costs or estimated costs shall be retained as a part of or in support of 
the continuing property record.
    (9) Jointly owned property. (i) With respect to jointly owned 
property, there shall be shown in the continuing property record or 
records supplemental thereto:
    (A) The identity of all joint owners.
    (B) The percentage owned by the accounting company.
    (ii) When regulated plant is constructed under arrangements for 
joint ownership, the amount received by the constructing company from 
the other joint owner or owners shall be credited as a reduction of the 
gross cost of the plant in place.
    (iii) When a sale of a part interest in regulated plant is made, the 
fractional interest sold shall be treated as a retirement and the amount 
received shall be treated as salvage. The continuing property record or 
records supplemental thereto shall be so maintained as to identify 
separately retirements of this nature from physical retirements of 
jointly owned plant.
    (iv) If jointly owned regulated property is substantial in relation 
to the total of the same kind of regulated property owned wholly by the 
company, such jointly owned regulated property shall be appropriately 
segregated in the continuing property record.
    (g) Depreciation accounting--(1) Computation of depreciation rates. 
(i) Unless otherwise provided by the Commission, either through prior 
approval or upon prescription by the Commission, depreciation percentage 
rates shall be computed in conformity with a group plan of accounting 
for depreciation and shall be such that the loss in service value of the 
property, except for losses excluded under the definition of 
depreciation, may be distributed under the straight-line method during 
the service life of the property.
    (ii) In the event any composite percentage rate becomes no longer 
applicable, revised composite percentage rates shall be computed in 
accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section.
    (iii) The company shall keep such records of property and property 
retirements as will allow the determination of the service life of 
property which has been retired, or facilitate the determination of 
service life indications by mortality, turnover, or other appropriate 
methods. Such records will also allow the determination of the 
percentage of salvage value and cost of removal for property retired 
from each class of depreciable plant.
    (2) Depreciation charges. (i) A separate annual percentage rate for 
each depreciation category of telecommunications plant shall be used in 
computing depreciation charges.
    (ii) Companies, upon receiving prior approval from this Commission, 
or, upon prescription by this Commission, shall apply such depreciation 
rate, except where provisions of paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section 
apply, as will ratably distribute on a straight line basis the 
difference between the net book cost of a class or subclass of plant and 
its estimated net salvage during the known or estimated remaining 
service life of the plant.
    (iii) Charges for currently accruing depreciation shall be made 
monthly to the appropriate depreciation accounts, and corresponding 
credits shall be made to the appropriate depreciation reserve accounts. 
Current monthly charges shall normally be computed by the application of 
one-twelfth of the annual depreciation rate to the monthly average 
balance of the associated category of plant. The average monthly balance 
shall be computed using the balance as of the first and last days of the 
current month.
    (iv) In certain circumstances and upon prior approval of this 
Commission, monthly charges may be determined in total or in part 
through the use of other methods whereby selected plant balances or 
portions thereof are ratably distributed over periods prescribed by this 
Commission. Such circumstances could include but not be limited to 
factors such as the existence of reserve deficiencies or surpluses, 
types of plant that will be completely retired in the near future, and 
changes

[[Page 421]]

in the accounting for plant. Where alternative methods have been used in 
accordance with this subparagraph, such amounts shall be applied 
separately or in combination with rates determined in accordance with 
paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (3) Acquired depreciable plant. When acquired depreciable plant 
carried in Account 1438, Deferred maintenance, retirements and other 
deferred charges, is distributed to the appropriate plant accounts, 
adjusting entries shall be made covering the depreciation charges 
applicable to such plant for the period during which it was carried in 
Account 1438.
    (4) Plant Retired for Nonrecurring Factors not Recognized in 
Depreciation Rates.
    (i) A retirement will be considered as nonrecurring (extraordinary) 
only if the following criteria are met:
    (A) The impending retirement was not adequately considered in 
setting past depreciation rates.
    (B) The charging of the retirement against the reserve will unduly 
deplete that reserve.
    (C) The retirement is unusual such that similar retirements are not 
likely to recur in the future.
    (5) Upon direction or approval from this Commission, the company 
shall credit Account 3100, Accumulated Depreciation, and charge Account 
1438, Deferred Maintenance, retirements and other deferred charges, with 
the unprovided-for loss in service value. Such amounts shall be 
distributed from Account 1438 to Account 6561, Depreciation expense--
Telecommunications plant in service, or Account 6562, Depreciation 
expense--property held for future telecommunications use, over such 
period as this Commission may direct or approve.
    (h) Amortization accounting. (1) Unless otherwise provided by this 
Commission, either through approval, or upon prescription by this 
Commission, amortization shall be computed on the straight-line method, 
i.e., equal annual amounts shall be applied. The cost of each type asset 
shall be amortized on the basis the estimated life of that asset and 
shall not be written off in the accounting period in which the asset is 
acquired. A reasonable estimate of the useful life may be based on the 
upper or lower limits even though a fixed existence is not determinable. 
However, the period of amortization shall not exceed forty years.
    (2) In the event any estimated useful life becomes no longer 
applicable, a revised estimated useful life shall be determined in 
accordance with paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
    (3) Amortization charges shall be made monthly to the appropriate 
amortization expense accounts and corresponding credits shall be made to 
accounts 2005, 2682, 2690, and 3410, as appropriate. Monthly charges 
shall be computed by the application of one-twelfth to the annual 
amortization amount.
    (4) The company shall keep such records as will allow the 
determination of the useful life of the asset.

upon an estimate of such costs.
    (b) The amounts recorded in this account with respect to each 
property acquisition (except land and artworks) shall be disposed of, 
written off, or provision shall be made for the amortization thereof, as 
follows:
    (1) Debit amounts may be charged in whole or in part, or amortized 
over a reasonable period through charges to Account 7300, Nonoperating 
income and expense, without further direction or approval by this

<R04>
               Subpart D_Instructions For Revenue Accounts


<R05>
Sec. 32.4999  General.

    (a) Purpose of revenue accounts. The revenue accounts are intended 
to include the actual cash inflows (or equivalents) that have or will 
occur as a result of the company's ongoing major or central operations 
during the period. They will include the revenues which arise from 
furnishing regulated telecommunications services to others, from 
directory advertising, rentals of telecommunications assets and from 
providing other services which are directly associated with the 
provision of regulated telecommunications services.
    (b) Deductions from revenue. Corrections of overcharges, authorized 
refunds of overcollections previously credited to revenue, authorized 
refunds and adjustments on account of failure in service, and other 
corrections shall be charged to the revenue account previously credited 
with the amounts involved.
    (c) Commissions. Commissions paid to others or employees in place of 
compensation or salaries for services rendered, such as public telephone 
commissions, shall be charged to Account 6623, Customer services, and 
not to the revenue accounts. Other commissions shall be charged to the 
appropriate expense accounts.
    (d) Revenue recognition. Credits shall be made to the appropriate 
revenue accounts when such revenue is actually earned. When the billing 
cycle encompasses more than one accounting period, adjustments are 
necessary to properly recognize the revenue applicable to the current 
accounting period under report. Revenues recorded under the terms of 
two-tier contracts or other variable payment plans should be deferred, 
if necessary, and recognized ratably with expenses over the terms of the 
related contract. Any amounts deferred shall be credited to Account 
4300, Other long-term liabilities and deferred credits.
    (e) Contractual arrangements. Charges and credits resulting from 
activities associated with the provisions of regulated 
telecommunications services

[[Page 441]]

shall be recorded in a manner consistent with the nature of the 
underlying contractual arrangements. The charges and credits resulting 
from expense sharing or apportionment arrangements associated with the 
provision of regulated telecommunications services shall be recorded in 
the detailed regulated accounts. Charges and credits resulting from 
revenue settlement agreements or other revenue pooling arrangements 
associated with the provision of regulated telecommunications services 
shall be included in the appropriate revenue accounts. Those charges and 
credits resulting from contractual revenue pooling and/or sharing 
agreements shall be recorded in each prescribed revenue account and 
prescribed subsidiary record categories thereof to the extent that each 
is separately identifiable in the settlement process. It is not intended 
that settlement amounts be allocated or generally spread to the 
individual revenue accounts where they are not separately identifiable 
in the settlement process. When the settlement amounts are not 
identifiable by a revenue account they shall be recorded in Account 
5060, Other basic area revenue, 5105, Long distance message revenue, or 
5200, Miscellaneous revenue, as appropriate.
    (f) Subsidiary records--jurisdictional subdivisions and 
interconnection. Subsidiary record categories shall be maintained in 
order that the company may separately report revenues derived from 
charges imposed under intrastate, interstate and international tariff 
filings. Class A carriers shall also maintain subsidiary record 
categories in order that the companies may separately report 
interconnection revenues derived from the following categories: 
Unbundled network element revenues, Resale revenues, Reciprocal 
compensation revenues, and Other interconnection revenues. Such 
subsidiary record categories shall be reported as required by part 43 of 
this Commission's Rules and Regulations.
    (g) Structure of revenue accounts. (1) The revenue section of the 
system of accounts shall be organized by revenue group summary account, 
account and subsidiary record category (if required).
    (2) The revenue section of this system of accounts shall be 
comprised of six major groups--Local Network Services Revenues, Network 
Access Services Revenues, Long Distance Network Services Revenues, 
Miscellaneous Revenues, Nonregulated revenues, and Uncollectible 
Revenues, which shall be considered as a revenue group for the purposes 
of the construction of the system.
    (3) Accounts shall be maintained as prescribed in this section 
subject to the conditions described in section 32.13 of subpart B. In 
certain instances, subsidiary record categories may be required below 
the account level by this system of accounts or by Commission order.
    (h) Local Network Services revenues. Local Network Services revenues 
(Accounts 5001 through 5060) shall include revenues derived from the 
provision of service and equipment entirely within the basic service 
area. That area is defined as the normal boundaries for local calling 
plus Extended Area Service (EAS) boundaries as they apply to that 
service. It includes revenues derived from both local private network 
service and local public network services as well as from customer 
premises facilities services. Local revenues include associated charges 
such as one-time service connection or termination charges and secondary 
features such as call waiting.
    (i) Network Access revenues. (1) Network Access revenues (Accounts 
5081-5083) shall include revenues derived from the provision of exchange 
access services to an interexchange carrier or to an end user of 
telecommunications services beyond the exchange carrier's network.
    (2) Billing and collections service provided under exchange access 
tariffs shall be included in the Miscellaneous Revenues Group.
    (j) Long Distance Network Service revenues. Long Distance Network 
Service revenues shall include revenues derived from the provision of 
services beyond the basic service area, whether message or flat-rate and 
including public network switching as well as private.
    (k) Miscellaneous revenues. Miscellaneous revenues are those 
revenues derived from the provision of regulated

[[Page 442]]

products and services provided under tariff or contract but not 
contained elsewhere. They shall also include operating revenue derived 
from activities performed incident to the company's tariffed 
telecommunications operations which, though non-tariffed, are included 
in the regulatory process.
    (l) Nonregulated revenues. The nonregulated revenue account shall be 
used for nonregulated operating revenues when a nonregulated activity 
involves the common or joint use of assets or resources in the provision 
of regulated and nonregulated products or services as required in Sec. 
32.23(c) of this subpart. Revenues from nontariffed activities offered 
incidental to tariffed services may be accounted for as regulated 
revenues, provided the activities are outgrowths of regulated operations 
and the revenues do not exceed, in the aggregate, one percent of total 
revenues for three consecutive years. Such activities must be listed in 
the Commission-approved Cost Allocation Manual for any company required 
to file a Cost Allocation Manual.
    (m) Uncollectible revenues. Uncollectible revenues shall include 
amounts originally credited to the revenue accounts which have proved 
impracticable of collection.
    (n) Revenue accounts to be maintained.

that terminate beyond the basic service area of the originating wire 
center and are individually priced. This includes those message services 
which utilize the public long distance switching network and the basic 
subscriber access line. It also includes those long distance calls 
placed from mobile and public telephones, as well as any charges for 
operator assistance or special billing directly related to the 
completion of a specific call. This account shall also include revenue 
derived from individually priced message services offered under calling

shall be included in this account. This account includes revenue derived 
from the following services:
    (a) Long distance services which permit unidirectional calls to a 
subscriber from specified services areas (multipoint-to-point service). 
These calls require the use of dedicated access lines connecting a

subscriber to place outward calls. The call is billed to the subscriber 
even though it is generally initiated by the subscriber's customer or 
correspondent.
    (b) Long distance services which permit the subscriber to place 
telephone calls from one location to other specified service areas 
(point-to-multipoint service). These calls are completed without 
operator assistance and require the use of a dedicated access line. The 
dedicated access line is generally separate from those required for 
inward message services and cannot be used to place calls within the 
basic service area or calls outside the selected service areas. Outward 
calls are screened and blocked to determine whether the calls are within 
an authorized service area.
    (c) Services extending beyond the basic service area that involve 
dedicated circuits, private switching arrangements, and/or predefined 
transmission paths, whether virtual or physical, which provide 
communications between specific locations (e.g., point-to-point

    (2) Private network circuits and facilities (including multipurpose 
wide-band) which provide voice grade services for the transmission of 
analog signals. It includes revenue from services such as voice, data 
and telephoto communication, as well as remote metering, supervisory 
control, miscellaneous signaling and channels furnished for the purpose 
of extending customer--provided communications systems. It includes 
revenue from the provision of facilities between customer premises and a 
serving office, a carrier distribution point, or an extension 
distribution channel.

program transmission purposes, such as radio broadcasting, sound 
recording (wired music) and loud speaker services. It includes revenue 
from the provision of facilities for the transmission of analog signals 
between customer premises and a serving office, a carrier distribution 
point, or an extension distribution channel furnished in connection with 
such services. It also includes revenue from facilities furnished to 
carry the audio portion of a television program if furnished under 
separate audio rates. If the rate for television program services 
includes both the picture and sound

[[Page 445]]

portion of the transmission, the revenue shall also be included in this

program transmission purposes, such as commercial broadcast and 
educational or private television services. It includes revenue from the 
provision of facilities for the transmission of analog signals between 
customer premises and a serving office, a carrier distribution point, or

               Subpart E_Instructions for Expense Accounts


<R05>
Sec. 32.5999  General.

    (a) Structure of the expense accounts. (1) The expense section of 
the system of accounts shall be organized by expense group summary 
account, and subsidiary record category (if required).
    (2) The expense section of this system of accounts shall be 
comprised of four major expense groups--Plant Specific Operations, Plant 
Nonspecific Operations, Customer Operations and Corporate Operations. 
Expenses to be recorded in Plant Specific and Plant Nonspecific 
Operations Expense Groups generally reflect cost associated with the 
various kinds of equipment identified in the plant asset accounts. 
Expenses to be recorded in the Customer Operations and Corporate 
Operations accounts reflect the costs of, or are associated with, 
functions performed by people, irrespective of the organization in which 
any particular function is performed.
    (3) Accounts shall be maintained as prescribed in this section 
subject to the conditions described in Sec. 32.13 in subpart B. 
Subsidiary record categories may be required below the account level by 
this system of accounts or by Commission order.
    (b) Plant Specific Operations Expense. (1) The Plant Specific 
Operations Expense Accounts, 6110 through 6441, are used to record costs 
related to specific kinds of telecommunications plant.
    (2) The Plant Specific Operations Expense accounts predominantly 
mirror the telecommunications plant in service detail accounts and are 
numbered consistently with them; the first digit of the expense account 
being six (6) and the remaining digits being the same as the last three 
numbers of the related plant account. In classifying Plant Specific 
Operations expenses, the text of the corresponding plant account should 
be consulted to ensure appropriateness.
    (3) The Plant Specific Operations Expense accounts shall include the 
costs of inspecting, testing (except as specified in Account 6533, 
Testing Expense) and reporting on the condition of telecommunications 
plant to determine the need for repairs, replacements, rearrangements 
and changes; performing routine work to prevent trouble (except as 
specified in Account 6533), replacing items of plant other than 
retirement units; rearranging and changing the location of plant not 
retired; repairing material for reuse; restoring the condition of plant 
damaged by storms, floods, fire or other casualties (other than the cost 
of replacing retirement units); inspecting after repairs have been made; 
and receiving training to perform these kinds of work. Also included are 
the costs of direct supervision (immediate of first-level) and office 
support of this work.
    (4) In addition to the activities specified in paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section, the appropriate Plant Specific Operations Expense accounts 
shall include the cost of personnel whose principal job is the operation 
of plant equipment, such as general purpose computer operators, aircraft 
pilots, chauffeurs and shuttle bus drivers. However, when the operation 
of equipment is performed as part of other identifiable functions (such 
as the use of office equipment, capital tools or motor vehicles), the 
operators' cost shall be charged to accounts appropriate for those 
functions. (For costs of operator services personnel, see Accounts 6621, 
Call completion services, and 6622, Number services, and for costs of 
test board personnel see Account 6533.)
    (c) Plant nonspecific operations expense. The Plant Nonspecific 
Operations Expense accounts shall include expenses related to property 
held for future telecommunications use, provisioning expenses, network 
operations expenses, and depreciation and amortization expenses. 
Accounts in this group

[[Page 448]]

(except for Account 6540, Access expense, and Accounts 6560 through 
6565) shall include the costs of performing activities described in 
narratives for individual accounts. These costs shall also include the 
costs of supervision and office support of these activities.
    (d) Customer Operations Expense. The Customer Operations Expense 
accounts shall include the cost of performing customer related marketing 
and services activities described in narratives for individual accounts. 
These costs shall also include the costs of supervision, office support 
and training for these activities.
    (e) Corporate Operations Expense. The Corporate Operations Expense 
accounts shall include the costs of performing executive and planning 
activities and general and administrative activities described in 
narratives for individual accounts. These costs shall also include the 
costs of supervision, office support and training for these activities.
    (f) Reimbursements. Reimbursements of actual costs incurred in 
connection with joint operations or projects repairing plant due to 
damages by others, and obligations to make changes in telecommunications 
plant (such as highway relocations), shall be credited to the accounts 
originally charged.
    (g) Expense accounts to be maintained.

Sec. 32.9000  Glossary of terms.

    When used in this system of accounts:
    Accelerated depreciation means a depreciation method or period of 
time, including the treatment given cost of removal and gross salvage, 
used in calculating depreciation deductions on income tax returns which 
is different from the depreciation method or period of time prescribed 
by this Commission for use in calculating depreciation expense recorded 
in a company's books of account.
    Account means a specific element of a chart of accounts used to 
record, classify and accumulate similar financial transactions resulting 
from the operations of the entity. ``Accounts'' or ``these accounts'' 
refer to the accounts of this system of accounts.
    Accounting system means the total set of interrelated principles, 
rules, requirements, definitions, accounts, records, procedures and 
mechanisms necessary to operate and evaluate the entity from a financial 
perspective. An accounting system generally consists of a chart of 
accounts, various parallel subsystems and subsidiary records. An 
accounting system is utilized to provide the necessary financial 
information to users to meet judiciary and other responsibilities.
    Affiliated companies means companies that directly or indirectly 
through one or more intermediaries, control or are controlled by, or are 
under common control with, the accounting company. See also Control.
    Amortization means the systematic recoveries, through ratable 
charges to expense, of the cost of assets.
    Associated equipment means that equipment which functions with a 
specific type of plant or with two (2) or more types of plant, e.g., 
switching equipment, network power equipment, circuit equipment, common 
channel network signaling equipment or network operations equipment. 
Associated equipment shall be classified to the account appropriate for 
the type of equipment with which it is predominately used rather than on 
its own characteristics.
    Illustrative examples of associated equipment are:

Alarm and signal apparatus
Auxiliary framing
Cable and cable racks
Distributing frames and equipment thereon
Frame and aisle lighting equipment (not permanently attached to the 
building)
Relay racks and panels

    Basic service area means the minimum specified calling area for 
which a tariff is prescribed.
    Book cost means the amount at which property is recorded in these 
accounts,

[[Page 462]]

without deduction of related allowances.
    Common carrier or carrier means any person engaged as a common 
carrier for hire, in interstate or foreign communication by wire or 
radio or in interstate or foreign radio transmission of energy, except 
where reference is made to common carriers not subject to this Act; but 
a person engaged in radio broadcasting shall not, insofar as such person 
is so engaged, be deemed a common carrier.
    Company or the company, when not otherwise indicated in the context, 
means the accounting entity. It includes such unincorporated entities 
which may be subject to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
    Control (including the terms ``controlling,'' ``controlled by,'' and 
``under common control with'') means the possession directly or 
indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the 
management and policies of a company, whether such power is exercised 
through one or more intermediary companies, or alone, or in conjunction 
with, or pursuant to an agreement with, one or more other companies, and 
whether such power is established through a majority or minority 
ownership or voting of securities, common directors, officers, or 
stockholders, voting trusts, holding trusts, affiliated companies, 
contract, or any other direct or indirect means.
    Cost, except as applied to telecommunications plants, franchises, 
and patent rights, means the amount of money actually paid (or the 
current money value of any consideration other than money exchanged) for 
property or services. See also Original Cost.
    Cost of removal means the cost of demolishing, dismantling, 
removing, tearing down, or otherwise disposing of telecommunications 
plant and recovering the salvage, including the cost of transportation 
and handling incident thereto.
    Depreciation means the loss not restored by current maintenance, 
incurred in connection with the consumption or prospective retirement of 
telecommunications plant in the course of service from causes which are 
known to be in current operation, against which the company is not 
protected by insurance, and the effect of which can be forecast with a 
reasonable approach to accuracy. Among the causes to be given 
consideration are wear and tear, decay, action of the elements, 
inadequacy, obsolescence, changes in technology, changes in demand and 
requirements of public authorities.
    Entity means a legal enterprise (common carrier) engaged in 
interstate communications within the meaning of the Communications Act 
of 1934, as amended.
    Group plan, as applied to depreciation accounting, means the plan 
under which depreciation charges are accrued upon the basis of the 
original cost of all property included in each depreciable plant 
account, using the average service life thereof properly weighted, and 
upon the retirement of any depreciable property its cost is charged to 
the depreciation reserve whether or not the particular item has attained 
the average service life.
    Indexed revenue threshold for a given year means $100 million, 
adjusted for inflation, as measured by the Department of Commerce Gross 
Domestic Product Chain-type Price Index (GDP-CPI), for the period from 
October 19, 1992 to the given year. The indexed revenue threshold for a 
given year shall be determined by multiplying $100 million by the ratio 
of the annual value of the GDP-CPI for the given year to the estimated 
seasonally adjusted GDP-CPI on October 19, 1992. The indexed revenue 
threshold shall be rounded to the nearest $1 million. The seasonally 
adjusted GDP-CPI on October 19, 1992 is determined to be 100.69.
    Intangible property means assets that have no physical existence but 
instead have value because of the rights which ownership confers.
    Intrasystems means assets consisting of:
    (1) PBX and Key System Common Equipment (a switchboard or switching 
equipment shared by all stations);
    (2) Associated CPE station equipment (usually telephone or Key 
Telephone Systems); and
    (3) Intrasystem wiring (all cable or wiring and associated 
components which connect the common equipment and the station equipment, 
located on

[[Page 463]]

the customer's side of the demarcation point).
    An intrasystem does not include property, plant or equipment which 
are not solely dedicated to its operation.
    Mid-sized incumbent local exchange carrier is a carrier whose annual 
revenue from regulated telecommunications operations equals or exceeds 
the indexed revenue threshold and whose revenue when aggregated with the 
revenues of any local exchange carrier that it controls, is controlled 
by, or with which it is under common control is less than $7 billion 
(indexed for inflation as measured by the Department of Commerce Gross 
Domestic Product Chain-type Price Index (GDP-CPI)).
    Minor items, as applied to depreciable telecommunications plant, 
means any part or element of such plant, which when removed, (with or 
without replacement) does not initiate retirement accounting.
    Original cost or cost, as applied to telecommunications plant, 
rights of way and other intangible property, means the actual money cost 
of (or the current money value of any consideration other than money 
exchanged for) property at the time when it was first dedicated to use 
by a regulated telecommunications entity, whether the accounting company 
or by predecessors.

For the application of this definition to property acquired from 
predecessors see Sec. 32.2000(b)(1) of subpart C. Note also the 
definition of Cost in this section.
    Plant retired means plant which has been removed, sold, abandoned, 
destroyed, or otherwise withdrawn from service.
    Retirement units, as applied to depreciable telecommunications 
plant, means those items of plant which when removed (with or without 
replacement) cause the initiation of retirement accounting entries.
    Salvage value means the amount received for property retired, if 
sold, or if retained for reuse, the amount at which the material 
recovered is chargeable to Account 1220, Material and Supplies, or other 
appropriate account.
    Straight-line method, as applied to depreciation accounting, means 
the plan under which the cost of property is charged to operating 
expenses and credited to accumulated depreciation through equal annual 
charges as nearly as may be during its service life.
    Subsidiary record means accumulation of detailed information which 
is required by this Commission to be maintained in support of entries to 
the accounts.
    Subsidiary record categories means those segregations of certain 
regulated costs, expenses and revenues which must be maintained and are 
subject to specific reporting requirements of this Commission.
    Subsystems, parallel mechanisms means processes or procedures which 
augment the use of a chart of accounts in the financial operation of the 
entity. These subsystems operate on and/or process account and 
subsidiary record information for specific purposes.
    Telecommunications means any transmission, emission, or reception of 
signs, signals, writing, images or sounds or intelligence of any nature 
by wire, radio, visual or other electromagnetic systems. This 
encompasses the aggregate of several modes of conveying information, 
signals or messages over a distance. Included in the telecommunications 
industry is the transmitting, receiving, or exchanging of information 
among multiple locations. The minimum elements required for the 
telecommunications process to occur are a message source, a transmission 
medium and a receiver.
    Time of installation means the date at which telecommunications 
plant is placed in service.
    Time of retirement means the date at which telecommunications plant 
is retired from service.
    Tangible property means assets characterized by physical existence, 
such as land, buildings, equipment, furniture, fixtures and tools.

<R04>
                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 36.1  General.

    (a) This part contains an outline of separations procedures for 
telecommunications companies on the station-to-station basis. These 
procedures are applicable either to property costs, revenues, expenses, 
taxes, and reserves as recorded on the books of the company or to 
estimated amounts.
    (1) Where a value basis is used instead of book costs, the ``costs'' 
referred to are the ``values'' of the property derived from the 
valuation.
    (b) The separations procedures set forth in this part are designed 
primarily for the allocation of property costs, revenues, expenses, 
taxes and reserves between state and interstate jurisdictions. For 
separations, where required, of the state portion between exchange and 
toll or for separations of individual exchanges or special services, 
further analyses and studies may be required to adapt the procedures to 
such additional separations.
    (c) The fundamental basis on which separations are made is the use 
of telecommunications plant in each of the operations. The first step is 
the assignment of the cost of the plant to categories. The basis for 
making this assignment is the identification of the plant assignable to 
each category and the determination of the cost of the plant so 
identified. The second step is the apportionment of the cost of the 
plant in each category among the operations by direct assignment where 
possible, and all remaining costs are assigned by the application of 
appropriate use factors.
    (d) In assigning book costs to categories, the costs used for 
certain plant classes are average unit costs which equate to all book 
costs of a particular account or subaccount; for other plant classes, 
the costs used are those which either directly approximate book cost 
levels or which are equated to match total book costs at a given 
location.
    (e) The procedures outlined herein reflect ``short-cuts'' where 
practicable and where their application produces substantially the same 
separations results as would be obtained by the use of more detailed 
procedures, and they assume the use of records generally maintained by 
Telecommunications Companies.
    (f) The classification to accounts of telecommunications property, 
revenues, expenses, etc., set forth in this manual is that prescribed by 
the Federal Communications Commission's Uniform System of Accounts for 
Telecommunications Companies.
    (g) In the assignment of property costs to categories and in the 
apportionment of such costs among the operations, each amount so 
assigned and apportioned is identified as to the account classification 
in which the property is included. Thus, the separated results are 
identified by property accounts and apportionment bases are provided for 
those expenses which are separated on the basis of the apportionment of 
property costs. Similarly, amounts of revenues and expenses assigned 
each of the operations are identified as to account classification.
    (h) The separations procedures described in this part are not to be 
interpreted as indicating what property,

[[Page 467]]

revenues, expenses and taxes, or what items carried in the income, 
reserve and retained earnings accounts, should or should not be 
considered in any investigation or rate proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 36.2  Fundamental principles underlying procedures.

    (a) The following general principles underlie the procedures 
outlined in this part:
    (1) Separations are intended to apportion costs among categories or 
jurisdictions by actual use or by direct assignment.
    (2) Separations are made on the ``actual use'' basis, which gives 
consideration to relative occupancy and relative time measurements.
    (3) In the development of ``actual use'' measurements, measurements 
of use are (i) determined for telecommunications plant or for work 
performed by operating forces on a unit basis (e.g., conversation-
minute-kilometers per message, weighted standard work seconds per call) 
in studies of traffic handled or work performed during a representative 
period for all traffic and (ii) applied to overall traffic volumes, 
i.e., 24-hour rather than busy-hour volumes.
    (b) Underlying the procedures included in this manual for the 
separation of plant costs is an over-all concept which may be described 
as follows:
    (1) Telecommunications plant, in general, is segregable into two 
broad classifications, namely, (i) interexchange plant, which is plant 
used primarily to furnish toll services, and (ii) exchange plant, which 
is plant used primarily to furnish local services.
    (2) Within the interexchange classification, there are three broad 
types of plant, i.e., operator systems, switching plant, and trunk 
transmission equipment. Within the exchange classification there are 
four board types of plant, i.e., operator systems, switching plant, 
truck equipment and subscriber plant. Subscriber plant comprises lines 
to the subscriber.
    (3) In general, the basis for apportioning telecommunications plant 
used jointly for state and interstate operations are:
    (i) Operator work time expressed in weighted standard work seconds 
is the basis for measuring the use of operator systems.
    (ii) Holding-time-minutes is the basis for measuring the use of 
local and toll switching plant.
    (iii) Conversation-minute-kilometers or conversation minutes is the 
basis for measuring the use of interexchange circuit plant and holding-
time minutes is the basis for measuring the use of exchange trunk plant. 
While the use of holding-time-minute-kilometers is the basic fundamental 
allocation factor for interexchange circuit plant and exchange trunk 
plant, the use of conversation-minute-kilometers or conversation-minutes 
for the allocation of interexchange circuit plant and holding-time 
minutes for the allocation of exchange trunk plant are considered 
practical approximations for separations between state and interstate 
operations when related to the broad types of plant classifications used 
herein.
    (iv) Message telecommunications subscriber plant shall be 
apportioned on the basis of a Gross Allocator which assigns 25 percent 
to the interstate jurisdiction and 75 percent to the state jurisdiction.
    (c) Property rented to affiliates, if not substantial in amount, is 
included as used property of the owning company with the associated 
revenues and expenses treated consistently: Also such property rented 
from affiliates is not included with the used property of the company 
making the separations; the rent paid is included in its expenses. If 
substantial in amount, the following treatment is applied:
    (1) In the case of property rented to affiliates, the property and 
related expenses and rent revenues are excluded from the telephone 
operations of the owning company, and
    (2) In the case of property rented from affiliates, the property and 
related expenses are included with, and the rent expenses are excluded 
from, the telephone operations of the company making the separation.
    (d) Property rented to or from non-affiliates is usually to be 
included as used property of the owning company with the associated 
revenues and expenses treated consistently. In the event the amount is 
substantial, the

[[Page 468]]

property involved and the revenues and expenses associated therewith may 
be excluded from or included in the telecommunications operations of the 
company. When required, the cost of property rented to or from non-
affiliates is determined using procedures that are consistent with the 
procedures for the allocation of costs among the operations.
    (e) Costs associated with services or plant billed to another 
company which have once been separated under procedures consistent with 
general principles set forth in this part, and are thus identifiable as 
entirely interstate or State in nature, shall be directly assigned to 
the appropriate operation and jurisdiction.

Sec. 36.3  Freezing of jurisdictional separations category relationships and/or allocation factors.

    (a) Effective July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2011, all local 
exchange carriers subject to part 36 rules shall apportion costs to the 
jurisdictions using their study area and/or exchange specific 
jurisdictional allocation factors calculated during the twelve month 
period ending December 31, 2000, for each of the categories/sub-
categories as specified herein. Direct assignment of private line 
service costs between jurisdictions shall be updated annually. Other 
direct assignment of investment, expenses, revenues or taxes between 
jurisdictions shall be updated annually. Local exchange carriers that 
invest in telecommunications plant categories during the period July 1, 
2001, through June 30, 2011, for which it had no separations allocation 
factors for the twelve month period ending December 31, 2000, shall 
apportion that investment among the jurisdictions in accordance with the 
separations procedures in effect as of December 31, 2000 for the 
duration of the freeze.
    (b) Effective July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2011, local exchange 
carriers subject to price cap regulation, pursuant to Sec. 61.41, shall 
assign costs from the part 32 accounts to the separations categories/
sub-categories, as specified herein, based on the percentage 
relationships of the categorized/sub-categorized costs to their 
associated part 32 accounts for the twelve month period ending December 
31, 2000. If a part 32 account for separations purposes is categorized 
into more than one category, the percentage relationship among the 
categories shall be utilized as well. Local exchange carriers that 
invest in types of telecommunications plant during the period July 1, 
2001, through June 30, 2011, for which it had no separations category 
investment for the twelve month period ending December 31, 2000, shall 
assign such investment to separations categories in accordance with the 
separations procedures in effect as of December 31, 2000. Local exchange 
carriers not subject to price cap regulation, pursuant to Sec. 61.41 of 
this chapter, may elect to be subject to the provisions of Sec. 
36.3(b). Such election must be made prior to July 1, 2001. Local 
exchange carriers electing to become subject to Sec. 36.3(b) shall not 
be eligible to withdraw from such regulation for the duration of the 
freeze. Local exchange carriers participating in Association tariffs, 
pursuant to Sec. 69.601 of this chapter et seq., shall notify the 
Association prior to July 1, 2001, of such intent to be subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 36.3(b). Local exchange carriers not participating 
in Association tariffs shall notify the Commission prior to July 1, 
2001, of such intent to be subject to the provisions of Sec. 36.3(b).
    (c) Effective July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2011, any local 
exchange carrier that sells or otherwise transfers exchanges, or parts 
thereof, to another carrier's study area shall continue to utilize the 
factors and, if applicable, category relationships as specified in 
Sec. Sec. 36.3(a) and (b).
    (d) Effective July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2011, any local 
exchange carrier that buys or otherwise acquires exchanges or part 
thereof, shall calculate new, composite factors and, if applicable, 
category relationships based on a weighted average of both the seller's 
and purchaser's factors and category relationships calculated pursuant 
to Sec. Sec. 36.3(a) and 36.3(b). This weighted average should be based 
on the number of access lines currently being served by the acquiring 
carrier and the number

[[Page 469]]

of access lines in the acquired exchanges.
    (1) To compute the composite allocation factors and, if applicable, 
the composite category percentage relationships of the acquiring 
company, the acquiring carrier shall first sum its existing (pre-
purchase) access lines (A) with the total access lines acquired from 
selling company (B). Then, multiply its factors and category 
relationship percentages by (A/(A+B)) and those of the selling company 
by (B/(A+B)) and sum the results.
    (2) For carriers subject to a freeze of category relationships, the 
acquiring carrier should remove all categories of investment from the 
selling carrier's list of frozen category relationships where no such 
category investment exists within the sold exchange(s). The seller's 
remaining category relationships must then be increased proportionately 
to total 100 percent. Then, the adjusted seller's category relationships 
must be combined with those of the acquiring carrier as specified in 
Sec. 36.3(d)(1) to determine the category relationships for the 
acquiring carrier's post-transfer study area.
    (e) Any local exchange carrier study area converting from average 
schedule company status, as defined in Sec. 69.605(c) of this chapter, 
to cost company status during the period July 1, 2001, through June 30, 
2011, shall, for the first twelve months subsequent to conversion 
categorize the telecommunications plant and expenses and develop 
separations allocation factors in accordance with the separations 
procedures in effect as of December 31, 2000. Effective July 1, 2001 
through June 30, 2011, such companies shall utilize the separations 
allocation factors and account categorization subject to the 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 36.3(a) and (b) based on the category 
relationships and allocation factors for the twelve months subsequent to 
the conversion to cost company status.

FR 12549, Mar. 17, 2004]

                        Central Office Equipment


<R05>
Sec. 36.121  General.

    (a) The costs of central office equipment are carried in the 
following accounts:

Central Office Switching.................  Account 2210.
Non-digital Switching....................  Account 2211.
Digital Electronic Switching.............  Account 2212.
Operator Systems.........................  Account 2220.
Central Office--Transmission.............  Account 2230.
Radio Systems............................  Account 2231.
Circuit Equipment........................  Account 2232.
 

    (b) Records of the cost of central office equipment are usually 
maintained for each study area separately by accounts. However, each 
account frequently includes equipment having more than one use. Also, 
equipment in one account frequently is associated closely with equipment 
in the same building in another account. Therefore, the separations 
procedures for central office equipment have been designed to deal with 
categories of plant rather than with equipment in an account.
    (c) In the separation of the cost of central office equipment among 
the operations, the first step is the assignment of the equipment in 
each study area to categories. The basic method of making this 
assignment is the identification of the equipment assignable to each 
category, and the determination of the cost of the identified equipment 
by analysis of accounting, engineering and other records.
    (1) The cost of common equipment not assigned to a specific 
category, e.g., common power equipment, including emergency power 
equipment, aisle lighting and framework, including distributing frames, 
is distributed among the categories in proportion to the cost of 
equipment, (excluding power equipment not dependent upon common power 
equipment) directly assigned to categories.
    (i) The cost of power equipment used by one category is assigned 
directly to that category, e.g., 130 volt power supply provided for 
circuit equipment. The cost of emergency power equipment protecting only 
power equipment used by one category is also assigned directly to that 
category.
    (ii) Where appropriate, a weighting factor is applied to the cost of 
circuit equipment in distributing the power plant costs not directly 
assigned, in order to reflect the generally greater power use per dollar 
of cost of this equipment.
    (d) The second step is the apportionment of the cost of the 
equipment in each category among the operations

[[Page 471]]

through the application of appropriate use factors or by direct 
assignment.

Sec. 36.122  Categories and apportionment procedures.

    (a) The following categories of central office equipment and 
apportionment procedures therefore are set forth in Sec. Sec. 36.123 
through 36.126.

Operator Systems Equipment.............  Category 1.
Tandem Switching Equipment.............  Category 2.
Local Switching Equipment..............  Category 3.
Circuit Equipment......................  Category 4.
 


<R05>
Sec. 36.123  Operator systems equipment--Category 1.

    (a) Operator systems equipment is contained in Account 2220. It 
includes all types of manual telephone switchboards except tandem 
switchboards and those used solely for recording of calling telephone 
numbers in connection with customer dialed charge traffic. It includes 
all face equipment, terminating relay circuits of trunk and toll line 
circuits, cord circuits, cable turning sections, subscriber line 
equipment, associated toll connecting trunk equipment, number checking 
facilities, ticket distributing systems, calculagraphs, chief operator 
and other desks, operator chairs, and other such equipment.
    (1) Operator systems equipment is generally classified according to 
operating arrangements of which the following are typical:
    (i) Separate toll boards
    (ii) Separate local manual boards
    (iii) Combined local manual and toll boards
    (iv) Combined toll and DSA boards
    (v) Separate DSA and DSB boards
    (vi) Service observing boards
    (vii) Auxiliary service boards
    (viii) Traffic service positions
    (2) If switchboards as set forth in Sec. 36.123(a) are of the key 
pulsing type, the cost of the key pulsing senders, link and trunk finder 
equipment is included with the switchboards.
    (3) DSB boards include the associated DSB dial equipment, such as 
link and sender equipment.
    (4) Traffic service position systems include the common control and 
trunk equipment in addition to the associated groups of positions 
wherever located.
    (5) Effective July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2011, study areas 
subject to price cap regulation, pursuant to Sec. 61.41 of this 
chapter, shall assign the average balance of Account 2220, Operator 
Systems, to the categories/subcategories, as specified in Sec. 
36.123(a)(1), based on the relative percentage assignment of the average 
balance of Account 2220 to these categories/subcategories during the 
twelve month period ending December 31, 2000.
    (6) Effective July 1, 2001 through June 30, 2011, all study areas 
shall apportion the costs assigned to the categories/subcategories, as 
specified in Sec. 36.123(a)(1), among the jurisdictions using the 
relative use measurements for the twelve month period ending December 
31, 2000 for each of the categories/subcategories specified in 
Sec. Sec. 36.123 (b) through 36.123(e).
    (b) The cost of the following operator systems equipment is 
apportioned among the operations on the basis of the relative number of 
weighted standard work seconds handled at the switchboards under 
consideration.
    (1) The following types of switchboards at toll centers are 
generally apportioned individually:
    (i) Separate toll boards. These usually include outward, through and 
inward positions in separate lines and associated inward toll 
switchboard positions in line.
    (ii) Switchboards handling both local and toll, either combined or 
having segregated local and toll positions in the same line.
    (iii) Switchboards handling both toll and DSA, either combined or 
having segregated toll and DSA positions in the same line.
    (iv) Traffic service positions, including separately located groups 
of these positions when associated with a common basic control unit.
    (2) The following types of switchboards at toll centers are 
apportioned individually, or by groups of comparable types of boards for 
each exchange:
    (i) Separate local manual boards. This includes the local positions 
of manual

[[Page 472]]

boards where inward toll positions are in the same line.
    (ii) Separate DSA boards.
    (iii) Separate DSB boards.
    (3) Tributary boards may be treated individually if warranted or 
they may be treated on a group basis.
    (c) Auxiliary service boards generally handle rate and route, 
information, and intercept service at individual or joint positions. The 
cost of these boards is apportioned as follows:
    (1) The cost of separate directory assistance boards is apportioned 
among the operations on the basis of the relative number of weighted 
standard work seconds handled at the boards under consideration. 
Directory assistance weighted standard work seconds are apportioned 
among the operations on the basis of the classification of these 
weighted standard work seconds as follows:
    (i) Directory assistance weighted standard work seconds first are 
classified between calls received over toll directory assistance trunks 
from operators or customers and all other directory assistance calls.
    (ii) The directory assistance weighted standard work seconds of each 
type further are classified separately among the operations on the basis 
of an analysis of a representative sample of directory assistance calls 
of each type with reference to the locations of the calling and called 
stations for each call.
    (2) The cost of separate intercept boards and automated intercept 
systems in the study area is appportioned among the operations on the 
basis of the relative number of subscriber line minutes of use.
    (3) The cost of separate rate and route boards is generally included 
with the cost of the toll boards served and is apportioned with those 
boards.
    (4) Where more than one auxiliary service is handled at an auxiliary 
board, the cost of the board is apportioned among the auxiliary services 
on the basis of the relative number of weighted standard work seconds 
for each service. The cost of that part of the board allocated to each 
auxiliary service is apportioned among the operations in the same manner 
as for a separate auxiliary board.
    (d) The cost of joint exchange and toll service observing boards is 
first apportioned between exchange and toll use on the basis of the 
relative number of exchange and toll service observing units at these 
boards. The cost of separate toll service observing boards and the toll 
portion of joint service observing boards is apportioned between state 
and interstate operations on the basis of the relative number of toll 
minutes of use associated with the toll messages originating in the 
offices observed.
    (e) Traffic Service Position System (TSPS) investments are 
apportioned as follows:
    (1) Operator position investments are apportioned on the basis of 
the relative weighted standard work seconds for the entire TSPS complex.
    (2) Remote trunk arrangement (RTA) investments are apportioned on 
the basis of the relative processor real time (i.e., actual seconds) 
required to process TSPS traffic originating from the end offices served 
by each RTA.
    (3) The remaining investments at the central control location, such 
as the stored program control and memory, is apportioned on the basis of 
the relative processor real time (i.e., actual seconds) for the entire 
TSPS complex.

customer dialed charge traffic is included with Local Switching 
Equipment--Category 3.
    (1) At toll center toll offices, intertoll switching equipment 
comprises equipment in the toll office used in the interconnection of: 
Toll center to toll center circuits; toll center to tributary circuits; 
tributary to tributary circuits; toll center to tandem circuits or in 
the interconnection of the aforementioned types of circuits with trunks 
to local offices in the toll center city, i.e., interconnection with 
toll switching trunks, operator trunks, information trunks, testing 
trunks, etc. Equipment associated with the local office end of such 
trunks is included with local switching equipment or switchboard 
categories as appropriate.
    (2) At tributary offices, this category includes intertoll switching 
equipment similar to that at toll center toll offices if it is used in 
the interconnection of: Tributary to tributary circuits; tributary to 
subtributary circuits; subtributary to subtributary circuits; toll 
center to subtributary circuits; or if it is used jointly in the 
interconnection of any of the aforementioned types of circuits and in 
the interconnection of such toll circuits with trunk circuits for the 
handling of traffic terminating in the tributary office. Where 
comparable equipment has no joint use but is used only for the handling 
of traffic terminating in the tributary office, it is included in the 
local switching equipment category.
    (3) At all switching entities, this category includes intertoll 
switching equipment similar to that at toll center toll offices if it is 
used in the interconnection of switched private line trunks or TWX 
switching plant trunks when these functions are in addition to the 
message telephone switching function. Switching entities wholly 
dedicated to switching of special services are assigned to Category 3--
Local Switching Equipment.
    (b) The costs of central office equipment items assigned this 
category are to be directly assigned when possible. When direct 
assignment is not possible the costs shall be apportioned among the 
operations on the basis of the relative number of study area minutes of 
use of this equipment.
    (c) Effective July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2011, study areas 
subject to price cap regulation, pursuant to Sec. 61.41 of this 
chapter, shall assign the average balances of Accounts 2210, 2211, and 
2212 to Category 2, Tandem Switching Equipment based on the relative 
percentage assignment of the average balances of Account 2210, 2211, 
2212, and 2215 to Category 2, Tandem Switching Equipment during the 
twelve month period ending December 31, 2000.
    (d) Effective July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2011, all study areas 
shall apportion costs in Category 2, Tandem Switching Equipment, among 
the jurisdictions using the relative number of study area minutes of 
use, as specified in Sec. 36.124(b), for the twelve month period ending 
December 31, 2000. Direct assignment of any subcategory of Category 2 
Tandem Switching Equipment between jurisdictions shall be updated 
annually.

Sec. 36.125  Local switching equipment--Category 3.

    (a) Local switching equipment is included in accounts 2210, 2211, 
and 2212. It comprises all central office switching equipment not 
assigned other categories. Examples of local switching equipment are 
basic switching train, toll connecting trunk equipment, interlocal 
trunks, tandem trunks, terminating senders used for toll completion, 
toll completing train, call reverting equipment, weather and time of day 
service equipment, and switching equipment at electronic analog or 
digital remote line locations. Equipment used for the identification, 
recording and timing of customer dialed charge traffic, or switched 
private line traffic (e.g. transmitters, recorders, call identity 
indexers, perforators, ticketers, detectors, mastertimes) switchboards 
used solely for recording of calling telephone numbers in connection 
with customer dialed charge traffic, or switched private line traffic 
(or both) is included in this local switching category. Equipment 
provided and used primarily for operator dialed toll or customer dialed 
charge traffic except such equipment included in Category 2

[[Page 474]]

Tandem Switching Equipment is also included in this local switching 
category. This includes such items as directors translators, sender 
registers, out trunk selectors and facilities for toll intercepting and 
digit absorption. Special services switching equipment which primarily 
performs the switching function for special services (e.g. switching 
equipment, TWX concentrators and switchboards) is also included in this 
local switching category.
    (1) Local office, as used in Sec. 36.125, comprises one or more 
local switching entities of the same equipment type (e.g., step-by-step, 
No. 5 Crossbar) in an individual location. A local switching entity 
comprises that local central office equipment of the same type which has 
a common intermediate distributing frame, market group or other 
separately identifiable switching unit serving one or more prefixes (NNX 
codes).
    (2) A host/remote local switching complex is composed of an 
electronic analog or digital host office and all of its remote 
locations. A host/remote local switching complex is treated as one local 
office. The current jurisdictional definition of an exchange will apply.
    (3) Dial equipment minutes of use (DEM) is defined as the minutes of 
holding time of the originating and terminating local switching 
equipment. Holding time is defined in the Glossary.
    (4) The interstate allocation factor is the percentage of local 
switching investment apportioned to the interstate jurisdiction.
    (5) The interstate DEM factor is the ratio of the interstate DEM to 
the total DEM. A weighted interstate DEM factor is the product of 
multiplying a weighting factor, as defined in paragraph (f) of this 
section, to the interstate DEM factor. The state DEM factor is the ratio 
of the state DEM to the total DEM.
    (b) Beginning January 1, 1993, Category 3 investment for study areas 
with 50,000 or more access lines is apportioned to the interstate 
jurisdiction on the basis of the interstate DEM factor. Category 3 
investment for study areas with 50,000 or more access lines is 
apportioned to the state jurisdiction on the basis of the state DEM 
factor.
    (c)-(e) [Reserved]
    (f) Beginning January 1, 1998, for study areas with fewer than 
50,000 access lines, Category 3 investment is apportioned to the 
interstate jurisdiction by the application of an interstate allocation 
factor that is the lesser of either .85 or the sum of the interstate DEM 
factor specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, and the difference 
between the 1996 interstate DEM factor and the 1996 interstate DEM 
factor multiplied by a weighting factor as determined by the table 
below. The Category 3 investment that is not assigned to the interstate 
jurisdiction pursuant to this paragraph is assigned to the state 
jurisdiction.

    (j) If the number of a study area's access lines increases such 
that, under Sec. 36.125(f), the weighted interstate DEM factor for 1997 
or any successive year would be reduced, that lowered weighted 
interstate DEM factor shall be applied to the study area's 1996 
unweighted interstate DEM factor to derive a new local switching support 
factor. If the number of a study area's

[[Page 475]]

access lines decreases or has decreased such that, under Sec. 
36.125(f), the weighted interstate DEM factor for 2010 or any successive 
year would be raised, that higher weighted interstate DEM factor shall 
be applied to the study area's 1996 unweighted interstate DEM factor to 
derive a new local switching support factor.

                        Cable and Wire Facilities


<R05>
Sec. 36.151  General.

    (a) Cable and Wire Facilities, Account 2410, includes the following 
types of communications plant in service: Poles and antenna supporting 
structures, aerial cable, underground cable, buried cable, submarine 
cable, deep sea cable, intrabuilding network cable, aerial wire and 
conduit systems.
    (b) For separations purposes, it is necessary to analyze the cable 
and wire facilities classified in subordinate records in order to 
determine their assignment to the categories listed in the following 
paragraphs.
    (c) In the separation of the cost of cable and wire facilities among 
the operations, the first step is the assignment of the facilities to 
certain categories. The basic method of making this assignment is the 
identification of the facilities assignable to each category and the 
determination of the cost of the facilities so identified. Because of 
variations among companies in the character of the facilities and 
operating conditions, and in the accounting and engineering records 
maintained, the detailed methods followed, of necessity, will vary among 
the companies. The general principles to be followed, however, will be 
the same for all companies.
    (d) The second step is the apportionment of the cost of the 
facilities in each category among the operations through the application 
of appropriate factors or by direct assignment.

Sec. 36.152  Categories of Cable and Wire Facilities (C&WF).

    (a) C&WF are basically divided between exchange and interexchange. 
Exchange C&WF consists of the following categories:
    (1) Exchange Line C&WF Excluding Wideband--Category 1--This category 
includes C&W facilities between local central offices and subscriber 
premises used for message telephone, private line, local channels, and 
for circuits between control terminals and radio stations providing very 
high frequency maritime service or urban or highway mobile service.
    (2) Wideband and Exchange Trunk C&WF--Category 2--This category 
includes all wideband, including Exchange Line Wideband and C&WF between 
local central offices and Wideband facilities. It also includes C&WF 
between central offices or other switching points used by any common 
carrier for interlocal trunks wholly within an exchange or metropolitan 
service area, interlocal trunks with one or both terminals outside a 
metropolitan service area carrying some exchange traffic, toll 
connecting trunks, tandem trunks principally carrying exchange traffic, 
the exchange trunk portion of WATS access lines, the exchange trunk 
portion of private line local channels, and the exchange trunk portion 
of circuits between control terminals and radio stations providing very 
high frequency maritime service or urban or highway mobile service.
    (3) The procedures for apportioning the cost of exchange cable and 
wire facilites among the operations are set forth in Sec. Sec. 36.154 
and 36.155.
    (b) Interexchange C&WF--Category 3--This category includes the C&WF 
used for message toll and toll private line services. It includes cable 
and wire facilities carrying intertoll circuits, tributary circuits, the 
interexchange channel portion of special service circuits, circuits 
between control terminals and radio stations used for overseas or 
coastal harbor service, interlocal trunks between offices in the 
different exchange or metropolitan service areas carrying only message 
toll traffic and certain tandem trunks which carry principally message 
toll traffic.
    (1) The procedures for apportioning the cost of interexchange cable 
and wire facilities among the operations are set forth in Sec. 36.156.
    (c) Host/Remote Message C&WF--Category 4--This category includes the 
cost of message host/remote location C&WF for which a message circuit 
switching function is performed at the host central office. It applies 
to C&WF between host offices and all remote locations. The procedures 
for apportioning the cost of these facilities among the operations are 
set forth in Sec. 36.157.
    (d) Effective July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2011, study areas 
subject to price cap regulation, pursuant to Sec. 61.41, shall assign 
the average balance of Account 2410 to the categories/subcategories, as 
specified in Sec. Sec. 36.152(a) through (c), based on the relative 
percentage assignment of the average balance of Account 2410 to these

<R05>
Sec. 36.153  Assignment of Cable and Wire Facilities (C&WF) to categories.

    (a) Cable consists of: Aerial cable, underground cable, buried 
cable, submarine cable, deep sea cable and intrabuilding network cable. 
Where an entire cable or aerial wire is assignable to one category, its 
cost and quantity are, where practicable, directly assigned.
    (1) Cable. (i) There are two basic methods for assigning the cost of 
cable to the various categories. Both of them are on the basis of 
conductor cross section. The methods are as follows:
    (A) By section of cable, uniform as to makeup and relative use by 
categories. From an analysis of cable engineering and assignment 
records, determine in terms of equivalent gauge the number of pairs in 
use or reserved, for each category. The corresponding percentages of 
use, or reservation, are applied to the cost of the section of cable, 
i.e., sheath meters times unit cost per meter, to obtain the cost 
assignable to each category.
    (B) By using equivalent pair kilometers, i.e., pair kilometers 
expressed

[[Page 480]]

in terms of equivalent gauge. From an analysis of cable engineering and 
assignment records, determine the equivalent pair kilometers in use for 
each category by type of facility, e.g., quadded, paired. The equivalent 
pair kilometers are then divided by a cable fill factor to obtain the 
equivalent pair kilometers in plant. The total equivalent pair 
kilometers in plant assigned to each category is summarized by type of 
facility, e.g., quadded and paired, and priced at appropriate average 
unit costs per equivalent pair kilometer in plant. If desired, this 
study may be made in terms of circuit kilometers rather than physical 
pair kilometers, with average cost and fill data consistent with the 
basis of the facilities kilometer count.
    (ii) In the assignment of the cost of cable under the two basic 
methods described in Sec. 36.153(a)(1)(i) consideration is given to the 
following:
    (A) Method (A) described in Sec. 36.153(a)(1)(i)(A) will probably 
be found more desirable where there is a relatively small amount of 
cable of variable make-up and use by categories. Conversely, method (B) 
described in Sec. 36.153(a)(1)(i)(B) will probably be more desirable 
where there is a large amount of cable of variable make-up and use by 
categories. However, in some cases a combination of both methods may be 
desirable.
    (B) It will be desirable in some cases to determine the amount 
assignable to a particular category by deducting from the total the sum 
of the amounts assigned to all other categories.
    (C) For use in the assignment of poles to categories, the equivalent 
sheath kilometers of aerial cable assigned to each category are 
determined. For convenience, these quantities are determined in 
connection with assignment of cable costs.
    (D) Where an entire cable is assignable to one category, its costs 
and quantity are, where practicable, directly assigned.
    (iii) For cables especially arranged for high-frequency transmission 
such as shielded, disc-insulated and coaxial, recognition is given to 
the additional costs which are charged to the high-frequency complement.
    (2) Cable Loading. (i) Methods for assigning the cost of loading 
coils, cases, etc., to categories are comparable with those used in 
assigning the associated cable to categories. Loading associated with 
cable which is directly assigned to a given category is also directly 
assigned. The remaining loading is assigned to categories in either of 
the following bases:
    (A) By an analysis of the use made of the loading facilities where a 
loading coil case includes coils assignable to more than one category, 
e.g., in the case of a single gauge uniformly loaded section, the 
percentage used in the related cable assignment are applicable, or
    (B) By pricing out each category by determining the pair meters of 
loaded pairs assigned to each category and multiplying by the unit cost 
per pair meter of loading by type.
    (3) Other Cable Plant. (i) In view of the small amounts involved, 
the cost of all protected terminals and gas pressure contactor terminals 
in the toll cable subaccounts is assigned to the appropriate 
Interexchange Cable & Wire Facilities categories. The cost of all other 
terminals in the exchange and toll cable subaccounts is assigned to 
Exchange Cable and Wire Facilities.
    (b) Aerial Wire. (1) The cost of wire accounted for as exchange is 
assigned to the appropriate Exchange Cable & Wire Facilities categories. 
The cost of wire accounted for as toll, which is used for exchange, is 
also assigned to the appropriate Exchange Cable & Wire Facilities 
categories. The cost of the remaining wire accounted for as toll is 
assigned to the appropriate Interexchange Cable & Wire Facilities 
categories as described in Sec. 36.156. For companies not maintaining 
exchange and toll subaccounts, it is necessary to review the plant 
records and identify wire plant by use. The cost of wire used for 
providing circuits directly assignable to a category is assigned to that 
category. The cost of wire used for providing circuit facilities jointly 
used for exchange and interexchange lines is assigned to categories on 
the basis of the relative number of circuit kilometers involved.
    (c) Poles and Antenna Supporting Structures. (1) In the assignment 
of

[[Page 481]]

these costs, anchors, guys, crossarms, antenna supporting structure, and

<R05>
Sec. 36.412  Apportionment procedures.

    (a) For apportionment purposes, the expenses in this account are 
segregated into two groups as follows: (1) Operating Federal, State and 
local income taxes and (2) all other operating taxes.
    (b) Operating Federal, State and local income taxes are apportioned 
among the operations on the basis of the approximate net taxable income 
(positive or negative) applicable to each of the operations. The 
approximate net taxable income from each of the operations is the 
summation of the following amounts apportioned to each operation by 
means of the procedures set forth in this Manual:
    (1) Operating revenues,
    (2) Less operating expenses,
    (3) Less operating taxes except the net income tax being apportioned 
and except any other tax not treated as a deductible item in the 
determination of taxable net income for this purpose.
    (4) Less operating fixed charges.
    (i) The amount of fixed charges attributable to the operations is 
obtained by subtracting the tax component (positive or negative) 
attributable to other than the operating fixed charges, i.e., fixed 
charges on non-operating investments are that proportion of total fixed 
charges which non-operating net investments are of total operating and 
non-operating net investments.
    (ii) Operating fixed charges including interest on Rural Telephone 
Bank Stock are apportioned among the operations on the basis of the 
separation of the cost of telephone plant less appropriate reserves.
    (c) Other operating taxes should be directly assigned to the 
appropriate jurisdiction where possible, e.g., Local Gross Receipts may 
be directly identified as applicable to one jurisdiction. Where direct 
assignment is not feasible, these expenses should be apportioned among 
the operations on the basis of the separation of the cost of 
Telecommunications Plant in Service--Account 2001.

Sec. 36.421  Equal access expenses.

    (a) Equal access expenses include only initial incremental pre-
subscription costs and other initial incremental expenditures related 
directly to the provision of equal access, that would not be required to 
upgrade the capabilities of the office involved absent the provision of 
equal access. Equal access expenses are limited to such expenditures for 
converting central offices that serve competitive interexchange carriers 
or where there has been a bona fide request for conversion to equal 
access.
    (b) Equal access expenses are apportioned between the jurisdictions 
by first segregating them from all other expenses in the primary 
accounts and then allocating them on the same basis as equal access 
investment.

<R05>
Sec. 36.601  General.

    (a) The term Universal Service Fund in this subpart refers only to 
the support for loop-related costs included in Sec. 36.621. The term 
Universal Service in part 54 of this chapter refers to the comprehensive 
discussion of the Commission's rules implementing section 254 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 254, which addresses 
universal service support for rural, insular, and high cost areas, low-
income consumers, schools and libraries, and heath care providers. The 
expense adjustment calculated pursuant to this subpart F shall be added 
to interstate expenses and deducted from state expenses after expenses 
and taxes have been apportioned pursuant to subpart D of this part. 
Beginning January 1, 1998, the expense adjustment calculated pursuant to 
this subpart will be administered and funded through the new universal 
service system discussed in part 54 of this chapter.
    (b) The expense adjustment will be computed on the basis of data for 
a preceding calendar year which may be updated at the option of the 
carrier pursuant to Sec. 36.612(a).
    (c) Until June 30, 2001, the annual amount of the total nationwide 
expense adjustment shall consist of the amounts calculated pursuant to 
Sec. 54.309 of this chapter and the amounts calculated pursuant to this 
subpart F. The annual amount of the total nationwide loop cost expense 
adjustment calculated pursuant to this subpart F shall not exceed the 
amount of the total loop cost expense adjustment for the immediately 
preceding calendar year, increased by a rate equal to the rate of 
increase in the total number of working loops during the calendar year 
preceding the July 31st filing. The total loop cost expense adjustment 
shall consist of the loop cost expense adjustments, including amounts 
calculated pursuant to Sec. 36.612(a) and Sec. 36.631. The rate of 
increase in total working loops shall be based upon the difference 
between the number of total working loops on December 31 of the calendar 
year preceding the July 31st filing and the number of total working 
loops on December 31 of the second calendar year preceding that filing, 
both determined by the company's submissions pursuant to Sec. 36.611. 
Beginning January 1, 2000, non-rural incumbent local exchange carriers 
and, eligible telecommunications carriers serving lines in the service 
area of non-rural incumbent local exchange carriers, shall only receive 
support pursuant to this subpart F to the extent that they qualify 
pursuant to Sec. 54.311 of this chapter for interim hold-harmless 
support.

[[Page 498]]

increase in total working loops shall be based upon the difference 
between the number of total working loops on December 31 of the calendar 
year preceding the July 31st filing and the number of total working 
loops on December 31 of the second calendar year preceding that filing, 
both determined by the company's submissions pursuant to Sec. 36.611. 
Non-rural incumbent local exchange carriers and eligible 
telecommunications carriers serving lines in the service area of non-

Sec. 36.603  Calculation of rural incumbent local exchange carrier portion of nationwide loop cost expense adjustment.

    (a) Effective July 1, 2001, the rural incumbent local exchange 
carrier portion of the annual nationwide loop cost expense adjustment 
will be recomputed by the fund administrator as if the indexed cap 
calculated pursuant to Sec. 36.601(c) and the corporate operations 
expense limitation calculated pursuant to Sec. 36.621 had not been in 
effect for the calendar year 2000. For the period July 1, 2001, to 
December 31, 2001, the annualized amount of the rural incumbent local 
exchange carrier portion of the nationwide loop cost expense adjustment 
calculated pursuant to this subpart F shall not exceed the non-capped 
amount of the total rural incumbent local exchange carrier loop cost 
expense adjustment for the calendar year 2000, multiplied times one plus 
the Rural Growth Factor calculated pursuant to Sec. 36.604. For the 
period January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2002, the annual amount of the 
rural incumbent local exchange carrier portion of the nationwide loop 
cost expense adjustment calculated pursuant to this subpart F shall not 
exceed the non-capped amount of the total rural incumbent local exchange 
carrier loop cost expense adjustment for calendar year 2000, multiplied 
times one plus the Rural Growth Factor for 2001, which then shall be 
multiplied times one plus the Rural Growth Factor for 2002. Beginning 
January 1, 2003, the annual amount of the rural incumbent local exchange 
carrier portion of the nationwide loop cost expense adjustment 
calculated pursuant to this subpart F shall not exceed the amount of the 
total rural incumbent local exchange carrier loop cost expense 
adjustment for the immediately preceding calendar year, multiplied times 
one plus the Rural Growth Factor calculated pursuant to Sec. 36.604.
    (b) The annual rural incumbent local exchange carrier portion of the 
nationwide loop cost expense adjustment shall be reduced to reflect the 
transfer

[[Page 499]]

of rural incumbent local exchange carrier access lines that are eligible 
for expense adjustments pursuant to Sec. 36.631. The reduction shall 
equal the amount of the Sec. 36.631 expense adjustment available to the 
transferred access lines at the time of the transfer and shall be 
effective in the next calendar quarter after the access lines are 
transferred.
    (c) Safety net additive support calculated pursuant to Sec. 36.605, 
and transferred high-cost support and safety valve support calculated 
pursuant to Sec. 54.305 of this chapter shall not be included in the 
rural incumbent local exchange carrier portion of the annual nationwide 
loop cost expense adjustment.

Sec. 36.604  Calculation of the rural growth factor.

    The Rural Growth Factor (RGF) is equal to the sum of the annual 
percentage change in the United States Department of Commerce's Gross 
Domestic Product--Chained Price Index (GPD-CPI) plus the percentage 
change in the total number of rural incumbent local exchange carrier 
working loops during the calendar year preceding the July 31st filing 
submitted pursuant to Sec. 36.611. The percentage change in total rural 
incumbent local exchange carrier working loops shall be based upon the 
difference between the total number of rural incumbent local exchange 
carrier working loops on December 31 of the calendar year preceding the 
July 31st filing and the total number of rural incumbent local exchange 
carrier working loops on December 31 of the second calendar year 
preceding that filing, both determined by the company's submissions 
pursuant to Sec. 36.611. Loops acquired by rural incumbent local 
exchange carriers shall not be included in the RGF calculation.

Sec. 36.605  Calculation of safety net additive.

    (a) ``Safety net additive support.'' A rural incumbent local 
exchange carrier shall receive safety net additive support if it 
satisfies the conditions set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. 
Safety net additive support is support available to rural telephone 
companies, as conditioned in paragraph (c) of this section, in addition 
to support calculated pursuant to Sec. 36.631. Safety net additive 
support shall not be available to rural telephone companies for 
exchange(s) that are subject to Sec. 54.305 of this chapter.
    (b) Calculation of safety net additive support: Safety net additive 
support is equal to the amount of capped support calculated pursuant to 
this subpart F in the qualifying year minus the amount of support in the 
year prior to qualifying for support subtracted from the difference 
between the uncapped expense adjustment for the study area in the 
qualifying year minus the uncapped expense adjustment in the year prior 
to qualifying for support as shown in the following equation: Safety net 
additive support = (Uncapped support in the qualifying year-Uncapped 
support in the base year)-(Capped support in the qualifying year-Amount 
of support received in the base year).
    (c) Operation of safety net additive support: (1) In any year in 
which the total carrier loop cost expense adjustment is limited by the 
provisions of Sec. 36.603 a rural incumbent local exchange carrier 
shall receive safety net additive support as calculated in paragraph (b) 
of this section, if in any study area, the rural incumbent local 
exchange carrier realizes growth in end of period Telecommunications 
Plant in Service (TPIS), as prescribed in Sec. 32.2001 of this chapter, 
on a per loop basis, of at least 14 percent more than the study area's 
TPIS per loop investment at the end of the prior period.
    (2) If paragraph (c)(1) of this section is met, the rural incumbent 
local exchange carrier must notify the Administrator; failure to 
properly notify the Administrator of eligibility shall result in 
disqualification of that study area for safety net additive, requiring 
the rural incumbent local exchange carrier to again meet the eligibility 
requirements in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for that study area in 
a subsequent period.
    (3) Upon completion of verification by the Administrator that the 
study

[[Page 500]]

area meets the stated criterion in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) of this 
section, the Administrator shall:
    (i) Pay to any qualifying rural telephone company, safety net 
additive support for the qualifying study area in accordance with the 
calculation set forth in paragraph (b) of this section; and
    (ii) Continue to pay safety net additive support in any of the four 
succeeding years in which the total carrier loop expense adjustment is 
limited by the provisions of Sec. 36.603. Safety net additive support 
in the succeeding four years shall be the lesser of:
    (A) The sum of capped support and the safety net additive support 
received in the qualifying year; or
    (B) The rural telephone company's uncapped support.

            Calculation of Loop Costs for Expense Adjustment


<R05>
Sec. 36.621  Study area total unseparated loop cost.

    (a) For the purpose of calculating the expense adjustment, the study 
area total unseparated loop cost equals the sum of the following:
    (1) Return component for net unseparated Exchange Line C&WF 
subcategory 1.3 investment and Exchange Line CO Circuit Equipment 
Category 4.13 investment. This amount is calculated by deducting the 
accumulated depreciation and noncurrent deferred

[[Page 502]]

Federal income taxes attributable to C&WF subcategory 1.3 investment and 
Exchange Line Category 4.13 circuit investment reported pursuant to 
Sec. 36.611(b) from the gross investment in Exchange Line C&WF 
subcategory 1.3 and CO Category 4.13 reported pursuant to Sec. 
36.611(a) to obtain the net unseparated C&WF subcategory 1.3 investment, 
and CO Category 4.13 investment. The net unseparated C&WF subcategory 
1.3 investment and CO Category 4.13 investment is multiplied by the 
study area's authorized interstate rate of return.
    (2) Depreciation expense attributable to C&WF subcategory 1.3 
investment, and CO Category 4.13 investment as reported in Sec. 
36.611(c).
    (3) Maintenance expense attributable to C&WF subcategory 1.3 
investment, and CO Category 4.13 investment as reported in Sec. 
36.611(d).
    (4) Corporate Operations Expenses, Operating Taxes and the benefits 
and rent portions of operating expenses, as reported in Sec. 36.611(e) 
attributable to investment in C&WF Category 1.3 and COE Category 4.13. 
This amount is calculated by multiplying the total amount of these 
expenses and taxes by the ratio of the unseparated gross exchange plant 
investment in C&WF Category 1.3 and COE Category 4.13, as reported in 
Sec. 36.611(a), to the unseparated gross telecommunications plant 
investment, as reported in Sec. 36.611(f). Total Corporate Operations 
Expense, for purposes of calculating universal service support payments 
beginning July 1, 2001, shall be limited to the lesser of:
    (i) The actual average monthly per-loop Corporate Operations 
Expense; or
    (ii) A monthly per-loop amount computed according to paragraphs 
(a)(4)(ii)(A), (a)(4)(ii)(B), (a)(4)(ii)(C), and (a)(4)(ii)(D) of this 
section. To the extent that some carriers' corporate operations expenses 
are disallowed pursuant to these limitations, the national average 
unseparated cost per loop shall be adjusted accordingly.
    (A) For study areas with 6,000 or fewer working loops the amount 
monthly per working loop shall be $33.30853-(.00246 x the number of 
working loops), or, $50,000 / the number of working loops, whichever is 
greater;
    (B) For study areas with more than 6,000 but fewer than 18,006 
working loops, the monthly amount per working loop shall be $3.83195 + 
(88,429.20 / the number of working loops); and
    (C) For study areas with 18,006 or more working loops, the monthly 
amount per working loop shall be $8.74472.
    (D) Beginning January 1, 2002, the monthly per-loop amount computed 
according to paragraphs (a)(4)(ii)(A), (a)(4)(ii)(B), and (a)(4)(ii)(C) 
of this section shall be adjusted each year to reflect the annual 
percentage change in the United States Department of Commerce's Gross 
Domestic Product-Chained Price Index (GDP-CPI).

Sec. 36.622  National and study area average unseparated loop costs.

    (a) National Average Unseparated Loop Cost per Working Loop. Except 
as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, this is equal to the sum 
of the Loop Costs for each study area in the country as calculated 
pursuant to Sec. 36.621(a) divided by the sum of the working loops 
reported in Sec. 36.611(h) for each study area in the country. The 
national average unseparated loop cost per working loop shall be 
calculated by the National Exchange Carrier Association. Effective July 
1, 2001, the national average unseparated loop cost for purposes of 
calculating expense adjustments for rural incumbent local exchange 
carriers, as that term is defined in Sec. 54.5 of this chapter, is 
frozen at $240.00.
    (1) The National Average Unseparated Loop Cost per Working Loop 
shall be recalculated by the National Exchange Carrier Association to 
reflect the September, December, and March update filings.

reflect changes in the size of the Universal Service Fund resulting from 
adjustments calculated pursuant to Sec. 36.612(a) made during the 
previous year. If the resulting amount exceeds the previous year's fund 
size, the difference will be added to the amount calculated pursuant to 
Sec. 36.631 (c) and (d) for the following year. If the adjustments made 
during the previous year result in a decrease in the size of the funding 
requirement, the difference will be subtracted from the amount 
calculated pursuant to Sec. 36.631 (c) and (d) for the following year.
