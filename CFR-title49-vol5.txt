                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Sec. 453.1  Unsafe and noncomplying containers subject to detention or control.

    (a) Any container used in or offered for movement in international 
transport which does not have a valid safety approval plate attached to 
it is subject to detention or other control by a District Commander or 
Captain of the Port. However, upon receipt of evidence that a container 
which does not have a valid safety approval plate attached to it meets 
the standards of the convention, the District Commander or

[[Page 16]]

Captain of the Port may authorize limited movement of such container 
under conditions he deems appropriate. This paragraph becomes effective 
on January 3, 1979 for new containers and on January 1, 1985 for 
existing containers.
    (b) If a District Commander or Captain of the Port finds that a 
container used in or offered for movement in international transport, 
even though it has a valid safety approval plate attached to it, is in a 
condition that creates an obvious risk to safety, he issues a detention 
order causing the container to be removed from service until it is 
restored to a safe condition. In addition to removing a container from 
transport, a detention order may require any special handling, including 
unloading prior to movement, necessary to ensure safety.
    (c) If a District Commander or Captain of the Port finds that a 
container used or offered for movement in international transport has 
not been timely examined, the District Commander or Captain of the Port 
affixes to the container, at a place on the container where it will be 
readily noticeable to anyone loading or unloading the container, a mark 
or tag indicating that the container must be examined before being 
reloaded and again used in international transport. The mark or tag 
affixed by the District Commander or Captain of the Port indicates the 
place and the date on which it was affixed, and is capable of remaining 
legible and in place for at least 12 months. Such mark or tag must not 
be removed until the container is examined in accordance with Sec. 452.3 
of this subchapter. If a District Commander or Captain of the Port finds 
that container marked or tagged as provided for in this paragraph was 
reloaded and used or offered for movement in international transport 
without having been examined, the District Commander or Captain of the 
Port issues a detention order causing the container to be removed from 
service until it is brought into compliance.

[53 FR 26261, July 12, 1988]

[[Page 29]]


<R05>
Sec. 510.5  Information gathering hearings.

    (a) NHTSA may issue a subpoena to compel any person, sole 
proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or other entity to provide 
information at an information gathering hearing. The subpoenas are used 
for the purpose of obtaining testimony from a witness under oath and 
obtaining relevant documents and things. The Administrator, or a NHTSA 
employee designated by the Administrator, presides at the hearing. 
Information gathering hearings are open to the public unless the 
presiding officer rules otherwise, and the hearings are stenographically 
reported.
    (b) In addition to the presiding officer, one or more other persons 
may comprise the panel. Each member of the panel may question any 
witness at the hearing. No person who is not a member of the panel may 
ask questions of a witness. However, any person may submit to the panel, 
in writing, proposed questions to be asked of a witness. A member of the 
panel may pose these questions to the witness if that member deems the 
questions useful and appropriate. Proposed questions may be submitted to 
the panel at any time before or during the course of the hearing.
    (c) The stenographic record of each witness's testimony will be 
available to the public, unless the testimony was not given publicly and 
the witness requests confidential treatment for some or all of his or 
her testimony. When an oral request for confidential treatment is made 
during the course of a witness's testimony, the presiding officer may 
order the hearing closed to the public at that point and continue the 
questioning of the witness, or may note the request for confidentiality 
and direct the witness not to answer the question at that time, but 
require the witness to answer the question in writing within some 
specified period, or take such other action as the presiding officer 
deems appropriate. If a request for confidential treatment is made, the 
release of the record is governed by the applicable laws or regulations 
relating to the handling of allegedly confidential information. To the 
extent that some or all of a witness's testimony is not publicly 
available, that witness may procure a copy of his or her testimony as 
recorded upon payment of lawfully prescribed costs.
    (d)(1) Any person who is required by subpoena or designated by an 
entity that is required by subpoena to provide information at an 
information gathering hearing conducted under this section may be 
accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel. Any member of the bar 
of a Federal court or the courts of any State or Territory of the United 
States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the District of Columbia, 
and any representative, official, or employee of the sole 
proprietorship, partnership, corporation or other entity under subpoena 
may act as counsel.
    (2) A witness appearing in response to subpoena may confer in 
confidence with his or her counsel or representative concerning any 
questions asked of the witness. If such witness, counsel, or 
representative objects to a question, he or she shall state the 
objection and basis therefor on the record.
    (e) The presiding officer at an information gathering hearing takes 
all necessary action to regulate the course of the hearing, to avoid 
delay, and to assure that reasonable standards of orderly and ethical 
conduct are maintained. In any case in which counsel for or a 
representative of a witness has refused to comply with the presiding 
officer's directions, or to adhere to reasonable standards of orderly 
and ethical conduct in the course of a hearing, the presiding officer 
states on the record the reasons given, if any, for the refusal and, if 
the presiding officer is someone other than the Administrator, 
immediately reports the refusal to the Administrator. The Administrator 
thereupon takes such action as the circumstances warrant.
    (f) Where appropriate, the procedures established in this subsection 
may be utilized in informal hearings conducted by NHTSA pursuant to its 
authority under sections 152 and 156 of the Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1412, 
1416) to receive data, views and arguments concerning alleged safety-
related defects. The rights accorded to witnesses in this subsection may 
also be accorded to witnesses who appear voluntarily at such hearings.

[[Page 30]]


<R05>
Sec. 510.6  Administrative depositions.

    (a) NHTSA may issue a subpoena to compel any person, sole 
proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or other entity to provide 
information as a witness at an administrative deposition. These 
depositions are for the purpose of obtaining information from the 
witness under oath and receiving documents and things relevant to an 
agency investigation. These depositions shall be taken before an officer 
authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States or of 
the place where the deposition is taken. Unless otherwise ordered by the 
Administrator, administrative depositions are closed to the public.
    (b) Any person who is required by subpoena or designated by an 
entity that is required by subpoena to produce documents or things or to 
give testimony as a witness at an administrative deposition conducted 
under this section may be accompanied, represented, and advised by 
counsel. Any member of the bar or a Federal court or the courts of any 
State or Territory of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, or the District of Columbia and any representative, official, or 
employee of the person, sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, 
or other entity under subpoena may act as counsel.
    (c) During an administrative deposition:
    (1) The presiding officer before whom the deposition is to be taken 
puts the witness on oath and personally, or by someone acting under his 
or her direction and in his or her presence, records the testimony of 
the witness. The testimony is stenographically reported.
    (2) After NHTSA has examined the witness at the deposition, that 
witness' counsel or representative may examine the witness. NHTSA may 
then reexamine the witness and the witnesses' counsel or representative 
may reexamine the witness and so forth, as appropriate.
    (3) A witness appearing in response to a subpoena may confer in 
confidence with his or her counsel or representative concerning any 
questions asked of the witness. If such witness, counsel, or 
representative objects to a question, he or she shall state the 
objection and the basis therefor on the record.
    (4) Objections to the qualifications of the officer taking the 
deposition, or to the manner of taking it, or, to the evidence 
presented, and any other objection to the proceedings shall be noted by 
the officer on the record, and shall be treated as continuing. Evidence 
objected to shall be taken subject to the objections. Errors and 
irregularities occurring at a deposition in the manner of the taking of 
the deposition, in the form of questions or answers, or in the oath or 
affirmation, and errors of any kind which might be obviated, removed, or 
cured if promptly presented shall be deemed to be waived unless 
reasonable objection is made thereto at the taking of the deposition.
    (5) If the witness refuses to answer any question or answers 
evasively, or if the witness or his or her counsel engages in conduct 
likely to delay or obstruct the administrative deposition, such refusal, 
evasive answer or conduct shall be a failure to comply with the subpoena 
issued to the witness.
    (6) Upon completion of the examination of a witness, the witness may 
clarify on the record any of his or her answers.
    (d) The transcript of the testimony of a witness who testified in 
response to a subpoena at an administrative deposition is submitted to 
the witness for signature, unless the witness waives the right to sign 
the transcript. If a witness desires to make any changes in the form or 
substance contained in the transcript, the witness shall submit, 
together with the transcript, a separate document setting forth the 
changes and stating the reasons for such changes. If the deposition is 
not signed by the witness within 30 days of its submission to the 
witness, or such other period as the NHTSA may designate, the officer 
before whom the deposition was taken or a NHTSA employee signs the 
transcript and states on the record the fact of the waiver of the right 
to sign or the fact of the witness' unavailability or inability or 
refusal to sign together with the reasons, if any, given therefor.
    (e) The transcript of the testimony of a witness will be inspected 
by NHTSA to determine if there are any errors in

[[Page 31]]

the transcription of the questions posed to the witness and the 
testimony in response to those questions. If NHTSA discovers any errors, 
it notes that fact and forwards the notation of errors together with the 
transcript to the witness, requesting the witness to stipulate that the 
transcript is in error and that the corrections made by NHTSA are 
accurate. If the witness will not make this stipulation, NHTSA may make 
a motion to the presiding officer to include its notation of error and 
its corrections in the record along with the version of the testimony 
signed by the witness.
    (f)(1) Upon payment of lawfully prescribed costs, any person who is 
required by subpoena or designated by a sole proprietorship, 
partnership, corporation, or other entity that is required by subpoena 
to appear as a witness at an administrative deposition may procure a 
copy of the deposition as recorded, except that in a nonpublic 
investigatory proceeding, the witness may, for good cause, be limited to 
an inspection of the record of the deposition.
    (2) A copy of the record of the deposition may be furnished to the 
witness without charge or at a reduced charge if the Associate 
Administrator for Administration determines that waiver of the fee is in 
the public interest because furnishing the copy can be considered as 
primarily benefitting the general public. Any witness who seeks a waiver 
of the copying charge may apply in writing to the Associate 
Administrator for Administration, and shall state the reasons justifying 
waiver of the fee in the application.
    (g) The testimony obtained in an adminstrative deposition may be 
used or considered by the NHTSA in any of its activities, and may be 
used or offered into evidence in any administrative proceeding in 
accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 554, or in any judicial 
proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 510.7  General or special orders.

    The NHTSA may require by the issuance of general or special orders 
any person, sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or other 
entity to file with the NHTSA, in such form as NHTSA may prescribe, 
periodic or special reports or answers in writing to specific questions. 
The responses to general or special orders will provide NHTSA with such 
information as it may require, including, but not limited to, 
information relating to the organization of that person, sole 
proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or other entity, its business, 
conduct, practices, management, and relation to any other person or 
entity. General or special orders which are required to be answered 
under oath are issued by the Chief Counsel. Any general or special order 
issued under this section contains the information specified in

    The NHTSA may, by the issuance of a written request for the 
production of documents and things, require any person, sole 
proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or other entity to produce 
documents or things. A written request for the production of documents 
and things may be issued alone, or as a part of a general or special 
order issued under Sec. 510.7. Written requests for the production of 
documents and things are issued by the Chief Counsel. Any written 
request for the production of documents and things issued under this

<R05>
Sec. 510.9  Motions to modify, limit, or quash process.

    (a)(1) Any person, sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or 
other entity served with a subpoena issued under Sec. 510.4 may file 
with the Deputy Administrator a motion to modify, limit, or quash that 
subpoena. If there is no Deputy Administrator, or the Deputy 
Administrator is not available, such motions shall be filed with and 
decided by the Associate Administrator for Administration. A motion to 
modify, limit, or quash must be filed not later than 15 days after the 
service of the process or five days before the return date specified in 
the process, whichever is earlier, except that, if the process is served 
within five days of its

[[Page 32]]

return date, such motion may be filed at any time before the return 
date. Any motion must set forth the grounds and theories of why and how 
the party believes the process should be modified, limited, or quashed 
and must contain all facts and arguments which support those grounds and 
theories.
    (2) The Deputy Administrator may, upon receiving a motion filed 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section:
    (i) Deny the motion;
    (ii) Modify the return date of the subpoena;
    (iii) Modify, limit or quash the subpoena;
    (iv) Condition granting the motion upon certain requirements; or
    (v) Take any other action he or she believes to be appropriate in 
the circumstances.
    (3) The Office of the Deputy Administrator serves the decision on 
the motion on the moving party or the counsel or representative of the 
moving party. This service may be made by personal service, by 
registered or certified mail, or by reading a copy of the decision to 
the moving party or the counsel or representative of the moving party.
    (4) A denial of any motion properly filed under this section shall 
be in writing, and shall contain a brief statement of the facts involved 
and the conclusions drawn from those facts by the Deputy Administrator.
    (b) The Deputy Administrator's decision on the motion to modify, 
limit, or quash, filed under paragraph (a) of this section is not 
subject to reconsideration by NHTSA.


<R05>
Sec. 510.10  Supplementation of responses to process.

    (a) A person, sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or 
other entity which has provided NHTSA with information under this part, 
which information was complete and accurate at the time the information 
was given to NHTSA, is not required to supplement that information in 
the light of after acquired information, except:
    (1) The person or entity to whom the process is addressed shall 
supplement the response with respect to any question directly addressed 
to the identity and location of persons having knowledge of information 
obtainable under this part.
    (2) The person or entity to whom the process is addressed shall 
seasonably amend a prior response if that person or entity obtains 
information upon the basis of which the person or entity knows that the 
response was incorrect when made or the person or entity knows that the 
response, though correct when made, is no longer true and the 
circumstances are such that a failure to amend the response is in 
substance a knowing concealment.
    (b) The requirement to supplement information set forth in paragraph 
(a) of this section terminates when:
    (1) The compulsory process stated that it was issued in connection 
with a contemplated rulemaking action, and a final rule is issued on 
that subject or a notice is issued announcing that the rulemaking action 
has been suspended or terminated.
    (2) The compulsory process stated that it was issued in connection 
with an enforcement investigation, and the investigation is closed.
    (3) The compulsory process does not state that it is issued in 
connection with a specific rulemaking action or enforcement 
investigation, and 18 months have passed since the date of the original 
response.
    (c) This section in no way limits NHTSA's authority to obtain 
supplemental information by specific demands through the means specified 
in Sec. 510.3.


<R05>
Sec. 510.11  Fees.

    Any person compelled to appear in person in response to a subpoena 
issued under this part at an information gathering hearing or an 
administrative deposition is paid the same attendance and mileage fees 
as are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States, in accordance 
with title 28, U.S.C., section 1821.


<R05>
Sec. 510.12  Remedies for failure to comply with compulsory process.

    Any failure to comply with compulsory process authorized by law and 
issued under this part is a violation of this part. In the event of such 
failure to comply, NHTSA may take appropriate action pursuant to the 
authority

[[Page 33]]

conferred by the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act or the 
Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, as appropriate, 
including institution of judicial proceedings to enforce the order and 
to collect civil penalties.

    (a) Notice of institution of an enforcement proceeding. An 
adjudicative proceeding under this part is commenced by the issuance of 
a complaint by the NHTSA.
    (b) Form and content of complaint. The complaint shall be signed by

with specific designation of the statutory provisions involved in each 
allegation.
    (2) Identification of each respondent.

[[Page 35]]

    (5) The right of the respondent to a hearing on the alleged

basis of written submissions. If a hearing is requested, respondent 
shall specify those issues on which a hearing is desired.
    (2) Contested allegations. An answer in which the allegations of a 
complaint are contested shall contain:
    (i) Specific admission or denial of each allegation in the 
complaint. If the respondent is without knowledge or information 
sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an allegation, respondent 
shall so state. Such a statement shall have the effect of a denial. 
Denials shall fairly meet the substance of the allegations denied. 
Allegations not thus answered shall be deemed to have been admitted.
    (ii) A concise statement of the factual and/or legal defenses to 
each allegation of the complaint.
    (3) Admitted allegations. If the respondent admits or fails to deny 
any factual allegation, he or she shall be deemed to have waived a 
hearing as to such allegation.
    (c) Default. Failure of the respondent to file an answer within the 
time provided (or within an extended time, if provided), shall be deemed 
to constitute a waiver of the right to appear and contest the 
allegations set forth in the complaint and to authorize the Presiding 
Officer to make such findings of fact, as are reasonable under the 
circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 511.13  Amendments and supplemental pleadings.

signed by a representative of record for the party; or in the case of 
parties not represented, by the party; or by a partner, officer, or 
regular employee of any corporation, partnership, or association, who 
files an appearance on behalf of the party.
    (2) The act of signing a document constitutes a representation by 
the signer that the signer has read it; that to the best of the signer's 
knowledge, information and belief, the statements made in it are true; 
and that it is not filed for purposes of delay.

Officer, who shall rule upon them promptly after affording an 
opportunity for response.
    (b) Written motions. All written motions shall state the particular 
order, ruling, or action desired and the grounds therefor. If a motion 
is supported by memoranda, affidavits or other documents, they shall be 
served and filed with the motion. All motions shall contain a proposed 
order setting forth the relief sought. All written motions shall be 
filed with the Executive Secretary and served on all parties, and all 
motions addressed to the Administrator shall be in writing.

motion or petition or within such longer or shorter time as may be 
designated by these Rules or by the Presiding Officer or the 
Administrator, the opposing party or parties shall file a written 
response to such motion. Where a motion would affect only a single 
party, or an identifiable group of parties, the Presiding Officer or 
Administrator may limit the response to the motion to the affected party 
or parties. Failure to respond to a written motion may, in the 
discretion of the Presiding Officer be deemed as consent to the granting 
of the relief sought in the motion. The moving party shall have no right 
to reply, except as permitted by the Presiding Officer or the 
Administrator.
    (d) Rulings on motions for dismissal. When a motion to dismiss a 
complaint or motion for other relief is granted with the result that the 
proceeding before the Presiding Officer is terminated, the Presiding 
Officer shall issue an Initial Decision and Order thereon in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 511.51. If such a motion is granted as to 
all issues alleged in the complaint in regard to some, but not all, the 
respondents, or is granted as to any part of the allegations in regard 
to any or all the respondents, the Presiding Officer shall enter an 
order on the record and consider the remaining issues in the Initial 
Decision. The Presiding Officer may elect to defer ruling on a motion to 
dismiss until the close of the case.


<R05>
Sec. 511.24  Interlocutory appeals.

    (a) General. Rulings of the Presiding Officer may not be appealed to 
the Administrator prior to the Initial Decision, except as provided 
herein.
    (b) Exceptions--(1) Interlocutory appeals to Administrator. The 
Administrator may, in his or her discretion, entertain interlocutory 
appeals where a ruling of the Presiding Officer:
    (i) Requires the production or disclosure of records claimed to be 
confidential;
    (ii) Requires the testimony of a supervisory official of the agency 
other than one especially cognizant of the facts of the matter in 
adjudication;
    (iii) Excludes an attorney from participation in a proceeding 
pursuant to Sec. 511.42(b).
    (2) Procedures for interlocutory appeals. Within ten (10) days of 
issuance of a ruling, any party may petition the Administrator to 
entertain an interlocutory appeal on a ruling in the categories 
enumerated above. The petition shall not exceed fifteen (15) pages. Any 
other party may file a response to the petition within ten (10) days of 
its service. The response shall not exceed fifteen (15) pages. The 
Administrator shall thereupon act upon the petition, or the 
Administrator shall request such further briefing or oral presentation 
as he may deem necessary.
    (3) Interlocutory appeals from all other rulings--(i) Grounds. 
Interlocutory appeals from all other rulings by the Presiding Officer 
may proceed only upon motion to the Presiding Officer and a 
determination by the Presiding Officer

[[Page 39]]

in writing, with justification in support thereof, that the ruling 
involves a controlling question of law or policy as to which there is 
substantial ground for differences of opinion and that an immediate 
appeal from the ruling may materially advance the ultimate termination 
of the litigation, or that subsequent review will be an inadequate 
remedy.
    (ii) Form. If the Presiding Officer determines, in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section that an interlocutory appeal may 
proceed a petition for interlocutory appeal may be filed with and acted 
upon by the Administrator in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (c) Proceedings not stayed. A petition for interlocutory appeal 
under this part shall not stay the proceedings before the Presiding 
Officer unless the Presiding Officer shall so order, except that a 
ruling of the Presiding Officer requiring the production of records 
claimed to be confidential shall be automatically stayed for a period of 
(10) days following the issuance of such ruling to allow an affected 
party the opportunity to file a petition for an interlocutory appeal 
pursuant to Sec. 511.24(b)(2). The filing of such a petition shall 
automatically extend the stay of such a ruling pending the 
Administrator's action on such petition.


<R05>
Sec. 511.25  Summary decision and order.

    (a) Motion. Any party may move, with a supporting memorandum, for a 
Summary Decision and Order in its favor upon all or any of the issues in 
controversy. Complaint Counsel may so move at any time after thirty (30) 
days following issuance of a complaint, and any other party may so move 
at any time after issuance of a complaint. Any such motion by any party 
shall be filed at least twenty (20) days before the date fixed for the 
adjudicatory hearing.
    (b) Response to motion. Any other party may, within ten (10) days 
after service of the motion, file a response thereto with a supporting 
memorandum.
    (c) Grounds. A Summary Decision and Order shall be granted if the 
pleadings and any testimony upon oral examination, answers to 
interrogatories, admissions, and/or affidavits show that there is no 
genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is 
entitled to a Summary Decision and Order as a matter of law.
    (d) Legal effect. A Summary Decision and Order upon all the issues 
being adjudicated shall constitute the Initial Decision of the Presiding 
Officer, and may be appealed to the Administrator in accordance with 
Sec. 511.53. A Summary Decision, interlocutory in character, may be 
rendered on fewer than all issues and may not be appealed prior to 
issuance of the Initial Decision, except in accordance with Sec. 511.24.
    (e) Case not fully adjudicated on motion. A Summary Decision and 
Order that does not dispose of the whole case shall include a statement 
of those material facts as to which there is no substantial controversy, 
and of those material facts that are actually and in good faith 
controverted. The Summary Order shall direct such further proceedings as 
are just.


<R05>
Sec. 511.26  Settlement.

    (a) Applicability. This section applies only to cases of alleged 
violations of section 507(3) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost 
Savings Act, Pub. L. 94-163, 89 Stat. 911 (15 U.S.C. section 2007(3)). 
Settlement in other cases may be made only in accordance with subpart G 
of this part.
    (b) Availability. Any party shall have the opportunity to submit an 
offer of settlement to the Presiding Officer.
    (c) Form. Offers of settlement shall be in the form of a consent 
agreement and order, shall be signed by the party submitting the offer 
or his representative, and may be signed by any other party. Each offer 
of settlement shall be accompanied by a motion to transmit to the 
Administrator the proposed agreement and order, outlining the 
substantive provisions of the agreement, and the reasons why it should 
be accepted.
    (d) Contents. The proposed consent agreement and order which 
constitute the offer of settlement shall be contain the following:
    (1) An admission of all jurisdictional facts;
    (2) An express waiver of further procedural steps, and of all rights 
to seek

[[Page 40]]

judicial review or otherwise to contest the validity of the order;
    (3) A description of the alleged noncompliance, or violation;
    (4) Provisions to the effect that the allegations of the complaint 
are resolved by the proposed consent agreement and order;
    (5) A listing of the acts or practices from which the respondent 
shall refrain;
    (6) A detailed statement of the corrective action(s) which the 
respondent shall excute and the civil penalty, if any, that respondent 
shall pay.
    (e) Transmittal. The Presiding Officer shall transmit to the 
Administrator for decision all offers of settlement and accompanying 
memoranda that meet the requirements enumerated in paragraph (d) of this 
section. The Presiding Officer may, but need not, recommend acceptance 
or rejection of such offers. Any party or participant, may object to a 
proposed consent agreement by filing a motion and supporting memorandum 
with the Administrator.
    (f) Stay of proceedings. When an offer of settlement has been agreed 
to by the parties and has been transmitted to the Administrator, the 
proceedings shall be stayed until the Administrator has ruled on the 
offer. When an offer of settlement has been made and transmitted to the 
Administrator but has not been agreed to by all parties, the proceedings 
shall not be stayed pending the Administrator's decision on the offer.
    (g) Administrator's ruling. The Administrator will rule upon all 
transmitted offers of settlement. If the Administrator accepts the 
offer, the Administrator shall issue an appropriate order. The order 
shall become effective upon issuance. In determining whether to accept 
an offer of settlement, the Administrator will consider the gravity of 
the alleged violation, and any good faith efforts by the respondent to 
comply with applicable requirements.
    (h) Rejection. If the Administrator rejects an offer of settlement, 
the Administrator shall give written notice of that decision and the 
reasons therefor to the parties and the Presiding Officer. Promptly 
thereafter, the Presiding Officer shall issue an order notifying the 
parties of the resumption of the proceedings, including any 
modifications to the schedule resulting from the stay of the 
proceedings.
    (i) Effect of rejected offer. Rejected offers of settlement shall 
not be admissible in evidence over the objection of any signatory, nor 
shall the fact of the proposal of the offer be admissible in evidence.

<R04>
                Subpart D--Discovery; Compulsory Process


<R05>
Sec. 511.31  General provisions governing discovery.

    (a) Applicability. The discovery rules established in this subpart 
are applicable to the discovery of information among the parties to a 
proceeding. Parties seeking information from persons not parties may do 
so by subpoena in accordance with Sec. 511.38.
    (b) Discovery methods. Parties may obtain discovery by one or more 
of the following methods: (1) Written interrogatories; (2) requests for 
production of documents or things; (3) requests for admissions; or (4) 
testimony upon oral examination. Unless the Presiding Officer otherwise 
orders under paragraph (d) of this section, the frequency of use of 
these methods is not limited.
    (c) Scope of discovery. The scope of discovery is as follows:
    (1) In general. Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter 
not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the 
proceedings, whether it relates to the claim or defense of the party 
seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of any other party. It is 
not ground for objection that the information sought will be 
inadmissible at the hearing if the information sought appears reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
    (2) Exception. Parties may not obtain discovery of documents which 
accompanied the staff's recommendation as to whether a complaint should 
issue or of documents or portions thereof which would be exempt from 
discovery under Rule 26(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
    (3) Hearing preparation: Experts. A party may obtain discovery of 
facts

[[Page 41]]

known and opinions held by experts, regardless of whether they are 
acquired or developed in anticipation of or for litigation. Such 
discovery may be had by any of the methods provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (d) Protective orders. Upon motion by a party or person and for good 
cause shown, the Presiding Officer may make any order which justice 
requires to protect such party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, 
competitive disadvantage, oppression or undue burden or expense, 
including one or more of the following: (1) That the discovery shall not 
be had; (2) that the discovery may be had only on specified terms and 
conditions, including a designation of the time and/or place; (3) that 
the discovery shall be had only by a method of discovery other than that 
selected by the party seeking discovery; (4) that certain matters shall 
not be inquired into, or that the scope of discovery shall be limited to 
certain matters; (5) that discovery shall be conducted with no one 
present except persons designated by the Presiding Officer; (6) that a 
trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial 
information shall not be disclosed or shall be disclosed only in a 
designated way or only to designated parties; and (7) that responses to 
discovery shall be placed in camera in accordance with Sec. 511.45.

If a motion for a protective order is denied in whole or in part, the 
Presiding Officer may, on such terms or conditions as are just, order 
that any party provide or permit discovery.
    (e) Sequence and timing of discovery. Discovery may commence at any 
time after filing of the answer. Unless otherwise provided in these 
Rules or by order of the Presiding Officer, methods of discovery may be 
used in any sequence and the fact that a party is conducting discovery 
shall not operate to delay any other party's discovery.
    (f) Supplementation of responses. A party who has responded to a 
request for discovery shall supplement the response with information 
thereafter acquired.
    (g) Completion of discovery. All discovery shall be completed as 
soon as practical but in no case longer than one hundred fifty (150) 
days after issuance of a complaint unless otherwise ordered by the 
Presiding Officer in exceptional circumstances and for good cause shown. 
All discovery shall be served by a date which affords the party from 
whom discovery is sought the full response period provided by these 
Rules.
    (h) Service and filing of discovery. All discovery requests and 
written responses, and all notices of the taking of testimony, shall be 
filed with the Docket Section and served on all parties and the 
Presiding Officer.
    (i) Control of discovery. The use of these discovery procedures is 
subject to the control of the Presiding Officer, who may issue any just 
and appropriate order for the purpose of ensuring their timely 
completion.
[45 FR 81578, Dec. 11, 1980, as amended at 53 FR 15783, May 3, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 511.32  Written interrogatories to parties.

    (a) Availability; procedures for use. Any party may serve upon any 
other party written interrogatories to be answered by the party served 
or, if the party served is a public or private corporation or a 
partnership or association or governmental agency, by any officer or 
agent, who shall furnish such information as is available to the party. 
Interrogatories may, without leave of the Presiding Officer, be served 
upon any party after filing of the answer.
    (b) Procedures for response. Each interrogatory shall be answered 
separately and fully in writing under oath, unless it is objected to, in 
which event the reasons for objection shall be stated in lieu of an 
answer. The answers are to be signed by a responsible representative of 
the respondent and the objections signed by the representative making 
them. The party upon whom the interrogatories have been served shall 
serve a copy of the answers, and objections if any, within 30 days after 
service of the interrogatories. The Presiding Officer may allow a 
shorter or longer time for response. The party submitting the 
interrogatories may move for an order under Sec. 511.36 with respect to 
any objection to or other failure to answer an interrogatory.

[[Page 42]]

    (c) Scope of interrogatories. Interrogatories may relate to any 
matters which can be inquired into under Sec. 511.31(c)(1), and the 
answers may be used to the extent permitted under this part. An 
interrogatory otherwise proper is not objectionable merely because an 
answer to the interrogatory would involve an opinion or contention that 
relates to fact or to the application of law to fact, but the Presiding 
Officer may order that such an interrogatory need not be answered until 
a later time.
    (d) Option to produce business records. Where the answer to an 
interrogatory may be derived or ascertained from the business records of 
the party upon whom the interrogatory has been served, or from an 
examination, audit or inspection of such business records, or from a 
compilation, abstract or summary based thereon, and the burden of 
deriving the answer is substantially the same for the party serving the 
interrogatory as for the party served, it is a sufficient answer to the 
interrogatory to specify the records from which the answer may be 
derived or ascertained and to afford to the party serving the 
interrogatory reasonable opportunity to examine, audit or inspect such 
records and to make copies, complications, abstracts, or summaries.


<R05>
Sec. 511.33  Production of documents and things.

    (a) Scope. Any party may serve upon any other party a request (1) to 
produce and permit the party making the request, or someone acting on 
behalf of that party, to inspect and copy any designated documents 
(including writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, phono-
records, and any other data-compilation from which information can be 
obtained, translated, if necessary, by the party in possession into 
reasonably usable form), or (2) to inspect and copy, test or sample 
tangible things which constitute or contain matters within the scope of 
Sec. 511.31(c)(1) and which are in the possession, custody or control of 
the party upon whom the request is served.
    (b) Procedure for request. The request may be served at any time 
after the filing of the answer without leave of the Presiding Officer. 
The request shall set forth the items to be inspected either by 
individual item or by category, and shall describe each item or category 
with reasonable particularity. The request shall specify a reasonable 
time, place and manner for making the inspection and performing the 
related acts.
    (c) Procedure for response. The party upon whom the request is 
served shall serve a written response within twenty (20) days after 
service of the request. The Presiding Officer may allow a shorter or 
longer time for response. The response shall state, with respect to each 
item or category requested, that inspection and related activities will 
be permitted as requested, unless the request is objected to, in which 
event the reasons for objection shall be stated. If objection is made to 
only part of an item or category, that part shall be so specified. The 
party submitting the request may move for an order under Sec. 511.36 
with respect to any objection to or other failure to respond to the 
request or any part thereof, or to any failure to permit inspection as 
requested.


<R05>
Sec. 511.34  Requests for admission.

    (a) Procedure for request. A party may serve upon any other party a 
written request for the admission, for the purposes of the pending 
proceeding only, of the truth of any matters within the scope of 
Sec. 511.31(c)(1) set forth in the request that relate to statements or 
opinions of fact or if the application of law to fact, including the 
genuineness of documents described in the request. Copies of documents 
shall be served with the request unless they have been, or are 
otherwise, furnished or made available for inspection and copying. The 
request may, without leave of the Presiding Officer, be served upon any 
party after filing of the answer. Each matter as to which an admission 
is requested shall be separately set forth.
    (b) Procedure for response. The matter as to which an admission is 
requested is deemed admitted unless within thirty (30) days after 
service of the request, or within such shorter or longer time as the 
Presiding Officer may allow, the party to whom the request is directed 
serves upon the party requesting the

[[Page 43]]

admission a written answer or objection addressed to the matter, signed 
by the party or the party's representatives. If objection is made, the 
reasons therefore shall be stated.

The answer shall specifically admit or deny the matter or set forth in 
detail the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or 
deny the matter. A denial shall fairly meet the substance of the 
requested admission. When good faith requires that a party qualify an 
answer or deny only a part of the matter as to which an admission is 
requested, the party shall specify the portion that is true and qualify 
or deny the remainder. An answering party may not give lack of 
information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny, 
unless the party states that he or she has made reasonable inquiry and 
that the information known or readily available to him or her is 
insufficient to enable him or her to admit or deny. A party who 
considers that a matter as to which an admission has been requested 
presents a genuine issue for hearing may not, on that ground alone, 
object to the request but may deny the matter or set forth reasons why 
the party cannot admit or deny it. The party who has requested an 
admission may move to determine the sufficiency of the answer or 
objection thereto in accordance with Sec. 511.36. If the Presiding 
Officer determines that an answer does not comply with the requirements 
of this section, he or she may order that the matter be deemed admitted 
or that an amended answer be served.
    (c) Effect of admission. Any matter admitted under this section is 
conclusively established unless the Presiding Officer on motion permits 
withdrawal or amendment of such admission. The Presiding Officer may 
permit withdrawal or amendment when the presentation of the merits of 
the action will be served thereby and the party that obtained the 
admission fails to satisfy the Presiding Officer that withdrawal or 
amendment will prejudice that party in maintaining an action or defense 
on the merits.


<R05>
Sec. 511.35  Testimony upon oral examination.

    (a) When testimony may be taken. At any time after the answer is 
filed under Sec. 511.12, upon leave of the Presiding Officer and under 
such terms and conditions as the Presiding Officer may prescribe, any 
party may take the testimony of any other party, including the agents, 
employees, consultants or prospective witnesses of that party at a place 
convenient to the witness. The attendance of witnesses and the 
production of documents and things at the examination may be compelled 
by subpoena as provided in Sec. 511.38.
    (b) Notice of oral examination--(1) Examination of a party. A party 
desiring to examine another party to the proceeding shall, after 
obtaining leave from the Presiding Officer, serve written notice of the 
examination on all other parties and the Presiding Officer at least ten 
(10) days before the date of the examination. The notice shall state (i) 
the time and place for making the examination; (ii) the name and address 
of each person to be examined, if known, or if the name is not known, a 
general description sufficient to identify him; and (iii) the subject 
matter of the expected testimony. If a subpoena duces tecum is to be 
served on the person to be examined, the designation of the materials to 
be produced, as set forth in the subpoena, shall be attached to or 
included in the notice of examination.
    (2) Examination of a nonparty. A party desiring to examine a person 
who is not a party to the proceeding shall make application for a 
subpoena, in accordance with Sec. 511.38, to compel the attendance, 
testimony and/or production of documents by such person who is not a 
party. The party desiring such examination shall serve written notice of 
the examination on all other parties to the proceeding, after issuance 
of the subpoena by the Presiding Officer of a designated alternate.
    (3) Opposition to notice. A person served with a notice of 
examination may, within 3 days of the date of service, oppose, in 
writing, the examination. The Presiding Officer shall rule on the notice 
and any opposition and may order the taking of all noticed examinations, 
upon a showing of good

[[Page 44]]

cause therefor. The Presiding Officer may, for good cause shown, enlarge 
or shorten the time for the taking of an examination.
    (c) Persons before whom examinations may be taken. Examinations may 
be taken before any person authorized to administer oaths by the laws of 
the United States or of the place where the examination is held. No 
examination shall be taken before a person who is a relative or employee 
or attorney or representative of any party, or who is a relative or 
employee of such attorney or representative, or who is financially 
interested in the action.
    (d) Procedure--(1) Examination. Each witness shall be duly sworn, 
and all testimony shall be duly recorded. All parties or their 
representatives may be present and participate in the examination. 
Examination and cross-examination of witnesses may proceed as permitted 
at the hearing. Questions objected to shall be answered subject to the 
objections. Objections shall be in short form, and shall state the 
grounds relied upon. The questions propounded and the answers thereto, 
together with all objections made, shall be recorded by the official 
reporter before whom the examination is made. The original or a verified 
copy of all documents and things produced for inspection during the 
examination of the witness shall, upon a request of any party present, 
be marked for identification and annexed to the record of the 
examination.
    (2) Motion to terminate or limit examination. At any time during the 
examination, upon motion of any party or of the witness, and upon 
showing that the examination is being conducted in bad faith or in such 
manner as unreasonably to annoy, embarrass or oppress the witness or 
party, the Presiding Officer may, upon motion, order the party 
conducting the examination to terminate the examination, or may limit 
the scope and manner of the examination as provided in Sec. 511.31(d).
    (3) Participation by parties not present. In lieu of attending an 
examination, any party may serve written questions in a sealed envelope 
on the party conducting the examination. That party shall transmit the 
envelope to the official reporter, who shall unseal it and propound the 
questions contained therein to the witness.
    (e) Transcription and filing of testimony--(1) Transcription. Upon 
request by any party, the testimony recorded at an examination shall be 
transcribed. When the testimony is fully transcribed, the transcript 
shall be submitted to the witness for examination and signing, and shall 
be read to or by the witness, unless such examination and signature are 
waived by the witness. Any change in form or substance which the witness 
desires to make shall be entered upon the transcript of the official 
reporter with a statement of the reasons given by the witness for making 
them. The transcript shall then be signed by the witness, unless the 
parties by stipulation waive the signing, or the witness is ill or 
cannot be found or refuses to sign. If the transcript is not signed by 
the witness within thirty (30) days of its submission to him, the 
official reporter shall sign it and state on the record the fact of the 
waiver of signature or of the illness or absence of the witness or the 
fact of the refusal to sign, together with a statement of the reasons 
therefor. The testimony may then be used as fully as though signed, in 
accordance with paragraph (i) of this section.
    (2) Certification and filing. The official reporter shall certify on 
the transcript that the witness was duly sworn and that the transcript 
is a true record of the testimony given and corrections made by the 
witness. The official reporter shall then seal the transcript in an 
envelope endorsed with the title and docket number of the action and 
marked ``Testimony of [name of witness]'' and shall promptly file the 
transcript with the Docket Section. The Presiding Officer shall notify 
all parties of the filing of the transcript and the Docket Section shall 
furnish a copy of the transcript to any party or to the witness upon 
payment of reasonable charges therefor.
    (f) Costs of examination. The party who notices the examination 
shall pay for the examination. The party who requests transcription of 
the examination shall pay for the transcription.
    (g) Failure to attend or to serve subpoena; expenses. If a party who 
notices

[[Page 45]]

an examination fails to attend and proceed therewith and another party 
attends in person or by a representative pursuant to the notice, the 
Presiding Officer may order the party who gave the notice to pay the 
attending party the reasonable expenses incurred. If a party who notices 
an examination fails to serve a subpoena upon the witness and as a 
result the witness does not attend, and if another party attends in 
person or by a representative because that party expects the examination 
to be made, the Presiding Officer may order the party who gave notice to 
pay the attending party the reasonable expenses incurred.
    (h) Examination to preserve testimony--(1) When available. By leave 
of the Presiding Officer, a party may examine a witness for the purpose 
of perpetuating the testimony of that witness. A party who wishes to 
conduct such an examination shall obtain prior leave of the Presiding 
Officer by filing a motion. The motion shall include a showing of 
substantial reason to believe that the testimony could not be presented 
at the hearing. If the Presiding Officer is satisfied that the 
perpetuation of the testimony may prevent a failure of justice or is 
otherwise reasonably necessary, he or she shall order that the 
deposition be taken.
    (2) Procedure. Notice of an examination to preserve testimony shall 
be served at least fifteen (15) days prior to the examination. The 
examination shall be taken in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraph (d) of this section. Any examination taken to preserve 
testimony shall be fully transcribed and filed in accordance with 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (i) Use of testimony obtained under this section. At the hearing or 
upon a motion or an interlocutory proceeding, any part or all of a 
deposition, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence applied as 
though the witness were then present and testifying, may be used against 
any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition 
or who had reasonable Notice thereof, in accordance with any of the 
following provisions:
    (1) Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of 
contradicting or impeaching the testimony of deponent as a witness.
    (2) The deposition of a party or of a person who at the time of the 
taking of his testimony was an officer, director or managing agent of a 
party may be used against that party for any purpose.
    (3) The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used 
by any party for any purpose if the Presiding Officer finds:
    (i) That the witness is dead; or
    (ii) That the witness is at a greater distance than 100 miles from 
the place of the hearing, or is out of the United States, unless it 
appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party 
offering the deposition; or
    (iii) That the witness is unable to attend or testify because of 
age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or
    (iv) That the party offering the deposition has been unable to 
procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or
    (v) Upon application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances 
exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due 
regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally 
in open court, to allow the deposition to be used.
    (4) If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, 
an adverse party may require him to introduce any other part which ought 
in fairness to be considered with the part introduced, and any party may 
introduce any other parts.

<R05>
Sec. 511.36  Motions to compel discovery.

    If a party fails to respond to discovery, in whole or in part, the 
party seeking discovery may move within twenty (20) days for an order 
compelling an answer, or compelling inspection or production of 
documents, or otherwise compelling discovery. For purposes of this 
subsection, an evasive or incomplete response is to be treated as a 
failure to respond. If the motion is granted, the Presiding Officer 
shall issue an order compelling discovery. If the motion is denied in 
whole or in part, the

[[Page 46]]

Presiding Officer may make such protective order as it would have been 
empowered to make on a motion pursuant to Sec. 511.31(d). When making 
oral examinations, the discovering party shall continue the examination

withheld admission, testimony documents, or other evidence would have 
shown;
    (f) Order that a pleading, or part of a pleading, or a motion or 
other submission by the party, concerning which the order was issued, be 
stricken, or that decision on the pleadings be rendered against the

accordance with Sec. 511.42(b).

Any such action may be taken by order at any point in the proceedings.

comply with a subpoena, the Presiding Officer may take any of the 
actions enumerated in Sec. 511.37 or may order any other appropriate

materials. If in the opinon of the Presiding Officer such relief is 
insufficient, the Presiding Officer shall certify to the Administrator a 
request for judicial enforcement of the subpoena.

to testify or provide other information upon being granted immunity from 
prosecution under title 18, U.S.C., section 6002, may make a motion to 
that effect. The motion shall be made and ruled on in accordance with 
Sec. 511.22, and shall include a showing:
    (1) That the testimony or other information sought from a witness or 
prospective witness may be necessary to the public interest; and

testify or provide such information on the basis of that individual's 
privilege against self-incrimination.
    (b) If the Presiding Officer determines that the witness' testimony 
appears necessary and that the privilege against self-incrimination may

or she obtain the approval of the Attorney General of the United States 
for the issuance of an order granting immunity.
    (c) Upon application to and approval of the Attorney General of the 
United States, and after the witness has invoked the privilege against

<R05>
Sec. 511.42  Powers and duties of Presiding Officer.

    (a) General. A Presiding Officer shall have the duty to conduct 
full, fair, and impartial hearings, to take appropriate action to avoid 
unnecessary delay in the disposition of proceedings, and to maintain 
order. He or she shall have all powers necessary to that end, including 
the following powers:
    (1) To administer oaths and affirmations;
    (2) To compel discovery and to impose appropriate sanctions for 
failure to make discovery;
    (3) To issue subpoenas;
    (4) To rule upon offers of proof and receive relevant and probative 
evidence;
    (5) To regulate the course of the hearings and the conduct of the 
parties and their representatives therein;
    (6) To hold conferences for simplification of the issues, settlement 
of the proceedings, or any other proper purposes;
    (7) To consider and rule, orally or in writing, upon all procedural 
and order motions appropriate in an adjudicative proceeding;
    (8) To issue initial decisions, rulings, and orders, as appropriate;
    (9) To certify questions to the Administrator for determination; and
    (10) To take any action authorized in this part or in conformance 
with the provisions of title 5, U.S.C., sections 551 through 559.
    (b) Exclusion of parties by Presiding Officer. A Presiding Officer 
shall have the authority, for good cause stated on the record, to 
exclude from participation in a proceeding any party, participant, and/
or representative who shall violate requirements of Sec. 511.76. Any 
party, participant and/or representative so excluded may appeal to the 
Administrator in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 511.23. If the 
representative of a party or participant is excluded, the hearing shall 
be suspended for a reasonable time so that the party or participant may 
obtain another representative.
    (c) Substitution of Presiding Officer. In the event of the 
substitution of a new Presiding Officer for the one originally 
designated, any motion predicated upon such substitution shall be made 
within five (5) days of the substitution.
    (d) Interference. In the performance of adjudicative functions, a 
Presiding Officer shall not be responsible to or subject to the 
supervision or direction of the Administrator or of any officer,

a Presiding Officer concerning any adjudicative proceeding shall appear 
on and be made a part of the record.
    (e) Disqualification of Presiding Officer. (1) When a Presiding 
Officer deems himself or herself disqualified to preside in a particular 
proceeding, he or she shall withdraw by notice on the record and shall 
notify the Chief Administrative Law Judge of the withdrawal.
    (2) Whenever, for any reason, any party shall deem the Presiding 
Officer to be disqualified to preside, or to continue to preside, in a 
particular proceeding, that party may file with the Chief Administrative 
Law Judge a motion to disqualify and remove, supported by affidavit(s) 
setting forth the alleged grounds for disqualification. A copy of the 
motion and supporting affidavit(s) shall be served by the Chief 
Administrative Law Judge on the Presiding Officer whose removal is 
sought. The Presiding Officer shall have ten (10) days from service to 
reply in writing. Such motion shall not stay the proceeding unless 
otherwise ordered by the Presiding Officer or the Administrator. If the 
Presiding Officer does not disqualify himself or herself, the 
Administrator will determine the validity of the grounds alleged, either 
directly or on the report of another Presiding Officer appointed to 
conduct a hearing for that purpose, and shall in the event of 
disqualification take appropriate action, by assigning another Presiding 
Officer or requesting assignment of another Administrative Law Judge 
through the Office of Hearings.

<R05>
Sec. 511.43  Evidence.

    (a) Applicability of Federal Rules of Evidence. The Federal Rules of 
Evidence shall apply to proceedings held

[[Page 49]]

under this part only as a general guide. The Presiding Officer may admit 
any relevent and probative evidence.
    (b) Burden of proof. (1) Compliant counsel shall have the burden of 
sustaining the allegations of any complaint.
    (2) Any party who is the proponent of a legal and/or factual 
proposition shall have the burden of sustaining the proposition.
    (c) Presumptions. A presumption imposes on the party against whom it 
is directed the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut or meet 
the presumption, but does not shift to such party the burden of proof in 
the sense of the risk of nonpersuasion, which remains throughout the 
hearing upon the party on whom it was originally cast.
    (d) Admissibility. All relevant and reliable evidence is admissible, 
but may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed 
by unfair prejudice or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, 
immateriality, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.
    (e) Official notice--(1) Definition. Official notice means use by 
the Presiding Officer of extra-record facts and legal conclusions drawn 
from those facts. An officially noticed fact or legal conclusion must be 
one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (i) generally 
known within the jurisdiction of the Presiding Officer or (ii) known by 
the Presiding Officer in areas of his or her expertise; or (iii) capable 
of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy 
cannot reasonably be questioned.
    (2) Method of taking official notice. The Presiding Officer may at 
any time take official notice upon motion of any party or upon its own 
initiative. The record shall reflect the facts and conclusions which 
have been officially noticed.
    (3) Opportunity to challenge. Any party may upon application in 
writing rebut officially noticed facts and conclusions by supplementing 
the record. The Presiding Officer shall determine the permissible extent 
of this challenge; that is, whether to limit the party to presentation 
of written materials, whether to allow presentation of testimony, 
whether to allow cross-examination, or whether to allow oral argument. 
The Presiding Officer shall grant or deny the application on the record.
    (f) Objections and exceptions. Objections to evidence shall be 
timely interposed, shall appear on the record, and shall contain the 
grounds upon which they are based. Rulings on all objections, and the 
bases therefore, shall appear on the record. Formal exception to an 
adverse ruling is not required to preserve the question for appeal.
    (g) Offer of proof. When an objection to proffered testimony or 
documentary evidence is sustained, the sponsoring party may make a 
specific offer, either in writing or orally, of what the party expects 
to prove by the testimony or the document. When an offer of proof is 
made, any other party may make a specific offer, either in writing or 
orally, of what the party expects to present to rebut or contradict the 
offer of proof. Written offers of proof or of rebuttal, adequately 
marked for identification, shall accompany the record and be available 
for consideration by any reviewing authority.


<R05>
Sec. 511.44  Expert witnesses.

    (a) Definition. An expert witness is one who, by reason of 
education, training, experience, or profession, has peculiar knowlege 
concerning the matter of science or skill to which his or her testimony 
relates and from which he or she may draw inferences based upon 
hypothetically stated facts or from facts involving scientific or 
technical knowledge.
    (b) Method of presenting testimony of expert witness. Except as may 
be otherwise ordered by the Presiding Officer, a detailed written 
statement of the elements of the direct testimony of an expert witness 
shall be filed on the record and exchanged between the parties no later 
than 10 days preceding the commencement of the hearing. The statement 
must contain a full explanation of the methodology underlying any 
analysis, and a full disclosure of the basis of any opinion. The direct 
testimony of an expert witness shall not include points not contained in 
the written statement. A party may waive direct examination of an expert 
witness

[[Page 50]]

by indicating that the written statement be considered the testimony of 
the witness. In such a case, the written testimony shall be incorporated 
into the record and shall constitute the testimony of the witness.
    (c) Cross-examination and redirect examination of expert witness. 
Cross-examination, redirect examination, and re-cross-examination of an 
expert witness will proceed in due course based upon the written 
testimony and any amplifying oral testimony.
    (d) Failure to file and/or to exchange written statement. Failure to 
file and/or to exchange the written statement of an expert witness as 
provided in this section shall deprive the sponsoring party of the use 
of the expert witness and of the conclusions which that witness would 
have presented.


<R05>
Sec. 511.45  In camera materials.

    (a) Definition. In camera materials are documents, testimony, or 
other data which by order of the Presiding Officer or the Administrator, 
as appropriate under this part, are kept confidential and excluded from 
the public record. Only materials exempt under the Freedom of 
Information Act may be kept confidential and excluded from the public 
record. Pursuant to 49 CFR part 512, the Chief Counsel of the NHTSA is 
responsible for determining whether an alleged confidential business 
record is exempt from the Freedom of Information Act. The right of the 
Presiding Officer, the Administrator and reviewing courts to order 
disclosure of in camera materials is specifically reserved.
    (b) In Camera treatment of documents and testimony. The Presiding 
Officer or the Administrator, as appropriate under this part, shall have 
authority, when good cause is found on the record, to order documents or 
testimony offered in evidence, whether admitted or rejected, to be 
received and preserved in camera. The order shall specify the length of 
time for in camera treatment and shall include:
    (1) A description of the documents and/or testimony;
    (2) The reasons for granting in camera treatment for the specified 
length of time.
    (c) Access and disclosure to parties. (1) The Administrator and 
Presiding Officer, and their immediate advisory staffs shall have 
complete access to all in camera materials. All other parties shall also 
have complete access to all in camera materials, except that these 
parties may seek access only in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section when:
    (i) The in camera materials consist of information obtained by the 
government from persons not parties to the proceeding; or
    (ii) The in camera materials consist of information provided by one 
of the parties to the proceeding which is confidential as to the other 
parties to the proceeding.
    (2) Any party desiring access to and/or disclosure of the in camera 
materials specified in paragraph (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section for 
the preparation and presentation of that party's case shall make a 
motion which sets forth the justification therefore. The Presiding 
Officer or the Administrator, as appropriate under this part, may grant 
such motion on the record for substantial good cause shown and shall 
enter a protective order prohibiting unnecessary disclosure and 
requiring other necessary safeguards. The Presiding Officer or the 
Administrator, as appropriate, may examine the in camera materials and 
excise portions thereof before disclosing the materials to the moving 
party.
    (d) Segregation of in camera materials. In camera materials shall be 
segregated from the public record and protected from public view.
    (e) Public release of in camera materials. In Camera materials 
constitute a part of the confidential records of the NHTSA and shall not 
be released to the public until the expiration of in camera treatment.
    (f) Reference to in camera materials. In the submission of proposed 
findings, conclusions, briefs, or other documents, all parties shall 
refrain from disclosing specific details of in camera materials. Such 
refraining shall not preclude general references to such materials. To 
the extent that parties consider it necessary to include specific 
details of in camera materials, the references shall be incorporated 
into separate proposed findings, briefs, or other documents marked 
``CONFIDENTIAL,

[[Page 51]]

CONTAINS IN CAMERA MATERIAL,'' which shall be placed in camera and 
become part of the in camera record. These documents shall be served 
only on parties accorded access to the in camera materials in accordance 
with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 511.46  Proposed findings, conclusions, and order.

    Within a reasonable time after the closing of the record and receipt 
of the transcript, all parties and participants may, simultaneously, 
file post-hearing briefs, including proposed findings of fact, 
conclusions of law and a proposed order, together with reasons 
therefore. The Presiding Officer shall establish a date certain for the 
filing of the briefs, which shall not exceed 45 days after the close of 
the record except in unusual circumstances. The briefs shall be in 
writing, shall be served upon all parties, and shall contain adequate 
references to the record and authorities relied on. Replies shall be 
filed within fifteen (15) days of the date for the filing of briefs 
unless otherwise established by the Presiding Officer. The parties and 
participants may waive either or both submissions.


<R05>

    (a) Reporting and transcription. Hearings shall be recorded and 
transcribed under the supervision of the Presiding Officer by a reporter 
appointed by the Administrator. The original transcript shall be a part 
of the record and the official transcript. Copies of transcripts are 
available from the reporter at a cost not to exceed the maximum rates 
fixed by contract between the NHTSA and the reporter.
    (b) Corrections. Corrections of the official transcript may be made 
only when they involve errors affecting substance and then only in the 
manner herein provided. The Presiding Officer may order corrections, 
either on his or her own motion or on motion of any party. The Presiding 
Officer shall determine the corrections to be made and so order. 
Corrections shall be interlineated or otherwise inserted in the official 
transcript so as not to obliterate the original text.

                            Economy Standards


<R05>
Sec. 511.61  Purpose.

    This subpart establishes the procedures and requirements necessary 
to obtain a settlement of a case of violation of section 507 (1) or (2) 
of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, as amended, Pub. 
L. 94-163, 89 Stat. 911 (15 U.S.C. section 2007(1)(2)). No settlement of 
such cases may be had except as in accordance with this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 511.62  Definitions.

    Average fuel economy standard means an average fuel economy standard 
established by or pursuant to the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost 
Savings Act.
    Insolvency means the inability to meet expenses when due.
    Settlement means a compromise, modification, or remission of a civil 
penalty assessed under this part for a violation of an average fuel 
economy standard.


<R05>
Sec. 511.63  Criteria for settlement.

    Settlement of a case of violation of an average fuel economy 
standard is discretionary with the Administrator. The Administrator will 
consider settlement only to the extent:
    (a) Necessary to prevent the insolvency or bankruptcy of the person 
seeking settlement, or
    (b) That the violation of the average fuel economy standard 
resulted, as shown by the person seeking settlement, from an act of God, 
a strike, or fire, or

[[Page 54]]

    (c) That modification of a civil penalty assessed under this part is 
necessary to prevent lessening of competition, as determined and as 
certified by the Federal Trade Commission under section 508(b)(4) of the 
Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, Pub. L. 94-163, 89 Stat. 
911 (15 U.S.C. section 2008(b)(4)).


<R05>
Sec. 511.64  Petitions for settlement; timing, contents.

    (a) A petition seeking settlement under this subpart must be filed 
within 30 days after the issuance of a final order assessing a civil 
penalty for a violation of an average fuel economy standard.
    (b)(1) A petition for settlement should be sufficient to allow the 
Administrator to determine that at least one of the criteria set out in 
Sec. 511.63 is satisfied, and that the public interest would be served 
by settlement.
    (2) A petition asserting that settlement is necessary to prevent 
bankruptcy or insolvency must include:
    (i) Copies of all pertinent financial records, auditors reports, and 
documents that show that the imposition of a civil penalty would cause 
insolvency, or would cause a company to do an act of bankruptcy, and
    (ii) A payment schedule that would allow the petitioner to pay a 
civil penalty without resulting in insolvency or an act of bankruptcy.
    (3) A petition asserting that the violation of the average fuel 
economy standard was caused by an act of God, fire, or strike must 
describe corrective and ameliorative steps taken to mitigate the effects 
of the act of God, fire, or strike.
    (4) A petition based on a certification by the Federal Trade 
Commission that modification of the civil penalty assessed is necessary 
to prevent a substantial lessening of competition must include a 
certified copy of:
    (i) The application to the Federal Trade Commission for a 
certification under section 508(b)(4) of the Motor Vehicle Information 
and Cost Savings Act, Pub. L. 94-163, 89 Stat. 911 (15 U.S.C. 
2008(b)(4)), and materials supporting the application.
    (ii) The administrative record of any Federal Trade Commission 
proceeding held in regard to the application, and
    (iii) The certification by the Federal Trade Commission.
    (c) It is the policy of the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration that unconditional settlements of violations of average 
fuel economy standards are not in the public interest, and absent 
special and extraordinary circumstances, will not be allowed. All 
petitions for settlement shall contain a section proposing conditions 
for settlement. Conditions for settlement can be specific acts designed 
to lead to the reduction of automotive fuel consumption, which the 
petitioner is not otherwise required to perform pursuant to any statute, 
regulation, or administrative or judicial order, such as sponsoring 
public education programs, advertising, accelerating commercial 
application of technology, accelerating technology development programs, 
or making public the results of privately performed studies, surveys, or 
research activities.


<R05>
Sec. 511.65  Public comment.

    Notice and opportunity for comment are provided to the public in 
regard to settlements under this part. Subject to Sec. 511.66, notice of 
receipt of a petition for settlement is published in the Federal 
Register, and a copy of such petitions and any supporting information is 
placed in a public docket. Any settlement agreed to by the Administrator 
shall be placed in the public docket for 30 days so that interested 
persons may comment thereon. No settlement is binding until the 
completion of that thirty day period.


<R05>
Sec. 511.66  Confidential business information.

    The Administrator shall have authority to segregate from the public 
docket and to protect from public view information in support of a 
petition for settlement which has been determined to be confidential 
business information. The provisions of 15 U.S.C. 2005(d) pertaining to 
discretionary release by the Administrator of and to limited disclosure 
of information determined to be confidential business information shall 
apply to this section.

[[Page 55]]


<R05>
Sec. 511.67  Settlement order.

    If, in accordance with this subpart, the Administrator allows a 
settlement of a case of violation of an average fuel economy standard, 
an order of settlement shall be issued, setting out the terms of the 
settlement, and containing a brief discussion of the factors underlying 
the exercise of the Administrator's discretion in allowing the 
settlement, including a discussion of comments received under 
Sec. 511.65. If the Administrator rejects a petition for settlement, the 
Administrator shall give written notice of the rejection and the reasons 
for the rejection to the parties and the Presiding Officer.

petition the Administrator to entertain an interlocutory appeal in 
accordance with Sec. 511.24. If, after such appeal, the representative

proceedings, to which the communication or statement pertains.
    (4) Service on parties. The Administrator shall serve a copy of each 
communication and statement forwarded under this section on all parties 
to the proceedings. However, if the parties are numerous, or if other 
circumstances satisfy the Administrator that service of the 
communication or statement would be unduly burdensome, he or she may, in 
lieu of service, notify all parties in writing that the communication or 
statement has been made and filed and that it is available for 
inspection and copying.
    (5) Service on maker. The Administrator shall forward to the person 
who made the prohibited ex parte communication a copy of each

prohibited communication.

disclosure would be likely to result in substantial competitive harm, 
what the harmful effects of disclosure would be, why the effects should 
be viewed as substantial, and the causal relationship between the

    (vii) If information is voluntarily submitted, why disclosure by 
NHTSA would be likely to impair NHTSA's ability to obtain similar 
information in the future.
    (viii) Whether the submitter of the information asserts that 
disclosure would be likely to impair other protectable government 
interests, what the effect of disclosure is likely to be and why 
disclosure is likely to impair such interests.
    (ix) The period of time for which confidentiality is claimed 
(permanently or until a certain date or until the occurrence of a 
certain event) and why earlier disclosure would result in the harms set 
out in paragraph (b)(2)(vi), (vii) or (viii) of this section.
    (c) If any element of the showing to support a claim for 
confidentiality required under paragraph (b)(3) of this section is 
presumptively established by a class determination, as issued pursuant 
to Sec. 512.10, affecting the information for which confidentiality is 
claimed, the submitter of information need not establish that element 
again.
    (d) Information in support of a claim for confidentiality submitted 
to NHTSA under paragraph (b) of this section must consist of objective 
data to

[[Page 61]]

the maximum extent possible. To the extent that opinions are given in 
support of a claim for confidential treatment of information, the 
submitter of the information shall submit in writing to NHTSA the basis 
for the opinions, and the name, title and credentials showing the 
expertise of the person supplying the opinion.
    (e) The submitter of information for which confidential treatment is 
requested shall submit to NHTSA with the request a certification in the 
form set out in appendix A from the submitter or an agent of the 
submitter that a diligent inquiry has been made to determine that the 
information has not been disclosed, or otherwise appeared publicly, 
except as indicated in accordance with paragraphs (b)(3)(iii) and (iv) 
of this section.
    (f) A single submission of supporting information, in accordance 
with paragraph (b) of this section, may be used to support a claim for 
confidential treatment of more than one item of information claimed to 
be confidential. However, general or nonspecific assertions or analysis 
may be insufficient to form an adequate basis for the agency to find 
that information may be afforded confidential treatment, and may result 
in the denial of a claim for confidentiality.
    (g) Where confidentiality is claimed for information obtained by the 
submitter from a third party, such as a supplier, the submitter of the 
information is responsible for obtaining all information and a 
certification from the third party necessary to comply with paragraphs 
(b), (d) and (e) of this section.
    (h) Information received by NHTSA that is identified as confidential 
and whose claim for confidentiality is submitted in accordance with this 
section will be kept confidential until a determination of its 
confidentiality is made under section 512.6 of this part. Such 
information will not be publicly disclosed except in accordance with 
this part.
    (i) A submitter of information shall promptly amend supporting 
information provided under paragraphs (b) or (e) of this section if the 
submitter obtains information upon the basis of which the submitter 
knows that the supporting information was incorrect when provided, or 
that the supporting information, though correct when provided, is no 
longer correct and the circumstances are such that a failure to amend 
the supporting information is in substance a knowing concealment.
    (j) Noncompliance with this section may result in a denial of a 
claim for confidential treatment of information. Noncompliance with 
paragraph (i) of this section may subject a submitter of information to 
civil penalties.
    (l) If the submitter fails to comply with paragraph (a) of this 
section at the time the information is submitted to NHTSA so that the 
agency is not aware of a claim for confidentiality, or the scope of a 
claim for confidentiality, the claim for confidentiality may be waived 
unless the agency is notified of the claim before the information is 
disclosed to the public. Placing the information in a public docket or 
file is disclosure to the public within the meaning of this part, and 
any claim for confidential treatment of information disclosed to the 
public may be precluded.
    (2) If the submitter of the information does not provide all of the 
supporting information required in paragraphs (b)(3) and (e) of this 
section, or if the information is insufficient to establish that the 
information may be afforded confidential treatment under the substantive 
tests set out in Sec. 512.5, a request that such information be afforded 
confidential protection may be denied. The Chief Counsel may notify a 
submitter of information of inadequacies in the supporting information, 
and may allow the submitter additional time to supplement the showing, 
but is under no obligation to provide either notice or additional time 
to supplement the showing.


<R05>
Sec. 512.5  Substantive standards for affording confidential treatment.

    Information submitted to or otherwise obtained by NHTSA may be 
afforded confidential treatment if it is a trade secret, or commercial 
or financial information that is privileged or confidential. Information 
is considered to be confidential when:
    (a) Disclosure of the information would be likely to result in 
substantial

[[Page 62]]

competitive harm to the submitter of the information; or
    (b) Failure to afford the information confidential treatment would 
impair the ability of NHTSA to obtain similar information in the future; 
or
    (c) Disclosure of the information would be likely to impair other 
protectable government interests.


<R05>
Sec. 512.6  Determination of confidential treatment.

    (a) The decision as to whether an item of information shall be 
afforded confidential treatment under this part is made by the Office of 
Chief Counsel.
    (b) Copies of documents submitted to NHTSA under Sec. 512.4(a)(5), 
from which information claimed to be confidential or privileged has been 
deleted, are placed in the public file or docket pending the resolution 
of the claim for confidential treatment.
    (c) When information claimed to be confidential or privileged is 
requested under the Freedom of Information Act, the determination of 
confidentiality is made within ten working days after NHTSA receives 
such a request, or within twenty working days in unusual circumstances 
as provided under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6).
    (d) For information not requested pursuant to the Freedom of 
Information Act, the determination of confidentiality is made within a 
reasonable period of time at the discretion of the Chief Counsel.
    (e) The time periods prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section may 
be extended by the Chief Counsel for good cause shown on the Chief 
Counsel's own motion, or on request from any person. An extension is 
made only in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552, and is accompanied by a 
written statement setting out the reasons for the extension.
    (f) If the Chief Counsel believes that information which a submitter 
of information asserts to be within a class of information set out in 
appendix B is not within that class, the Chief Counsel:
    (1) Notifies the submitter of the information that the information 
does not fall within the class as claimed, and briefly explains why the 
information does not fall within the class; and
    (2) Renders a determination of confidentiality in accordance with 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (g) A person submitting information to NHTSA with a request that the 
information be withheld from public disclosure as confidential or 
privileged business information is given notice of the Chief Counsel's 
determination regarding the request as soon as the determination is 
made.
    (1) If a request for confidentiality is granted, the submitter of 
the information is notified in writing of that determination and of any 
appropriate limitations.
    (2) If a request for confidentiality is denied in whole or in part, 
the submitter of the information is notified in writing of that 
decision, and is informed that the information will be made available to 
the public not less than ten working days after the submitter of the 
information has received notice of the denial of the request for 
confidential treatment, if practicable, or some earlier date if the 
Chief Counsel determines in writing that the public interest requires 
that the information be made available to the public on such earlier 
date. The written notification of a denial specifies the reasons for 
denying the request.
    (h) There will be no release of information processed pursuant to 
this section until the Chief Counsel advises the appropriate office(s) 
of NHTSA that the confidentiality decision is final according to this 
section, Sec. 512.7 or Sec. 512.9.


<R05>
Sec. 512.7  Petitions for reconsideration upon denial of a request for confidential treatment.

    (a) A submitter of information whose request for confidential 
treatment is denied may petition for reconsideration of that denial. 
Petitions for reconsideration must be addressed to and received by the 
Office of Chief Counsel prior to the date on which the information would 
otherwise be made available to the public. The determination by the 
Chief Counsel upon such petition for reconsideration shall be 
administratively final.
    (b) If the submission of a petition for reconsideration is not 
feasible by the date on which the information would otherwise be made 
available to the

[[Page 63]]

public, a request for an extension of time in which to submit a 
petition, accompanied by an explanation describing the reason for the 
request and the length of time needed, must be received by the Office of 
Chief Counsel by that date. The Chief Counsel determines whether to 
grant or deny the extension and the length of the extension.
    (c) Upon receipt of a petition or request for an extension, the 
Chief Counsel shall postpone making the information available to the 
public in order to consider the petition, unless the Chief Counsel 
determines in writing that disclosure would be in the public interest.
    (d) If a petition for reconsideration is granted, the petitioner is 
notified in writing of that determination and of any appropriate 
limitations.
    (e) If a petition for reconsideration is denied in whole or in part 
or a request for an extension for additional time to submit a petition 
for reconsideration is denied, the petitioner is notified in writing of 
that denial, and is informed that the information will be made available 
to the public not less than ten working days after the petitioner has 
received notice of the denial of the petition, if practicable, or some 
earlier date if the Chief Counsel determines in writing that the public 
interest requires that the information be made available to the public 
on such earlier date. The written notification of a denial specifies the 
reasons for denying the petition.


<R05>
Sec. 512.8  Modification of confidentiality determinations.

    (a) A determination that information is confidential or privileged 
business information remains in effect in accordance with its terms, 
unless modified by a later determination based upon:
    (1) Newly discovered or changed facts,
    (2) A change in the applicable law,
    (3) A class determination under Sec. 512.10, or
    (4) A finding that the prior determination is clearly erroneous.
    (b) If NHTSA believes that an earlier determination of 
confidentiality should be modified based on one or more of the factors 
listed in paragraph (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, the submitter 
of the information is notified in writing that NHTSA has modified its 
earlier determination and of the reasons for that modification, and is 
informed that the information will be made available to the public in 
not less than ten working days from the date of receipt of notice under 
this paragraph. The submitter may seek reconsideration of the 
modification pursuant to Sec. 512.7.


<R05>
Sec. 512.9  Release of confidential business information.

    (a) Information that has been claimed or determined to be 
confidential business information under Secs. 512.4, 512.6 or 512.7 may 
be disclosed to the public by the Administrator notwithstanding such 
determination or claim if disclosure would be in the public interest as 
follows:
    (1) Information obtained under Part A, Subchapter I of the National 
Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, relating to the establishment, 
amendment, or modification of Federal motor vehicle safety standards, 
may be disclosed when relevant to a proceeding under the part.
    (2) Information obtained under Part B, Subchapter I of the National 
Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, relating to motor vehicle safety 
defects, and failures to comply with applicable motor vehicle safety 
standards, may be disclosed if the Administrator determines that 
disclosure is necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act.
    (3) Information obtained under title I, V or VI of the Motor Vehicle 
Information and Cost Savings Act may be disclosed when that information 
is relevant to a proceeding under the title under which the information 
was obtained.
    (b) No information is disclosed under this section unless the 
submitter of the information is given written notice of the 
Administrator's intention to disclose information under this section. 
Written notice is normally given at least ten working days before the 
day of release, although the Administrator may provide shorter notice if 
the Administrator finds that such shorter notice is in the public 
interest. The notice under this paragraph includes a

[[Page 64]]

statement of the Administrator's reasons for determining to disclose the 
information, and affords the submitter of the information an opportunity 
to comment on the contemplated release of information. The Administrator 
may also give notice of the contemplated release of information to other 
persons, and may allow these persons the opportunity to comment. When a 
decision is made to release information pursuant to this section, the 
Administrator will consider ways to make the release with the least 
possible adverse effects to the submitter.
    (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, information 
which has been determined or claimed to be confidential business 
information, may be released:
    (1) To Congress;
    (2) Pursuant to an order of a court with valid jurisdiction;
    (3) To the Office of the Secretary, United States Department of 
Transportation and other Executive branch offices or other Federal 
agencies in accordance with applicable laws;
    (4) With the consent of the submitter of the information;
    (5) To contractors, if necessary for the performance of a contract 
with the Administration. In such instances, the contract limits further 
release of the information to named employees of the contractor with a 
need to know and provides that unauthorized release constitutes a breach 
of the contract for which the contractor may be liable to third parties.


<R05>
Sec. 512.10  Class determinations.

    (a) The Chief Counsel may issue a class determination relating to 
confidentiality under this section if the Chief Counsel determines that 
one or more characteristics common to each item of information in that 
class will in most cases necessarily result in identical treatment of 
each item of information under this part, and that it is appropriate to 
treat all such items as a class for one or more purposes under this 
part. The Chief Counsel obtains the concurrence of the Office of the 
General Counsel, United States Department of Transportation, for any 
class determination that has the effect of raising the presumption that 
all information in that class is eligible for confidential treatment. 
Class determinations are published in the Federal Register.
    (b) A class determination clearly identifies the class of 
information to which it pertains.
    (c) A class determination may state that all of the information in 
the class:
    (1) Is or is not governed by a particular section of this part, or 
by a particular set of substantive criteria under this part,
    (2) Fails to satisfy one or more of the applicable substantive 
criteria, and is therefore ineligible for confidential treatment,
    (3) Satisfies one or more of the applicable substantive criteria, 
and is therefore eligible for confidential treatment, or,
    (4) Satisfies one of the substantive criteria during a certain 
period of time, but will be ineligible for confidential treatment 
thereafter.
    (d) Class determinations will have the effect of establishing 
rebuttable presumptions, and do not conclusively determine any of the 
factors set out in paragraph (c) of this section.

                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 520.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 
1969 (83 Stat. 853; 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)), as implemented by Executive 
Order 11514 (3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 902) and the Council on 
Environmental Quality's Guidelines of April 23, 1971 (36 FR 7724), 
requires that all agencies of the Federal Government prepare detailed 
environmental statements on proposals for legislation and other major 
Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human 
environment. The purpose of the Act is to build into the agency 
decision-making process careful consideration of all environmental 
aspects of proposed actions.

[[Page 66]]

    (b) This part specifies National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) procedures for conducting environmental 
assessments and reviews, and for the preparation of environmental impact 
statements on proposals for legislation and other major agency actions 
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.


<R05>
Sec. 520.2  Policy.

    The agency will strive to carry out the full intent and purpose of 
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and related orders and 
statutes, and take positive steps to avoid any action which could 
adversely affect the quality of the human environment.


<R05>
Sec. 520.3  Definitions.

    (a) Environmental assessment is a written analysis describing the 
environmental impact of a proposed or ongoing agency action, submitted 
to the agency either by its grantees or contractors, or by any person 
outside the agency as part of any program or project proposal within the 
scope of activities listed in Sec. 520.4(b).
    (b) Environmental review is a formal evaluation undertaken by the 
agency, culminating in a brief document (the environmental review 
report), to determine whether a proposed or ongoing NHTSA action may 
have a significant impact on the environment. The review document will 
be included in the proposed or ongoing agency action, and either support 
a negative declaration or recommend the preparation of a draft 
environmental impact statement.
    (c) Draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) means a preliminary 
statement on the environmental impact of a proposed or ongoing NHTSA 
action which is circulated for comment and review within and outside 
NHTSA.
    (d) Final environmental impact statement (FEIS) means a detailed 
statement which, pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National 
Environmental Policy Act, identifies and analyzes the anticipated 
environmental impact of a proposed or ongoing NHTSA action.
    (e) Negative declaration means a statement prepared subsequent to an 
environmental review, which states that a proposed or ongoing NHTSA 
action will have no significant environmental impact and therefore does 
not require a draft or final environmental impact statement.


<R05>
Sec. 520.4  Applicability.

    (a) Scope. This part applies to all elements of NHTSA, including the 
Regional Offices.
    (b) Actions covered. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this 
section, this part applies to the following agency actions and such 
actions and proposals as may be sponsored jointly with another agency:
    (1) New and continuing programs and projects; budget proposals; 
legislative proposals by the agency; requests for appropriations; 
reports on legislation initiated elsewhere where the agency has primary 
responsibility for the subject matter involved; and any renewals or 
reapprovals of the foregoing;
    (2) Research, development, and demonstration projects; formal 
approvals of work plans; and associated contracts;
    (3) Rulemaking and regulatory actions, including Notices of Proposed 
Rulemaking (NPRM); requests for procurement (RFP); requests for grants 
(Annual Work Programs); and contracts;
    (4) All grants, loans or other financial assistance for use in State 
and Community projects;
    (5) Annual State Highway Safety Work Programs;
    (6) Construction; leases; purchases; operation of Federal 
facilities; and
    (7) Any other activity, project, or action likely to have a 
significant effect on the environment.
    (c) Continuing actions. This part applies to any action enumerated 
in paragraph (b) of this section, even though such actions arise from a 
project or program initiated prior to enactment of the National 
Environmental Policy Act on January 1, 1970.
    (d) Environmental assessments. Within the scope of activities listed 
in Sec. 520.4(b), any person outside the agency submitting a program or 
project proposal may be requested to prepare an environmental assessment 
of such proposed action to be included in his submission to the agency.
    (e) Exceptions. (1) Assistance in the form of general revenue 
sharing funds,

[[Page 67]]

distributed under the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972, 31 
U.S.C. 1221, with no control by the NHTSA over the subsequent use of 
such funds;
    (2) Personnel actions;
    (3) Administrative procurements (e.g., general supplies) and 
contracts for personal services;
    (4) Legislative proposals originating in another agency and relating 
to matters not within NHTSA's primary areas of responsibility;
    (5) Project amendments (e.g., increases in costs) which have no 
environmental significance; and
    (6) Minor agency actions that are determined by the official 
responsible for the actions to be of such limited scope that they 
clearly will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human 
environment.
    (f) Consolidation of statements. Proposed actions (and alternatives 
thereto) having substantially similar environmental impacts may be 
covered by a single environmental review and environmental impact 
statement or negative declaration.


<R05>
Sec. 520.5  Guidelines for identifying major actions significantly affecting the environment.

    (a) General guidelines. The phrase, ``major Federal actions 
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,'' as used 
in this part, shall be construed with a view to the overall, cumulative 
impact of the actions, other Federal projects or actions in the area, 
and any further contemplated or anticipated actions. Therefore, an 
environmental impact statement should be prepared in any of the 
following situations:
    (1) Proposed actions which are localized in their impact but which 
have a potential for significantly affecting the environment;
    (2) Any proposed action which is likely to be controversial on 
environmental grounds;
    (3) Any proposed action which has unclear but potentially 
significant environmental consequences.
    (b) Specific guidelines. While a precise definition of environmental 
significance that is valid in all contexts is not possible, any of the 
following actions should ordinarily be considered as significantly 
affecting the quality of the human environment:
    (1) Any matter falling under section 4(f) of the Department of 
Transportation Act (49 U.S.C. 1653(f)) and section 138 of Federal-aid 
highway legislation (23 U.S.C. 138), requiring the use of any publicly 
owned land from a park, recreation area, or wildlife and waterfowl 
refuge of national, State, or local significance as determined by the 
Federal, State, or local officials having jurisdiction thereof, or any 
land from an historic site of national, State, or local significance;
    (2) Any matter falling under section 106 of the National Historic 
Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470(f)), requiring consideration of 
the effect of the proposed action on any building included in the 
National Register of Historic Preservation and reasonable opportunity 
for the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation to comment on such 
action;
    (3) Any action that is likely to affect the preservation and 
enhancement of sites of historical, architectural, or archaeological 
significance;
    (4) Any action that is likely to be highly controversial regarding 
relocation housing;
    (5) Any action that (i) divides or disrupts an established 
community, disrupts orderly, planned development, or is inconsistent 
with plans or goals that have been adopted by the community in which the 
project is located; or (ii) causes significantly increased congestion;
    (6) Any action that (i) involves inconsistency with any Federal, 
State, or local law or administrative determination relating to the 
environment; (ii) has a significantly detrimental impact on air or water 
quality or on ambient noise levels for adjoining areas; (iii) involves a 
possibility of contamination of a public water supply system; or (iv) 
affects ground water, flooding, erosion, or sedimentation;
    (7) Any action that may directly or indirectly result in a 
significant increase in noise levels, either within a motor vehicle's 
closed environment or upon nearby areas;
    (8) Any action that may directly or indirectly result in a 
significant increase in the energy or fuel necessary

[[Page 68]]

to operate a motor vehicle, including but not limited to the following: 
(i) Actions which may directly or indirectly result in a significant 
increase in the weight of a motor vehicle; and (ii) actions which may 
directly or indirectly result in a significant adverse effect upon the 
aerodynamic drag of a motor vehicle;
    (9) Any action that may directly or indirectly result in a 
significant increase in the amount of harmful emissions resulting from 
the operation of a motor vehicle;
    (10) Any action that may directly or indirectly result in a 
significant increase in either the use of or the exposure to toxic or 
hazardous materials in the manufacture, operation, or disposal of motor 
vehicles or motor vehicle equipment;
    (11) Any action that may directly or indirectly result in a 
significant increase in the problem of solid waste, as in the disposal 
of motor vehicles or motor vehicle equipment;
    (12) Any action that may directly or indirectly result in a 
significant depletion of scarce natural resources associated with the 
manufacture or operation of motor vehicles or motor vehicle equipment; 
and
    (13) Any other action that causes significant environment impact by 
directly or indirectly affecting human beings through adverse impacts on 
the environment.
    (c) Research activities. (1) In accord-ance with DOT Order 5610.1B, 
the Assistant Secretary for Systems Development and Technology (TST) 
will prepare, with the concurrence of the NHTSA, proposed procedures for 
assessing the environmental consequences of research activities. Until 
final procedures are promulgated, the following factors are to be 
considered for periodic evaluation to determine when an environmental 
statement is required for such programs:
    (i) The magnitude of Federal investment in the program;
    (ii) The likelihood of widespread application of the technology;
    (iii) The degree of environmental impact which would occur if the 
technology were widely applied; and
    (iv) The extent to which continued investment in the new technology 
is likely to restrict future alternatives.
    (2) The statement or environmental review culminating in a negative 
declaration must be written late enough in the development process to 
contain meaningful information, but early enough so that this 
information can practically serve as an input in the decision-making 
process. Where it is anticipated that an environmental impact statement 
may ultimately be required but its preparation is still premature, the 
office shall prepare a publicly available record briefly setting forth 
the reasons for its determination that a statement is not yet necessary. 
This record shall be updated at least quarterly, or as may be necessary 
when significant new information becomes available concerning the 
potential environmental impact of the program. In any case, a statement 
or environmental review culminating in a negative declaration must be 
prepared before research activities have reached a state of investment 
or commitment to implementation likely to determine subsequent 
development or restrict later alternatives. Statements on technology 
research and development programs shall include an analysis not only of 
alternative forms of the same technology that might reduce any adverse 
environmental impacts but also of alternative technologies that would 
serve the same function as the technology under consideration. Efforts 
shall be made to involve other Federal agencies and interested groups 
with relevant expertise in the preparation of such statements because 
the impacts and alternatives to be considered are likely to be less well 
defined than in other types of statements.

                          Subpart B--Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 520.21  Preparation of environmental reviews, negative declarations, and notices of intent.

    (a) General responsibilities--(1) Associate Administrators and Chief 
Counsel. Each Associate Administrator and the Chief Counsel is 
responsible for determining, in accordance with Subpart A, whether the 
projects and activities

[[Page 69]]

under his jurisdiction require an environmental review, and for 
preparing all such reviews, negative declarations, and notices of 
intent.
    (2) Regional Administrators. Each Regional Administrator, in 
consultation with the Governor's Representative, is responsible for 
determining, in accordance with Subpart A, whether proposed State 
activities in his Region, as stated in Annual Work Programs, require an 
environmental review, and for the preparing all such reviews, negative 
declarations, and notices of intent.
    (3) Associate Administrator for Planning and Evaluation. The 
Associate Administrator for Planning and Evaluation may request in 
accordance with the requirements of this order, that the appropriate 
Associate Administrator or Regional Administrator prepare an 
Environmental review or Environmental Impact Statement for any proposed 
or continuing NHTSA action, or comment on any environmental statement 
prepared by other agencies.
    (b) Coordination. Coordination with appropriate local, State and 
Federal agencies should be accomplished during the early stages by the 
responsible official to assist in identifying areas of significance and 
concern. Existing procedures, including those established under the 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Revised Circular A-95, should be 
used to the greatest extent practicable to accomplish this early 
coordination.
    (c) Applicants. (1) Each applicant for a grant, loan, or other 
financial assistance for use in State and community projects may be 
requested to submit, with the original application, an environmental 
assessment of the proposed project.
    (2) Under OMB Revised Circular A-95, ``Evaluation, Review, and 
Coordination of Federal Assistance Programs and Projects,'' and DOT 
4600.4B, ``Evaluation, Review and Coordination of DOT Assistance 
Programs and Projects,'' dated February 27, 1974, a grant applicant must 
notify the clearinghouse of its intention to apply for Federal program 
assistance. The notification must solicit comments on the project and 
its impacts from appropriate State and local agencies. Since it is the 
NHTSA's policy to assure that (i) interested parties and Federal, State, 
and local agencies receive early notification of the decision to prepare 
an environmental impact statement, and (ii) their comments on the 
environmental effects of the proposed Federal action are solicited at an 
early stage in the preparation of the draft impact statement, this early 
notification requirement may be met by a grant applicant by sending the 
notification to interested parties and agencies at the same time it is 
sent to the clearinghouse.
    (d) Consultants. Consultants may prepare background or preliminary 
material and assist in preparing a draft or final environmental 
statement for which the NHTSA takes responsibility. Care should be 
exercised in selecting consultants, and in reviewing their work, to 
insure complete and objective consideration of all relevant project 
impacts and alternatives, particularly if the consultant may expect 
further contracts based on the outcome of the environmental decision.
    (e) Environmental review report. The environmental review shall 
culminate in a brief written report of the same title, which shall be 
included in the proposed or ongoing agency action, and which:
    (1) Describes the proposed or ongoing NHTSA action, the environment 
affected, and the anticipated benefits;
    (2) Evaluates the potential environmental impact, including those 
adverse impacts which cannot be avoided, should the proposal be 
implemented or the action continued;
    (3) Assesses the alternatives to the proposed or ongoing action and 
their potential environmental impact;
    (4) Evaluates the cumulative and long-term environmental effects of 
the proposed or ongoing action;
    (5) Describes the irreversible and irretrievable commitments of 
resources involved in the proposal's implementation or the action's 
continuance;
    (6) Identifies any known or potential conflicts with State, 
regional, or local plans and programs;
    (7) Weighs and analyzes the anticipated benefits against the 
environmental and other costs of the proposed or ongoing action in a 
manner which reflects similar comparisons of reasonably available 
alternatives; and

[[Page 70]]

    (8) Concludes with a negative declaration or recommends the 
preparation of a DEIS.
    (f) Negative declarations. (1) If the responsible official judges 
that the environmental impact of a proposed or ongoing action under his 
jurisdiction will not significantly affect the quality of the human 
environment, the following declaration will be included in the 
environmental review report:

It is the judgment of this agency, based on available information, that 
no significant environmental impact will result from execution of this 
action.

    (2) A DEIS may be changed to a negative declaration if the public 
review process indicates that the proposal or ongoing action will not 
have a significant effect upon the environment.
    (3) An index of all negative declarations and a copy of each 
environmental review report shall be retained by the responsible 
official under whose jurisdiction it was prepared and shall be made 
available for public inspection upon request.
    (g) Notice of intent to prepare a draft environmental impact 
statement. If the responsible official under whose jurisdiction an 
environmental review is prepared determines that the proposed or ongoing 
action could have a potentially significant effect on the quality of the 
environment, he shall: coordinate with the Associate Administrator for 
Planning and Evaluation and the Chief Counsel, transmit to appropriate 
Federal, State and local agencies and have published in the Federal 
Register a notice of intent to prepare an environmental statement as 
soon as is practicable after the determination to prepare such a 
statement.


<R05>
Sec. 520.22  Maintenance of a list of actions.

    (a) The Associate Administrator for Planning and Evaluation shall be 
responsible for the preparation and maintenance of a list of actions for 
which draft or final environmental impact statements have been or are to 
be prepared. This list shall be on file with the Associate Administrator 
for Planning and Evaluation and shall be available for public inspection 
in the Docket Section upon request. A copy of the initial list and its 
updatings at the end of each calendar quarter shall be transmitted by 
the Associate Administrator for Planning and Evaluation to TES and CEQ.
    (b) If a determination is made that an environmental statement is 
not necessary for a proposed action (1) which has been identified as 
normally requiring preparation of a statement, (2) which is similar to 
actions for which a significant number of statements have been prepared, 
(3) which the agency has previously announced would be the subject of a 
statement, or (4) for which the official responsible for such proposal 
has made a negative determination in response to a request from the CEQ, 
a record briefly setting forth the decision and the reasons for that 
determination shall be prepared by the responsible official. Such a 
record of negative determinations and any evaluations made pursuant to 
Sec. 520.21 which conclude that preparation of a statement is not yet 
timely shall be prepared by the responsible official, submitted to the 
Associate Administrator for Planning and Evaluation, and made available 
by the Associate Administrator for Planning and Evaluation in the same 
manner as provided in paragraph (a) of this section for lists of 
statements under preparation.


<R05>
Sec. 520.23  Preparation of draft environmental impact statements.

    (a) Planning stage. (1) When a DEIS is to be prepared, the 
responsible official shall promptly initiate its preparation and develop 
a schedule in consultation with the Associate Administrator for Planning 
and Evaluation, to assure completion prior to the first significant 
point of decision in the program or project development process.
    (2) The environmental impacts of proposed activities should be 
initially assessed concurrently with the initial technical and economic 
studies.
    (3) Section 102(2)(A) of NEPA requires each Federal agency to 
utilize a ``systematic, interdisciplinary approach'' to plans and 
programs affecting the environment. To assure that all environmental 
impacts are identified and assessed, all relevant disciplines should be 
represented. If the necessary disciplines are not represented on the 
staff of the applicant or NHTSA, it is

[[Page 71]]

appropriate to use professional services available in other Federal, 
State or local agencies, universities, or consulting firms. The use of 
the interdisciplinary approach should not be limited to the 
environmental statement. This approach should also be used in the early 
planning stages to help assure a systematic evaluation of reasonable 
alternative courses of action and their potential social, economic, and 
environmental consequences.
    (b) Form and content requirements. Attachment 1 of this order 
prescribes the form and content requirements to be followed for each 
draft and final environmental impact statement. The DEIS must fulfill 
and satisfy, to the fullest extent possible at the time it is prepared, 
the requirements established for final statements.
    (c) Lead agency. CEQ guidelines provide that when more than one 
Federal agency (1) directly sponsors an action, or is directly involved 
in an action through funding, licenses, or permits, or (2) is involved 
in a group of actions directly related to each other because of their 
functional interdependence and geographical proximity, consideration 
should be given to preparing one statement for all the Federal actions 
involved. Agencies in such cases should consider the designation of a 
single ``lead agency'' to assume supervisory responsibility for 
preparation of a joint statement. Where a lead agency prepares the 
statement, the other agencies involved should provide assistance with 
respect to their areas of jurisdiction and expertise. The statement 
should contain an evaluation of the full range of Federal actions 
involved, should reflect the views of all participating agencies, and 
should be prepared before major or irreversible actions have been taken 
by any of the participating agencies. Some relevant factors in 
determining an appropriate lead agency are: The time sequence in which 
the agencies become involved, the magnitude of their respective 
involvement, and their relative expertise with respect to the project's 
environmental effects. Questions concerning ``lead agency'' decisions 
should be raised with CEQ through TES. For projects serving and 
primarily involving land owned by or under the jurisdiction of another 
Federal agency, that agency may be the appropriate lead agency.
    (d) Applicants. Where the agency requests an applicant for financial 
assistance or other agency approval to submit an environmental 
assessment, the responsible official will (1) assist the applicant by 
outlining the information required, and (2) in all cases make his own 
evaluation of the environmental issues involved and take responsibility 
for the scope and content of draft and final environmental statements.


<R05>
Sec. 520.24  Internal processing of draft environmental impact statements.

    Before circulating a DEIS for external review, the official 
responsible for the DEIS shall receive the concurrence of the Associate 
Administrator for Planning and Evaluation and the Chief Counsel; and 
prepare a memorandum for approval by the Administrator which shall:
    (a) Set forth the basis on which it was determined that a 
potentially significant environmental effect exists;
    (b) Attach the DEIS;
    (c) Identify the Federal, State, and local agencies and private 
sources from which comments on the DEIS are proposed to be solicited 
(see Attachment 2); <SUP>1</SUP> and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>1</SUP>  Filed as part of the original document.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Include a recommendation on whether a public hearing on the 
proposed action should be held.


<R05>
Sec. 520.25  External review of draft environmental impact statements.

    (a) Requirements. The official responsible for the DEIS shall:
    (1) Transmit 5 copies of the DEIS to the CEQ and 2 copies to TES;
    (2) Solicit comments from all Federal, State, and local agencies 
which have jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to the 
possible environmental impact involved, and from the public (see 
Attachment 2); and
    (3) Inform the public and interested parties of the availability of 
the DEIS and provide copies as appropriate; and
    (4) Allow a comment period of not less than 45 days from the Friday 
of the week following receipt of the draft impact statement by CEQ. 
Requests for extensions shall be granted whenever

[[Page 72]]

possible, and particularly when warranted by the magnitude and 
complexity of the statement or the extent of citizen interest.
    (b) Procedures--(1) Federal and Federal-State agency review. (i) The 
DEIS shall be circulated for review to the Federal and Federal-State 
agencies with special expertise or jurisdiction by law with regard to 
the potential environmental impact involved. These agencies and their 
relevant areas of expertise are identified in Attachment 2.
    (ii) For actions within the jurisdiction of the Environmental 
Protection Agency (air or water quality, solid wastes, pesticides, 
radiation standards, noise), the DEIS shall be sent to EPA.
    (iii) For actions which would affect any property that is included 
in the National Register of Historic Preservation, the DEIS should be 
sent to the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and the State 
Liaison Office for Historic Preservation.
    (2) State and local review. Where a review of the proposed action by 
State and local agencies authorized to develop and enforce environmental 
stand-ards is relevant, comments are to be solicited directly from such 
agencies with known responsibilities in environmental matters, and shall 
be obtained as follows:
    (i) Where review of direct Federal development projects, and of 
projects assisted under programs listed in Attachment D to revised OMB 
Circular A-95 (as implemented by DOT 4600.4B ``Evaluation, Review and 
Coordination of DOT Assistance Programs and Projects'', dated February 
27, 1974), takes place prior to preparation of an environmental 
statement, comments of the reviewing agencies on the environmental 
effects of the proposed project are inputs to the environmental 
statement. These comments shall be attached to the draft statement when 
it is circulated for review and copies of the draft shall be sent to 
those who commented. A-05 clearinghouses or other agencies designated by 
the Governor may also secure comments on environmental statements. In 
all cases, copies of the draft environmental statements shall be sent to 
clearinghouses and to the applicant whose project is the subject of the 
statement.
    (ii) Comments shall be directly obtained from appropriate State and 
local agencies, except where review is secured by agreement through A-95 
clearinghouses, unless the Governor of the appropriate State has 
designated some other point for obtaining his review. Instructions for 
obtaining the views of such agencies are contained in the joint OMB-CEQ 
memorandum (see Attachment 4). Comments shall be solicited from 
municipalities and counties on all projects located therein.
    (iii) State and local review of NHTSA procedures, regulations, and 
policies for administering Federal programs of assistance to State and 
local governments shall be obtained pursuant to procedures established 
by OMB Circular No. A-85.
    (iv) Generally, environmental statements on legislative and budget 
proposals may be excluded from State and local review.
    (3) General public review. (i) At the time the DEIS is circulated to 
Federal, State, and local agencies, public availability of the DEIS for 
comment and review will be announced by the CEQ in the Federal Register. 
Copies of the DEIS should be sent to known interested parties, and press 
releases should be sent to local news media advising where the DEIS is 
available and how copies may be obtained. The Office of Public Affairs 
and Consumer Services shall maintain a list of groups, including 
conservation organizations and motor vehicle manufacturers, known to be 
interested in the agency's activities, and directly notify such groups 
of the availability of the DEIS or send them a copy as soon as it has 
been prepared.
    (ii) A DEIS should be available to the public at least 30 days prior 
to the time of a public hearing on the DEIS.
    (iii) Copies of the DEIS will be made available at the NHTSA Docket 
Section, Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590, and, 
where appropriate, NHTSA Regional Offices, at the offices of any 
applicants or grantees, at appropriate State, regional, and metropolitan 
clearing houses, and local public libraries, and furnished to public and 
private organizations and individuals with special expertise with 
respect to the potential

[[Page 73]]

environmental impact involved, and to those with an interest in the 
action who request an opportunity to comment. Copies to be made 
available to the public shall be provided without charge to the extent 
practicable, or at a fee which is not more than the actual cost of 
reproducing copies required to be sent to other Federal agencies, 
including the CEQ.
    (iv) A copy of the DEIS should in all cases be sent to any applicant 
whose project is the subject of the statement.
    (v) If a DEIS is changed to a negative declaration as a result of 
the public review process, all agencies and individuals that received 
copies and/or commented on the DEIS must be informed that a negative 
declaration was substituted for the DEIS and given a brief explanation 
of the reason for such substitution.
    (c) Utilization of comments. Comments received on the draft 
statement, and inputs (in summary form, if appropriate) from the 
processes for citizen participation, shall accompany the environmental 
statement through the normal internal project or program review process.


<R05>
Sec. 520.26  Public hearings.

    (a) A public hearing on a proposed or ongoing action covered by a 
DEIS shall be held upon the determination by the official responsible 
for such action, in consultation with the Associate Administrator for 
Planning and Evaluation, that a public hearing would be appropriate and 
in the public interest. In deciding whether a public hearing is 
appropriate, the responsible official should consider:
    (1) The magnitude of the proposal in terms of economic costs, the 
geographic area involved, and the uniqueness or size of the commitment 
of the resources involved;
    (2) The degree of interest in the proposal, as evidenced by requests 
from the public and from Federal, State, and local authorities that a 
hearing be held;
    (3) The likelihood that information will be presented at the hearing 
which will be of assistance to the agency in fulfilling its 
responsibilities under the NEPA;
    (4) The extent to which public involvement already has been achieved 
through other means, such as earlier public hearings, meetings with 
citizen representatives, and/or written comments on the proposed action; 
and
    (5) The extent of potential environmental impact.
    (b) If it is determined that a public hearing is to be held in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the official responsible 
for the action shall both announce the hearing through newspaper 
articles, direct notification to interested parties, and clearinghouses, 
and cause a notice to be issued in the Federal Register at least 30 days 
prior to the time of such hearing:
    (1) Identifying the subject matter of the hearing;
    (2) Announcing the date, time, and place of the hearing and the 
procedures to be followed; and
    (3) Announcing the availability of the DEIS and any other 
information, as appropriate, for public inspection at one or more 
locations in the area affected by the action.


<R05>
Sec. 520.27  Legislative actions.

    (a) A DEIS on both legislative proposals and reports for which NHTSA 
either develops the Departmental position or originates the legislation 
will be cleared with TES, filed with CEQ, and submitted to the Office of 
Management and Budget through the normal DOT and NHTSA legislative 
process.
    (b) The preparation, circulation, and filing of the environmental 
statement shall be in accordance with OMB Bulletin 72-6, ``Proposed 
Federal Actions Affecting the Environment.''
    (c) A DEIS and any comments that have been received should be 
available to the Congress and to the public for consideration in 
connection with the proposed legislation or report on proposed 
legislation. In cases where the scheduling of Congressional hearings on 
recommendations or reports on proposals for legislation which the 
Department has forwarded to the Congress does not allow adequate time 
for the completion of a FEIS, a DEIS may be furnished to the Congress 
and made available to the public pending transmittal of the comments as 
received and the final text.

[[Page 74]]


<R05>
Sec. 520.28  Preparation of final environmental impact statements.

    (a) If the action is to go forward and the DEIS has not been changed 
to a negative declaration, as soon as practicable after the expiration 
of the comment period and hearing process, if any, the official 
responsible for the action shall prepare a final environmental impact 
statement (FEIS), taking into account all comments received and issues 
raised during such period and process.
    (b) The FEIS shall conform to the guidelines for form and content in 
Attachment 1.
    (c) The FEIS shall then be submitted to the Chief Counsel by the 
official responsible for the action, for determination of legal 
sufficiency.


<R05>
Sec. 520.29  Internal review of final environmental impact statements.

    (a) Upon completion of the review for legal sufficiency of the FEIS, 
the Chief Counsel shall transmit 2 copies of the FEIS to TES for 
concurrence. Unless other notification is provided within 2 weeks after 
receipt in TES, the statement will be considered concurred in by TES.
    (b) After concurrence by TES, the FEIS will be transmitted by the 
Chief Counsel to the Administrator for approval.
    (c) If an action requires the personal approval of the Secretary or 
Deputy Secretary pursuant to a request by them or by TES, TGC, or the 
NHTSA office originating the action, the final environmental statement 
shall be accompanied by a brief cover memorandum requesting the 
Secretary's or Deputy Secretary's approval of the action.
    (1) The memorandum shall have signature lines for the concurrence of 
the Assistant Secretary for Environment, Safety, and Consumer Affairs, 
the General Counsel, and the Deputy Secretary, and for the approval of 
the Secretary or Deputy Secretary.
    (2) TES, in conjunction with the Executive Secretary, is responsible 
for informing the Assistant Secretary for Congressional and 
Intergovernmental Affairs and the Office of Public Affairs of the 
Secretary's decisions so that they, in coordination with the operating 
administrations or other Secretarial Offices involved, may take the 
appropriate actions.


<R05>
Sec. 520.30  Availability of final environmental impact statements.

    (a) Pending final approval and filing with CEQ, a proposed FEIS may 
be made available to the public and Federal, State, or local agencies if 
it carries a notation that it is not approved and filed.
    (b) After approval by the Administrator, the Associate Administrator 
for Planning and Evaluation will send 5 copies of the FEIS (together 
with comments) to the CEQ; individual copies with comments attached to 
the EPA and all Federal, State, and local agencies and members of the 
public who submitted comments on the DEIS or requested copies of the 
FEIS. If the length of the statement or the number of comments make this 
distribution requirement highly impractical, TES should be consulted to 
consider an alternative arrangement.
    (c) Copies of the FEIS will be made available in the NHTSA Docket 
Section, Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590, and, 
where appropriate, NHTSA Regional Offices, at the offices of any 
applicants or grantees, and at appropriate State, regional, and 
metropolitan clearinghouses and, where the impact is localized, public 
libraries.
    (d) The official responsible for the action shall, upon request, 
make available copies of the FEIS and substantive comments received on 
the DEIS without charge to the extent practicable, or at a fee which is 
not more than the actual cost of reproducing copies.

<R05>
Sec. 520.31  Amendments or supplements.

    A draft or final environmental impact statement may be amended or

[[Page 75]]

supplemented. Supplements or amendments should be considered when 
substantial changes are made in the proposed or ongoing action that will 
introduce a new or changed environmental effect of significance to the 
quality of the environment, or significant new information becomes 
available concerning its environmental aspects. In such cases, the 
supplement or amendment shall be processed in consultation with TES with 
respect to the need for, or desirability of, recirculating the statement 
for the appropriate period. TES concurrence must be secured before 
issuance.


<R05>
Sec. 520.32  Emergency action procedures.

    The CEQ Guidelines allow modification of requirements in case of a 
national emergency, a disaster or similar great urgency. The processing 
times may be reduced, or if the emergency situation warrants, 
preparation and processing of a DEIS, FEIS, or negative declaration may 
be abbreviated. Such procedural changes, however, should be requested 
only for those projects where the need for immediate action requires 
processing in other than the normal manner.


<R05>
Sec. 520.33  Timing of proposed NHTSA actions.

    To the maximum extent practicable, no administrative action (i.e., 
any proposed action to be taken by the agency other than agency 
proposals for legislation to Congress, budget proposals, or agency 
reports on legislation) subject to this part and covered by an 
environmental impact statement shall be taken sooner than 90 days after 
a DEIS has been circulated for comment, furnished to the CEQ, and made 
public. Neither shall such administrative action be taken sooner than 30 
days after the FEIS (together with comments) has been filed with CEQ, 
and made available to commenting agencies and the public. If the FEIS is 
filed within 90 days after a DEIS has been circulated for comment, 
furnished to the CEQ and made public, the 30-day period and 90-day 
period may run concurrently to the extent that they overlap. The 90-day 
time period is measured from the date of publication in the Federal 
Register of the list of weekly filings of environmental impact 
statements with the CEQ, but the 30-day period is computed from the date 
of receipt by the CEQ.


<R05>
Sec. 520.34  Comments on environmental statements prepared by other agencies.

    (a) All requests for NHTSA's views on a DEIS or a proposed action 
undergoing environmental review by another agency will be transmitted to 
the Associate Administrator for Planning and Evaluation for action or 
referral to TES where appropriate. Offices within NHTSA may be requested 
by the Associate Administrator for Planning and Evaluation to supply any 
pertinent information and comments for a coordinated agency response.
    (b) NHTSA's comments and the comments of any offices responding to a 
request by the Associate Administrator for Planning and Evaluation 
should be organized in a manner consistent with the structure of an 
environmental review set out in Sec. 520.21(e). NHTSA programs that are 
environmentally related to the proposed action under review should be 
identified so interrelationships may receive due consideration.
    (c) Copies of NHTSA's comments on environmental statements prepared 
by other agencies shall be distributed as follows:
    (1) The original and 1 copy to the requesting agency;
    (2) 1 copy to TES-70; and
    (3) 5 copies to CEQ.
    (d) Requests by the public for copies should be referred to the 
agency originating the statement.

    2. Guidance as to content of statement. The following paragraphs of 
this Attachment are intended to be considered, where relevant, as 
guidance regarding the content of environmental statements. This 
guidance is expected to be supplemented by research reports, guidance on 
methodology, and other material from the literature as may be pertinent 
to evaluation of relevant environmental factors.
    3. General content. The following points are to be covered:
    a. A description of the proposed Federal action (e.g., ``The 
proposed Federal action is approval of a grant application to construct 
* * *''), a statement of its purpose, and a description of the 
environment affected, including information, summary technical data, and 
maps and diagrams where relevant, adequate to permit an assessment of 
potential environmental impact by commenting offices and the public.
    (1) Highly technical and specialized analyses and data should 
generally be avoided in the body of the draft impact statement. Such 
materials should be appropriately summarized in the body of the 
environmental statement and attached as appendices or footnoted with 
adequate bibliographic references.
    (2) The statement should succinctly describe the environment of the 
area affected as it exists prior to a proposed action, including other 
related Federal activities in the area, their interrelationships, and 
cumulative environmental impact. The amount of detail provided in such 
descriptions should be commensurate with the extent and expected impact 
of the action, and with the amount of information required at the 
particular level of decision making (planning, feasibility, design, 
etc.). In order to insure accurate descriptions and environmental 
considerations, site visits should be made where appropriate.
    (3) The statement should identify, as appropriate, population and 
growth characteristics of the affected area and any population and 
growth assumptions used to justify the project or program or to 
determine secondary population and growth impacts resulting from the 
proposed action and its alternatives (see paragraph 3c(2)). In 
discussing these population aspects, the statement should give 
consideration to using the rates of growth in the region of the project 
contained in the projection compiled for the Water Resources Council by 
the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Department of Commerce and the 
Economic Research Service of the Department of Agriculture (the OBERS 
projection).
    (4) The sources of data used to identify, quantify, or evaluate any 
or all environmental consequences must be expressly noted.
    b. The relationship of the proposed action and how it may conform to 
or conflict with adopted or proposed land use plans, policies, controls, 
and goals and objectives as have been promulgated by affected 
communities. Where a conflict or inconsistency exists, the statement 
should describe the extent of reconciliation and the reasons for 
proceeding notwithstanding the absence of full reconciliation.
    c. The probable impact of the proposed action on the environment. 
(1) This requires assessment of the positive and negative effects of the 
proposed action is it affects both national and international human 
environment. The attention given to different environmental factors will 
vary according to the nature, scale, and location of proposed actions. 
Among factors to be considered should be the potential effect of the 
action on such aspects of the environment as those listed in Attachment 
2, and in section 520.5(b), supra. Primary attention should be given in 
the statement to discussing those factors most evidently impacted by the 
proposed action.
    (2) Secondary and other foreseeable effects, as well as primary 
consequences for the environment, should be included in the analyses. 
Secondary effects, such as the impact on fuel consumption, emissions, or 
noise levels of automobiles or in the use of toxic or scarce materials, 
may be more substantial than the primary effects of the original action.

[[Page 77]]

    d. Alternatives to the proposed action, including, where relevant, 
those not within the existing authority of the responsible preparing 
office. Section 102(2)(D) of NEPA requires the responsible agency to 
``study, develop, and describe appropriate alternatives to recommended 
courses of action in any proposal which involves unresolved conflicts 
concerning alternative uses of available resources.'' A rigorous 
exploration and an objective evaluation of the environmental impacts of 
all reasonable alternative actions, particularly those that might 
enhance environmental quality or avoid some or all of the adverse 
environmental effects, are essential. Sufficient analysis of such 
alternatives and their environmental benefits, costs, and risks should 
accompany the proposed action through the review process in order not to 
foreclose prematurely options which might enhance environmental quality 
or have less detrimental effects. Examples of such alternatives include: 
The alternatives of not taking any action or of postponing action 
pending further study; alternatives requiring actions of a significantly 
different nature which would provide similar benefits with different 
environmental impacts, e.g., low capital intensive improvements, mass 
transit alternatives to highway construction; alternatives related to 
different locations or designs or details of the proposed action which 
would present different environmental impacts. In each case, the 
analysis should be sufficiently detailed to reveal comparative 
evaluation of the environmental benefits, costs, and risks of the 
proposed action and each reasonable alternative. Where an existing 
impact statement already contains such an analysis its treatment of 
alternatives may be incorporated, provided such treatment is current and 
relevant to the precise purpose of the proposed action.
    e. Any probable adverse environmental effacts which cannot be 
avoided (such as water or air pollution, noise, undesirable land use 
patterns, or impacts on public parks and recreation areas, wildlife and 
waterfowl refuges, or on historic sites, damage to life systems, traffic 
congestion, threats to health, or other consequences adverse to the 
environmental goals set out in section 101(b) of NEPA). This should be a 
brief section summarizing in one place those effects discussed in 
paragraph 3c that are adverse and unavoidable under the proposed action. 
Included for purposes of contrast should be a clear statement of how all 
adverse effects will be mitigated. Where mitigating steps are included 
in the statement, the responsible official shall see that they are 
carried out.
    f. The relationship between local short-term uses of man's 
environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term 
productivity. This section should contain a brief discussion of the 
extent to which the proposed action involves tradeoffs between short-
term environmental gains at the expense of long-term losses, or vice 
versa, and a discussion of the extent to which the proposed action 
forecloses future options.
    g. Any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources that 
would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented. This 
requires identification of unavoidable impacts and the extent to which 
the action irreversibly curtails the range of potential uses of the 
environment. ``Resources'' means not only the labor and materials 
devoted to an action but also the natural and cultural resources lost or 
destroyed.
    h. An indication of what other interests and considerations of 
Federal policy are thought to offset the adverse environmental effects 
of the proposed action identified pursuant to subparagraphs (c) and (e) 
of this paragraph. The statement should also indicate the extent to 
which these stated countervailing benefits could be realized by 
following reasonable alternatives to the proposed action (as identified 
in subparagraph (d) of this paragraph) that would avoid some or all of 
the adverse environmental effects. In this connection if a cost-benefit 
analysis of the proposed action has been prepared, it, or a summary, 
should be attached to the environmental impact statement, and should 
clearly indicate the extent to which environmental costs have not been 
reflected in such analysis.
    i. A discussion of problems and objections raised by other Federal 
agencies, State and local entities, and citizens in the review process, 
and the disposition of the issues involved and the reasons therefor. 
(This section shall be added to the final environmental statement at the 
end of the review process.)
    (1) The draft and final statements should document issues raised 
through consultations with Federal, State, and local agencies with 
jurisdiction or special expertise and with citizens, of actions taken in 
response to comments, public hearings, and other citizens involvement 
proceedings.
    (2) Any unresolved environmental issues and efforts to resolve them, 
through further consultations or otherwise, should be identified in the 
final statement. For instance, where an agency comments that the 
statement has inadequate analysis or that the agency has reservations 
concerning the impacts, or believes that the impacts are too adverse for 
approval, either the issue should be resolved or the final statement 
should reflect efforts to resolve the issue and set forth any action 
that will result.
    (3) The statement should reflect that every effort was made to 
discover and discuss all major points of view on the environmental 
effects of the proposed action and alternatives in the draft statement. 
However,

[[Page 78]]

where opposing professional views and responsible opinion have been 
overlooked in the draft statement and are raised through the commenting 
process, the environmental effects of the action should be reviewed in 
light of those views. A meaningful reference should be made in the final 
statement to the existence of any responsible opposing view not 
adequately discussed in the draft statement indicating responses to the 
issues raised.
    (4) All substantive comments received on the draft (or summaries of 
responses from the public which have been exceptionally voluminous) 
should be attached to the final statement, whether or not each such 
comment is thought to merit individual discussion in the text of the 
statement.
    j. Draft statement should indicate at appropriate points in the text 
any underlying studies, reports, and other information obtained and 
considered in preparing the statement, including any cost-benefit 
analyses prepared. In the case of documents not likely to be easily 
accessible (such as internal studies or reports), the statement should 
indicate how such information may be obtained. If such information is 
attached to the statement, care should be taken to insure that the 
statement remains an essentially self-contained instrument, capable of 
being understood by the reader without the need for undue cross 
reference.
    4. Publicly owned parklands, recreational areas, wildlife and 
waterfowl refuges and historic sites. The following points are to be 
covered:
    a. Description of ``any publicly owned land from a public park, 
recreational area or wildlife and waterfowl refuge'' or ``any land from 
an historic site'' affected or taken by the project. This includes its 
size, available activities, use, patronage, unique or irreplaceable 
qualities, relationship to other similarly used lands in the vicinity of 
the project, maps, plans, slides, photographs, and drawings showing a 
sufficient scale and detail the project. This also includes its impact 
on park, recreation, wildlife, or historic areas, and changes in 
vehicular or pedestrian access.
    b. Statement of the ``national, State or local significance'' of the 
entire park, recreational area, refuge, or historic site ``as determined 
by the Federal, State or local officials having jurisdiction thereof.''
    (1) In the absence of such a statement lands will be presumed to be 
significant. Any statement of ``insignificance'' by the official having 
jurisdiction is subject to review by the Department as to whether such 
statement is capricious.
    (2) Where Federal lands are administered for multiple uses, the 
Federal official having jurisdiction over the lands shall determine 
whether the subject lands are in fact being used for park, recreation, 
wildlife, waterfowl, or historic purposes.
    c. Similar data, as appropriate, for alternative designs and 
locations, including detailed cost estimates (with figures showing 
percentage differences in total project costs) and technical 
feasibility, and appropriate analysis of the alternatives, including any 
unique problems present and evidence that the cost or community 
disruptions resulting from alternative routes reach extraordinary 
magnitudes. This portion of the statement should demonstrate compliance 
with the Supreme Court's statement in the Overton Park case, as follows:
    [The] very existence of the statute indicates that protection of 
parkland was to be given paramount importance. The few green havens that 
are public parks were not to be lost unless there were truly unusual 
factors present in a particular case or the cost or community disruption 
resulting from alternative routes reached extraordinary magnitudes. If 
the statutes are to have any meaning, the Secretary cannot approve the 
destruction of parkland unless he finds that alternative routes present 
unique problems. 401 U.S. 402, 412 (1971).
    d. If there is no feasible and prudent alternative, description of 
all planning undertaken to minimize harm to the protected area and 
statement of actions taken or to be taken to implement this planning, 
including measures to maintain or enhance the natural beauty of the 
lands traversed.
    (1) Measures to minimize harm may include replacement of land and 
facilities, providing land or facilities, provision for functional 
replacement of the facility (see 49 CFR 25.267).
    (2) Design measures to minimize harm; e.g., tunneling, cut and 
cover, cut and fill, treatment of embankments, planting, screening, 
maintenance of pedestrian or bicycle paths and noise mitigation measures 
all reflecting utilization of appropriate interdisciplinary design 
personnel.
    e. Evidence of concurrence or description of efforts to obtain 
concurrence of Federal, State or local officials having jurisdiction 
over the section 4(f) property regarding the action proposed and the 
measures planned to minimize harm.
    f. If Federally-owned properties are involved in highway projects, 
the final statement shall include the action taken or an indication of 
the expected action after filing a map of the proposed use of the land 
or other appropriate documentation with the Secretary of the Department 
supervising the land (23 U.S.C. 317).
    g. If land acquired with Federal grant money (Department of Housing 
and Urban Development open space or Bureau of Outdoor Recreation land 
and water conservation funds) is involved, the final statement shall

[[Page 79]]

include appropriate communications with the grantor agency.
    h. TGC will determine application of section 4(f) to public 
interests in lands, such as easements, reversions, etc.
    i. A specific finding by the Administrator that there is no feasible 
and prudent alternative and that the proposal includes all possible 
planning to minimize harm to the ``4(f) area'' involved.
    5. Properties and sites of historic and cultural significance. The 
statement should document actions taken to preserve and enhance 
districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects of historical, 
architectural, archeological, or cultural significance affected by the 
action.
    a. Draft environmental statements should include identification, 
through consulting the National Register and applying the National 
Register Criteria (36 CFR part 800), of properties that are included in 
or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places 
that may be affected by the project. The National Register is published 
in its entirety each February in the Federal Register. Monthly additions 
and listings of eligible properties are published in the Federal 
Register the first Tuesday of each month. The Secretary of the Interior 
will advise, upon request, whether properties are eligible for the 
National Register.
    b. If application of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation's 
(ACHP) Criteria of Effect (36 CFR part 800) indicates that the project 
will have an effect upon a property included in or eligible for 
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, the draft 
environmental statement should document the effect. Evaluation of the 
effect should be made in consultation with the State Historic 
Preservation Officer (SHPO) and in accordance with the ACHP's criteria 
of Adverse Effect (36 CFR part 800).
    c. Determinations of no adverse effect should be documented in the 
draft statement with evidence of the application of the ACHP's Criteria 
of Adverse Effect, the views of the appropriate State Historic 
Preservation Officer, and submission of the determination to the ACHP 
for review.
    d. If the project will have an adverse effect upon a property 
included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of 
Historic Places, the final environmental statement should include either 
an executed Memorandum of Agreement or comments from the Council after 
consideration of the project at a meeting of the ACHP and an account of 
actions to be taken in response to the comments of the ACHP. Procedures 
for obtaining a Memorandum of Agreement and the comments of the Council 
are found in 36 CFR part 800.
    e. To determine whether the project will have an effect on 
properties of State or local historical, architectural, archaeological, 
or cultural significance not included in or eligible for inclusion in 
the National Register, the responsible official should consult with the 
State Historic Preservation Officer, with the local official having 
jurisdiction of the property, and where appropriate, with historical 
societies, museums, or academic institutions having expertise with 
regard to the property. Use of land from historic properties of Federal, 
State and local significance as determined by the official having 
jurisdiction thereof involves section 4(f) of the DOT Act and 
documentation should include information necessary to consider a 4(f) 
determination (see paragraph 4).
    6. Impacts of the proposed action on the human environment involving 
community disruption and relocation. a. The statement should include a 
description of probable impact sufficient to enable an understanding of 
the extent of the environmental and social impact of the project 
alternatives and to consider whether relocation problems can be properly 
handled. This would include the following information obtainable by 
visual inspection of the proposed affected area and from secondary 
sources and community sources when available.
    (1) An estimate of the households to be displaced including the 
family characteristics (e.g., minorities, and income levels, tenure, the 
elderly, large families).
    (2) Impact on the human environment of an action which divides or 
disrupts an established community, including where pertinent, the effect 
of displacement on types of families and individuals affected, effect of 
streets cut off, separation of residences from community facilities, 
separation of residential areas.
    (3) Impact on the neighborhood and housing to which relocation is 
likely to take place (e.g., lack of sufficient housing for large 
families, doublings up).
    (4) An estimate of the businesses to be displaced, and the general 
effect of business dislocation on the economy of the community.
    (5) A discussion of relocation housing in the area and the ability 
to provide adequate relocation housing for the types of families to be 
displaced. If the resources are insufficient to meet the estimated 
displacement needs, a description of the actions proposed to remedy this 
situation including, if necessary, use of housing of last resort.
    (6) Results of consultation with local officials and community 
groups regarding the impacts to the community affected. Relocation 
agencies and staff and other social agencies can help to describe 
probable social impacts of this proposed action.
    (7) Where necessary, special relocation advisory services to be 
provided the elderly, handicapped and illiterate regarding 
interpretations of benefits, assistance in selecting replacement housing 
and consultation with

[[Page 80]]

respect to acquiring, leasing, and occupying replacement housing.
    b. This data should provide the preliminary basis for assurance of 
the availability of relocation housing as required by DOT 5620.1, 
Replacement Housing Policy, dated June 24, 1970, and 49 CFR 25.53.
    7. Considerations relating to pedestrians and bicyclists. Where 
appropriate, the statement should discuss impacts on and consideration 
to be given in the development of the project to pedestrian and bicycle 
access, movement and safety within the affected area, particularly in 
medium and high density commercial and residential areas.
    8. Other social impacts. The general social groups specially 
benefitted or harmed by the proposed action should be identified in the 
statement including the following:
    a. Particular effects of a proposal on the elderly, handicapped, 
non-drivers, transit dependent, or minorities should be described to the 
extent reasonably predictable.
    b. How the proposal will facilitate or inhibit their access to jobs, 
educational facilities, religious institutions, health and welfare 
services, recreational facilities, social and cultural facilities, 
pedestrian movement facilities, and public transit services.
    9. Standards as to noise, air, and water pollution. The statement 
shall reflect sufficient analysis of the effects of the proposed action 
on attainment and maintenance of any environmental standards established 
by law or administrative determination (e.g., noise, ambient air 
quality, water quality) including the following documentation:
    a. With respect to water quality, there should be consultation with 
the agency responsible for the State water pollution control program as 
to conformity with standards and regulations regarding storm sewer 
discharge sedimentation control, and other non-point source discharges.
    b. The comments or determinations of the offices charged with 
administration of the State's implementation plan for air quality as to 
the consistency of the project with State plans for the implementation 
of ambient air quality standards.
    c. Conformity to adopted noise standards, compatible, if 
appropriate, with different land uses.
    10. Energy supply and natural resources development. Where 
applicable, the statement should reflect consideration of whether the 
project or program will have any effect on either the production or 
consumption of energy and other natural resources, and discuss such 
effects if they are significant.
    11. Flood hazard evaluation. When an alternative under consideration 
encroaches on a flood plain, the statement should include evidence that 
studies have been made and evidence of consultations with agencies with 
expertise have been carried out. Necessary measures to handle flood 
hazard problems should be described. In compliance with Executive Order 
11296, and Flood Hazard Guidelines for Federal Executive Agencies, 
promulgated by the Water Resources Council, or how such requirements can 
be met during project development.
    12. Considerations relating to wetlands or coastal zones. Where 
wetlands or coastal zones are involved, the statement should include:
    a. Information on location, types, and extent of wetlands areas 
which might be affected by the proposed action.
    b. An assessment of the impacts resulting from both construction and 
operation of the project on the wetlands and associated wildlife, and 
measures to minimize adverse impacts.
    c. A statement by the local representative of the Department of the 
Interior, and any other responsible officials with special expertise, 
setting forth his views on the impacts of the project on the wetlands, 
the worth of the particular wetlands areas involved to the community and 
to the Nation, and recommendations as to whether the proposed action 
should proceed, and, if applicable, along what alternative route.
    d. Where applicable, a discussion of how the proposed project 
relates to the State coastal zone management program for the particular 
State in which the project is to take place.
    13. Construction impacts. In general, adverse impacts during 
construction will be of less importance than long-term impacts of a 
proposal. Nonetheless, statements should appropriately address such 
matters as the following identifying any special problem areas:
    a. Noise impacts from construction and any specifications setting 
maximum noise levels.
    b. Disposal of spoil and effect on borrow areas and disposal sites 
(include specifications where special problems are involved).
    c. Measures to minimize effects on traffic and pedestrians.
    14. Land use and urban growth. The statement should include, to the 
extent relevant and predictable:
    a. The effect of the project on land use, development patterns, and 
urban growth.
    b. Where significant land use and development impacts are 
anticipated, identify public facilities needed to serve the new 
development and any problems or issues which would arise in connection 
with these facilities, and the comments of agencies that would provide 
these facilities.

39 FR 35248, Sept. 30, 1975.

    Attachment 4--State and Local Agency Review of Impact Statements

    1. OBM Revised Circular No. A-95 through its system of 
clearinghouses provides a means for securing the views of State and 
local environmental agencies, which can assist in the preparation of 
impact statements. Under A-95, review of the proposed project in the 
case of federally assisted projects (Part I of A-95) generally takes 
place prior to the preparation of the impact statement. Therefore, 
comments on the environmental effects of the proposed project that are 
secured during this stage of the A-95 process represent inputs to the 
environmental impact statement.
    2. In the case of direct Federal development (Part II of A-95), 
Federal agencies are required to consult with clearinghouses at the 
earliest practicable time in the planning of the project or activity. 
Where such consultation occurs prior to completion of the draft impact 
statement, comments relating to the environmental effects of the 
proposed action would also represent inputs to the environmental impact 
statement.
    3. In either case, whatever comments are made on environmental 
effects of proposed Federal or federally assisted projects by 
clearinghouses, or by State and local environmental agencies through 
clearinghouses, in the course of the A-95 review should be attached to 
the draft impact statement when it is circulated for review. Copies of 
the statement should be sent to the agencies making such comments. 
Whether those agencies then elect to comment again on the basis of the 
draft impact statement is a matter to be left to the discretion of the 
commenting agency depending on its resources, the significance of the 
project and the extent to which its earlier comments were considered in 
preparing the draft statement.
    4. The clearinghouses may also be used, by mutual agreement, for 
securing reviews of the draft environmental impact statement. However, 
the Federal agency may wish to deal directly with appropriate State or 
local agencies in the review of impact statements because the 
clearinghouses may be unwilling or unable to handle this phase of the 
process. In some cases, the Governor may have designated a specific 
agency, other than the clearinghouse, for securing reviews of impact 
statements. In any case, the clearinghouses should be sent copies of the 
impact statement.
    5. To aid clearinghouses in coordinating State and local comments, 
draft statements should include copies of State and local agency 
comments made earlier under the A-95 process and should indicate on the 
summary sheet those other agencies from which comments have been 
requested, as specified in Attachment 1.

Sec. 523.2  Definitions.

    Approach angle means the smallest angle, in a plane side view of an 
automobile, formed by the level surface on which the automobile is 
standing and a line tangent to the front tire static loaded radius arc 
and touching the underside of the automobile forward of the front tire.
    Axle clearance means the vertical distance from the level surface on 
which an automobile is standing to the lowest point on the axle

index, as appropriate, and as those terms are defined in 40 CFR 600.315, 
in the case of automobiles to which either of those terms apply. With 
respect to automobiles to which neither of those terms apply ``cargo-
carrying volume'' means the total volume in cubic feet rounded to the 
nearest 0.1 cubic feet of either an automobile's enclosed nonseating 
space that is intended primarily for carrying cargo and is not 
accessible from the passenger compartment, or the space intended 
primarily for carrying cargo bounded in the front by a vertical plane 
that is perpendicular to the longitudinal centerline of the automobile 
and passes through the rearmost point on the rearmost seat and elsewhere 
by the automobile's interior surfaces.
    Curb weight is defined the same as vehicle curb weight in 40 CFR 
part 86.
    Departure angle means the smallest angle, in a plane side view of an 
automobile, formed by the level surface on which the automobile is 
standing and a line tangent to the rear tire static loaded radius arc

    (a) For purposes of this part, credits under this section shall be 
considered to be available to any manufacturer upon the completion of 
the model year in which such credits are earned under paragraph (b) of 
this section unless under paragraph (c) of this section the credits are 
made available for use at a time prior to the model year in which 
earned.
    (b) Whenever the average fuel economy for a class of light trucks 
manufactured by a manufacturer in a particular model year exceeds an 
applicable average fuel economy standard established in part 533 of this 
chapter, such manufacturer shall be entitled to credit, calculated under 
paragraph (c) of this section, which--
    (1) Shall be available to be taken into account with respect to the 
average fuel economy for the same class of light trucks of that 
manufacturer for any of the three consecutive model years immediately 
prior to the model year in which such manufacturer exceeds such 
applicable average fuel economy standard, and
    (2) To the extent that such credit is not so taken into account 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall be available to be 
taken into account with respect to the average fuel economy for the same 
class of light trucks of that manufacturer for any of the three 
consecutive model years immediately following the model year in which 
such manufacturer exceeds such applicable average fuel economy standard.
    (c)(1) At any time prior to the end of any model year, a 
manufacturer which has reason to believe that its average fuel economy 
for a class of light trucks will be below such applicable standard for 
that model year may submit a plan demonstrating that such manufacturer 
will earn sufficient credits under paragraph (b) of this section within

established in part 533 of this chapter, multiplied by
    (2) The total number of light trucks in that class manufactured by 
such manufacturer during such model year.
    (e) The Administrator takes credits into account for any model year 
on the basis of the number of tenths of a mile per gallon by which the 
manufacturer involved was below an applicable average fuel economy 
standard for a class of light trucks for that model year and the volume 
of that class of light trucks manufactured that model year by the 
manufacturer. Credits may not be applied between class of light trucks, 
except as determined by the Administrator to account for changes made in 
the definitions of classes between model years. Credits once taken into 
account for any model year shall not thereafter be available for any 
other model year. Prior to taking any credit into account, the 
Administrator provides the manufacturer involved with written notice and 
reasonable opportunity to comment thereon.

Appendix C to Part 541--Criteria for Selecting Lines Likely To Have High 
                               Theft Rates

                                  Scope

    These criteria specify the factors the Administrator will take into 
account in determining whether a new line is likely to have a high theft 
rate, and, therefore, whether such line will be subject to the 
requirements of this theft prevention standard.

                                 Purpose

    The purpose of these criteria is to enable the Administrator to 
select, by agreement with the manufacturer, if possible, those new lines 
which are likely to have high theft rates.

                               Application

    These criteria apply to lines of passenger motor vehicles initially 
introduced into commerce on or after January 1, 1983.

                               Methodology

    These criteria will be applied to each line initially introduced 
into commerce on or after January 1, 1983. The likely theft rate for 
such lines will be determined in relation to the national median theft 
rate for 1983 and 1984. If the line is determined to be likely to have a 
theft rate above the national median, the Administrator will select such 
line for coverage under this theft prevention standard.

                                Criteria

    1. Retail price of the vehicle line.
    2. Vehicle image or marketing strategy.
    3. Vehicle lines with which the new line is intended to compete, and 
the theft rates of such lines.
    4. Vehicle line(s), if any, which the new line is intended to 
replace, and the theft rate(s) of such line(s).
    5. Presence or absence of any new theft prevention devices or 
systems.
    6. Preliminary theft rate for the line, if it can be determined on 
the basis of currently available data.

          major parts interchangeable with those of a high theft line.

    Authority:  15 U.S.C. 2021, 2022, and 2023; delegation of authority 
at 49 CFR 1.50.

    Source:  59 FR 21672, Apr. 26, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 542.1  Procedures for selecting new lines that are likely to have high or low theft rates.

    (a) Scope. This section sets forth the procedures for motor vehicle 
manufacturers and NHTSA to follow in the determination of whether any 
new vehicle line is likely to have a theft rate above or below the 
median theft rate.
    (b) Application. These procedures apply to each manufacturer that 
plans to introduce a new line into commerce in the United States on or 
after April 24, 1986, and to each of those new lines.
    (c) Procedures. (1)(i) For each new line introduced before the 1997 
model year, each manufacturer uses the criteria in appendix C of part 
541 of this chapter to evaluate each new line and to conclude whether 
the new line is likely to have a theft rate above or below the median 
theft rate established for calendar years 1990 and 1991.
    (ii) For each new line to be introduced for the 1997 or subsequent 
model

[[Page 112]]

years, each manufacturer shall use the criteria in appendix C of part 
541 of this chapter to evaluate each new line and to conclude whether 
the new line is likely to have a theft rate above or below the median 
theft rate.
    (2)(i) For each new line to be introduced before the 1997 model 
year, the manufacturer submits its evaluations and conclusions made 
under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, together with the underlying 
factual information, to NHTSA not less than 18 months before the date of 
introduction. The manufacturer may request a meeting with the agency to 
further explain the bases for its evaluations and conclusions.
    (ii) For each new line to be introduced for the 1997 or subsequent 
model years, the manufacturer shall submit its evaluations and 
conclusions made under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, together 
with the underlying factual information, to NHTSA not less than 15 
months before the date of introduction. The manufacturer may request a 
meeting with the agency during this period to further explain the bases 
for its evaluations and conclusions.
    (3) Within 90 days after its receipt of the manufacturer's 
submission under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the agency 
independently evaluates the new line using the criteria in appendix C of 
part 541 of this chapter and, on a preliminary basis, determines whether 
the new line should or should not be subject to Sec. 541.2 of this 
chapter. NHTSA informs the manufacturer by letter of the agency's 
evaluations and determinations, together with the factual information 
considered by the agency in making them.
    (4) The manufacturer may request the agency to reconsider any of its 
preliminary determinations made under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. 
The manufacturer shall submit its request to the agency within 30 days 
of its receipt of the letter under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The 
request shall include the facts and arguments underlying the 
manufacturer's objections to the agency's preliminary determinations. 
During this 30-day period, the manufacturer may also request a meeting 
with the agency to discuss those objections.
    (5) Each of the agency's preliminary determinations under paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section shall become final 45 days after the agency sends 
the letter specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section unless a 
request for reconsideration has been received in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section. If such a request has been received, 
the agency makes its final determinations within 60 days of its receipt 
of the request. NHTSA informs the manufacturer by letter of those 
determinations and its response to the request for reconsideration.


<R05>
Sec. 542.2  Procedures for selecting low theft new lines with a majority of major parts interchangeable with those of a high theft line.

    (a) Scope. This section sets forth the procedures for motor vehicle 
manufacturers and NHTSA to follow in the determination of whether any 
new lines that will be likely to have a low theft rate have major parts 
interchangeable with a majority of the covered major parts of a line 
having or likely to have a high theft rate.
    (b) Application. These procedures apply to:
    (1) Each manufacturer that produces--
    (i) At least one passenger motor vehicle line that has been or will 
be introduced into commerce in the United States and that has been 
listed in appendix A of part 541 of this chapter or that has been 
identified by the manufacturer or preliminarily or finally determined by 
NHTSA to be a high-theft line under Sec. 542.1, and
    (ii) At least one passenger motor vehicle line that will be 
introduced into commerce in the United States on or after April 24, 1986 
and that the manufacturer identifies as likely to have a theft rate 
below the median theft rate; and
    (2) Each of those likely submedian theft rate lines.
    (c) Procedures. (1)(i) For each new line that is to be introduced 
before the 1997 model year and that a manufacturer identifies under 
appendix C of part 541 of this chapter as likely to have a theft rate 
below the median rate, the manufacturer identifies how many and which of 
the major parts of that line

[[Page 113]]

will be interchangeable with the covered major parts of any other of its 
lines that has been listed in appendix A of part 541 of this chapter or 
identified by the manufacturer or preliminarily or finally determined by 
the agency to be a high theft line under Sec. 542.1.
    (ii) For each new line that is to be introduced in the 1997 or 
subsequent model years and that a manufacturer identifies under appendix 
C of part 541 of this chapter as likely to have a theft rate below the 
median rate, the manufacturer shall identify how many and which of the 
major parts of that line will be interchangeable with the covered major 
parts of any other of its lines that has been listed in appendix A of 
part 541 of this chapter or identified by the manufacturer or 
preliminarily or finally determined by the agency to be a high-theft 
line under Sec. 542.1.
    (2)(i) If the manufacturer concludes that a new line that is to be 
introduced before the 1997 model year has a likely submedian theft rate 
and will have major parts that are interchangeable with a majority of 
the covered major parts of a high theft line, the manufacturer 
determines whether all the vehicles of those lines with likely submedian 
theft rates and interchangeable parts will account for more than 90 
percent of the total annual production of all of the manufacturer's 
lines with those interchangeable parts.
    (ii) If the manufacturer concludes that a new line that is to be 
introduced for the 1997 or subsequent model years has a likely submedian 
theft rate and will have major parts that are interchangeable with a 
majority of the covered major parts of a high theft line, the 
manufacturer shall determine whether all the vehicles of those lines 
with likely submedian theft rates and interchangeable parts will account 
for more than 90 percent of the total annual production of all of the 
manufacturer's lines with those interchangeable parts.
    (3)(i) For new lines to be introduced before the 1997 model year, 
the manufacturer submits its evaluations and identifications made under 
paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (2)(i) of this section, together with the 
underlying factual information, to NHTSA not less than 18 months before 
the date of introduction. During this period, the manufacturer may 
request a meeting with the agency to further explain the bases for its 
evaluations and conclusions.
    (ii) For new lines to be introduced for the 1997 and subsequent 
model years, the manufacturer shall submit its evaluations and 
conclusions made under paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (2)(ii) of this 
section, together with the underlying factual information, to NHTSA not 
less than 15 months before the date of introduction. During this period, 
the manufacturer may request a meeting with the agency to further 
explain the bases for its evaluations and conclusions.
    (4) Within 90 days after its receipt of the manufacturer's 
submission under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the agency considers 
that submission, if any, and independently makes, on a preliminary 
basis, the determinations of those lines with likely submedian theft 
rates which should or should not be subject to Sec. 541.5 of this 
chapter. NHTSA informs the manufacturer by letter of the agency's 
preliminary determinations, together with the factual information 
considered by the agency in making them.
    (5) The manufacturer may request the agency to reconsider any of its 
preliminary determinations made under paragraph (c)(4) of this section. 
The manufacturer must submit its request to the agency within 30 days of 
its receipt of the letter under paragraph (c)(4) of this section 
informing it of the agency's evaluations and preliminary determinations. 
The request must include the facts and arguments underlying the 
manufacturer's objections to the agency's preliminary determinations. 
During this 30-day period, the manufacturer may also request a meeting 
with the agency to discuss those objections.
    (6) Each of the agency's preliminary determinations made under 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section becomes final 45 days after the agency 
sends the letter specified in that paragraph unless a request for 
reconsideration has been received in accordance with paragraph (c)(5) of 
this section. If such a request has been received, the agency makes its 
final determinations within 60 days

[[Page 114]]

of its receipt of the request. NHTSA informs the manufacturer by letter 
of those determinations and its response to the request for 
reconsideration.

vehicle line or lines that are the subject of the grant, and are 
equipped with the antitheft device on which the line's exemption was 
based.
    (e) An exemption granted under this part is effective for the model 
year beginning after the model year in which NHTSA issue the notice of 
exemption, unless the notice of exemption specifies a later model year.
    (f) NHTSA publishes a notice of its decision to grant or deny an 
exemption petition in the Federal Register, and

[[Page 116]]

notifies the petitioner in writing of the agency's decision.


<R05>
Sec. 543.8  Duration of exemption.

equipment antitheft device installed under the exemption is not as 
effective as compliance with the parts-marking requirements of part 541 
in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft;
    (iii) Comply with Sec. 543.5, paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) and 
(7).
    (2) In a petition to modify an exemption, the petitioner must:
    (i) Identify the vehicle line or lines that are the subject of the 
exemption;
    (ii) Request permission to use an antitheft device similar to, but 
different from the standard equipment antitheft device which is 
installed under the exemption;
    (iii) Comply with Sec. 543.5, paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) and 
(7); and
    (iv) Provide the same information for the modified device that is

    (d) NHTSA processes any complete petition. If a person submits a 
petition under this section that does not contain all the information 
required by it, NHTSA informs the manufacturer of the areas of 
insufficiency and advises the manufacturer that the agency does not 
process the petition until it receives the required information.
    (e) If NHTSA denies a petition requesting a proceeding to terminate 
or modify an exemption, the agency notifies the petitioner by letter.
    (f) If NHTSA commences a termination proceeding on its own 
initiative or in response to a petition, the agency provides the 
manufacturer of the exempted line with a copy of the petition, if any, a 
written statement of NHTSA's reasons for commencing the proceeding, and 
an opportunity to present its written views.
    (g)(1) The agency terminates an exemption if it determines that the 
antitheft device installed under the exemption has not been as effective 
as parts-marking in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, a 
decision to terminate an exemption under this section takes effect on 
the later of the following dates:
    (i) The last day of the model year in which NHTSA issues the 
termination decision, or
    (ii) Six months after the manufacturer receives written notice of 
the termination.
    (3) If a manufacturer shows good cause why terminating its exemption 
effective on a date later than the one specified in paragraph (g)(2) of 
this section is consistent with the public interest and the purposes of 
the Act, the agency may set such later date.
    (h)(1) The agency modifies an exemption if it detemines, based on 
substantial evidence, that the modified antitheft device described in 
the petition is likely to be as effective in reducing and deterring 
motor vehicle theft as compliance with the parts-marking requirements of 
part 541.
    (2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section, a 
decision to modify an exemption under this section takes effect on the 
first day of the model year following the model year in which NHTSA 
issued the modification decision.
    (ii) If a manufacturer shows good cause why modifying its exemption 
effective on a date earlier than the one

[[Page 117]]

specified in paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section is consistent with the 
public interest and the purposes of the Act, the agency may set such 
earlier date.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) NHTSA publishes notice in the Federal Register of any agency

<R04>
               Subpart B--Procedures for Adoption of Rules


<R05>
Sec. 553.11  Initiation of rulemaking.

    The Administrator may initiate rulemaking either on his own motion 
or on petition by any interested person after a determination in 
accordance with Part 552 of this title that grant of the petition is 
advisable. The Administrator may, in his discretion, also consider the 
recommendations of other agencies of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 553.13  Notice of proposed rulemaking.

    Unless the Administrator, for good cause, finds that notice is

the notice. The petitions must be submitted to: Administrator, National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, U.S. Department of 
Transportation, 400 Seventh Street SW, Washington, DC, 20590. It is 
requested, but not required, that 10 copies be submitted. The filing of 
the petition does not automatically extend the time for petitioner's 
comments. Such a petition is granted only if the petitioner shows good 
cause for the extension, and if the extension is consistent with the 
public interest. If an extension is granted, it is granted to all 
persons, and it is published in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 553.21  Contents of written comments.

    All written comments shall be in English. Unless otherwise specified 
in a notice requesting comments, comments may not exceed 15 pages in

without regard to the 15-page limit. Any interested person shall submit 
as a part of his written comments all material that he considers 
relevant to any statement of fact made by him. Incorporation by 
reference should be avoided. However,

[[Page 127]]

if incorporation by reference is necessary, the incorporated material

    The Administrator may initiate any further rulemaking proceedings 
that he finds necessary or desirable. For example, interested persons 
may be invited to make oral arguments, to participate in conferences

Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC, 20590. It is 
requested, but not required, that 10 copies be submitted. The petition 
must be received not later than 45 days after publication of the rule in 
the Federal Register. Petitions filed after that time will be considered 
as petitions filed under Part 552 of this chapter. The petition must 
contain a brief statement of the complaint and an explanation as to why 
compliance with the rule is not practicable, is unreasonable, or is not 
in the public interest. Unless otherwise specified in the final rule, 
the statement and explanation together may not exceed 15 pages in 
length, but necessary attachments may be appended to the submission 
without regard to the 15-page limit.
    (b) If the petitioner requests the consideration of additional 
facts, he must state the reason they were not presented to the

    The Administrator may grant or deny, in whole or in part, any 
petition for reconsideration without further proceedings. In the event 
he determines to reconsider any rule, he may issue a final decision on 
reconsideration without further proceedings, or he may provide such 
opportunity to submit comment or information and data as he deems 
appropriate. Whenever the Administrator determines that a petition 
should be granted or denied, he prepares a notice of the grant

[[Page 128]]

or denial of a petition for reconsideration, for issuance to the 
petitioner, and issues it to the petitioner. The Administrator may 
consolidate petitions relating to the same rule.


<R05>
Sec. 553.39  Effect of petition for reconsideration on time for seeking judicial review.

    The filing of a timely petition for reconsideration of any rule 
issued under this part postpones the expiration of the statutory period 
in which to seek judicial review of that rule only as to the petitioner, 
and not as to other interested persons. For the petitioner, the period 
for seeking judicial review will commence at the time the agency takes 
final action upon the petition for reconsideration.

    It is the policy of the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration to issue notice of the action taken on a petition for 
reconsideration within 90 days after the closing date for receipt of 
such petitions, unless it is found impracticable to take action within

period is expected to be substantial, notice of that fact, and the date 
by which it is expected that action will be taken, will be published in 
the Federal Register.

Sec. 556.1  Scope.

    This part sets forth procedures, pursuant to section 157 of the Act, 
for exempting manufacturers of motor vehicles and replacement equipment 
from the Act's notice and remedy requirements when a defect or 
noncompliance is determined to be inconsequential as it relates to motor 
vehicle safety.


<R05>
Sec. 556.2  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to enable manufacturers of motor 
vehicles and replacement equipment to petition the NHTSA for exemption 
from the notification and remedy requirements of the Act due to the 
inconsequentiality of

[[Page 135]]

the defect or noncompliance as it relates to motor vehicle safety, and 
to give all interested persons an opportunity for presentation of data, 
views, and arguments on the issues of inconsequentiality.


<R05>
Sec. 556.3  Application.

    This part applies to manufacturers of motor vehicles and replacement 
equipment.


<R05>
Sec. 556.4  Petition for exemption.

    (a) A manufacturer who has determined the existence, in a motor 
vehicle or item of replacement equipment that he produces, of a defect 
related to motor vehicle safety or a noncompliance with an applicable 
Federal motor vehicle safety standard, or who has received notice of an 
initial determination by the NHTSA of the existence of a defect related 
to motor vehicle safety or a noncompliance, may petition for exemption 
from the Act's notification and remedy requirements on the grounds that 
the defect or noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor 
vehicle safety.
    (b) Each petition submitted under this part shall--
    (1) Be written in the English language;
    (2) Be submitted in three copies to: Administrator, National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration, Washington, DC 20590;
    (3) State the full name and address of the applicant, the nature of 
its organization (e.g., individual, partnership, or corporation) and the 
name of the State or country under the laws of which it is organized.
    (4) Describe the motor vehicle or item of replacement equipment, 
including the number involved and the period of production, and the 
defect or noncompliance concerning which an exemption is sought; and
    (5) Set forth all data, views, and arguments of the petitioner 
supporting his petition.
    (6) Be accompanied by three copies of the report the manufacturer 
has submitted, or is submitting, to NHTSA in accordance with part 573 of 
this chapter, relating to its determination of the existence of safety 
related defect or noncompliance with an applicable safety standard that 
is the subject of the petition.
    (c) In the case of defects related to motor vehicle safety or 
noncompliances determined to exist by a manufacturer, petitions under 
this part must be submitted not later than 30 days after such 
determination. In the case of defects related to motor vehicle safety or 
noncompliances initially determined to exist by the NHTSA, petitions 
must be submitted not later than 30 days after notification of the 
determination has been received by the manufacturer. Such a petition 
will not constitute a concession by the manufacturer of, nor will it be 
considered relevant to, the existence of a defect related to motor 
vehicle safety or a nonconformity.

<R05>
Sec. 556.5  Processing of petition.

    (a) The NHTSA publishes a notice of each petition in the Federal 
Register. Such notice includes:
    (1) A brief summary of the petition;
    (2) A statement of the availability of the petition and other 
relevant information for public inspection; and
    (3)(i) In the case of a defect related to motor vehicle safety or a 
noncompliance determined to exist by the manufacturer, an invitation to 
interested persons to submit written data, views, and arguments 
concerning the petition, and, upon request by the petitioner or 
interested persons, a statement of the time and place of a public 
meeting at which such materials may be presented orally if any person so 
desires.
    (ii) In the case of a defect related to motor vehicle safety or a 
noncompliance initially determined to exist by the NHTSA, an invitation 
to interested persons to submit written data, views, and arguments 
concerning the petition or to submit such data, views, and arguments 
orally at the meeting held pursuant to section 152(a) of the Act 
following the initial determination, or at a separate meeting if deemed 
appropriate by the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 556.6  Meetings.

    (a) At a meeting held under this part, any interested person may 
make oral (as well as written) presentations of

data, views, and arguments on the question whether the defect or 
noncompliance described in the Federal Register notice is 
inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety.
    (b) Sections 556 and 557 of Title 5, U.S.C., do not apply to any 
meeting held under this part. Unless otherwise specified, any meeting 
held under this part is an informal, nonadversary, fact-finding 
proceeding, at which there are no formal pleadings or adverse parties. A 
decision to grant or deny a petition, after a meeting on such petition, 
is not necessarily based exclusively on the record of the meeting.
    (c) The Administrator designates a representative to conduct any 
meeting held under this part. The Chief Counsel designates a member of 
his staff to serve as legal officer at the meeting. A transcript of the 
proceeding is kept and exhibits may be kept as part of the transcript.

Sec. 556.7  Disposition of petition.

    Notice of either a grant or denial of a petition for exemption from 
the notice and remedy requirements of the Act based upon the 
inconsequentiality of a defect or noncompliance is issued to the 
petitioner and published in the Federal Register. The effect of a grant 
of a petition is to relieve the manufacturer from any further 
responsibility to provide notice and remedy of the defect or 
noncompliance. The effect of a denial is to continue in force, as 
against a manufacturer, all duties contained in the Act relating to 
notice and remedy of the defect or noncompliance. Any interested person 
may appeal the grant or denial of a petition by submitting written data, 
views, or arguments to the Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 556.8  Rescission of decision.

    The Administrator may rescind a grant or denial of an exemption 
issued under this part any time after the receipt of new data and notice 
and opportunity for comment thereon, in accordance with Secs. 556.5 and 
556.7.


<R05>
Sec. 556.9  Public inspection of relevant information.

forward half of the left side, such that it is easily readable from 
outside the vehicle without moving any part of the vehicle.
    (e) The label for motorcycles shall be affixed to a permanent member 
of the vehicle as close as is practicable to the intersection of the 
steering post with the handle bars, in a location such that it is easily 
readable without moving any part of the vehicle except the steering 
system.
    (f) The lettering on the label shall be of a color that contrasts 
with the background of the label.
    (g) The label shall contain the following statements, in the English 
language, lettered in block capitals and numerals not less than three 
thirty-seconds of an inch high, in the order shown:
    (1) Name of manufacturer: Except as provided in paragraphs (g)(1) 
(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, the full corporate or individual 
name of the actual assembler of the vehicle shall be spelled out, except

where the label required by this section is affixed by the Registered 
Importer, the name of the Registered Importer shall also be placed on 
the label in the manner described in this paragraph, directly below the 
name of the final assembler.
    (i) If a vehicle is assembled by a corporation that is controlled by 
another corporation that assumes responsibility for conformity with the 
standards, the name of the controlling corporation may be used.
    (ii) If a vehicle is fabricated and delivered in complete but 
unassembled form, such that it is designed to be assembled without 
special machinery or tools, the fabricator of the vehicle may affix the 
label and name itself as the manufacturer for the purposes of this 
section.
    (iii) If a trailer is sold by a person who is not its manufacturer, 
but who is engaged in the manufacture of trailers and assumes legal 
responsibility for all duties and liabilities imposed by the Act with 
respect to that trailer, the name of that person may appear on the label 
as the manufacturer. In such a case the name shall be preceded by the 
words ``Responsible Manufacturer'' or ``Resp Mfr.''
    (2) Month and year of manufacture: This shall be the time during 
which work was completed at the place of main assembly of the vehicle. 
It may be spelled out, as ``June 1970'', or expressed in numerals, as 
``6/70.''
    (3) ``Gross Vehicle Weight Rating'' or ``GVWR,'' followed by the 
appropriate value in pounds, which shall not be less than the sum of the 
unloaded vehicle weight, rated cargo load, and 150 pounds times the 
vehicle's designated seating capacity. However, for school buses the 
minimum occupant weight allowance shall be 120 pounds.
    (4) ``Gross Axle Weight Rating'' or ``GAWR,'' followed by the 
appropriate value in pounds for each axle, identified in order from 
front to rear (e.g., front, first intermediate, second intermediate, 
rear). The ratings for any consecutive axles having indentical gross 
axle weight ratings when equipped with tires having the same tire size 
designation may, at the option of the manufacturer, be stated as a 
single value,

[[Page 150]]

with label indicating to which axles the ratings apply.

                      Examples of Combined Ratings

    GAWR: (a) All axles--4080 with 7.00-15 LT (D) tires.
    (b) Front--12,000 with 10.00-20(G) tires.
    First intermediate to rear--15,000 with 12.00-20(H) tires.

    (5) The statement: ``This vehicle conforms to all applicable Federal 
motor vehicle safety standards in effect on the date of manufacture 
shown above.'' The expression ``U.S.'' or ``U.S.A.'' may be inserted 
before the word ``Federal''.
    (i) In the case of passenger cars manufactured on or after September 
1, 1978, the expression ``and bumper'' shall be included in the 
statement following the word ``safety''.
    (ii) In the case of 1987 and subsequent model year passenger cars 
manufactured on or after April 24, 1986, the expression ``safety, 
bumper, and theft prevention'' shall be substituted in the statement for 
the word ``safety''.
    (6) Vehicle identification number.
    (7) The type classification of the vehicle as defined in Sec. 571.3 
of this chapter (e.g., truck, MPV, bus, trailer).
    (h) Multiple GVWR-GAWR ratings. (1) (For passenger cars only) In 
cases where different tire sizes are offered as a customer option, a 
manufacturer may at his option list more than one set of values for GVWR 
and GAWR, in response to the requirements of paragraphs (g) (3) and (4) 
of this section. If the label shows more than one set of weight rating 
values, each value shall be followed by the phrase ``with ______ 
tires,'' inserting the proper tire size designations. A manufacturer may 
at his option list one or more tire sizes where only one set of weight 
ratings is provided.

                          Passenger Car Example

GVWR:
    4400 LB with G78-14B Tires, 4800 LB with H78-14B Tires.

GAWR:
    Front--2000 LB with G78-14B Tires at 24 psi, 2200 LB with H78-14B 
Tires at 24 psi.
    Rear--2400 LB with G78-14B Tires at 28 psi, 2600 LB with H78-14B 
Tires at 28 psi.

    (2) (For multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, buses, trailers, 
and motorcycles) The manufacturer may, at its option, list more than one 
GVWR-GAWR-tire-rim-combination on the label, as long as the listing 
conforms in content and format to the requirements for tire-rim-
inflation information set forth in Standard No. 120 of this chapter 
(Sec. 571.120).
    (3) At the option of the manufacturer, additional GVWR-GAWR ratings 
for operation of the vehicle at reduced speeds may be listed at the 
bottom of the certification label following any information that is 
required to be listed.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) A manufacturer may, at his option, provide information 
concerning which tables in the document that accompanies the vehicle 
pursuant to Sec. 575.6(a) of this chapter apply to the vehicle. This 
information may not precede or interrupt the information required by 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (k) In the case of passenger cars admitted to the United States 
under 49 CFR part 592 to which the label required by this section has

         Subpart A--Vehicles With GVWR of 10,000 Pounds or Less

    Source:  38 FR 23950, Sept. 5, 1973, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 570.1  Scope.

    This part specifies standards and procedures for inspection of 
hydraulic service brake systems, steering and suspension systems, and 
tire and wheel assemblies of motor vehicles in use.


<R05>
Sec. 570.2  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to establish criteria for the inspection 
of motor vehicles by State inspection systems, in order to reduce death 
and injuries attributable to failure or inadequate performance of motor 
vehicle systems.


<R05>
Sec. 570.3  Applicability.

    This part does not in itself impose requirements on any person. It 
is intended to be implemented by States through the highway safety 
program standards issued under the Highway Safety Act (23 U.S.C. 402) 
with respect to inspection of motor vehicles with gross vehicle weight 
rating of 10,000 pounds or less, except motorcycles or trailers.


<R05>
Sec. 570.4  Definitions.

    Unless otherwise indicated, all terms used in this part that are 
defined in 49 CFR part 571, Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, are used as 
defined in that part.


<R05>
Sec. 570.5  Service brake system.

    Unless otherwise noted, the force to be applied during inspection 
procedures to power-assisted and full-power brake systems is 25 lb, and 
to all other systems, 50 lb.
    (a) Failure indicator. The brake system failure indicator lamp, if 
part of a vehicle's original equipment, shall be operable. (This lamp is 
required by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 105, 49 CFR 
571.105, on every new passenger car manufactured on or after January 1, 
1968, and on other types of motor vehicles manufactured on or after 
September 1, 1975.)
    (1) Inspection procedure. Apply the parking brake and turn the 
ignition to start, or verify lamp operation by other means indicated by 
the vehicle manufacturer that the brake system failure indicator lamp is 
operable.
    (b) Brake system integrity. The brake system shall demonstrate 
integrity as indicated by no perceptible decrease in pedal height under 
a 125 pound force applied to the brake pedal or by no illumination of 
the brake system failure indicator lamp. The brake system shall 
withstand the application of force to the pedal without failure of any 
line or other part.
    (1) Inspection procedures. With the engine running on vehicles 
equipped with power brake systems, and the ignition turned to ``on'' in 
other vehicles, apply a force of 125 pounds to the brake pedal and hold 
for 10 seconds. Note any decrease in pedal height, and whether the lamp 
illuminates.

[[Page 160]]

    (c) Brake pedal reserve. When the brake pedal is fully depressed, 
the distance that the pedal has traveled from its free position shall be 
not greater than 80 percent of the total distance from its free position 
to the floorboard or other object that restricts pedal travel.
    (1) Inspection procedure. Measure the distance (A) from the free 
pedal position to the floorboard or other object that restricts brake 
pedal travel. Depress the brake pedal, and with the force applied 
measure the distance (B) from the depressed pedal position to the 
floorboard or other object that restricts pedal travel.

Determine the percentage as

                            [(A-B)/A] x 100.

The engine must be operating when power-assisted brakes are checked. The 
pedal reserve check is not required for vehicles equipped with full 
power (central hydraulic) brake systems, or to vehicles with brake 
systems designed to operate with greater than 80 percent pedal travel.
    (d) Service brake performance. Compliance with one of the following 
performance criteria will satisfy the requirements of this section. 
Verify that tire inflation pressure is within the limits recommended by 
vehicle manufacturer before conducting either of the following tests.
    (1) Roller-type or drive-on platform tests. The force applied by the 
brake on a front wheel or a rear wheel shall not differ by more than 20 
percent from the force applied by the brake on the other front wheel or 
the other rear wheel respectively.
    (i) Inspection procedure. The vehicle shall be tested on a drive-on 
platform, or a roller-type brake analyzer with the capability of 
measuring equalization. The test shall be conducted in accordance with 
the test equipment manufacturer's specifications. Note the left to right 
brake force variance.
    (2) Road test. The service brake system shall stop the vehicle in a 
distance of 25 feet or less from a speed of 20 miles per hour without 
leaving a 12-foot-wide lane.
    (i) Inspection procedure. The road test shall be conducted on a 
level (not to exceed plus or minus one percent grade) dry, smooth, hard-
surfaced road that is free from loose material, oil, or grease. The 
service brakes shall be applied at a vehicle speed of 20 miles per hour 
and the vehicle shall be brought to a stop as specified. Measure the 
distance required to stop.
    (e) Brake hoses and assemblies. Brake hoses shall not be mounted so 
as to contact the vehicle body or chassis. Hoses shall not be cracked, 
chafed, or flattened. Protective devices, such as ``rub rings,'' shall 
not be considered part of the hose or tubing.
    (1) Inspection procedure. Examine visually, inspecting front brake 
hoses through all wheel positions from full left to full right for 
conditions indicated.


    Note: To inspect for paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) of this section, 
remove at a minimum one front wheel and one rear wheel.


    (f) Disc and drum condition. If the drum is embossed with a maximum 
safe diameter dimension or the rotor is embossed with a minimum safety 
thickness dimension, the drum or disc shall be within the appropriate 
specifications. These dimensions will be found on motor vehicles 
manufactured since January 1, 1971, and may be found on vehicles 
manufactured for several years prior to that time. If the drums and 
discs are not embossed, the drums and discs shall be within the 
manufacturer's specifications.
    (1) Inspection procedure. Examine visually for condition indicated, 
measuring as necessary.
    (g) Friction materials. On each brake the thickness of the lining or 
pad shall not be less than one thirty-second of an inch over the rivet 
heads, or the brake shoe on bonded linings or pads. Brake linings and 
pads shall not have cracks or breaks that extend to rivet holes except 
minor cracks that do not impair attachment. Drum brake linings shall be 
securely attached to brake shoes. Disc brake pads shall be securely 
attached to shoe plates.
    (1) Inspection procedure. Examine visually for conditions indicated, 
and measure height of rubbing surface of lining over rivet heads. 
Measure bonded lining thickness over shoe surface at the thinnest point 
on the lining or pad.

[[Page 161]]

    (h) Structural and mechanical parts. Backing plates and caliper 
assemblies shall not be deformed or cracked. System parts shall not be 
broken, misaligned, missing, binding, or show evidence of severe wear. 
Automatic adjusters and other parts shall be assembled and installed 
correctly.
    (1) Inspection procedure. Examine visually for conditions indicated.

<R05>
Sec. 570.6  Brake power unit.

    (a) Vacuum hoses shall not be collapsed, abraded, broken, improperly 
mounted, or audibly leaking. With residual vacuum exhausted and a 
constant 25 pound force on the brake pedal, the pedal shall fall 
slightly when the engine is started, demonstrating integrity of the 
power assist system. This test is not applicable to vehicles equipped 
with full power brake system as the service brake performance test shall 
be considered adequate test of system performance.
    (1) Inspection procedure. With engine running, examine hoses 
visually and aurally for conditions indicated. Stop engine and apply 
service brakes several times to destroy vacuum in system. Depress brake 
pedal with 25 pounds of force and while maintaining that force, start 
the engine. If brake pedal does not fall slightly under force when the 
engine starts, there is a malfunction in the power assist system.


<R05>
Sec. 570.7  Steering systems.

    (a) System play. Lash or free play in the steering system shall not 
exceed values shown in Table 1.
    (1) Inspection procedure. With the engine on and the wheels in the 
straight ahead position, turn the steering wheel in one direction until 
there is a perceptible movement of a front wheel. If a point on the 
steering wheel rim moves more than the value shown in Table 1 before 
perceptible return movement of the wheel under observation, there is 
excessive lash or free play in the steering system.

22..........................................................      2\3/4\
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Linkage play. Free play in the steering linkage shall not exceed 
one-quarter of an inch.
    (1) Inspection procedure. Elevate the front end of the vehicle to 
load the ball joints. Insure that wheel bearings are correctly adjusted. 
Grasp the front and rear of a tire and attempt to turn the tire and 
wheel assembly left and right. If the free movement at the front or rear 
tread of the tire exceeds one-quarter inch there is excessive steering 
linkage play.
    (c) Free turning. Steering wheels shall turn freely through the 
limit of travel in both directions.
    (1) Inspection procedure. Turn off steering wheel through the limit 
of travel in both directions. Feel for binding or jamming in the 
steering gear mechanism.
    (d) Alignment. Toe-in and toe-out measurements shall not be greater 
than 1.5 times the value listed in the vehicle manufacturer's service 
specification for alignment setting.
    (1) Inspection procedure. Verify that toe-in or toe-out is not 
greater than 1.5 times the values listed in the vehicle manufacturer's 
service specification for alignment settings as measured by a bar-type 
scuff gauge or other toe-in measuring device. Values to convert toe-in 
readings in inches to scuff gauge readings in ft/mi side-slip for 
different wheel sizes are provided in Table I. Tire diameters used in 
computing scuff gauge readings are based on the average maximum tire 
dimensions of grown tires in service for typical wheel and tire 
assemblies.

<R05>
Sec. 570.9  Tires.

    (a) Tread depth. The tread on each tire shall be not less than two 
thirty-seconds of an inch deep.
    (1) Inspection procedure. Passenger car tires have tread depth 
indicators that become exposed when tread depth is less than two thirty-
seconds of an inch. Inspect for indicators in any two adjacent major 
grooves at three locations spaced approximately equally around the 
outside of the tire. For vehicles other than passenger cars, it may be 
necessary to measure tread depth with a tread gauge.
    (b) Type. Vehicle shall be equipped with tires on the same axle that 
are matched in tire size designation, construction, and profile.
    (1) Inspection procedures. Examine visually. A major mismatch in 
tire size designation, construction, and profile between tires on the 
same axle, or a major deviation from the size as recommended by the 
manufacturer (e.g., as indicated on the glove box placard on 1968 and 
later passenger cars) are causes for rejection.
    (c) General condition. Tires shall be free from chunking, bumps, 
knots, or bulges evidencing cord, ply, or tread separation from the 
casing or other adjacent materials.
    (1) Inspection procedure. Examine visually for conditions indicated.

Sec. 570.54  Definitions.

    Unless otherwise indicated, all terms used in this part that are 
defined in part 571 of this chapter, Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, are 
used as defined in that part.
    Air-over-hydraulic brake subsystem means a subsystem of the air 
brake that uses compressed air to transmit a force from the driver 
control to a hydraulic brake system to actuate the service brakes.
    Electric brake system means a system that uses electric current to 
actuate the service brake.
    Vacuum brake system means a system that uses a vacuum and 
atmospheric pressure for transmitting a force from the driver control to 
the service brake, but does not include a system that uses vacuum only 
to assist the driver in applying muscular force to hydraulic or 
mechanical components.


<R05>
Sec. 570.55  Hydraulic brake system.

    The following requirements apply to vehicles with hydraulic brake 
systems.
    (a) Brake system failure indicator. The hydraulic brake system 
failure indicator lamp, if part of a vehicle's original equipment, shall 
be operable.
    (1) Inspection procedure. Apply the parking brake and turn the 
ignition to start to verify that the brake system failure indicator lamp 
is operable, or verify by other means recommended by the vehicle 
manufacturer.
    (b) Brake system integrity. The hydraulic brake system shall 
demonstrate integrity as indicated by no perceptible decrease in pedal 
height under a 125-pound force applied to the brake pedal and by no 
illumination of the brake system failure indicator lamp. The brake 
system shall withstand the application of force to the pedal without 
failure of any tube, hose or other part.
    (1) Inspection procedure. With the engine running in vehicles 
equipped with power brake systems and the ignition turned to ``on'' in 
other vehicles, apply a force of 125 pounds to the brake pedal and hold 
for 10 seconds. Note any additional decrease in pedal height after the 
initial decrease, and whether the

[[Page 164]]

brake system failure indicator lamp illuminates.
    (c) Brake pedal reserve. When the brake pedal is depressed with a 
force of 50 pounds, the distance that the pedal has traveled from its 
free position shall be not greater than 80 percent of the total distance 
from its free position to the floorboard or other object that restricts 
pedal travel. The brake pedal reserve test is not required for vehicles 
with brake systems designed by the original vehicle, manufacturer to 
operate with greater than 80 percent pedal travel.
    (1) Inspection procedure. Measure the distance (i) from the free 
pedal position to the floor board or other object that restricts brake 
pedal travel. Depress the brake pedal, and with the force applied 
measure the distance (ii) from the depressed pedal position to the floor 
board or other object that restricts pedal travel. Determine the pedal 
travel percentage as

                             [(A-B)/A] x 100

The engine must be operating when power-assisted brakes are checked.
    (d) Brake hoses, master cylinder, tubes and tube assemblies. 
Hydraulic brake hoses shall not be mounted so as to contact the vehicle 
body or chassis. Hoses shall not be cracked, chafed, or flattened. Brake 
tubes shall not be flattened or restricted. Brake hoses and tubes shall 
be attached or supported to prevent damage by vibration or abrasion. 
Master cylinder shall not show signs of leakage. Hose or tube protective 
rings or devices shall not be considered part of the hose or tubing.
    (1) Inspection procedure. Examine visually brake master cylinder, 
hoses and tubes, including front brake hoses, through all wheel 
positions from full left turn to full right turn for conditions 
indicated.

Sec. 570.56  Vacuum brake assist unit and vacuum brake system.

    The following requirements apply to vehicles with vacuum brake 
assist units and vacuum brake systems.
    (a) Vacuum brake assist unit integrity. The vacuum brake assist unit 
shall demonstrate integrity as indicated by a decrease in pedal height 
when the engine is started and a constant 50-pound force is maintained 
on the pedal.
    (1) Inspection procedure. Stop the engine and apply service brake 
several times to destroy vacuum in system. Depress the brake pedal with 
50 pounds of force and while maintaining that force, start the engine. 
If the brake pedal does not move slightly under force when the engine 
starts, there is a malfunction in the power assist unit.
    (b) Low-vacuum indicator. If the vehicle has a low-vacuum indicator, 
the indicator activation level shall not be less than 8 inches of 
mercury.
    (1) Inspection procedure. Run the engine to evacuate the system 
fully. Shut off the engine and slowly reduce the vacuum in the system by 
moderate brake applications until the vehicle vacuum gauge reads 8 
inches of mercury. Observe the functioning of the low-vacuum indicator.
    (c) Vacuum brake system integrity. (1) The vacuum brake system shall 
demonstrate integrity by meeting the following requirements:
    (i) The vacuum brake system shall provide vacuum reserve to permit 
one service brake application with a brake pedal force of 50 pounds 
after the engine is turned off without actuating the low vacuum 
indicator.
    (ii) Trailer vacuum brakes shall operate in conjunction with the 
truck or truck tractor brake pedal.
    (2) Inspection procedure. (i) Check the trailer vacuum system by 
coupling trailer(s) to truck or truck tractor and opening trailer 
shutoff valves. Start the engine and after allowing approximately 1 
minute to build up the vacuum, apply and release the brake pedal. In the 
case of trailer brakes equipped with brake chamber rods, observe the 
chamber rod movement. Run the engine to re-establish maximum vacuum, 
then shut off the engine and apply the brakes with a 50-pound force on 
the brake pedal. Note the brake application and check for low-vacuum 
indicator activation.
    (ii) For a combination vehicle equipped with breakaway protection 
and no reservoir on the towing vehicle supply line, close the supply 
line shutoff valve and disconnect the supply

[[Page 165]]

line. Apply a 50-pound force to the brake pedal on the towing vehicle 
and release. Trailer brakes should remain in the applied position.
    (d) Vacuum system hoses, tubes and connections. Vacuum hoses, tubes 
and connections shall be in place and properly supported. Vacuum hoses 
shall not be collapsed, cracked or abraded.

point and vertically above the seating reference point an amount equal 
to the rise which results from a 5-inch forward adjustment of the seat 
or 0.75 inch; and
    (2) For seats that are not adjustable fore and aft, at the seating 
reference point.
    (b) With the pivot point to ``top-of-head'' dimension at each value

this volume.


<R05>
Sec. 571.4  Explanation of usage.

    The word any, used in connection with a range of values or set of 
items in the requirements, conditions, and procedures of the standards 
or regulations in this chapter, means generally the totality of the 
items or values, any one of which may be selected by the Administration 
for testing, except where clearly specified otherwise.

    Examples: ``The vehicle shall meet the requirements of S4.1 when 
tested at any point between 18 and 22 inches above the ground.'' This 
means that the vehicle must be capable of meeting the specified 
requirements at every point between 18 and 22 inches above the ground. 
The test in question for a given vehicle may call for a single test (a 
single impact, for example), but the vehicle must meet the requirement 
at whatever point the Administration selects, within the specified 
range.
    ``Each tire shall be capable of meeting the requirements of this 
standard when mounted on any rim specified by the manufacturer as 
suitable for use with that tire.'' This means that, where the 
manufacturer specifies more than one rim as suitable for use with a 
tire, the tire must meet the requirements with whatever rim the 
Administration selects from the specified group.
    ``Any one of the items listed below may, at the option of the 
manufacturer, be substituted for the hardware specified in S4.1.'' Here 
the wording clearly indicates that the selection of items is at the 
manufacturer's option.

specification in column 2 and/or column 3. The identification shall be 
placed on or adjacent to the control. The identification shall, under 
the conditions of S6, be visible to the driver and, except as provided 
in S5.2.1.1, S5.2.1.2, and S5.2.1.3, appear to the driver perceptually 
upright.
    (b) S5.2.1(a) does not apply to a turn signal control which is 
operated in a plane essentially parallel to the face plane of the 
steering wheel in its normal driving position and which is located on 
the left side of the steering column so that it is the control on that 
side of the column nearest to the steering wheel face plane.
    S5.2.1.1  The identification of the following need not appear to the 
driver perceptually upright:
    (a) A master lighting switch or headlamp and tail lamp control that 
adjusts control and display illumination by means of rotation, or any 
other rotating control that does not have an off position.
    (b) A horn control.
    S5.2.1.2  The identification of a rotating control other than one 
described by S5.2.1.1 shall appear to the driver perceptually upright 
when the control is in the off position.
    S5.2.1.3  The identification of an automatic vehicle speed control 
located on the steering wheel, including the steering wheel hub and 
spokes, need not appear to the driver perceptually upright except when 
the vehicle, aligned to the manufacturer's specifications, has its 
wheels positioned for

[[Page 177]]

the vehicle to travel in a straight forward direction.
    S5.2.2  Identification shall be provided for each function of any 
automatic vehicle speed system control and any heating and air 
conditioning system control, and for the extreme positions of any such 
control that regulates a function over a quantitative range. If this 
identification is not specified in Table 1 or 2, it shall be in word or 
symbol form unless color coding is used. If color coding is used to 
identify the extreme positions of a temperature control, the hot extreme 
shall be identified by the color red and the cold extreme by the color 
blue.
    Example 1.  A slide lever controls the temperature of the air in the 
vehicle heating system over a continuous range, from no heat to maximum 
heat. Since the control regulates a single function over a quantitative 
range, only the extreme positions require identification.
    Example 2. A switch has three positions, for heat, defrost, and air 
conditioning. Since each position regulates a different function, each 
position must be identified.
    S5.2.3  Any display located within the passenger compartment and 
listed in column 1 of Table 2 that has a symbol designated in column 4 
of that table shall be identified by either the symbol designated in 
column 4 (or symbol substantially similar in form to that shown in 
column 4) or the word or abbreviation shown in column 3. Additional 
words or symbols may be used at the manufacturer's discretion for the 
purpose of clarity. Any telltales used in conjuction with a gauge need 
not be identified. The identification required or permitted by this 
section shall be placed on or adjacent to the display that it 
identifies. The identification of any display shall, under the 
conditions of S6, be visible to the driver and appear to the driver 
perceptually upright.
    S5.3  Illumination.
    S5.3.1  Except for foot-operated controls or hand-operated controls 
mounted upon the floor, floor console, or steering column, or in the 
windshield header area, the identification required by S5.2.1 or S5.2.2 
of any control listed in column 1 of Table 1 and accompanied by the word 
``yes'' in the corresponding space in column 4 shall be capable of being 
illuminated whenever the headlights are activated. However, control 
identification for a heating and air-conditioning system need not be 
illuminated if the system does not direct air directly upon windshield. 
If a gauge is listed in column 1 of Table 2 and accompanied by the word 
``yes'' in column 5, then the gauge and its identification required by 
S5.2.3 shall be illuminated whenever the ignition switch and/or the 
headlamps are activated. Controls, gauges, and their identifications 
need not be illuminated when the headlamps are being flashed. A telltale 
shall not emit light except when identifying the malfunction or vehicle 
condition for whose indication it is designed or during a bulb check 
upon vehicle starting.
    S5.3.2.  Each telltale shall be of the color shown in column 2 of 
Table 2. The identification of each telltale shall be in a color that 
contrasts with the background.
    S5.3.3 (a) Means shall be provided for making controls, gauges, and 
the identification of those items visible to the driver under all 
driving conditions.
    (b) The means for providing the required visibility--
    (1) Shall be adjustable to provide at least two levels of 
brightness, one of which is barely discernible to a driver who has 
adapted to dark ambient roadway conditions.
    (2) May be operable manually or automatically, and
    (3) May have levels of brightness at which those items and 
identification are not visible.
    (c) If the level of brightness is adjusted by automatic means to a 
point where those items or their identification are not visible to the 
driver, a means shall be provided to enable the driver to restore 
visibility.
    S5.3.4  (a) Means shall be provided that are capable of making 
telltales and their identification visible to the driver under all 
driving conditions.
    (b) The means for providing the required visibility may be 
adjustable manually or automatically, except that the telltales and 
identification for brakes, highbeams, turn signals, and safety belts may 
not be adjustable under any driving condition to a level that is 
invisible.
    S5.3.5  Any source of illumination within the passenger compartment

[[Page 178]]

which is forward of a transverse vertical plane 4.35 inch (110.6 mm) 
rearward of the manikin ``H'' point with the driver's seat in its 
rearmost driving position, which is not used for the controls and 
displays regulated by this standard, which is not a telltale, and which 
is capable of being illuminated while the vehicle is in motion, shall 
have either (1) light intensity which is manually or automatically 
adjustable to provide at least two levels of brightness, (2) a single 
intensity that is barely discernible to a driver who has adapted to dark 
ambient roadway conditions, or (3) a means of being turned off. This 
requirement does not apply to buses that are normally operated with the 
passenger compartment illuminated.
    S5.4  A common space may be used to display messages from any 
sources, subject to the following requirements:
    (a) The telltales for the brake, high beam, and turn signal, and the 
safety belt telltale required by S4.5.3.3 of Standard No. 208 may not be 
shown on the common space.
    (b) Except as provided in S5.4(e), the telltales listed in Table 2 
shall be displayed at the initiation of any underlying condition.
    (c) When the underlying condition exists for actuation of two or 
more messages, the messages shall be either--
    (1) Repeated automatically in sequence, or
    (2) Indicated by visible means and capable of being selected by the 
driver for viewing.
    (d) Messages may be cancellable automatically or by the driver.
    (e) The safety belt telltale must be displayed and visible during 
the time specified in S7.3 of Standard No. 208.
    S6. Conditions. The driver is restrained by the crash protection 
equipment installed in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 571.208 
of this part (Standard No. 208), adjusted in accordance with the 
manufacturer's instructions.

Sec. 571.102  Standard No. 102; Transmission shift lever sequence, starter interlock, and transmission braking effect.

    S1. Purpose and scope. This standard specifies the requirements for 
the transmission shift lever sequence, a starter interlock, and for a 
braking effect of automatic transmissions, to reduce the likelihood of 
shifting errors, starter engagement with vehicle in drive position, and 
to provide supplemental braking at speeds below 40 kilometers per hour.
    S2. Application. This standard applies to passenger cars, 
multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, and buses.
    S3. Requirements.
    S3.1  Automatic transmissions.
    S3.1.1  Location of transmission shift lever positions on passenger 
cars. A neutral position shall be located between forward drive and 
reverse drive positions. If a steering-column-mounted transmission shift 
lever is used, movement from neutral position to forward drive position 
shall be clockwise. If the transmission shift lever sequence includes a 
park position, it shall be located at the end, adjacent to the reverse 
drive position.
    S3.1.2  Transmission braking effect. In vehicles having more than 
one forward transmission gear ratio, one forward drive position shall 
provide a greater degree of engine braking than the highest speed 
transmission ratio at vehicle speeds below 40 kilometers per hour.
    S3.1.3  Starter interlock. The engine starter shall be inoperative 
when the transmission shift lever is in a forward or reverse drive 
position.
    S3.1.4  Identification of shift lever positions.
    S3.1.4.1  Except as specified in S3.1.4.3, if the transmission shift 
lever sequence includes a park position, identification of shift lever 
positions, including the positions in relation to each other and the 
position selected, shall be displayed in view of the driver whenever any 
of the following conditions exist:
    (a) The ignition is in a position where the transmission can be 
shifted.
    (b) The transmission is not in park.

    S3.1.4.2  Except as specified in S3.1.4.3, if the transmission shift 
lever sequence does not include a park position, identification of shift 
lever positions, including the positions in relation to each other and 
the position selected, shall be displayed in view of the driver whenever 
the ignition is in a position in which the engine is capable of 
operation.
    S3.1.4.3  Such information need not be displayed when the ignition 
is in a position that is used only to start the vehicle.
    S3.1.4.4  Effective September 23, 1991, all of the information 
required to be displayed by S3.1.4.1 or S3.1.4.2 shall be displayed in 
view of the driver in a single location. At the option of the 
manufacturer, redundant displays providing some or all of the 
information may be provided.
    S3.2  Manual transmissions. Identification of the shift lever 
pattern of manual transmissions, except three forward speed manual 
transmissions having the standard ``H'' pattern, shall be displayed in 
view of the driver at all times when a driver is present in the driver's 
seating position.

when the ignition (start) switch is turned to the ``on'' (run) position 
when the engine is not running, or when the ignition (start) switch is 
in a position between ``on'' (run) and ``start'' that is designated by 
the manufacturer as a check position.
    (b) The indicator lamps need not be activated when a starter 
interlock is in operation.
    S5.3.3  Each indicator lamp activated due to a condition specified 
in S5.3.1 shall remain activated as long as the condition exists, 
whenever the ignition (start) switch is in the ``on'' (run) position, 
whether or not the engine is running.
    S5.3.4  When an indicator lamp is activated it may be steady burning 
or flashing.
    S5.3.5 (a) Each indicator lamp shall display word, words or 
abbreviation, in accordance with the requirements of Standard No. 101 
(49 CFR 571.101) and/or this section, which shall have letters not less 
than \1/8\-inch high and be legible to the driver in daylight when 
lighted. Words in addition to those required by Standard No. 101 and/or 
this section and symbols may be provided for purposes of clarity.
    (b) If a single common indicator is used, the lamp shall display the 
word ``Brake''. The letters and background of a single common indicator 
shall be of contrasting colors, one of which is red.
    (c)(1) If separate indicators are used for one or more of the 
conditions described in S5.3.1(a) through S5.3.1(g) of this standard, 
the indicator display shall include the word ``Brake'' and appropriate 
additional labeling, except as provided in (c)(1) (A) through (D) of 
this paragraph.
    (A) If a separate indicator lamp is provided for gross loss of 
pressure, the words ``Brake Pressure'' shall be used for S5.3.1(a).
    (B) If a separate indicator lamp is provided for low brake fluid, 
the words ``Brake Fluid'' shall be used for S5.3.1(b), except for 
vehicles using hydraulic system mineral oil.
    (C) If a separate indicator lamp is provided for an anti-lock 
system, the single word ``Antilock'' or ``Anti-lock'', or the 
abbreviation ``ABS'', may be used for S5.3.1(c).
    (D) If a separate indicator lamp is provided for application of the 
parking brake, the single word ``Park'' may be used for S5.3.1(d).
    (2) Except for a separate indicator lamp for an anti-lock system, 
the letters and background of each separate indicator lamp shall be of 
contrasting colors, one of which is red. The letters and background of a 
separate indicator

[[Page 191]]

lamp for an anti-lock system shall be of contrasting colors, one of 
which is yellow.
    S5.4  Reservoirs.
    S5.4.1  Master cylinder reservoirs. A master cylinder shall have a 
reservoir compartment for each service brake subsystem serviced by the 
master cylinder. Loss of fluid from one compartment shall not result in 
a complete loss of brake fluid from another compartment.
    S5.4.2  Reservoir capacity. Reservoirs, whether for master cylinders 
or other type systems, shall have a total minimum capacity equivalent to 
the fluid displacement resulting when all the wheel cylinders or caliper 
pistons serviced by the reservoirs move from a new lining, fully 
retracted position (as adjusted initially to the manufacturer's 
recommended setting) to a fully worn, fully applied position, as 
determined in accordance with S7.18(c) of this standard. Reservoirs 
shall have completely separate compartments for each subsystem except 
that in reservoir systems utilizing a portion of the reservoir for a 
common supply to two or more subsystems, individual partial compartments 
shall each have a minimum volume of fluid equal to at least the volume 
displaced by the master cylinder piston servicing the subsystem, during 
a full stroke of the piston. Each brake power unit reservoir servicing 
only the brake system shall have a minimum capacity equivalent to the 
fluid displacement required to charge the system piston(s) or 
accumulator(s) to normal operating pressure plus the displacement 
resulting when all the wheel cylinders or caliper pistons serviced by 
the reservoir or accumulator(s) move from a new lining fully retracted 
position (as adjusted initially to the manufacturer's recommended 
setting) to a fully worn, fully applied position.
    S5.4.3 Reservoir labeling--Each vehicle equipped with hydraulic 
brakes shall have a brake fluid warning statement that reads as follows, 
in letters at least one-eighth of an inch high: ``WARNING, Clean filler 
cap before removing. Use only ______ fluid from a sealed container.'' 
(Inserting the recommended type of brake fluid as specified in 49 CFR 
571.116, e.g., ``DOT 3''). The lettering shall be--
    (a) Permanently affixed, engraved, or embossed;
    (b) Located so as to be visible by direct view, either on or within 
4 inches of the brake fluid reservoir filler plug or cap; and
    (c) Of a color that contrasts with its background, if it is not 
engraved or embossed.
    S5.5 Antilock and variable proportioning brake systems.
    S5.5.1 On and after March 1, 1999, each vehicle with a GVWR greater 
than 10,000 pounds, except for any vehicle that has a speed attainable 
in 2 miles of not more than 33 mph, shall be equipped with an antilock 
brake system that directly controls the wheels of at least one front 
axle and the wheels of at least one rear axle of the vehicle. On and 
after March 1, 1999, on each vehicle with a GVWR greater than 10,000 
pounds but not greater than 12,000 pounds, the antilock brake system may 
also directly control the wheels of the drive axle by means of a single 
sensor in the drive line. Wheels on other axles of the vehicle may be 
indirectly controlled by the antilock brake system.
    S5.5.2 In the event of any failure (structural or functional) in an 
antilock or variable proportioning brake system, the vehicle shall be 
capable of meeting the stopping distance requirements specified in 
S5.1.2 for service brake system partial failure. For an EV that is 
equipped with both ABS and RBS that is part of the service brake system, 
the ABS must control the RBS.
    S5.6  Brake system integrity. Each vehicle shall be capable of 
completing all performance requirements of S5 without--
    (a) Detachment or fracture of any component of the braking system, 
such as brake springs and brake shoe or disc pad facing, other than 
minor cracks that do not impair attachment of the friction facing. All 
mechanical components of the braking system shall be intact and 
functional. Friction facing tearout (complete detachment of lining) 
shall not exceed 10 percent of the lining on any single frictional 
element.

[[Page 192]]

    (b) Any visible brake fluid or lubricant on the friction surface of 
the brake, or leakage at the master cylinder or brake power unit 
reservoir cover, seal and filler openings.
    S6. Test conditions. The performance requirements of S5 shall be met 
under the following conditions. Where a range of conditions is 
specified, the vehicle shall be capable of meeting the requirements at 
all points within the range.
    S6.1  Vehicle weight.
    S6.1.1  Other than tests specified at lightly loaded vehicle weight 
in S7.7, S7.8, and S7.9, the vehicle is loaded to its GVWR such that the 
weight on each axle as measured at the tire-ground interface is in 
proportion to its GAWR, except that each fuel tank is filled to any 
level from 100 percent of capacity (corresponding to full GVWR) to 75 
percent. However, if the weight on any axle of a vehicle at lightly 
loaded vehicle weight exceeds the axle's proportional share of the gross 
vehicle weight rating, the load required to reach GVWR is placed so that 
the weight on that axle remains the same as a lightly loaded vehicle 
weight.
    S6.1.2  For the applicable tests specified in S7.7, S7.8, and S7.9, 
vehicle weight is lightly loaded vehicle weight, with the added weight 
distributed in the front passenger seat area in passenger cars, 
multipurpose passenger vehicles, and trucks, and in the area adjacent to 
the driver's seat in buses.
    S6.2 Electric vehicles and electric brakes.
    S6.2.1 The state of charge of the propulsion batteries is determined 
in accordance with SAE Recommended Practice J227a, Electric Vehicle Test 
Procedure, February 1976. The applicable sections of J227a are 3.2.1 
through 3.2.4, 3.3.1 through 3.3.2.2, 3.4.1 and 3.4.2, 4.2.1, 5.2, 
5.2.1, and 5.3.
    S6.2.2 At the beginning of the first effectiveness test specified in 
S7.3, and at the beginning of each burnishing procedure, each EV's 
propulsion battery is at the maximum state of charge recommended by the 
manufacturer, as stated in the vehicle operator's manual or on a label 
that is permanently attached to the vehicle, or, if the manufacturer has 
made no recommendation, at a state of charge of not less than 95 
percent. If a battery is replaced rather than recharged, the replacement 
battery is to be charged and measured for state of charge in accordance 
with these procedures. During each burnish procedure, each propulsion 
battery is restored to the recommended state of charge or a state of 
charge of not less than 95 percent after each increment of 40 burnish 
stops until each burnish procedure is complete. The batteries may be 
charged at a more frequent interval if, during a particular 40-stop 
increment, the EV is incapable of achieving the initial burnish test 
speed. During each burnish procedure, the propulsion batteries may be 
charged by an external means or replaced by batteries that are charged 
to the state of charge recommended by the manufacturer or a state of 
charge of not less than 95 percent. For EVs having a manual control for 
setting the level of regenerative braking, the manual control, at the 
beginning of each burnish procedure, is set to provide maximum 
regenerative braking throughout the burnish.
    S6.2.3 At the beginning of each performance test in the test 
sequence (S7,3, S7.5, S7.7 through S7.11, and S7.13 through S7.19 of 
this standard), unless otherwise specified, each propulsion battery of 
an EV is at the maximum state of charge recommended by the manufacturer, 
as stated in the vehicle operator's manual or on a label that is 
permanently attached to the vehicle, or, if the manufacturer has made no 
recommendation, at a state of charge of not less than 95 percent. If 
batteries are replaced rather than recharged, each replacement battery 
shall be charged and measured for state of charge in accordance with 
these procedures. No further charging of any propulsion battery occurs 
during any of the performance tests in the test sequence of this 
standard. If the propulsion batteries are depleted during a test 
sequence such that the vehicle reaches automatic shut-down, will not 
accelerate, or the low state of charge warning lamp is illuminated, the 
vehicle is to be accelerated to brake test speed by auxiliary means.
    S6.2.4 (a) For an EV equipped with RBS, the RBS is considered to be 
part of the service brake system if it is

[[Page 193]]

automatically controlled by an application of the service brake control, 
if there is no means provided for the driver to disconnect or otherwise 
deactivate it, and if it is activated in all transmission positions, 
including neutral. The RBS is operational during all burnishes and all 
tests, except for the test of a failed RBS.
    (b) For an EV equipped with an RBS that is not part of the service 
brake system, the RBS is operational and set to produce the maximum 
regenerative braking effect during the burnishes, and is disabled during 
the test procedures. If the vehicle is equipped with a neutral gear that 
automatically disables the RBS, the test procedures which are designated 
to be conducted in gear may be conducted in neutral.
    S6.2.5  For tests conducted ``in neutral,'' the operator of an EV 
with no ``neutral'' position (or other means such as a clutch for 
disconnecting the drive train from the propulsion motor(s)) does not 
apply any electromotive force to the propulsion motor(s). Any 
electromotive force that is applied to the propulsion motor(s) 
automatically remains in effect unless otherwise specified by the test 
procedure.
    S6.2.6  A vehicle equipped with electrically-actuated service brakes 
also performs the following test series. Conduct 10 stopping tests from 
a speed of 100 kph or the maximum vehicle speed, whichever is less. At 
least two of the 10 stopping distances must be less than or equal to 70 
meters. The vehicle is loaded to GVWR for these tests and the 
transmission is in the neutral position when the service brake control 
is actuated and throughout the remainder of the test. The battery or 
batteries providing power to those electrically-actuated brakes, at the 
beginning of each test, shall be in a depleted state of charge for 
conditions (a), (b), or (c) of this paragraph as appropriate. An 
auxiliary means may be used to accelerate an EV to test speed.
    (a) For an EV equipped with electrically-actuated service brakes 
deriving power from the propulsion batteries, and with automatic shut-
down capability of the propulsion motor(s), the propulsion batteries are 
at not more than five percent above the EV actual automatic shut-down 
critical value. The critical value is determined by measuring the state-
of-charge of each propulsion battery at the instant that automatic shut-
down occurs and averaging the states-of-charge recorded.
    (b) For an EV equipped with electrically-actuated service brakes 
deriving power from the propulsion batteries, and with no automatic 
shut-down capability of the propulsion motor(s), the propulsion 
batteries are at an average of not more than five percent above the 
actual state of charge at which the brake failure warning signal, 
required by S5.3.1(e) of this standard, is illuminated.
    (c) For a vehicle which has an auxiliary battery (or batteries) that 
provides electrical energy to operate the electrically-actuated service 
brakes, the auxiliary battery(batteries) is (are) at (at an average of) 
not more than five percent above the actual state of charge at which the 
brake failure warning signal, required by S5.3.1(e) of this standard, is 
illuminated.
    S6.3  Tire inflation pressure. Tire inflation pressure is the 
pressure recommended by the vehicle manufacturer for the GVWR of the 
vehicle.
    S6.4  Transmission selector control. For S7.3, S7.5, S7.8, S7.15, 
S7.17, S7.11.1.2, S7.11.2.2, S7.11.3.2, and as required for S7.13, the 
transmission selector control is in neutral for all decelerations. For 
all other tests during all decelerations, the transmission selector is 
in the control position, other than overdrive, recommended by the 
manufacturer for driving on a level surface at the applicable test 
speed. To avoid engine stall during tests required to be run in gear a 
manual transmission may be shifted to neutral (or the clutch disengaged) 
when the vehicle speed decreases to 20 mph.
    S6.5  Engine. Engine idle speed and ignition timing settings are 
according to the manufacturer's recommendations. If the vehicle is 
equipped with an adjustable engine speed governor, it is adjusted 
according to the manufacturer's recommendation.
    S6.6  Vehicle openings. All vehicle openings (doors, windows, hood, 
trunk, convertible top, cargo doors, etc.) are

[[Page 194]]

closed except as required for instrumentation purposes.
    S6.7  Ambient temperature. The ambient temperature is any 
temperature between 32 deg. F. and 100 deg. F.
    S6.8  Wind velocity. The wind velocity is zero.
    S6.9  Road surface. Road tests are conducted on a 12-foot-wide, 
level roadway having a skid number of 81. Burnish stops are conducted on 
any surface. The parking brake test surface is clean, dry, smooth 
Portland cement concrete.
    S6.10  Vehicle position. The vehicle is aligned in the center of the 
roadway at the start of each brake application. Stops, other than spike 
stops, are made without any part of the vehicle leaving the roadway. 
Except as noted below, stops are made without lockup of any wheel at 
speeds greater than 10 mph. There may be controlled lockup on an 
antilock-equipped axle, and lockup of not more than one wheel per 
vehicle, uncontrolled by an antilock system. (Dual wheels on one side of 
an axle are considered a single wheel.) Locked wheels at speeds greater 
than 10 mph are allowed during spike stops (but not spike check stops), 
partial failure stops and inoperative brake power or power assist unit 
stops.
    S6.11  Thermocouples. The brake temperature is measured by plug-type 
thermocouples installed in the approximate center of the facing length 
and width of the most heavily loaded shoe or disc pad, one per brake, as 
shown in figure 1. A second thermocouple may be installed at the 
beginning of the test sequence if the lining wear is expected to reach a 
point causing the first thermocouple to contact the metal rubbing 
surface of a drum or rotor. For centergrooved shoes or pads, 
thermocouples are installed within one-eighth of an inch to one-quarter 
inch of the groove and as close to the center as possible.
    S6.12  Initial brake temperature. Unless otherwise specified the 
brake temperature is 150 deg. F. to 200 deg. F.
    S6.13  Control forces. Unless otherwise specified, the force applied 
to a brake control is not less than 15 lb and not more than 150 lb.
    S7. Test procedures and sequence. Each vehicle shall be capable of 
meeting all the applicable requirements of S5. when tested according to 
the procedures and in the sequence set forth below, without replacing 
any brake system part or making any adjustments to the brake system 
other than as permitted in burnish and reburnish procedures and in S7.9 
and S7.10. (For vehicles only having to meet the requirements of S5.1.2 
and S5.1.3 in section S5.1, the applicable test procedures and sequence 
are S7.1, S7.2, S7.4, S7.9, S7.10 and S7.18. However, at the option of 
the manufacturer, the following test procedures and sequence may be 
conducted: S7.1, S7.2, S7.3, S7.4, S7.5, S7.6, S7.7, S7.8, S7.9, S7.10 
and S7.18. The choice of this option shall not be construed as adding to 
the requirements specified in S5.1.2 and S5.1.3.) For vehicles 
manufactured before September 1, 1991, automatic adjusters may be locked 
out, at the option of the manufacturer, when the vehicle is prepared for 
testing. If this option is selected, adjusters must remain locked out 
for the entire sequence of tests. For vehicles manufactured on or after 
September 1, 1991, automatic adjusters must remain activated at all 
times. A vehicle shall be deemed to comply with the stopping distance 
requirements of S5.1 if at least one of the stops at each speed and load 
specified in each of S7.3, S7.5, S7.8, S7.9, S7.10, S7.15, or S7.17 
(check stops) is made within a stopping distance that does not exceed 
the corresponding distance specified in Table II. When the transmission 
selector control is required to be in neutral for a deceleration, a stop 
or snub shall be obtained by the following procedures: (1) Exceed the 
test speed by 4 to 8 mph; (2) close the throttle and coast in gear to 
approximately 2 mph above the test speed; (3) shift to neutral; and (4) 
when the test speed is reached, apply the service brakes.
    S7.1 Brake warming. If the initial brake temperature for the first 
stop in a test procedure (other than S7.7 and S7.16) has not been 
reached, heat the brakes to the initial brake temperature by making not 
more than 10 snubs from not more than 40 to 10 mph, at a deceleration 
not greater than 10 fpsps.
    S7.2  Pretest instrumentation check. Conduct a general check of 
instrumentation by making not more than 10

[[Page 195]]

stops from a speed of not more than 30 mph, or 10 snubs from a speed of 
not more than 40 to 10 mph, at a deceleration of not more than 10 fpsps. 
If instrument repair, replacement, or adjustment is necessary, make not 
more than 10 additional stops or snubs after such repair, replacement, 
or adjustment.
    S7.3  Service brake system--first (preburnish) effectiveness test. 
Make six stops from 30 mph. Then make six stops from 60 mph.
    S7.4  Service brake system--burnish procedure.
    S7.4.1  Vehicles with GVWR of 10,000 lb or less.
    S7.4.1.1  Burnish. Burnish the brakes by making 200 stops from 40 
mph at 12 fpsps (the 150 lb control force limit does not apply here). 
The interval from the start of one service brake application to the 
start of the next shall be either the time necessary to reduce the 
initial brake temperature to between 230 deg. F. and 270 deg. F., or the 
distance of 1 mile, whichever occurs first. Accelerate to 40 mph after 
each stop and maintain that speed until making the next stop.
    S7.4.1.2  Brake adjustment--post burnish. After burnishing, adjust 
the brakes in accordance with the manufacturer's published 
recommendations.
    S7.4.2 Vehicles with GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds.
    S7.4.2.1  Burnish. Vehicles are burnished according to the following 
procedures. Make 500 snubs between 40 mph and 20 mph at a deceleration 
rate of 10 f.p.s.p.s. Except where an adjustment is specified, after 
each brake application accelerate to 40 mph and maintain that speed 
until making the next brake application at a point 1 mile from the 
initial point of the previous brake application. If the vehicle cannot 
attain a speed of 40 mph in 1 mph, continue to accelerate until the 
vehicle reaches 40 mph or until the vehicle has traveled 1.5 miles from 
the initial point of the previous brake application, whichever occurs 
first. The brakes shall be adjusted three times during the burnish 
procedure, in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, after 
125, 250, and 375 snubs.
    S7.4.2.2  Brake adjustment--post burnish. After burnishing, adjust 
the brakes in accordance with the manufacturer's published 
recommendations.
    S7.5  Service brake system--second effectiveness test. Repeat S7.3. 
Then (for passenger cars and other vehicles with a GVWR of 10,000 lbs. 
or less) make four stops from 80 mph if the speed attainable in 2 miles 
is not less than 84 mph.
    S7.6  First reburnish. Repeat S7.4, except make 35 burnish stops or 
snubs. In the case of vehicles burnished in accordance with S7.4.2.1(a) 
of this section, reburnish the vehicle by making 35 snubs from 60 to 20 
mph, but if the hottest brake temperature reaches 500  deg. F 
<plus-minus> 50  deg. F, make the remainder of the brake applications 
from the highest snub condition listed in Table IV that will maintain 
the hottest brake temperature at 500  deg. F <plus-minus> 50  deg. F. If 
at a snub condition of 40 to 20 mph, the temperature of the hottest 
brake exceeds 550  deg. F, make the remainder of the 35 brake 
applications from the snub condition without regard to brake 
temperature.
    S7.7  Parking brake test. The parking brake tests for any vehicle on 
different grades, in different directions, and for different loads may 
be conducted in any order. The force required for actuation of a hand-
operated brake system shall be measured at the center of the hand grip 
area or at a distance of 1\1/2\ inches from the end of the actuation 
lever, as illustrated in Figure II.
    S7.7.1  Test procedure for requirements of S5.2.1.
    S7.7.1.1  Condition the parking brake friction elements so that the 
temperature at the beginning of the test is at any level not more than 
150 deg. F. (when the temperature of components on both ends of an axle 
are averaged).
    S7.7.1.2  Drive the vehicle, loaded to GVWR, onto the specified 
grade with the longitudinal axis of the vehicle in the direction of the 
slope of the grade, stop the vehicle and hold it stationary by 
application of the service brake control, and place the transmission in 
neutral.
    S7.7.1.3  With the vehicle held stationary by means of the service 
brake control, apply the parking brake by a single application of the 
force specified

[[Page 196]]

in (a), (b), or (c) of this paragraph, except that a series of 
applications to achieve the specified force may be made in the case of a 
parking brake system design that does not allow the application of the 
specified force in a single application:
    (a) In the case of a passenger car or other vehicle with a GVWR of 
10,000 lbs. or less, not more than 125 pounds for a foot-operated 
system, and not more than 90 pounds for a hand-operated system; and
    (b) In the case of a school bus with a GVWR greater than 10,000 lbs. 
not more than 150 pounds for a foot-operated system, and not more than 
125 pounds for a hand-operated system.
    (c) For a vehicle using an electrically-activated parking brake, 
apply the parking brake by activating the parking brake control.
    S7.7.1.4  Following the application of the parking brake in 
accordance with S7.7.1.3, release all force on the service brake control 
and commence the measurement of time if the vehicle remains stationary. 
If the vehicle does not remain stationary, reapplication of the service 
brake to hold the vehicle stationary, with reapplication of a force to 
the parking brake control at the level specified in S7.7.1.3 (a) or (b) 
as appropriate for the vehicle being tested (without release of the 
ratcheting or other holding mechanism of the parking brake) may be used 
twice to attain a stationary position.
    S7.7.1.5  Following observation of the vehicle in a stationary 
condition for the specified time in one direction, repeat the same test 
procedure with the vehicle orientation in the opposite direction on the 
specified grade.
    S7.7.1.6  Check the operation of the parking brake application 
indicator required by S5.3.1(d).
    S7.7.2  Test procedure for requirements of S5.2.2 (a) Check that 
transmission must be placed in park position to release key;
    (b) Test as in S7.7.1, except in addition place the transmission 
control to engage the parking mechanism; and
    (c) Test as in S7.7.1 except on a 20 percent grade, with the parking 
mechanism not engaged.
    S7.7.3  Lightly loaded vehicle. Repeat S7.7.1 or S7.7.2 as 
applicable except with the vehicle at lightly loaded vehicle weight.
    S7.7.4  Non-service brake type parking brake systems. For vehicles 
with parking brake systems not utilizing the service brake friction 
elements, burnish the friction elements of such systems prior to parking 
brake tests according to the manufacturer's published recommendations as 
furnished to the purchaser. If no recommendations are furnished, run the 
vehicle in an unburnished condition.
    S7.8  Service brake system--lightly loaded vehicle (third 
effectiveness) test. Make six stops from 60 mph with vehicle at lightly 
loaded vehicle weight. (This test is not applicable to a vehicle which 
both has a GVWR of not less than 8,000 pounds and not greater than 
10,000 pounds and is not a school bus.)
    S7.9  Service brake system test--partial failure.
    S7.9.1  With the vehicle at lightly loaded vehicle weight, alter the 
service brake system to produce any one rupture or leakage type of 
failure, other than a structural failure of a housing that is common to 
two or more subsystems. Determine the control force, pressure level, or 
fluid level (as appropriate for the indicator being tested) necessary to 
activate the brake system indicator lamp. Make four stops if the vehicle 
is equipped with a split service brake system, or 10 stops if the 
vehicle is not so equipped, each from 60 mph, by a continuous 
application of the service brake control. Restore the service brake 
system to normal at completion of this test.
    S7.9.2  Repeat S7.9.1 for each of the other subsystems.
    S7.9.3  Repeat S7.9.1 and S7.9.2 with vehicle at GVWR. Restore the 
service brake system to normal at completion of this test.
    S7.9.4  (For vehicles with antilock and/or variable proportioning 
brake systems.) With vehicle at GVWR, disconnect functional power 
source, or otherwise render antilock system inoperative. Disconnect 
variable proportioning brake system. Make four stops, each from 60 mph. 
If more than one antilock or variable proportioning

[[Page 197]]

brake subsystem is provided, disconnect or render one subsystem 
inoperative and run as above. Restore system to normal at completion of 
this test. Repeat for each subsystem provided.
    Determine whether the brake system indicator lamp is activated when 
the electrical power source to the antilock or variable proportioning 
unit is disconnected.
    S7.9.5  For a vehicle in which the brake signal is transmitted 
electrically between the brake pedal and some or all of the foundation 
brakes, regardless of the means of actuation of the foundation brakes, 
the tests in S7.9.1 through S7.9.3 of this standard are conducted by 
inducing any single failure in any circuit that electrically transmits 
the brake signal, and all other systems intact. Determine whether the 
brake system indicator lamp is activated when the failure is induced.
    S7.9.6  For an EV with RBS that is part of the service brake system, 
the tests specified in S7.9.1 through S7.9.3 are conducted with the RBS 
disconnected and all other systems intact. Determine whether the brake 
system indicator lamp is activated when the RBS is disconnected.
    S7.10  Service brake system--inoperative brake power unit or brake 
power assist unit test. (For vehicles equipped with brake power unit or 
brake power assist unit.)
    S7.10.1  Regular procedure. (This test need not be run if the option 
in S7.10.2 is selected.) On vehicles with brake power assist units, 
render the brake power assist unit inoperative, or one of the brake 
power assist unit subsystems if two or more subsystems are provided, by 
disconnecting the relevant power supply. Exhaust any residual brake 
power reserve capability of the disconnected system. On vehicles with 
brake power units, disconnect the primary source of power. Make four 
stops, each from 60 mph by a continuous application of the service brake 
control. Restore the system to normal at completion of this test. For 
vehicles equipped with more than one brake power unit or brake power 
assist unit, conduct tests of each in turn.
    S7.10.2  Optional Procedures. On vehicles with brake power assist 
units, the unit is charged to maximum prior to start of test. (Engine 
may be run up in speed, then throttle closed quickly to attain maximum 
charge on vacuum assist units.) Brake power units shall also be charged 
to maximum accumulator pressure prior to start of test. No recharging is 
allowed after start of test.
    (a) (For vehicles with brake power assist units.) Disconnect the 
primary source of power. Make six stops each from 60 mph, to achieve the 
average deceleration for each stop as specified in table III. Apply the 
brake control as quickly as possible. Maintain control force until 
vehicle has stopped.

At the completion of the stops specified above, deplete the system of 
any residual brake power reserve capability. Make one stop from 60 mph 
at an average deceleration of not lower than 7 fpsps for passenger cars 
(equivalent stopping distance 554 feet), or 6 fpsps for vehicles other 
than passenger cars (equivalent stopping distance 646 feet) and 
determine whether the control force exceeds 150 pounds.
    (b) (For vehicles with brake power units with accumulator type 
systems.) Test as in S7.10.2(a), except make 10 stops instead of 6 and, 
at the completion of the 10 stops, deplete the failed element of the 
brake power unit of any residual brake power reserve capability before 
making the final stop.
    (c) (For vehicles with brake power assist or brake power units with 
backup systems.) If the brake power or brake power assist unit operates 
in conjunction with a backup system and the backup system is activated 
automatically in the event of a primary power failure, the backup system 
is operative during this test. Disconnect the primary source of power of 
one subsystem. Make 15 stops, each from 60 mph, with the backup system 
activated for the failed subsystem, to achieve an average deceleration 
of 12 fpsps for each stop.
    (d) Restore systems to normal at completion of these tests. For 
vehicles equipped with more than one brakepower assist or brakepower 
unit, conduct tests of each in turn.
    S7.10.3 Electric brakes.
    (a) For vehicles with electrically-actuated service brakes, the 
tests in

[[Page 198]]

S7.10.1 or S7.10.2 are conducted with any single electrical failure in 
the electric brake system instead of the brake power or brake power 
assist systems, and all other systems intact.
    (b) For EVs with RBS that is part of the service brake system, the 
tests in S7.10.1 or S7.10.2 are conducted with the RBS discontinued and 
all other systems intact.
    S7.11  Service brake system--first fade and recovery test.
    S7.11.1  Baseline check stops or snubs.
    S7.11.1.1  Vehicles with GVWR of 10,000 lb or less. Make three stops 
from 30 mph at 10 fpsps for each stop. Control force readings may be 
terminated when vehicle speed falls to 5 mph. Average the maximum brake 
control force required for the three stops.
    S7.11.1.2  Vehicles with GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds. With 
transmission in neutral (or declutched), make three snubs from 40 to 20 
mph at 10 fpsps for each snub. Average the maximum brake control force 
required for the three snubs.
    S7.11.2  Fade stops or snubs.
    S7.11.2.1  Vehicles with GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less. Make 5 stops 
from 60 mph at 15 fpsps followed by 5 stops at the maximum attainable 
deceleration between 5 and 15 fpsps for each stop. Establish an initial 
brake temperature before the first brake application of 130 deg. to 
150 deg.F. Initial brake temperatures before brake applications for 
subsequent stops are those occurring at the distance intervals. Attain 
the required deceleration within 1 second and, as a minimum, maintain it 
for the remainder of the stopping time. Control force readings may be 
terminated when vehicle speed falls to 5 mph. Leave an interval of 0.4 
mi between the start of brake applications. Accelerate immediately to 
the initial test speed after each stop. Drive 1 mi at 30 mph after the 
last fade stop, and immediately follow the recovery procedure specified 
in S7.11.3.1.
    S7.11.2.2  Vehicles with GVWR greater than 10,000 lb. With 
transmission in neutral (or declutched) make 10 snubs from 40 to 20 mph 
at 10 fpsps for each snub. Establish an initial brake temperature before 
the first brake application of 130 deg.F. to 150 deg.F. Initial brake 
temperatures before brake application for subsequent snubs are those 
occurring in the time intervals specified below. Attain the required 
deceleration within 1 s and maintain it for the remainder of the 
snubbing time. Leave an interval of 30 s between snubs (start of brake 
application to start of brake application). Accelerate immediately to 
the initial test speed after each snub. Drive for 1.5 mi at 40 mph after 
the last snub and immediately follow the recovery procedure specified in 
S7.11.3.2.
    S7.11.3  Recovery stops or snubs.
    S7.11.3.1  Vehicles with GVWR of 10,000 lb or less. Make five stops 
from 30 mph at 10 fpsps for each stop. Control force readings may be 
terminated when vehicle speed falls to 5 mph. Allow a braking distance 
interval of 1 mi. Immediately after each stop accelerate at maximum rate 
to 30 mph and maintain that speed until making the next stop. Record the 
maximum control force for each stop.
    S7.11.3.2  Vehicles with GVWR greater than 10,000 lb. With 
transmission in neutral (or declutched) make five snubs from 40 to 20 
mph at 10 fpsps for each snub. After each snub, accelerate at maximum 
rate to 40 mph and maintain that speed until making the next brake 
application at a point 1.5 mi from the point of the previous brake 
application. Record the maximum control force for each snub.
    S7.12  Service brake system--second reburnish. Repeat S7.6.
    S7.13  Service brake system--second fade and recovery test. Repeat 
S7.11 except in S7.11.2 run 15 fade stops or 20 snubs instead of 10.
    S7.14  Third reburnish. Repeat S7.6.
    S7.15  Service brake system--fourth effectiveness test. Repeat S7.5. 
Then (for passenger cars) make four stops from either 95 mph if the 
speed attainable in 2 mi is 99 to (but not including) 104 mph, or 100 
mph if the speed attainable in 2 mi is 104 mph or greater.
    S7.16  Service brake system--water recovery test.
    S7.16.1  Baseline check stop. Make three stops from 30 mph at 10 
fpsps for each stop. Control force readings may be terminated when 
vehicle speed falls to 5 mph. Average the maximum brake control force 
required for the three stops.

[[Page 199]]

    S7.16.2  Wet brake recovery stops. With the brakes fully released at 
all times, drive the vehicle for 2 min at a speed of 5 mph in any 
combination of forward and reverse directions, through a trough having a 
water depth of 6 in. After leaving the trough, immediately accelerate at 
a maximum rate to 30 mph without a brake application. Immediately upon 
reaching that speed make five stops, each from 30 mph at 10 fpsps for 
each stop. After each stop (except the last), accelerate the vehicle 
immediately at a maximum rate to a speed of 30 mph and begin the next 
stop.
    S7.17  Spike stops. Make 10 successive spike stops from 30 mph with 
the transmission in neutral, with no reverse stops. Make spike stops by 
applying a control force of 200 lb while recording control force versus 
time. Maintain control force until vehicle has stopped. At completion of 
10 spike stops, make six effectiveness stops from 60 mph.
    S7.18  Final inspection. Inspect--
    (a) The service brake system for detachment or fracture of any 
components, such as brake springs and brake shoes or disc pad facing.
    (b) The friction surface of the brake, the master cylinder or brake 
power unit reservoir cover and seal and filler openings, for leakage of 
brake fluid or lubricant.
    (c) The master cylinder or brake power unit reservoir for compliance 
with the volume and labeling requirements of S5.4.2 and S5.4.3. In 
determining the fully applied worn condition assume that the lining is 
worn to: (1) Rivet or bolt heads on riveted or bolted linings, or (2) 
within one thirty-seconds of an inch of shoe or pad mounting surface on 
bonded linings, or (3) the limit recommended by the manufacturer, 
whichever is larger relative to the total possible shoe or pad movement. 
Drums or rotors are assumed to be at nominal design drum diameter or 
rotor thickness. Linings are assumed adjusted for normal operating 
clearance in the released position.
    (d) The brake system indicator light(s), for compliance with 
operation in various key positions, lens color, labeling, and location, 
in accordance with S5.3.
    S7.19  Moving barrier test. (Only for vehicles that have been tested 
according to S7.7.2.) Load the vehicle to GVWR, release parking brake, 
and place the transmission selector control to engage the parking 
mechanism. With a moving barrier as described in paragraph 3.3 of SAE 
recommended practice J972 ``Moving Barrier Collision Tests,'' November 
1966, impact the vehicle from the front at 2\1/2\ mph. Keep the 
longitudinal axis of the barrier parallel with the longitudinal axis of 
the vehicle. Repeat the test, impacting the vehicle from the rear.

    Note: The vehicle used for this test need not be the same vehicle 
that has been used for the braking tests.

    S4 Definitions * * *
    Antilock brake system or ABS means a portion of a service brake 
system that automatically controls the degree of rotational wheel slip 
during braking by:
    (1) Sensing the rate of angular rotation of the wheels;
    (2) Transmitting signals regarding the rate of wheel angular 
rotation to one or more controlling devices which interpret those 
signals and generate responsive controlling output signals; and
    (3) Transmitting those controlling signals to one or more modulators 
which adjust brake actuating forces in response to those signals.

                                * * * * *

    Directly Controlled Wheel means a wheel for which the degree of 
rotational wheel slip is sensed, either at that wheel or on the axle 
shaft for that wheel and corresponding signals are transmitted to one or 
more modulators that adjust the brake actuating forces at that wheel. 
Each modulator may also adjust the brake actuating forces at other 
wheels that are on the same axle or in the same axle set in response to 
the same signal or signals.

                                * * * * *

    Indirectly Controlled Wheel means a wheel at which the degree of 
rotational wheel slip is not sensed, but at which the modulator of an 
antilock braking system adjusts its brake

[[Page 203]]

actuating forces in response to signals from one or more sensed wheels.

                                * * * * *

    Peak friction coefficient or PFC means the ratio of the maximum 
value of braking test wheel longitudinal force to the simultaneous 
vertical force occurring prior to wheel lockup, as the braking torque is 
progressively increased.

                                * * * * *

    Wheel lockup means 100 percent wheel slip.

    S5.1  Service brake systems. Each vehicle shall be equipped with a 
service brake system acting on all wheels. Wear of the service brake 
shall be compensated for by means of a system of automatic adjustment. 
Each passenger car and each multipurpose passenger vehicle, truck, and 
bus with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less shall be capable of meeting the 
requirements of S5.1.1 through S5.1.6 under the conditions prescribed in 
S6, when tested according to the procedures and in the sequence set 
forth in S7. Each school bus with a GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds 
shall be capable of meeting the requirements of S5.1.1 through S5.1.5 
under the conditions prescribed in S6, when tested according to the 
procedures and in the sequence set forth in S7. Each multipurpose 
passenger vehicle, truck, and bus (other than a school bus) with a GVWR 
greater than 10,000 pounds shall be capable of meeting the requirements 
of S5.1.1, S5.1.2, and S5.1.3 under the conditions prescribed in S6, 
when tested according to the procedures and in the sequence set forth in

of attaining a speed specified in S5.1.1, S5.1.2, S5.1.3, or S5.1.6, its 
service brakes shall be capable of stopping the vehicle from the 
multiple of 5 mph that is 4 to 8 mph less than the speed attainable in 2 
miles, within distances that do not exceed the corresponding distances 
specified in Table II. If a vehicle is incapable of attaining a speed 
specified in S5.1.4 in the time or distance interval set forth, it shall 
be tested at the highest speed attainable in the time or distance 
interval specified.
    S5.1.1  Stopping distance. (a) The service brakes shall be capable 
of stopping each vehicle with a GVWR of less than 8,000 pounds, and each 
school bus with a GVWR between 8,000 pounds and 10,000 pounds in four 
effectiveness tests within the distances and from the speeds specified 
in S5.1.1.1, S5.1.1.2, S5.1.1.3, and S5.1.1.4.
    (b) The service brakes shall be capable of stopping each vehicle 
with a GVWR of between 8,000 pounds and 10,000 pounds, other than a 
school bus, in three effectiveness tests within the distances and from 
the speeds specified in S5.1.1.1, S5.1.1.2, and S5.1.1.4.
    (c) The service brakes shall be capable of stopping each vehicle 
with a GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds in two effectiveness tests within 
the distances and from the speeds specified in S5.1.1.2 and S5.1.1.3. 
Each school bus with a GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds manufactured 
after January 12, 1996 and before March 1, 1999 and which is equipped 
with an antilock brake system may comply with paragraph S5.1.1.2 and 
S5.5.1 rather than the first effectiveness test, as specified in 
S5.1.1.1. Each school bus with a GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds 
manufactured on or after March 1, 1999 shall be capable of meeting the 
requirements of S5.1.1 through S5.1.5, under the conditions prescribed 
in S6, when tested according to the procedures and in the sequence set 
forth in S7.
    S5.1.1.2  In the second effectiveness test, each vehicle with a GVWR 
of 10,000 pounds or less and each school bus with a GVWR greater than 
10,000 pounds shall be capable of stopping from 30 mph and 60 mph, and 
each vehicle with a GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds (other than a school 
bus) shall be capable of stopping from 60 mph, within the corresponding 
distances specified in Column II of Table II. If the speed attainable in 
2 miles is not less than 84 mph, a passenger car or other vehicle with a 
GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less shall also be capable of stopping from 80 
mph within the corresponding distances specified in Column II of Table

    S5.3  Brake system indicator lamp. Each vehicle shall have a brake 
system indicator lamp or lamps, mounted in front of and in clear view of 
the driver, which meet the requirements of S5.3.1 through S5.3.5. A 
vehicle with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less may have a single common 
indicator lamp. A vehicle with a GVWR of greater than 10,000 pounds may 
have an indicator lamp which is common for gross loss of pressure, drop 
in the level of brake fluid, or application of the parking brake, but 
shall have a separate indicator lamp for antilock brake system 
malfunction. However, the options provided in S5.3.1(a) shall not apply 
to a vehicle manufactured without a split service brake system; such a 
vehicle shall, to meet the requirements of S5.3.1(a), be equipped with a 
malfunction indicator that activates under the conditions specified in 
S5.3.1(a)(4). This warning indicator shall, instead of meeting the 
requirements of S5.3.2 through S5.3.5, activate (while the vehicle 
remains capable of meeting the requirements of S5.1.2.2 and the ignition 
switch is in the ``on'' position) a continuous or intermittent audible 
signal and a flashing warning light, displaying the words ``STOP-BRAKE 
FAILURE'' in block

    S5.3.3 (a) Each indicator lamp activated due to a condition 
specified in S5.3.1 shall remain activated as long as the malfunction 
exists, whenever the ignition (start) switch is in the ``on'' (run) 
position, whether or not the engine is running.
    (b) For vehicles with a GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds, each 
message about the existence of a malfunction, as described in S5.3.1(c), 
shall be stored in the antilock brake system after the ignition switch 
is turned to the ``off'' position and the indicator lamp shall be 
automatically reactivated when the ignition switch is again turned to 
the ``on'' position. The indicator lamp shall also be activated as a 
check of lamp function whenever the ignition is turned to the ``on'' 
(run) position. The indicator lamp shall be deactivated at the end of 
the check of lamp function unless there is a malfunction or a message 
about a malfunction that existed when the key switch was last turned to 
the ``off'' position.

    S5.5  Antilock and variable proportioning brake systems.
    S5.5.1 Each vehicle with a GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds, except 
for any vehicle that has a speed attainable in 2 miles of not more than 
33 mph, shall be equipped with an antilock brake system that directly 
controls the wheels of at least one front axle and the wheels of at 
least one rear axle of the vehicle. On each vehicle with a GVWR greater 
than 10,000 pounds but not greater than 12,000 pounds, the antilock 
brake system may also directly control the wheels of the drive axle by 
means of a single sensor in the drive line. Wheels on other axles of the 
vehicle may be indirectly controlled by the antilock brake system.
    S5.5.2  In the event of any failure (structural or functional) in an 
antilock or variable proportioning brake system, the vehicle shall be 
capable of meeting the stopping distance requirements specified in 
S5.1.2 for service brake system partial failure.

Sec. 571.106  Standard No. 106; Brake hoses.

    S1. Scope. This standard specifies labeling and performance 
requirements for motor vehicle brake hose, brake hose assemblies, and 
brake hose end fittings.
    S2. Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to reduce deaths and 
injuries occurring as a result of brake system failure from pressure or 
vacuum loss due to hose or hose assembly rupture.
    S3. Application. This standard applies to passenger cars, 
multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, buses, trailers, and 
motorcycles, and to hydraulic, air, and vacuum brake hose, brake hose 
assemblies, and brake hose end fittings for use in those vehicles.
    S4. Definitions.
    Armor means protective material installed on a brake hose to 
increase the resistance of the hose or hose assembly to abrasion or 
impact damage.
    Brake hose means a flexible conduit, other than a vacuum tubing 
connector, manufactured for use in a brake system to transmit or contain 
the fluid pressure or vacuum used to apply force to a vehicle's brakes. 
For hose, a dimensional description such as ``\1/4\-inch hose'' refers 
to the nominal inside diameter. For tubing, a dimensional description 
such as ``\1/4\-in tubing'' refers to the nominal outside diameter.
    Brake hose assembly means a brake hose, with or without armor, 
equipped with end fittings for use in a brake system, but does not 
include an air or vacuum assembly prepared by the owner or operator of a 
used vehicle, by his employee, or by a repair facility, for installation 
in that used vehicle.
    Brake hose end fitting means a coupler, other than a clamp, designed 
for attachment to the end of a brake hose.
    Free length means the linear measurement of hose exposed between the 
end fittings of a hose assembly in a straight position.
    Permanently attached end fitting means an end fitting that is 
attached by deformation of the fitting about the hose by crimping or 
swaging, or an end fitting that is attached by use of a sacrificial 
sleeve or ferrule that requires replacement each time a hose assembly is 
rebuilt.
    Rupture means any failure that results in separation of a brake hose 
from its end fitting or in leakage.
    Vacuum tubing connector means a flexible conduit of vacuum that (i) 
connects metal tubing to metal tubing in a brake system, (ii) is 
attached without end fittings, and (iii) when installed, has an 
unsupported length less than the total length of those portions that 
cover the metal tubing.
    S5. Requirements--hydraulic brake hose, brake hose assemblies, and 
brake hose end fittings.
    S5.1 Construction. (a) Each hydraulic brake hose assembly shall have 
permanently attached brake hose end fittings which are attached by 
deformation of the fitting about the hose by crimping or swaging.
    (b) Each hydraulic brake hose assembly that is equipped with a 
permanent supplemental support integrally attached to the assembly and 
is manufactured as a replacement for use on a vehicle not equipped, as 
an integral part of the vehicle's original design, with a means of 
attaching the support to the vehicle shall be equipped with a bracket 
that is integrally attached to the supplemental support and that adapts 
the vehicle to properly accept this type of brake hose assembly.
    S5.2  Labeling.
    S5.2.1 Each hydraulic brake hose, except hose sold as part of a 
motor vehicle, shall have at least two clearly identifiable stripes of 
at least one-sixteenth of an inch in width, placed on opposite sides of 
the brake hose parallel to its longitudinal axis. One stripe may be 
interrupted by the information required by S5.2.2, and the other stripe 
may be interrupted by additional information at the manufacturer's 
option. However, hydraulic brake hose manufactured for use only in an 
assembly whose end fittings prevent its installation in a twisted 
orientation in either side of the vehicle, need not meet the 
requirements of S5.2.1.
    S5.2.2 Each hydraulic brake hose shall be labeled, or cut from bulk 
hose that is labeled, at intervals of not more than 6 inches, measured 
from the end of one legend to the beginning of the next, in block 
capital letters and numerals at least one-eighth of an inch high, with 
the information listed in

[[Page 207]]

paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. The information need not be 
present on hose that is sold as part of a brake hose assembly or a motor 
vehicle. (a) The symbol DOT, constituting a certification by the hose 
manufacturer that the hose conforms to all applicable motor vehicle 
safety standards.
    (b) A designation that identifies the manufacturer of the hose, 
which shall be filed in writing with: Office of Crash Avoidance 
Standards, Vehicle Dynamics Division, National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. The 
marking may consist of a designation other than block capital letters 
required by S5.2.2.
    (c) The month, day, and year, or the month and year, of manufacture, 
expressed in numerals. For example, 10/1/96 means October 1, 1996.
    (d) The nominal inside diameter of the hose expressed in inches or 
fractions of inches, or in millimeters followed by the abbreviation 
``mm.''
    (e) Either ``HR'' to indicate that the hose is regular expansion 
hydraulic hose or ``HL'' to indicate that the hose is low expansion 
hydraulic hose.

used with a supplemental support (a) Each hydraulic brake hose assembly 
that is equipped with a permanent supplemental support integrally 
attached to the assembly and is manufactured as a replacement assembly 
for a vehicle equipped, as an integral part of the vehicle's original 
design, with a means of attaching the support to the vehicle shall be 
sold in a package that is marked or labeled as follows: ``FOR USE ON 
[insert Manufacturer, Model Name] ONLY'';
    (b) Each hydraulic brake hose assembly that is equipped with a

    S6.1.2  Preparation. (a) Measure the free length of the hose 
assembly.
    (b) Mount the hose so that it is in a vertical straight position 
without tension when pressure is applied.
    (c) Fill the hose with test fluid and bleed all gases from the 
system.
    (d) Close the valve to the burette and apply 1,500 psi for 10 
seconds; then release pressure.
    S6.1.3  Calculation of expansion at 1,000 and 1,500 psi. (a) Adjust 
the fluid level in the burette to zero.
    (b) Close the valve to the burette, apply pressure at the rate of 
15,000 psi per minute, and seal 1,000 psi in the hose (1,500 psi in 
second series).
    (c) After 3 seconds open the valve to the burette for 10 seconds and 
allow the fluid in the expanded hose to rise into the burette.
    (d) Repeat the procedure in steps (b) and (c) twice. Measure the 
amount of test fluid which has accumulated in the burette as a result of 
the three applications of pressure.
    (e) Calculate the volumetric expansion per foot by dividing the 
total accumulated test fluid by 3 and further dividing by the free 
length of the hose in feet.
    S6.2  Burst strength test. (a) Connect the brake hose to a pressure 
system and fill it completely with water, allowing all gases to escape.
    (b) Apply water pressure of 4,000 psi at a rate of 15,000 psi per 
minute.
    (c) After 2 minutes at 4,000 psi, increase the pressure at the rate 
of 15,000 psi per minute until the pressure exceeds 5,000 psi.

headlamp system's design, the side chosen for the cutoff shall not be 
changed for any headlamps intended to be used as replacements for those 
system's headlamps.
    (1) Vertical position of cutoff. The headlamp shall be aimed 
vertically so that the cutoff is on the left side, at 0.4 degree down 
from the H-H line, or on the right side, at the H-H line.
    (2) Vertical gradient. The gradient of the cutoff measured at either 
2.5 degrees L or 2.0 degrees R shall be not less than 0.13 based on the 
procedure of S7.8.5.3, paragraph (a)(5).
    (3) Horizontal position of the cutoff. The width shall be not less 
than two degrees, with not less than two degrees of its actual width 
centered at either 2.5 degrees L, or 2.0 degrees R.
    (4) Maximum inclination of cutoff. The vertical location of the 
highest gradient at the ends of the minimum width shall be within +/-0.2 
degree of the vertical location of the maximum gradient measured at the 
appropriate

[[Page 246]]

vertical line (at either 2.5 degrees L for a left side cutoff, or 2.0 
degrees R for a right side cutoff.)
    (5) Measuring the cutoff parameter. (i) The headlamp shall be 
mounted on a fixture which simulates its actual design location on any 
vehicle for which the headlamp is intended. The fixture, with the 
headlamp installed shall be attached to the goniometer table in such a 
way that the fixture alignment axes are coincident with the goniometer 
axes. The headlamp shall be energized at the specified test voltage.
    (ii) The headlamp beam pattern shall be aimed with the cutoff at the 
H-H axis. There shall be no adjustment, shimming, or modification of the 
horizontal axis of the headlamp or test fixture, unless the headlamp is 
equipped with a VHAD. In this case the VHAD shall be adjusted to zero.
    (iii) A vertical scan of the beam pattern shall be conducted for a 
headlamp with a left side gradient by aligning the goniometer on a 
vertical line at 2.5 degrees L and scanning from 1.5 degrees U to 1.5 
degrees D. For a headlamp with a right side gradient, a vertical scan of 
the beam pattern shall be conducted by aligning the goniometer on a 
vertical line at 2.0 degrees R and scanning from 1.5 degrees U to 1.5 
degrees D.
    (iv) Determine the maximum gradient within the range of the scan by 
using the formula: G = log E(a)-log E(a+0.1), where ``G'' is the 
gradient, ``E'' is illumination and ``a'' is vertical angular position. 
The maximum value of the gradient ``G'' determines the vertical angular 
location of the cutoff. Perform vertical scans at 1.0 degree L and R of 
the measurement point of the maximum gradient to determine the 
inclination.
    (b) Horizontal aim, lower beam. There shall be no adjustment of 
horizontal aim unless the headlamp is equipped with a horizontal VHAD. 
If the headlamp has a VHAD, it shall be set to zero.
    (c) Vertical aim, upper beam. (1) If the upper beam is combined in a 
headlamp with a lower beam, the vertical aim of the upper beam shall not 
be changed from the aim set using the procedures of paragraphs 
S7.8.5.3(a) and (b) used for the lower beam.
    (2) If the upper beam is not combined in a headlamp with a lower 
beam, the vertical aim of the upper beam shall be adjusted so that the 
maximum beam intensity is located on the H-H axis.
    (d) Horizontal aim, upper beam. (1) If the upper beam is combined in 
a headlamp with a lower beam, the horizontal aim of the upper beam shall 
not be changed from the aim set using the procedures of paragraphs 
S7.8.5.3 (a) and (b) used for the lower beam.
    (2) If the upper beam is not combined in a headlamp with the lower 
beam and has fixed horizontal aim or has a horizontal VHAD, then the 
headlamp shall be mounted on a fixture which simulates its actual design 
location on any vehicle for which the headlamp is intended. The fixture, 
with the headlamp installed shall be attached to the goniometer table in 
such a way that the fixture alignment axes are coincident with the 
goniometer axes. The headlamp shall be energized at 12.8 <SUP>plus-minus</SUP> 
0.20 mV. There shall be no adjustment, shimming, or modification of the 
horizontal axis of the headlamp or test fixture, unless the headlamp is 
equipped with a VHAD. In this case the VHAD shall be adjusted to zero.
    (3) If the upper beam is not combined in a headlamp with a lower 
beam, and it does not have a VHAD, the horizontal aim of the upper beam 
shall be adjusted so that the maximium beam intensity is located on the 
V-V axis.
    (e) Photometric Requirements and Measurement. (1) Instead of being 
designed to conform to the photometric requirements of Figures 15-1, 17-
1, 27-1 or 28-1, a visually/optically aimable headlamp shall be designed 
to conform to the requirements of Figures 15-2, 17-2, 27-2 or 28-2 when 
tested in accordance with paragraph (2) and SAE J575 DEC88, with the 
distance from the photometer to the headlamp no less than 18.3 m.
    (2) If the lower beam has a left side cutoff, reaim the headlamp 
vertically to place the maximum gradient found in paragraph S7.8.5.3 at 
0.4 degree below the H-H line. For a headlamp with a lower beam right 
side cutoff, place the maximum gradient found in paragraph S7.8.5.3 at 
the H-H line. For

[[Page 247]]

an upper beam, the headlamp would already be aimed at the end of the 
procedure found in paragraph S7.8.5.3. A 0.25 degree reaim is permitted 
in any direction at any test point.
    (f) Marking--(1) Headlamp optical axis mark. There shall be a mark 
or markings identifying the optical axis of the headlamp visible from 
the front of the headlamp when installed on the vehicle, to assure 
proper horizontal and vertical alignment of the aiming screen or optical 
aiming equipment with the headlamp being aimed. The manufacturer is free 
to choose the design of the mark or markings. The mark or markings may 
be on the interior or exterior of the lens or indicated by a mark or 
central structure on the interior or exterior of the headlamp.
    (2) Visual/optical aimability identification marks. (i) The lens of 
a lower beam headlamp shall be marked ``VOL'' if the headlamp is 
intended to be visually/optically aimed using the left side of the lower 
beam pattern.
    (ii) The lens of a lower beam headlamp shall be marked ``VOR'' if 
the headlamp is intended to be visually/optically aimed using the right 
side of the lower beam pattern.
    (iii) The lens of each sealed beam or integral beam headlamp shall 
be marked ``VOR'' if the headlamp is of a type that was manufactured 
before May 1, 1997, and if such headlamp type has been redesigned since 
then to be visually/optically aimable.
    (iv) The lens of a headlamp that is solely an upper beam headlamp 
and intended to be visually/optically aimed using the upper beam shall 
be marked ``VO''.
    (v) Each letter used in marking according to this paragraph shall be 
not less than 3 mm. high.

positions, shall be subjected to a salt spray (fog) test in accordance 
with ASTM B117-73, Method of Salt Spray (Fog) Testing, for 240 hours, 
consisting of ten successive 24-hour periods. During each period, the 
headlamp shall be mounted in the middle of the chamber and exposed for 
23 hours to the salt spray. The spray shall not be activated during the 
24th hour. The bulb shall be removed from the headlamp and from the test 
chamber during the one hour of salt spray deactivation and reinserted 
for the start of the next test period, at the end of the first and last 
three 23-hour periods of salt spray exposure, and at the end of any two 
of the fourth through seventh 23-hour periods of salt-spray exposure. 
The test chamber shall be closed at all times except for a maximum of 2 
minutes which is allowed for removal or replacement of a bulb during 
each period. After the ten periods, the lens reflector unit without the 
bulb shall be immersed in deionized water for 5 minutes, then secured 
and allowed to dry by natural convection only.
    (c) Using the voltage, resistance and pretest set up of paragraph 
(a) the current in each filament circuit shall be measured after the 
test conducted in paragraph (b).
    S8.5  Dust. The headlamp, mounted on a headlamp test fixture, with 
all drain holes, breathing devices or other designed openings in their 
normal operating positions, shall be positioned within a cubical box, 
with inside measurements of 35.4 in. (900 mm) on each side or larger if 
required for adequate wall clearance, i.e., a distance of at

[[Page 250]]

least 5.9 in. (150 mm) between the headlamp and any wall of the box. The 
box shall contain 9.9 lb. (4.5 kg) of fine powdered cement which 
conforms to the ASTM C150-77 specification for Portland Cement. Every 15 
minutes, the cement shall be agitated by compressed air or fan blower(s) 
by projecting blasts of air for a two-second period in a downward 
direction so that the cement is diffused as uniformly as possible 
throughout the entire box. This test shall be continued for five hours 
after which the exterior surfaces of the headlamp shall be wiped clean.
    S8.6  Temperature and internal heat test. A headlamp with one or 
more replaceable light sources shall be tested according to paragraphs 
S8.6.1 and S8.6.2. Tests shall be made with all filaments lighted at 
design voltage that are intended to be used simultaneously in the 
headlamp and which in combination draw the highest total wattage. These 
include but are not limited to filaments used for turn signal lamps, fog 
lamps, parking lamps, and headlamp lower beams lighted with upper beams 
when the wiring harness is so connected on the vehicle. If a turn signal 
is included in the headlamp assembly, it shall be operated at 90 flashes 
a minute with a 75 <plus-minus> 2% current ``on time.'' If the lamp 
produces both the upper and lower beam, it shall be tested in both the 
upper beam mode and the lower beam mode under the conditions above 
described, except for a headlamp with a single Types HB1 or HB2 light 
source.
    S8.6.1  Temperature cycle. A headlamp, mounted on a headlamp test 
fixture, shall be subjected to 10 complete consecutive cycles having the 
thermal cycle profile shown in Figure 6. During the hot cycle, the lamp, 
shall be energized commencing at point ``A'' of Figure 6 and de-
energized at point ``B.'' Separate or single test chambers may be used 
to generate the environment of Figure 6. All drain holes, breathing 
devices or other openings or vents of the headlamps shall be in their 
normal operating positions.
    S8.6.2  Internal Heat Test. (a) The headlamp lens surface that would 
normally be exposed to road dirt shall be uniformly sprayed with any 
appropriate mixture of dust and water or other materials to reduce the 
photometric output at the H-V test point of the upper beam (or the \1/
2\D-1\1/2\R test point of the lower beam as appropriate) to 25 
<plus-minus> 2% of the output originally measured in the photometric 
test conducted pursuant to paragraphs S7.4(i), or S7.5 (a) through (e), 
as applicable. A headlamp with a single Types HB1 or HB2 light source 
shall be tested on the upper beam only. Such reduction shall be 
determined under the same conditions as that of the original photometric 
measurement.
    (b) After the photometric output of the lamp has been reduced as 
specified in paragraph (a), the lamp and its mounting hardware shall be 
mounted in an environmental chamber in a manner similar to that 
indicated in Figure 7 ``Dirt/Ambient Test Setup.'' The headlamp shall be 
soaked for one hour at a temperature of 95 + 7 -0 degrees F (35 + 4 -0 
degrees C) and then the lamp shall be energized according to paragraph 
S8.6 for one hour in a still air condition, allowing the temperature to 
rise from the soak temperature.
    (c) The lamp shall be returned to a room ambient temperature of 73 + 
7 -0 degrees F (23 + 4 -0 degrees C) and a relative humidity of 30 
<plus-minus> 10% and allowed to stabilize to the room ambient 
temperature. The lens shall then be cleaned.
    S8.7 Humidity. (a) The test fixture consists of a horizontal steel 
plate to which three threaded steel or aluminum rods of \1/2\ inch 
diameter are screwed vertically behind the headlamp. The headlamp 
assembly is clamped to the vertical rods, which are behind the headlamp. 
All attachments to the headlamp assembly are made behind the lens and 
vents or openings, and are not within 2 inches laterally of a vent inlet 
or outlet.
    (b) The mounted headlamp assembly is oriented in its design 
operating position, and is placed in a controlled environment at a 
temperature of 100+7-0 degrees F (38+4-0 degrees C) with a relative 
humidity of not less than 90 percent. All drain holes, breathing 
devices, and other openings are in their normal operation positions for 
all phases of the humidity test. The headlamp shall be subjected to 24 
consecutive 3-hour test cycles. In each

[[Page 251]]

cycle, it shall be energized for 1 hour at design voltage with the 
highest combination of filament wattages that are intended to be used, 
and then de-energized for 2 hours. If the headlamp incorporates a turn 
signal, it shall flash at 90 flashes per minute with a 75+/-2 percent 
current ``on-time.''
    (c) Within 3 minutes after the completion of the 24th cycle, the air 
flow test will begin. The following shall occur: the mounted assembly 
shall be removed, placed in an insulating box and covered with foam 
material so that there is no visible air space around the assembly; the 
box shall be closed, taken to the air flow test chamber, and placed 
within it. Inside the chamber, the assembly with respect to the air 
flow, shall be oriented in its design operating position. The assembly 
is positioned in the chamber so that the center of the lens is in the 
center of the opening of the air flow entry duct during the test. The 
headlamp has at least 3 inches clearance on all sides, and at least 4 
inches to the entry and exit ducts at the closest points. If vent tubes 
are used which extend below the lamp body, the 3 inches are measured 
from the bottom of the vent tube or its protection. The temperature of 
the chamber is 73+7-0 degrees F (23+4-0 degrees C) with a relative 
humidity of 30+10-0 percent. The headlamp is not energized.
    (d) Before the test specified in paragraph (e) of this section, the 
uniformity of the air flow in the empty test chamber at a plane 4 inches 
downstream of the air entry duct shall have been measured over a 4-inch 
square grid. The uniformity of air flow at each grid point is +/-10 
percent of the average air flow specified in paragraph (e) of this 
section.
    (e) The mounted assembly in the chamber shall be exposed, for one 
hour, to an average air flow of 330+0-30 ft/min. as measured with an air 
velocity measuring probe having an accuracy of +/-3 percent in the 330 
ft/min range. The average air flow is the average of the velocity 
recorded at six points around the perimeter of the lens. The six points 
are determined as follows: At the center of the lens, construct a 
horizontal plane. The first two points are located in the plane, 1 inch 
outward from the intersection of the plane and each edge of the lens. 
Then, trisect the distance between these two points and construct 
longitudinal vertical planes at the two intermediate locations formed by 
the trisection. The four remaining points are located in the vertical 
planes, one inch above the top edge of the lens, and one inch below the 
bottom edge of the lens.
    (f) After one hour, the headlamp is removed and inspected for 
moisture.
    S8.8 Vibration. A vibration test shall be conducted in accordance 
with the procedures of SAE Standard J575e Tests for Motor Vehicle 
Lighting Devices and Components August 1970, and the following: the 
table on the adapter plate shall be of sufficient size to completely 
contain the test fixture base with no overhang. The vibration shall be 
applied in the vertical axis of the headlamp system as mounted on the 
vehicle. The filament shall not be energized.
    S8.9 Sealing. An unfixtured headlamp in its design mounting position 
shall be placed in water at a temperature of 176 +/- 5 degrees F (60 +/- 
3 degrees C) for one hour. The headlamp shall be energized in its 
highest wattage mode, with the test voltage at 12.8 +/- 0.1 V. during 
immersion. The lamp shall then be de-energized and immediately submerged 
in its design mounting position into water at 32 +5 -0 degrees F (0 +3 
-0 degrees C). The water shall be in a pressurized vessel, and the 
pressure shall be increased to 10 psi (70 kPa), upon placing the lamp in 
the water. The lamp shall remain in the pressurized vessel for a period 
of thirty minutes. This entire procedure shall be repeated for four 
cycles. Then the lamp shall be inspected for any signs of water on its 
interior. During the high temperature portion of the cycles, the lamp 
shall be observed for signs of air escaping from its interior. If any 
water occurs on the interior or air escapes, the lamp is not a sealed 
lamp.
    S8.10  Chemical and corrosion resistance of reflectors of 
replaceable lens headlamps.
    S8.10.1  Chemical resistance. (a) With the headlamp in the headlamp 
test fixture and the lens removed, the entire surface of the reflector 
that receives light from a headlamp light source

[[Page 252]]

shall be wiped once to the left and once to the right with a 6-inch 
square soft cotton cloth (with pressure equally applied) which has been 
saturated once in a container with 2 ounces of one of the test fluids 
listed in paragraph (b). The lamp shall be wiped within 5 seconds after 
removal of the cloth from the test fluid.
    (b) The test fluids are:
    (1) Tar remover (consisting by volume of 45% xylene and 55% 
petroleum base mineral spirits);
    (2) Mineral spirits; or
    (3) Fluids other than water contained in the manufacturer's 
instructions for cleaning the reflector.
    (c) After the headlamp has been wiped with the test fluid, it shall 
be stored in its designed operating attitude for 48 hours at a 
temperature of 73 deg.F <plus-minus> 7 deg. (23 deg.C <plus-minus> 
4 deg.) and a relative humidity of 30 <plus-minus> 10 percent. At the 
end of the 48-hour period, the headlamp shall be wiped clean with a soft 
dry cotton cloth and visually inspected.
    S8.10.2  Corrosion. (a) The headlamp with the lens removed, 
unfixtured and in its designed operating attitude with all drain holes, 
breathing devices or other designed openings in their normal operating 
positions, shall be subjected to a salt spray (fog) test in accordance 
with ASTM B117-73, Method of Salt Spray (Fog) Testing, for 24 hours, 
while mounted in the middle of the chamber.
    (b) Afterwards, the headlamp shall be stored in its designed 
operating attitude for 48 hours at a temperature of 73 deg.F 
<plus-minus> 7 deg. (23 deg.C <plus-minus> 4 deg.) and a relative 
humidity of 30 <plus-minus> 10 percent and allowed to dry by natural 
convection only. At the end of the 48-hour period, the reflector shall 
be cleaned according to the instructions supplied with the headlamp 
manufacturer's replacement lens, and inspected. The lens and seal shall 
then be attached according to these instructions and the headlamp tested 
for photometric performance.
    S9. Deflection test for replaceable light sources. With the light 
source rigidly mounted in a fixture in a manner indicated in Figure 8, a 
force 4.0 <plus-minus> 0.1 pounds (17.8 <plus-minus> 0.4N) is applied at 
a distance ``A'' from the reference plane perpendicular to the 
longitudinal axis of the glass capsule and parallel to the smallest 
dimension of the pressed glass capsule seal. The force shall be applied 
(using a rod with a hard rubber tip with a minimum spherical radius of 
.039 in (1 mm)) radially to the surface of the glass capsule in four 
locations in a plane parallel to the reference plane and spaced at a 
distance ``A'' from that plane. These force applications shall be spaced 
90 degrees apart starting at the point perpendicular to the smallest 
dimension of the pressed seal of the glass capsule. The bulb deflection 
shall be measured at the glass capsule surface at 180 degrees opposite 
to the force application. Distance ``A'' for a replaceable light source 
other than an HB Type shall be the dimension provided in accordance with 
Appendix A of part 564 of this chapter, section I.A.1 if the light 
source has a lower beam filament, or as specified in section I.B.1 if 
the light source has only an upper beam filament.
    S10 Simultaneous Aim Photometry Tests--(a) Type F Headlamp Systems. 
The assembly shall be located on a goniometer placed not less than 60 
feet (18.3m) from the photometer. The LF unit shall be aimed 
mechanically by centering the unit on the photometer axis and by 
aligning the aiming plane of the lens perpendicular to the photometer 
axis. Then the assembly shall be moved in a plane parallel to the 
established aiming plane of the LF headlamp until the UF headlamp is 
centered on the photometer axis. Photometry measurements of the UF 
photometry unit shall be completed using the aiming plane so 
established, and the procedures of section 4.1 and 4.1.4 Standard J1383 
APR85, and Figure 15-1 or Figure 15-2. A reaim tolerance of 
<plus-minus>\1/4\ degree is permitted in any direction at any test 
point.
    (b) Integral Beam Headlamp Systems. The assembly used for 
simultaneously aiming more than one integral beam headlamp shall be 
placed on a test fixture on a goniometer located not less than 60 feet 
(18.3 m.) from the photometer. The assembly shall be aimed by centering 
the geometric center of the lower beam lens(es) on the photometer axis 
and by aligning the photometer axis to be perpendicular to the aiming 
reference plane or appropriate vertical plane defined by the 
manufacturer of

any lower beam contributor. Photometric compliance of the lower beam 
shall be determined with all lower beam contributors illuminated and in 
accordance with sections 4.1 and 4.1.6 of SAE Standard J1383 APR85, and 
Figure 15-1 or Figure 15-2. The assembly shall then be moved in a plane 
parallel to the established aiming plane of the lower beam until the 
assembly is located with the geometric center of the upper lens(es) on 
the photometer axis. Photometric compliance for upper beam shall now be 
determined using the figure and procedure specified for the lower beam. 
During photometric testing, a \1/4\ degree reaim is permitted in any 
direction at any test point.
    S11. Photometric Test. A lamp that is wired in accordance with 
paragraph S5.5.11 of this standard, shall be tested for compliance with 
S5.5.11(a)(1) in accordance with the test method specified for 
photometric testing in SAE Standard J575 DEC88 when a test voltage of 
12.8V +/-20 mV is applied to the input terminals of the lamp switch 
module or voltage-reducing equipment, whichever is closer to the 
electrical source on the vehicle. The test distance from the lamp to the 
photometer shall be not less than 18.3 m, if the lamp is optically 
combined with a headlamp, or is a separate lamp, and not less than 3 m, 
if the lamp is optically combined with a lamp, other than a headlamp, 
that is required by this standard.
    S12. Headlamp Concealment Devices.
    S12.1  While the headlamp is illuminated, its fully opened headlamp 
concealment device shall remain fully opened should any loss of power to 
or within the headlamp concealment device occur.
    S12.2  Whenever any malfunction occurs in a component that controls 
or conducts power for the actuation of the concealment device, each 
closed headlamp concealment device shall be capable of being fully 
opened by a means not requiring the use of any tools. Thereafter, the 
headlamp concealment device must remain fully opened until intentionally 
closed.
    S12.3  Except for malfunctions covered by S12.2, each headlamp 
concealment device shall be capable of being fully opened and the 
headlamps illuminated by actuation of a single switch, lever, or similar 
mechanism, including a mechanism that is automatically actuated by a 
change in ambient light conditions.
    S12.4  Each headlamp concealment device shall be installed so that 
the headlamp may be mounted, aimed, and adjusted without removing any 
component of the device, other than components of the headlamp assembly.
    S12.5  Except for cases of malfunction covered by S12.2, each 
headlamp concealment device shall, within an ambient temperature range 
of -20 deg. F. to +120 deg. F., be capable of being fully opened in not 
more than 3 seconds after the actuation of a driver-operated control.

<ls-thn-eq>Note: (1) The term overall width refers to the nominal design dimension of the widest part of the    
  vehicle, exclusive of signal lamps, marker lamps, outside rearview mirrors, flexible fender extensions, and   
  mud flaps, determine with doors and windows closed, and the wheels in the straight-ahead position.            
This supersedes the interpretation of the term ``overall width'' appearing in the Federal Register of March 1,  
  1967 (32 FR 3390).                                                                                            
(2) Paragraph S3.1 and Tables I and III of Sec.  571.108 as amended (32 FR 18033, Dec. 16, 1967), specify that  
  certain lamp assemblies shall conform to applicable SAE Standards. Each of these basically referenced         
  standards subreferences both SAE Standard J575 (tests for motor vehicle lighting devices and components) which
  in turn references SAE Standard J573 on bulbs, and SAE Standard J567 on bulb sockets.                         
(3) Paragraph C of SAE Standard J575 states in part: ``Where special bulbs are specified, they should be        
  submitted with the devices and the same or similar bulbs used in the tests and operated at their rated mean   
  spherical candlepower.'' The Administrator has determined that this provision of SAE Standard J575 permits the
  use of special bulbs, including tubular-type bulbs, which do not conform to the detailed requirements of Table
  I of SAE Standard J573. It follows that the sockets for special bulbs need not conform to the detailed        
  requirements of SAE Standard J567. These provisions for special bulbs in no way except the lamp assemblies    
  from meeting all performance requirements specified in Federal Standard No. 108, including those specified in

    S5.3.2.1  Force a \3/4\-inch diameter cylindrical steel plunger with 
a hemispherical end perpendicularly into the tread rib as near to the 
centerline as possible, avoiding penetration into the tread groove, at 
the rate of 2 inches per minute.
    S5.3.2.2  Record the force and penetration at five test points 
equally spaced around the circumference of the tire. If the tire fails 
to break before the plunger is stopped by reaching the rim, record the 
force and penetration as the rim is reached and use these values in 
S5.3.2.3.
    S5.3.2.3  Compute the breaking energy for each test point by means 
of the following formula:

                              W=[(F x P)/2]

where

W=Energy, inch-pounds;
F=Force, pounds; and
P=Penetration, inches.

Sec. 571.111  Standard No. 111; Rearview mirrors.

    S1. Scope. This standard specifies requirements for the performance 
and location of rearview mirrors.
    S2. Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to reduce the number of 
deaths and injuries that occur when the driver of a motor vehicle does 
not have a clear and reasonably unobstructed view to the rear.
    S3. Application. This standard applies to passenger cars, 
multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, buses, schoolbuses and 
motorcycles.
    S4. Definitions.
    Convex mirror means a mirror having a curved reflective surface 
whose shape is the same as that of the exterior surface of a section of 
a sphere.

[[Page 305]]

    Effective mirror surface means the portions of a mirror that reflect 
images, excluding the mirror rim or mounting brackets.
    Unit magnification mirror means a plane or flat mirror with a 
reflective surface through which the angular height and width of the 
image of an object is equal to the angular height and width of the 
object when viewed directly at the same distance except for flaws that 
do not exceed normal manufacturing tolerances. For the purposes of this 
regulation a prismatic day-night adjustment rearview mirror one of whose 
positions provides unit magnification is considered a unit magnification 
mirror.
    S5. Requirements for passenger cars.
    S5.1  Inside rearview mirror. Each passenger car shall have an 
inside rearview mirror of unit magnification.
    S5.1.1  Field of view. Except as provided in S5.3, the mirror shall 
provide a field of view with an included horizontal angle measured from 
the projected eye point of at least 20 degrees, and sufficient vertical 
angle to provide a view of a level road surface extending to the horizon 
beginning at a point not greater than 200 feet to the rear of the 
vehicle when the vehicle is occupied by the driver and four passengers 
or the designed occupant capacity, if less, based on an average occupant 
weight of 150 pounds. The line of sight may be partially obscured by 
seated occupants or by head restraints. The location of the driver's eye 
reference points shall be those established in Motor Vehicle Safety 
Standard No. 104 (Sec. 571.104) or a nominal location appropriate for 
any 95th percentile male driver.
    S5.1.2  Mounting. The mirror mounting shall provide a stable support 
for the mirror, and shall provide for mirror adjustment by tilting in 
both the horizontal and vertical directions. If the mirror is in the 
head impact area, the mounting shall deflect, collapse or break away 
without leaving sharp edges when the reflective surface of the mirror is 
subjected to a force of 90 pounds in any forward direction that is not 
more than 45 deg. from the forward longitudinal direction.
    S5.2  Outside rearview mirror--driver's side.
    S5.2.1  Field of view. Each passenger car shall have an outside 
mirror of unit magnification. The mirror shall provide the driver a view 
of a level road surface extending to the horizon from a line, 
perpendicular to a longitudinal plane tangent to the driver's side of 
the vehicle at the widest point, extending 8 feet out from the tangent 
plane 35 feet behind the driver's eyes, with the seat in the rearmost 
position. The line of sight may be partially obscured by rear body or 
fender contours. The location of the driver's eye reference points shall 
be those established in Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 104 
(Sec. 571.104) or a nominal location appropriate for any 95th percentile 
male driver.
    S5.2.2  Mounting. The mirror mounting shall provide a stable support 
for the mirror, and neither the mirror nor the mounting shall protrude 
farther than the widest part of the vehicle body except to the extent 
necessary to produce a field of view meeting or exceeding the 
requirements of S5.2.1. The mirror shall not be obscured by the unwiped 
portion of the windshield, and shall be adjustable by tilting in both 
horizontal and vertical directions from the driver's seated position. 
The mirror and mounting shall be free of sharp points or edges that 
could contribute to pedestrian injury.
    S5.3  Outside rearview mirror passenger's side. Each passenger car 
whose inside rearview mirror does not meet the field of view 
requirements of S5.1.1 shall have an outside mirror of unit 
magnification or a convex mirror installed on the passenger's side. The 
mirror mounting shall provide a stable support and be free of sharp 
points or edges that could contribute to pedestrian injury. The mirror 
need not be adjustable from the driver's seat but shall be capable of 
adjustment by tilting in both horizontal and vertical directions.
    S5.4  Convex mirror requirements. Each motor vehicle using a convex 
mirror to meet the requirements of S5.3 shall comply with the following 
requirements:
    S5.4.1  When each convex mirror is tested in accordance with the 
procedures specified in S12. of this standard, none of the radii of 
curvature readings shall deviate from the average radius

[[Page 306]]

of curvature by more than plus or minus 12.5 percent.
    S5.4.2 Each convex mirror shall have permanently and indelibly 
marked at the lower edge of the mirror's reflective surface, in letters 
not less than 3/16 of an inch nor more than 1/4 inch high the words 
``Objects in Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear.''
    S5.4.3  The average radius of curvature of each such mirror, as 
determined by using the procedure in S12., shall be not less than 35 
inches and not more than 65 inches.
    S6. Requirements for multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, and 
buses, other than schoolbuses, with GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less.

horizontal and vertical directions.
    S11. Mirror Construction. The average reflectance of any mirror 
required by this standard shall be determined in accordance with SAE 
Recommended Practice J964, OCT84. All single reflectance mirrors shall 
have an average reflectance of at least 35 percent. If a mirror is 
capable of multiple reflectance levels, the minimum reflectance level in 
the day mode shall be at least 35 percent and the minimum reflectance 
level in the night mode shall be at least 4 percent. A multiple 
reflectance mirror shall either be equipped with a means for the driver 
to adjust the mirror to a reflectance level of at least 35 percent in 
the event of electrical failure, or achieve such reflectance level 
automatically in the event of electrical failure.
    S12.  Determination of radius of curvature.
    S12.1  To determine the average radius of curvature of a convex 
mirror, use a 3-point linear spherometer, which meets the requirements 
of S12.2, at the 10 test positions shown in Figure 1 and record the 
readings for each position.
    S12.2  The 3-point linear spherometer has two outer fixed legs 1.5 
inches apart and one inner movable leg at the mid-point. The spherometer 
has a dial indicator with a scale that can be read accurately to 0.0001 
inches, with the zero reading being a flat surface.
    S12.3  The 10 test positions on the image display consist of two 
positions at right angles to each other at each of five locations as 
shown in Figure 1. The locations are at the center of the mirror, at the 
left and right ends of a horizontal line that bisects the mirror and at 
the top and bottom ends of a vertical line that bisects the mirror. None 
of the readings are within a 0.25-inch border on the edge of the image 
display.
    S12.4  At each position, the spherometer is held perpendicular to 
the convex mirror-surface and a record is made of the reading on the 
dial indicator to the nearest 0.0001 inch.

[[Page 308]]

    S12.5  Convert the dial reading data for each of the 10 test 
positions to radius of curvature calculations using Table I. Consider 
the change as linear for dial readings that fall between two numbers in 
Table I.
    S12.6  Calculate the average radius of curvature by adding all 10 
radius of curvature calculations and dividing by ten.
    S12.7  Determine the numerical difference between the average radius 
of curvature and each of the 10 individual radius of curvature 
calculations determined in S12.5.
    S12.8  Calculate the greatest percentage deviation by dividing the 
greatest numerical difference determined in S12.7 by the average radius 
of curvature and multiply by 100.

    S13.4  The driver's eye location is the eye location of a 25th 
percentile adult female, when seated in the driver's seat as follows:
    (a) The center point of the driver's eye location is the point 
located 68.58 centimeters (27 inches) vertically above the intersection 
of the seat cushion and the seat back at the longitudinal centerline of 
the seat.
    (b) Adjust the driver's seat to the midway point between the 
forward-most and rear-most positions, and if separately adjustable in 
the vertical direction, adjust to the lowest position. If an adjustment 
position does not exist at the midway point, use the closest adjustment 
position to the rear of the midpoint. If a seat back is adjustable, 
adjust the seat back angle to the manufacturer's nominal design riding 
position in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
    S13.5  Adjustable mirrors are adjusted before the test in accordance 
with the manufacturer's recommendations. Such mirrors are not moved or 
readjusted at any time during the test.
    13.6  Place a 35 mm or larger format camera, or video camera, so 
that its image plane is located at the center point of the driver's eye 
location or at any single point within a semicircular area established 
by a 15.24 centimeter (6 inch) radius parallel to and forward of the 
center point (see figure 3). With the camera at any single location on 
or within that semicircle look through the camera and the windows of the 
bus and determine whether the entire top surface of each cylinder is 
directly visible.
    S13.7  For each cylinder whose entire top surface is determined 
under paragraph 13.4 of this section not to be directly visible at the 
driver's eye location,

          minutes of arc;
D=distance from center point of driver's eye location to the center of 
          the mirror's surface; and

0.000873=tangent of 3 minutes of arc.

    For 9 minutes of arc:

X=D x 0.002618,

Where:

X=the width of a line, in the unit of measurement D, representing 9 
minutes of arc;
D=distance from center point of driver's eye location to the center of 
the mirror's surface; and

0.002618=tangent of 9 minutes of arc.

    (b) Photograph each cylinder through the mirror(s) that provides a 
view of the cylinder. Photograph each cylinder with the camera located 
so that the view through its film or image plane is located at any 
single location within the semicircle established under 13.4, [POINT 
A,B,C, OR D] ensuring that the image of the mirror and comparison chart 
fill the camera's view finder to the extent possible.

    S6. Test procedures.
    S6.1  Equilibrium reflux boiling point. Determine the ERBP of a 
brake fluid by running duplicate samples according to the following 
procedure and averaging the results.
    S6.1.1  Summary of procedure. Sixty milliliters (ml.) of brake fluid 
are boiled under specified equilibrium conditions (reflux) at 
atmospheric pressure in a 100-ml. flask. The average temperature of the 
boiling fluid at the end of the reflux period, corrected for variations 
in barometric pressure if necessary, is the ERBP.
    S6.1.2  Apparatus. (See Figure 1) The test apparatus shall consist 
of--
    (a) Flask. (See Figure 2) A 100-ml. round-bottom, short-neck heat-
resistant glass flask having a neck with a \19/38\ standard taper, 
female ground-glass joint and a side-entering tube, with an outside 
diameter of 10 millimeters (mm.), which centers the thermometer bulb in 
the flask 6.5 mm. from the bottom;
    (b) Condenser. A water-cooled, reflux, glass-tube type, condenser 
having a jacket 200 mm. in length, the bottom end of which has a \19/38\ 
standard-taper, drip-tip, male ground-glass joint;
    (c) Boiling stones. Three clean, unused silicon carbide grains 
(approximately 2 mm. (0.08 inch) in diameter, grit No. 8);
    (d) Thermometer. Standardized calibrated partial immersion (76 mm.), 
solid stem, thermometers conforming to the requirements for an ASTM 2C 
or 2F, and an ASTM 3C or 3F thermometer; and

    S6.1.3  Preparation of apparatus. (a) Thoroughly clean and dry all 
glassware.

[[Page 323]]

    (b) Insert thermometer through the side tube until the tip of the 
bulb is 6.5 mm. (\1/4\ inch) from the bottom center of the flask. Seal 
with a short piece of natural rubber, EPDM, SBR, or butyl tubing.
    (c) Place 60<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 ml. of brake fluid and the 
silicon carbide grains into the flask.
    (d) Attach the flask to the condenser. When using a heating mantle, 
place the mantle under the flask and support it with a ring-clamp and 
laboratory-type stand, holding the entire assembly in place by a clamp. 
When using a rheostat-controlled heater, center a standard porcelain or 
hard asbestos refractory, having a diameter opening 32 to 38 mm., over 
the heating element and mount the flask so that direct heat is applied 
only through the opening in the refractory. Place the assembly in an 
area free from drafts or other types of sudden temperature changes. 
Connect the cooling water inlet and outlet tubes to the condenser. Turn 
on the cooling water. The water supply temperature shall not exceed 
28 deg. C. (82.4 deg. F.) and the temperature rise through the condenser 
shall not exceed 2 deg. C. (3.6 deg. F.).
    S6.1.4  Procedure. Apply heat to the flask so that within 
10<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 minutes the fluid is refluxing in excess of 1 
drop per second. The reflux rate shall not exceed 5 drops per second at 
any time. Immediately adjust the heating rate to obtain an equilibrium 
reflux rate of 1 to 2 drops per second over the next 
5<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 minutes. Maintain this rate for an additional 2 
minutes, taking four temperature readings at 30-second intervals. Record 
the average of these as the observed ERBP. If no reflux is evident when 
the fluid temperature reaches 260 deg. C (500 deg. F), discontinue 
heating and report ERBP as in excess of 260 deg. C (500 deg. F).
    S6.1.5  Calculation. (a) Thermometer inaccuracy. Correct the 
observed ERBP by applying any correction factor obtained in 
standardizing the thermometer.
    (b) Variation from standard barometric pressure. Apply the factor 
shown in Table III to calculate the barometric pressure correction to 
the ERBP.

    (c) If the two corrected observed ERBP's agree within 2 deg. C. 
(4 deg. C. for brake fluids having an ERBP over 230 deg. C./446 deg. F.) 
average the duplicate runs as the ERBP; otherwise, repeat the entire 
test, averaging the four corrected observed values to determine the 
original ERBP.
    S6.2  Wet ERBP. Determine the wet ERBP of a brake fluid by running 
duplicate samples according to the following procedure.
    S6.2.1.  Summary of procedure. A 350 ml. sample of the brake fluid 
is humidified under controlled conditions; 350 ml. of SAE triethylene 
glycol monomethyl ether, brake fluid grade, referee material (TEGME) as 
described in appendix E of SAE Standard J1703 Nov. 83, ``Motor Vehicle 
Brake Fluid,'' November 1983, is used to establish the end point for 
humidification. After humidification, the water content and ERBP of the 
brake fluid are determined.
    S6.2.2  Apparatus for humidification. (See Figure 3).
    Test apparatus shall consist of--
    (a) Glass jars. Four SAE RM-49 corrosion test jars or equivalent 
screwtop, straight-sided, round glass jars each having a capacity of 
about 475 ml. and approximate inner dimensions of 100 mm. in height by 
75 mm. in diameter, with matching lids having new, clean inserts 
providing water-vapor-proof seals;
    (b) Desiccator and cover. Two bowl-form glass desiccators, 250-mm. 
inside diameter, having matching tubulated covers fitted with No. 8 
rubber stoppers; and
    (c) Desiccator plate. Two 230-mm. diameter, perforated porcelain 
desiccator plates, without feet, glazed on one side.
    S6.2.3  Reagents and materials. (a) Distilled water, see S7.1.
    (b) SAE TEGME referee material.

[[Page 324]]

    Sec. 6.2.4  Preparation of apparatus. Lubricate the ground-glass 
joint of the desiccator. Pour 450<plus-minus>10 ml. of distilled water 
into each desiccator and insert perforated porcelain desiccator plates. 
Place the desiccators in an oven with temperature controlled at 
50<plus-minus>1  deg.C. (122<plus-minus>1.8  deg.F.) throughout the 
humidification procedure.
    S6.2.5  Procedure. Pour 350<plus-minus>5 ml. of brake fluid into an 
open corrosion test jar. Prepare in the same manner a duplicate test 
fluid sample and two duplicate specimens of the SAE TEGME referee 
material (350<plus-minus>5 ml. of TEGME in each jar). The water content 
of the SAE TEGME fluid is adjusted to 0.50<plus-minus>0.05 percent by 
weight at the start of the test in accordance with S7.2. Place one 
sample each of the test brake fluid and the prepared TEGME sample into 
the same desiccator. Repeat for the second sample of test brake fluid 
and TEGME in a second desiccator. Place the desiccators in the 50 
deg.C. (122  deg.F.) controlled oven and replace desiccator covers. At 
intervals, during oven humidification, remove the rubber stoppers in the 
tops of desiccators. Using a long needled hypodermic syringe, take a 
sample of not more than 2 ml. from each TEGME sample and determine its 
water content. Remove no more than 10 ml. of fluid from each SAE TEGME 
sample during the humidification procedure. When the water content of 
the SAE fluid reaches 3.70<plus-minus>0.05 percent by weight (average of 
the duplicates). remove the two test fluid specimens from their 
desiccators and promptly cap each jar tightly. Allow the sealed jars to 
cool for 60 to 90 minutes at 23 deg.<plus-minus>5  deg.C. 
(73.4 deg.<plus-minus>9  deg.F.). Measure the water contents of the test 
fluid specimens in accordance with S7.2 and determine their ERBP's in 
accordance with S6.1. If the two ERBPs agree within 4  deg.C. (8 
deg.F.), average them to determine the wet ERBP; otherwise repeat and 
average the four individual ERBPs as the wet ERBP of the brake fluid.

    S6.3  Kinematic viscosity. Determine the kinematic viscosity of a 
brake fluid in centistokes (cSt.) by the following procedure. Run 
duplicate samples at each of the specified temperatures, making two 
timed runs on each sample.
    S6.3.1  Summary of the procedure. The time is measured for a fixed 
volume of the brake fluid to flow through a calibrated glass capillary 
viscometer under an accurately reproducible head and at a closely 
controlled temperature. The kinematic viscosity is then calculated from 
the measured flow time and the calibration constant of the viscometer.
    S6.3.2  Apparatus.
    (a) Viscometers. Calibrated glass capillary-type viscometers, ASTM 
D2515-66, ``Standard Specification for Kinematic Glass Viscometers,'' 
measuring viscosity within the precision limits of S6.4.7. Use suspended 
level viscometers for viscosity measurements at low temperatures. Use 
Cannon-Fenske Routine or other modified Ostwald viscometers at ambient 
temperatures and above.
    (b) Viscometer holders and frames. Mount a viscometer in the 
constant-temperature bath so that the mounting tube is held within 
1 deg. of the vertical.

[[Page 326]]

    (c) Viscometer bath. A transparent liquid bath of sufficient depth 
such that at no time during the measurement will any portion of the 
sample in the viscometer be less than 2 cm. below the surface or less 
than 2 cm. above the bottom. The bath shall be cylindrical in shape, 
with turbulent agitation sufficient to meet the temperature control 
requirements. For measurements within 15 deg. to 100 deg. C. (60 deg. to 
212 deg. F.) the temperature of the bath medium shall not vary by more 
than 0.01 deg. C. (0.02 deg. F.) over the length of the viscometers, or 
between the positions of the viscometers, or at the locations of the 
thermometers. Outside this range, the variation shall not exceed 
0.03 deg. C. (0.05 deg. F.).
    (d) Thermometers. Liquid-in-Glass Kinematic Viscosity Test 
Thermometers, covering the range of test temperatures indicated in Table 
IV and conforming to ASTM E1-68, ``Specifications for ASTM 
Thermometers,'' and in the IP requirements for IP Standard Thermometers. 
Standardize before use (see S6.3.3(b)). Use two standardized 
thermometers in the bath.

    (e) Timing device. Stop watch or other timing device graduated in 
divisions representing not more than 0.2 second, with an accuracy of at 
least <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.05 percent when tested over intervals of 15 
minutes. Electrical timing devices may be used when the current 
frequency is controlled to an accuracy of 0.01 percent or better.
    S6.3.3  Standardization.
    (a) Viscometers. Use viscometers calibrated in accordance with 
appendix 1 of ASTM D445-65, ``Viscosity of Transparent and Opaque 
Liquids (Kinematic and Dynamic Viscosities).'' The calibration constant, 
C, is dependent upon the gravitational acceleration at the place of 
calibration. This must, therefore, be supplied by the standardization 
laboratory together with the instrument constant. Where the acceleration 
of gravity, g, in the two locations differs by more than 0.1 percent, 
correct the calibration constant as follows:

          C<INF>2</INF>=(g<INF>2</INF>/g<INF>1</INF>) x C<INF>1

</INF>where the subscripts 1 and 2 indicate respectively the 
standardization laboratory and the testing laboratory.

    (b) Thermometers. Check liquid-in-glass thermometers to the nearest 
0.01 deg. C. (0.02 deg. F.) by direct comparison with a standardized 
thermometer. Kinematic Viscosity Test Thermometers shall be standardized 
at ``total immersion.'' The ice point of standardized thermometers shall 
be determined before use and the official corrections shall be adjusted 
to conform to the changes in ice points. (See ASTM E77-66, 
``Verification and Calibration of Liquid-in-Glass Thermometers.'')
    (c) Timers. Time signals are broadcast by the National Bureau of 
Standards, Station WWV, Washington, DC at 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 
and 35 Mc/sec (MHz). Time signals are also broadcast by Station CHU from 
Ottawa, Canada, at 3.330, 7.335, and 14.670 Mc/sec, and Station MSF at 
Rugby, United Kingdom, at 2.5, 5, and 10 Mc/sec.
    S6.3.4  Procedure. (a) Set and maintain the bath at the appropriate 
test temperature (see S5.1.3) within the limits specified in S6.3.2(c). 
Apply the necessary corrections, if any, to all thermometer readings.
    (b) Select a clean, dry, calibrated viscometer giving a flow time 
not less than its specified minimum, or 200 seconds, whichever is the 
greater.
    (c) Charge the viscometer in the manner used when the instrument was 
calibrated. Do not filter or dry the

[[Page 327]]

brake fluid, but protect it from contamination by dirt and moisture 
during filling and measurements.
    (1) Charge the suspended level viscometers by tilting about 30 deg. 
from the vertical and pouring sufficient brake fluid through the fill 
tube into the lower reservoir so that when the viscometer is returned to 
vertical position the meniscus is between the fill marks. For 
measurements below 0 deg. C. (32 deg. F.), before placing the filled 
viscometer into the constant temperature bath, draw the sample into the 
working capillary and timing bulb and insert small rubber stoppers to 
suspend the fluid in this position, to prevent accumulation of water 
condensate on the walls of the critical portions of the viscometer. 
Alternatively, fit loosely packed drying tubes into the open ends of the 
viscometer to prevent water condensation, but do not restrict the flow 
of the sample under test by the pressures created in the instrument.
    (2) If a Cannon-Fenske Routine viscometer is used, charge by 
inverting and immersing the smaller arm into the brake fluid and 
applying vacuum to the larger arm. Fill the tube to the upper timing 
mark, and return the viscometer to an upright position.
    (d) Mount the viscometer in the bath in a true vertical position 
(see S6.3.2(b)).
    (e) The viscometer shall remain in the bath until it reaches the 
test temperature.
    (f) At temperatures below 0 deg. C. (32 deg. F.) conduct an untimed 
preliminary run by allowing the brake fluid to drain through the 
capillary into the lower reservoir after the test temperature has been 
established.
    (g) Adjust the head level of the brake fluid to a position in the 
capillary arm about 5 mm. above the first timing mark.
    (h) With brake fluid flowing freely measure to within 0.2 second the 
time required for the meniscus to pass from the first timing mark to the 
second. If this flow time is less than the minimum specified for the 
viscometer, or 200 seconds, whichever is greater, repeat using a 
viscometer with a capillary of smaller diameter.
    (i) Repeat S6.3.4 (g) and (h). If the two timed runs do not agree 
within 0.2 percent, reject and repeat using a fresh sample of brake 
fluid.
    S6.3.5  Cleaning the viscometers. (a) Periodically clean the 
instrument with chromic acid to remove organic deposits. Rinse 
thoroughly with distilled water and acetone, and dry with clean dry air.
    (b) Between successive samples rinse the viscometer with ethanol 
(isopropanol when testing DOT 5 fluids) followed by an acetone or ether 
rinse. Pass a slow stream of filtered dry air through the viscometer 
until the last trace of solvent is removed.
    S6.3.6  Calculation. (a) The following viscometers have a fixed 
volume charged at ambient temperature, and as a consequence C varies 
with test temperature: Cannon-Fenske Routine, Pinkevitch, Cannon-Manning 
Semi-Micro, and Cannon Fenske Opaque. To calculate C at test 
temperatures other than the calibration temperature for these 
viscometers, see ASTM D2515-66, ``Kinematic Glass Viscometers'' or 
follow instructions given on the manufacturer's certificate of 
calibration.
    (b) Average the four timed runs on the duplicate samples to 
determine the kinematic viscosities.
    S6.3.7  Precision (at 95 percent confidence level).
    (a) Repeatability. If results on duplicate samples by the same 
operator differ by more than 1 percent of their mean, repeat the tests.
    S6.4  pH value. Determine the pH value of a brake fluid by running 
one sample according to the following procedure.
    S6.4.1  Summary of the procedure. Brake fluid is diluted with an 
equal volume of an ethanol-water solution. The pH of the resultant 
mixture is measured with a prescribed pH meter assembly at 23 deg. C. 
(73.4 deg. F.).
    S6.4.2  Apparatus. The pH assembly consists of the pH meter, glass 
electrode, and calomel electrode, as specified in Appendices A1.1, A1.2, 
and A1.3 of ASTM D 1121-67, ``Standard Method of Test for Reserve 
Alkalinity of Engine Antifreezes and Antirusts.'' The glass electrode is 
a full range type (pH 0-14), with low sodium error.
    S6.4.3  Reagents. Reagent grade chemicals conforming to the 
specifications of the Committee on Analytical

[[Page 328]]

Reagents of the American Chemical Society.
    (a) Distilled water. Distilled water (S7.1) shall be boiled for 
about 15 minutes to remove carbon dioxide, and protected with a soda-
lime tube or its equivalent while cooling and in storage. (Take 
precautions to prevent contamination by the materials used for 
protection against carbon dioxide.) The pH of the boiled distilled water 
shall be between 6.2 and 7.2 at 25 deg. C. (77 deg. F.).
    (b) Standard buffer solutions. Prepare buffer solutions for 
calibrating the pH meter and electrode pair from salts sold specifically 
for use, either singly or in combination, as pH standards. Dry salts for 
1 hour at 110 deg. C. (230 deg. F.) before use except for borax which 
shall be used as the decahydrate. Store solutions with pH less than 9.5 
in bottles of chemically resistant glass or polyethylene. Store the 
alkaline phosphate solution in a glass bottle coated inside with 
paraffin. Do not use a standard with an age exceeding three months.
    (1) Potassium hydrogen phthalate buffer solution (0.05 M, pH=4.01 at 
25 deg. C. (77 deg. F.)). Dissolve 10.21 g. of potassium hydrogen 
phthalate (KHC<INF>8</INF> H<INF>4</INF> O<INF>4</INF>) in distilled 
water. Dilute to 1 liter.
    (2) Neutral phosphate buffer solution (0.025 M with respect to each 
phosphate salt, pH=6.86 at 25 deg. C. (77 deg. F.)). Dissolve 3.40 g. of 
potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH<INF>2</INF> PO<INF>4</INF>) and 3.55 
g. of anhydrous disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na<INF>2</INF> 
HPO<INF>4</INF>) in distilled water.
    (3) Borax buffer solution (0.01 M, pH=9.18 at 25 deg. C. (77 deg. 
F.)). Dissolve 3.81 g. of disodium tetraborate decahydrate (Na<INF>2</INF> 
B<INF>4</INF> O<INF>7</INF> deg.10H2 O) in distilled water, and dilute 
to 1 liter. Stopper the bottle except when actually in use.
    (4) Alkaline phosphate buffer solution (0.01 M trisodium phosphate, 
pH=11.72 at 25 deg. C. (77 deg. F.)). Dissolve 1.42 g. of anhydrous 
disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na<INF>2</INF> HPO<INF>4</INF>) in 100 ml. 
of a 0.1 M carbonate-free solution of sodium hydroxide. Dilute to 1 
liter with distilled water.
    (5) Potassium chloride electrolyte. Prepare a saturated solution of 
potassium chloride (KCl) in distilled water.
    (c) Ethanol-water mixture. To 80 parts by volume of ethanol (S7.3) 
add 20 parts by volume of distilled water. Adjust the pH of the mixture 
to 7<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.1 using 0.1 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) 
solution. If more than 4 ml. of NaOH solution per liter of mixture is 
required for neutralization, discard the mixture.
    S6.4.4  Preparation of electrode system.
    (a) Maintenance of electrodes. Clean the glass electrode before 
using by immersing in cold chromic-acid cleaning solution. Drain the 
calomel electrode and fill with KCl electrolyte, keeping level above 
that of the mixture at all times. When not in use, immerse the lower 
halves of the electrodes in distilled water, and do not immerse in the 
mixture for any appreciable period of time between determinations.
    (b) Preparation of electrodes. Condition new glass electrodes and 
those that have been stored dry as recommended by the manufacturer. 
Before and after using, wipe the glass electrode thoroughly with a clean 
cloth, or a soft absorbent tissue, and rinse with distilled water. 
Before each pH determination, soak the prepared electrode in distilled 
water for at least 2 minutes. Immediately before use, remove any excess 
water from the tips of the electrode.
    S6.4.5  Standardization of the pH assembly and testing of the 
electrodes. (a) Immediately before use, standardize the pH assembly with 
a standard buffer solution. Then use a second standard buffer solution 
to check the linearity of the response of the electrodes at different pH 
values, and to detect a faulty glass electrode or incorrect temperature 
compensation. The two buffer solutions bracket the anticipated pH value 
of the test brake fluid.
    (b) Allow instrument to warm up, and adjust according to the 
manufacturer's instructions. Immerse the tips of the electrodes in a 
standard buffer solution and allow the temperature of the buffer 
solution and the electrodes to equalize. Set the temperature knob at the 
temperature of the buffer solution. Adjust the standardization or 
asymmetry potential control until the meter registers a scale reading, 
in pH units, equal to the known pH of the standardizing buffer solution.
    (c) Rinse the electrodes with distilled water and remove excess 
water from the tips. Immerse the electrodes in a second standard buffer 
solution. The reading of the meter shall agree with the known pH of the 
second standard

[[Page 329]]

buffer solution within <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.05 unit without changing 
the setting of the standardization of asymmetry potential control.
    (d) A faulty electrode is indicated by failure to obtain a correct 
value for the pH of the second standard buffer solution after the meter 
has been standardized with the first.
    S6.4.6  Procedure. To 50<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 ml. of the test brake 
fluid add 50<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 ml. of the ethanol-water (S6.4.3(c)) 
and mix thoroughly. Immerse the electrodes in the mixture. Allow the 
system to come to equilibrium, readjust the temperature compensation if 
necessary, and take the pH reading.
    S6.5  Fluid stability. Evaluate the heat and chemical stability of a 
brake fluid by the following procedure, running duplicate samples for 
each test and averaging the results.
    S6.5.1  Summary of the procedure. The degradation of the brake fluid 
at elevated temperature, alone or in a mixture with a reference fluid, 
is evaluated by determining the change in boiling point after a period 
of heating under reflux conditions.
    S6.5.2  Apparatus. Use the apparatus and preparation specified in 
S6.1.2 and S6.1.3.
    S6.5.3  High temperature stability.
    S6.5.3.1  Procedure. (a) Heat a new 60<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 ml. 
sample of the brake fluid to 185 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 deg. C. 
(365 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>3.6 deg. F.). Hold at this temperature for 
120<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 minutes. Bring to a reflux rate in excess of 1 
drop per second within 5 minutes. The reflux rate should not exceed 5 
drops per second at any time. Over the next 5<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 
minutes adjust the heating rate to obtain an equilibrium reflux rate of 
1 to 2 drops per second. Maintain this rate for an additional 2 minutes, 
taking four temperature readings at 30-second intervals. Average these 
as the observed ERBP. If no reflux is evident when the fluid temperature 
reaches 260 deg. C. (500 deg. F), discontinue heating and report ERBP as 
in excess of 260 deg. C. (500 deg. F.).
    S6.5.3.2  Calculation. Correct the observed ERBP for thermometer and 
barometric pressure factors according to S6.1.5 (a) and (b). Average the 
corrected ERBP's of the duplicate samples. The difference between this 
average and the original ERBP obtained in S6.1 is the change in ERBP of 
the fluid.
    S6.5.4  Chemical stability.
    S6.5.4.1  Materials. SAE RM-66-04 Compatibility Fluid as described 
in appendix B of SAE Standard J1703 JAN 1995, ``Motor Vehicle Brake 
Fluid.'' (SAE RM-66-03 Compatibility Fluid as described in appendix A of 
SAE Standard J1703 Nov83, ``Motor Vehicle Brake Fluid,'' November 1983, 
may be used in place of SAE RM-66-04 until January 1, 1995.)
    S6.5.4.2  Procedure. (a) Mix 30 <plus-minus> 1 ml. of the brake 
fluid with 30 <plus-minus> 1 ml. of SAE RM-66-04 Compatibility Fluid in 
a boiling point flask (S6.1.2(a)). Determine the initial ERBP of the 
mixture by applying heat to the flask so that the fluid is refluxing in 
10 <plus-minus> 2 minutes at a rate in excess of 1 drop per second, but 
not more than 5 drops per second. Note the maximum fluid temperature 
observed during the first minute after the fluid begins refluxing at a 
rate in excess of 1 drop per second. Over the next 15 <plus-minus> 1 
minutes, adjust and maintain the reflux rate at 1 to 2 drops per second. 
Maintain this rate for an additional 2 minutes, recording the average 
value of four temperature readings taken at 30 second intervals as the 
final ERBP.
    (b) Thermometer and barometric corrections are not required.
    S6.5.4.3  Calculation. The difference between the initial ERBP and 
the final average temperature is the change in temperature of the 
refluxing mixture. Average the results of the duplicates to the nearest 
0.5  deg.C (1.0  deg.F).
    S6.6  Corrosion. Evaluate the corrosiveness of a brake fluid by 
running duplicate samples according to the following procedure.

corrosion test strips on all surface areas with silicon carbide paper 
wet with ethanol (isopropanol when testing DOT 5 SBBF fluids) until all 
surface scratches, cuts and pits are removed. Use a new piece of paper 
for each different type of metal. Polish the strips with the 00 grade 
steel wool. Wash all strips, including the tinned iron and the assembly 
hardware, with ethanol (isopropanol when testing DOT 5 SBBF fluids); dry 
the strips and assembly hardware with a clean lint free cloth or use 
filtered compressed air and place the strips and hardware in a 
desiccator containing silica gel or other suitable desiccant and 
maintained at 23 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 deg. C. 
(73.4 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>9 deg. F.), for at least 1 hour. Handle 
the strips with forceps after polishing. Weigh and record the weight of 
each strip to the nearest 0.1 mg. Assemble the strips on a clean dry

    (b) SBR WC cups. Measure the base diameters of the two standard SBR 
cups, using an optical comparator or micrometer, to the nearest 0.02 mm. 
(0.001 inch) along the centerline of the SAE and rubber-type 
identifications and at right angles to this centerline. Take the 
measurements at least 0.4 mm. (0.015 inch) above the bottom edge and 
parallel to the base of the cup. Discard any cup if the two measured 
diameters differ by more than 0.08 mm. (0.003 inch). Average the two 
readings on each cup. Determine the hardness of the cups according to 
S7.4.
    S6.6.5  Procedure. Rinse the cups in ethanol (isopropanol when 
testing DOT 5 SBBF fluids) for not more than 30 seconds and wipe dry 
with a clean lint-free cloth. Place one cup with lip edge facing up, in 
each jar. Insert a metal strip assembly inside each cup with the 
fastened end down and the free end extending upward. (See Figure 5.) 
When testing brake fluids, except DOT 5 SBBF, mix 760 ml. of brake fluid 
with 40 ml. of distilled water. When testing DOT 5 SBBF's, humidify 800 
ml. of brake fluid in accordance with S6.2, eliminating determination of 
the ERBP. Using this water-wet mixture, cover each strip assembly to a 
minimum depth of 10 mm. above the tops of the strips. Tighten the lids 
and place the jars for 120<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 hours in an oven 
maintained at 100 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 deg. C. 
(212 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>3.6 deg. F.). Allow the jars to cool at 
23 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 deg. C. 
(73.4 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>9 deg.F.) for 60 to 90 minutes. 
Immediately remove the strips from the jars using forceps, agitating the 
strip assembly in the fluid to remove loose adhering sediment. Examine 
the test strips and jars for adhering crystalline deposits. Disassemble 
the metal strips, and remove adhering fluid by flushing with water; 
clean each strip by wiping with a clean cloth wetted with ethanol 
(isopropanol when testing DOT 5 fluids). Examine the strips for evidence 
of corrosion and pitting. Disregard staining or discoloration. Place the 
strips in a desiccator containing silica gel or other suitable 
desiccant, maintained at 23 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 deg. C. 
(73.4 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>9 deg. F.), for at least 1 hour. Weigh 
each strip to the nearest 0.1 mg. Determine the change in weight of each 
metal strip. Average the results for the two strips of each type of 
metal. Immediately following the cooling period, remove the cups from 
the jars with forceps. Remove loose adhering sediment by agitation of 
the cups in the mixture. Rinse the cups in ethanol (isopropanol when 
testing DOT 5 fluids) and air-dry. Examine the cups for evidence of 
sloughing, blisters, and other forms of disintegration. Measure the base 
diameter and hardness of each cup within 15 minutes after removal from 
the mixture. Examine the mixture for gelling. Agitate the mixture to 
suspend and uniformly disperse sediment. From each jar, transfer a 100 
ml. portion of the mixture to an ASTM cone-shaped centrifuge tube. 
Determine the percent sediment after centrifuging as described in S7.5. 
Measure the pH value of the corrosion text fluid according to S6.4.6.

    S6.7.3  Procedure. (a) Place 100<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 ml. of brake 
fluid at room temperature in an oil sample bottle. Stopper the bottle 
with an unused cork and place in the cold chamber at the higher storage 
temperature specified in Table II (S5.1.7(c)). After 
144<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>4 hours remove the bottle from the chamber, 
quickly wipe it with a clean, lint-free cloth, saturated with ethanol 
(isopropanol when testing DOT 5 fluids) or acetone. Examine the fluid 
for evidence of sludging, sedimentation, crystallization, or 
stratification. Invert the bottle and determine the number of seconds 
required for the air bubble to travel to the top of the fluid. Let 
sample warm to room temperature and examine.
    (b) Repeat S6.7.3(a), substituting the lower cold chamber 
temperature specified in Table II, and a storage period of 6 hours 
<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>12 minutes.

    Note: Test specimens from either storage temperature may be used for 
the other only after warming up to room temperature.


    S6.8  Evaporation. The evaporation residue, and pour point of the 
evaporation residue of brake fluid, are determined by the following 
procedure. Four replicate samples are run.
    S6.8.1  Summary of the procedure. The volatile diluent portion of a 
brake fluid is evaporated in an oven at 100 deg. C. (212 deg. F.). The 
nonvolatile lubricant portion (evaporation residue) is measured and 
examined for grittiness; the residues are then combined and checked to

    S6.8.3  Procedure. Obtain the tare weight of each of the four 
covered petri dishes to the nearest 0.01 gram. Place 
25<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 ml. of brake fluid in each dish, replace proper 
covers and reweigh. Determine the weight of each brake fluid test 
specimen by the difference. Place the four dishes, each inside its 
inverted cover, in the oven at 100 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 deg. C. 
(212 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>3.6 deg. F.) for 46<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 
hours. (Note: Do not simultaneously heat more than one fluid in the same 
oven.) Remove the dishes from the oven, allow to cool to 
23 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 deg. C. 
(73.4 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>9 deg. F.), and weigh. Return to the oven 
for an additional 24<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 hours. If at the end of 
72<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>4 hours the average loss by evaporation is less 
than 60 percent, discontinue the evaporation procedure and proceed with 
examination of the residue. Otherwise, continue this procedure either 
until equilibrium is reached as evidenced by an incremental weight loss 
of less than 0.25 gram in 24 hours on all individual dishes or for a 
maximum of 7 days. During the heating and weighing operation, if it is 
necessary to remove the dishes from the oven for a period of longer than 
1 hour, the dishes shall be stored in a desiccator as soon as cooled to 
room temperature. Calculate the percentage of fluid evaporated from each 
dish. Examine the residue in the dishes at the end of 1 hour at 
23 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 deg. C. 
(73.4 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>9 deg. F.). Rub any sediment with the 
fingertip to determine grittiness or abrasiveness. Combine the residues 
from all four dishes in a 4-ounce oil sample bottle and store vertically 
in a cold chamber at minus

[[Page 333]]

5 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 deg. C. 
(23 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 deg.F.) for 60<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>10 
minutes. Quickly remove the bottle and place in the horizontal position. 
The residue must flow at least 5 mm. (0.2 inch) along the tube within 5 
seconds.
    S6.8.4  Calculation. The average of the percentage evaporated from 
all four dishes is the loss by evaporation.
    S6.9  Water tolerance. Evaluate the water tolerance characteristics 
of a brake fluid by running one test specimen according to the following 
procedure.
    S6.9.1  Summary of the procedure.
    Brake fluid, except DOT 5 SBBF, is diluted with 3.5 percent water 
(DOT 5 SBBF is humidified), then stored at minus 40  deg.C. (minus 40 
deg.F.) for 120 hours. The cold, water-wet fluid is first examined for 
clarity, stratification, and sedimentation, then placed in an oven at 60 
 deg.C. (140  deg.F.) for 24 hours. On removal, it is again examined for 
stratification, and the volume percent of sediment determined by 
centrifuging.

    (a) At low temperature. Humidify 100<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 ml. of 
DOT 5 SBBF brake fluid in accordance with S6.2 eliminating determination 
of the ERBP. When testing brake fluids except DOT 5 SBBF, mix 
3.5<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.1 ml. of distilled water with 
100<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 ml. of the brake fluid; pour into a centrifuge 
tube. Stopper the tube with a clean cork and place in the cold chamber 
maintained at minus 40<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 deg. C. (minus 
40<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>3.6 deg. F.). After 120 
hours<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 hours remove the tube, quickly wipe with 
clean lint-free cloth saturated with ethanol or acetone and examine the 
fluid for evidence of sludging, sedimentation, crystallization, or 
stratification. Invert the tube and determine the number of seconds 
required for the air bubble to travel to the top of the fluid. (The air 
bubble is considered to have reached the top of the fluid when the top 
of the bubble reaches the 2 ml. graduation of the centrifuge tube.) If 
the wet fluid has become cloudy, warm to 23<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 deg. 
C. (73.4<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>9 deg. F.) and note appearance and 
fluidity.
    (b) At 60 deg. C. (140 deg. F.). Place tube and brake fluid from 
S6.9.3(a) in an oven maintained at 60 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 deg. C. 
(140 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>3.6 deg. F.) for 24<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 
hours. Remove the tube and immediately examine the contents for evidence 
of stratification. Determine the percent sediment by centrifuging as 
described in S7.5.
    S6.10  Compatibility. The compatibility of a brake fluid with other 
brake fluids shall be evaluated by running one test sample according to 
the following procedure.
    S6.10.1  Summary of the procedure.
    Brake fluid is mixed with an equal volume of SAE RM-66-04 
Compatibility Fluid, then tested in the same way as for water tolerance 
(S6.9) except that the bubble flow time is not measured. This test is an 
indication of the compatibility of the test fluid with other motor 
vehicle brake fluids at both high and low temperatures.

oxidative conditions shall be evaluated by running duplicate samples 
according to the following procedure.

[[Page 334]]

    S6.11.1  Summary of procedure.
    Brake fluids, except DOT 5 SBBF, are activated with a mixture of 
approximately 0.2 percent benzoyl peroxide and 5 percent water. DOT 5 
SBBF is humidified in accordance with S6.2 eliminating determination of 
the ERBP, and then approximately 0.2 percent benzoyl peroxide is added. 
A corrosion test strip assembly consisting of cast iron and an aluminum 
strip separated by tinfoil squares at each end is then rested on a piece 
of SBR WC cup positioned so that the test strip is half immersed in the 
fluid and oven aged at 70  deg.C. (158  deg.F.) for 168 hours. At the 
end of this period, the metal strips are examined for pitting. etching, 
and weight loss.
    S6.11.2  Equipment.
    (a) Balance. See S6.6.2(a).
    (b) Desiccators. See S6.6.2(b).
    (c) Oven. See S6.6.2(c).

175 mm. in length.
    S6.11.3  Reagents and materials.
    (a) Benzoyl peroxide, reagent grade, 96 percent. (Benzoyl peroxide 
that is brownish, or dusty, or has less than 90 percent purity, must be 
discarded.) Reagent strength may be evaluated by ASTM E298-68, 
``Standard Methods for Assay of Organic Peroxides.''
    (b) Corrosion test strips. Two sets of cast iron and aluminum metal 
test strips as described in appendix C of SAE Standard J1703b.
    (c) Tinfoil. Four unused pieces of tinfoil approximately 12 mm. (\1/
2\ inch) square and between 0.02 and 0.06 mm. (0.0008 and 0.0024 inch) 
in thickness. The foil shall be at least 99.9 percent tin and contain 
not more than 0.025 percent lead.
    (d) SBR cups. Two unused, approximately one-eighth sections of a 
standard SAE SBR WC cup (as described in S7.6).
    (e) Machine screw and nut. Two clean oil-free, No. 6 or 8-32 x \3/
8\- or \1/2\-inch long (or equivalent metric size), round or fillister 
head, uncoated mild steel machine screws, with matching plain nuts.
    S6.11.4  Preparation.
    (a) Corrosion test strips. Prepare two sets of aluminum and cast 
iron test strips according to S6.6.4(a) except for assembly. Weigh each 
strip to the nearest 0.1 mg. and assemble a strip of each metal on a 
machine screw, separating the strips at each end with a piece of 
tinfoil. Tighten the nut enough to hold both pieces of foil firmly in 
place.
    (b) Test mixture.
    Place 30<plus-minus>1 ml. of the brake fluid under test in a 22 by 
175 mm. test tube. For all fluids except DOT 5 SBBF, add 
0.060<plus-minus>.002 grams of benzoyl peroxide, and 
1.50<plus-minus>0.05 ml. of distilled water. For DOT 5 SBBF, use test 
fluid humidified in accordance with S6.2, and add only the benzoyl 
peroxide. Stopper the tube loosely with a clean dry cork, shake, and 
place in an oven for 2 hours at 70 deg.<plus-minus>2  deg.C. 
(158 deg.<plus-minus>3.6  deg.F.). Shake every 15 minutes to effect 
solution of the peroxide, but do not wet cork. Remove the tube from the 
oven and allow to cool to 23 deg.<plus-minus>5  deg.C. 
(73.4 deg.<plus-minus>9  deg.F.) Begin testing according to paragraph 
S6.11.5 not later than 24 hours after removal of tube from oven.
    S6.11.5  Procedure. Place a one-eighth SBR cup section in the bottom 
of each tube. Add 10 ml. of prepared test mixture to each test tube. 
Place a metal-strip assembly in each, the end of the strip without the 
screw resting on the rubber, and the solution covering about one-half 
the length of the strips. Stopper the tubes with clean dry corks and 
store upright for 70<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 hours at 
23 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 deg. C. 
(73.4 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>9 deg. F.). Loosen the corks and place 
the tubes for 168<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 hours in an oven maintained at 
70 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 deg. C. 
(158 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>3.6 deg. F.). Afterwards remove and 
disassemble strips. Examine the strips and note any gum deposits. Wipe 
the strips with a clean cloth wet with ethanol (isopropanol when testing 
DOT 5 fluids) and note any pitting, etching or roughening of surface 
disregarding stain or discoloration. Place the strips in a desiccator 
over silica gel or other suitable desiccant, at 
23 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 deg. C. 
(73.4 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>9 deg. F.) for at least 1 hour. Again 
weigh each strip to the nearest 0.1 mg.
    S6.11.6  Calculation. Determine corrosion loss by dividing the 
change in weight of each metal strip by the total surface area of each 
strip measured in square centimeters, to the nearest square centimeter. 
Average the results for the two strips of each type of metal, rounding 
to the nearest 0.05 mg. per square centimeter. If only one of the 
duplicates fails for any reason, run a second set of duplicate samples. 
Both

[[Page 335]]

repeat samples shall meet all requirements of S5.1.11.
    S6.12  Effect on SBR cups. The effects of a brake fluid in swelling, 
softening, and otherwise affecting standard SBR WC cups shall be 
evaluated by the following procedure.
    S6.12.1  Summary of the procedure. Four standard SAE SBR WC cups are 
measured and their hardnesses determined. The cups, two to a jar, are 
immersed in the test brake fluid. One jar is heated for 70 hours at 
70 deg. C. (158 deg. F), and the other for 70 hours at 120 deg. C 
(248 deg. F). Afterwards, the cups are washed, examined for 
disintegration, remeasured and their hardnesses redetermined.
    S6.12.2  Equipment and supplies.
    (a) Oven. See S6.6.2(c).
    (b) Glass jars and lids. Two screw-top, straight-sided round glass 
jars, each having a capacity of approximately 250 ml. and inner 
dimensions of approximately 125 mm. in height and 50 mm. in diameter, 
and a tinned steel lid (no insert or organic coating).
    (c) SBR cups. See S7.6.
    S6.12.3  Preparation. Measure the base diameters of the SBR cups as 
described in S6.6.4(b), and the hardness of each as described in S7.4.
    S6.12.4  Procedure. Wash the cups in 90 percent ethanol (isopropanol 
when testing DOT 5 fluids) (see S7.3), for not longer than 30 seconds 
and quickly dry with a clean, lint-free cloth. Using forceps, place two 
cups into each of the two jars; add 75 ml. of brake fluid to each jar 
and cap tightly. Place one jar in an oven held at 
70 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 deg. C. (158<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>3.6 deg. 
F.) for 70<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 hours. Place the other jar in an oven 
held at 120 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 deg. C. 
(248 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>3.6 deg. F.) for 70<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 
hours. Allow each jar to cool for 60 to 90 minutes at 
23 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 deg. C. 
(73.4 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>9 deg. F.). Remove cups, wash with 
ethanol (isopropanol when testing DOT 5 fluids) for not longer than 30 
seconds, and quickly dry. Examine the cups for disintegration as 
evidenced by stickiness, blisters, or sloughing. Measure the base 
diameter and hardness of each cup within 15 minutes after removal from 
the fluid.
    S6.12.5  Calculation. (a) Calculate the change in base diameter for 
each cup. If the two values, at each temperature, do not differ by more 
than 0.10 mm. (0.004 inch) average them to the nearest 0.02 mm. (0.001 
inch). If the two values differ by more than 0.10 mm., repeat the test 
at the appropriate temperature and average the four values as the change 
in base diameter.
    (b) Calculate the change in hardness for each cup. The average of 
the two values for each pair is the change in hardness.
    (c) Note disintegration as evidenced by stickiness, blisters, or 
sloughing.
    S6.13  Stroking properties. Evaluate the lubricating properties, 
component compatibility, resistance to leakage, and related qualities of 
a brake fluid by running one sample according to the following 
procedures.
    S6.13.1  Summary of the procedure. Brake fluid is stroked under 
controlled conditions at an elevated temperature in a simulated motor 
vehicle hydraulic braking system consisting of three slave wheel 
cylinders and an actuating master cylinder connected by steel tubing. 
Referee standard parts are used. All parts are carefully cleaned, 
examined, and certain measurements made immediately prior to assembly 
for test. During the test, temperature, rate of pressure rise, maximum 
pressure, and rate of stroking are specified and controlled. The system 
is examined periodically during stroking to assure that excessive 
leakage of fluid is not occurring. Afterwards, the system is torn down. 
Metal parts and SBR cups are examined and remeasured. The brake fluid 
and any resultant sludge and debris are collected, examined, and tested.
    S6.13.2  Apparatus and equipment.
    Either the drum and shoe type of stroking apparatus (see Figure 1 of 
SAE Standard J1703b) except using only three sets of drum and shoe 
assemblies, or the stroking fixture type apparatus as shown in Figure 2 
of SAE J1703Nov83, with the components arranged as shown in Figure 1 of 
SAE J1703Nov83. The following components are required.
    (a) Brake assemblies. With the drum and shoe apparatus: three drum 
and shoe assembly units (SAE RM-29a) consisting of three forward brake 
shoes and three reverse brake shoes with linings and three front wheel 
brake drum assemblies with assembly component

[[Page 336]]

parts. With stroking fixture type apparatus: three fixture units 
including appropriate adapter mounting plates to hold brake wheel 
cylinder assemblies.
    (b) Braking pressure actuation mechanism. An actuating mechanism for 
applying a force to the master cylinder pushrod without side thrust. The 
amount of force applied by the actuating mechanism shall be adjustable 
and capable of applying sufficient thrust to the master cylinder to 
create a pressure of at least 70 kg./sq. cm. (1,000 p.s.i.) in the 
simulated brake system. A hydraulic gage or pressure recorder, having a 
range of at least 0 to 70 kg./sq. cm. (0 to 1,000 p.s.i.), shall be 
installed between the master cylinder and the brake assemblies and shall 
be provided with a shutoff valve and with a bleeding valve for removing 
air from the connecting tubing. The actuating mechanism shall be 
designed to permit adjustable stroking rates of approximately 1,000 
strokes per hour. Use a mechanical or electrical counter to record the 
total number of strokes.
    (c) Heated air bath cabinet. An insulated cabinet or oven having 
sufficient capacity to house the three mounted brake assemblies or 
stroking fixture assemblies, master cylinder, and necessary connections. 
A thermostatically controlled heating system is required to maintain a 
temperature of 70 deg.<plus-minus>5  deg. C (158 deg.<plus-minus>9  deg. 
F) or 120 deg.<plus-minus>5  deg. C (248 deg.<plus-minus>9  deg. F). 
Heaters shall be shielded to prevent direct radiation to wheel or master 
cylinder.
    (d) Master cylinder (MC) assembly (SAE RM-15a). One cast iron 
housing hydraulic brake system cylinder having a diameter of 
approximately 28 mm. (1\1/8\ inch) and fitted for a filler cap and 
standpipe (see S6.13.2(e)). The MC piston shall be made from SAE CA360 
copperbase alloy (half hard). A new MC assembly is required for each 
test.
    (e) Filler cap and standpipe. MC filler cap provided with a glass or 
uncoated steel standpipe. Standpipe must provide adequate volume for 
thermal expansion, yet permit measurement and adjustment of the fluid 
level in the system to <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>3 ml. Cap and standpipe may 
be cleaned and reused.
    (f) Wheel cylinder (WC) assemblies (SAE RM-14a). Three unused cast 
iron housing straight bore hydraulic brake WC assemblies having 
diameters of approximately 28 mm (1\1/8\ inch) for each test. Pistons 
shall be made from unanodized SAE AA 2024 aluminum alloy.
    (g) Micrometer. Same as S6.6.2(d).
    S6.13.3  Materials.
    (a) Standard SBR brake cups. Six standard SAE SBR wheel cylinder 
test cups, one primary MC test cup, and one secondary MC test cup, all 
as described in S7.6, for each test.
    (b) Steel tubing. Double wall steel tubing meeting SAE specification 
J527. A complete replacement of tubing is essential when visual 
inspection indicates any corrosion or deposits on inner surface of 
tubing. Tubing from master cylinder to one wheel cylinder shall be 
replaced for each test (minimum length 3 feet). Uniformity in tubing 
size is required between master cylinder and wheel cylinder. The 
standard master cylinder has two outlets for tubing, both of which must 
be used.
    S6.13.4  Preparation of test apparatus.
    (a) Wheel cylinder assemblies. Use unused wheel cylinder assemblies. 
Disassemble cylinders and discard cups. Clean all metal parts with 
ethanol (isopropanol when testing DOT 5 fluids). Inspect the working 
surfaces of all metal parts for scoring, galling, or pitting and 
cylinder bore roughness, and discard all defective parts. Remove any 
stains on cylinder walls with crocus cloth and ethanol (isopropanol when 
testing DOT 5 fluids). If stains cannot be removed, discard the 
cylinder. Measure the internal diameter of each cylinder at a location 
approximately 19 mm. (0.75 inch) from each end of the cylinder bore, 
taking measurements in line with the hydraulic inlet opening and at 
right angles to this centerline. Discard the cylinder if any of these 
four readings exceeds the maximum or minimum limits of 28.66 to 28.60 
mm. (1.128 to 1.126 inch). Measure the outside diameter of each piston 
at two points approximately 90 deg. apart. Discard any piston if either 
reading exceeds the maximum or minimum limits of 28.55 to 28.52 mm. 
(1.124 to 1.123 inch). Select parts to insure that the clearance between 
each piston and mating cylinder is within 0.08 to 0.13 mm. (0.003 to 
0.005 inch). Use unused SBR cups. To remove dirt and debris, rinse the 
cups

[[Page 337]]

in 90 percent ethyl alcohol for not more than 30 seconds and wipe dry 
with a clean lint-free cloth. Discard any cups showing defects such as 
cuts, molding flaws, or blisters. Measure the lip and base diameters of 
all cups with an optical comparator or micrometer to the nearest 0.02 
mm. (0.001 inch) along the centerline of the SAE and rubber-type 
identifications and at right angles to this centerline. Determine base 
diameter measurements at least 0.4 mm. (0.015 inch) above the bottom 
edge and parallel to the base of the cup. Discard any cup if the two 
measured lip or base diameters differ by more than 0.08 mm. (0.003 
inch). Average the lip and base diameters of each cup. Determine the 
hardness of all cups according to S7.4. Dip the rubber and metal parts 
of wheel cylinders, except housing and rubber boots, in the fluid to be 
tested and install them in accordance with the manufacturer's 
instructions. Manually stroke the cylinders to insure that they operate 
easily. Install cylinders in the simulated brake system.
    (b) Master cylinder assembly. Use an unused master cylinder and 
unused standard SBR primary and secondary MC cups which have been 
inspected, measured and cleaned in the manner specified in S6.13.4(a), 
omitting hardness of the secondary MC cup. However, prior to determining 
the lip and base diameters of the secondary cup, dip the cup in test 
brake fluid, assemble on the MC piston, and maintain the assembly in a 
vertical position at 23 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 deg. C. 
(73.4 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>9 deg.F.) for at least 12 hours. Inspect 
the relief and supply ports of the master cylinder; discard the cylinder 
if ports have burrs or wire edges. Measure the internal diameter of the 
cylinder at two locations (approximately midway between the relief and 
supply ports and approximately 19 mm. (0.75 inch) beyond the relief port 
toward the bottom or discharge end of the bore), taking measurements at 
each location on the vertical and horizontal centerline of the bore. 
Discard the cylinder if any reading exceeds the maximum or minimum 
limits of 28.65 to 28.57 mm. (1.128 to 1.125 inch). Measure the outside 
diameter of each end of the master cylinder piston at two points 
approximately 90 deg. apart. Discard the piston if any of these four 
readings exceed the maximum or minimum limits of 28.55 to 28.52 mm. 
(1.124 to 1.123 inch). Dip the rubber and metal parts of the master 
cylinder, except the housing and push rod-boot assembly, in the brake 
fluid and install in accordance with manufacturer's instructions. 
Manually stroke the master cylinder to insure that it operates easily. 
Install the master cylinder in the simulated brake system.
    (c) Assembly and adjustment of test apparatus.
    (1) When using a shoe and drum type apparatus, adjust the brake shoe 
toe clearances to 1.0<plus-minus>0.1 mm. (0.040<plus-minus>0.004 inch). 
Fill the system with brake fluid, bleeding all wheel cylinders and the 
pressure gage to remove entrapped air. Operate the actuator manually to 
apply a pressure greater than the required operating pressure and 
inspect the system for leaks. Adjust the actuator and/or pressure relief 
valve to obtain a pressure of 70<plus-minus>3.5 kg./sq. cm. 
(1,000<plus-minus>50 p.s.i.). A smooth pressure-stroke pattern is 
required when using a shoe and drum type apparatus. The pressure is 
relatively low during the first part of the stroke and then builds up 
smoothly to the maximum stroking pressure at the end of the stroke, to 
permit the primary cup to pass the compensating hole at a relatively low 
pressure. Using stroking fixtures, adjust the actuator and/or pressure 
relief valve to obtain a pressure of 70<plus-minus>3.5 kg./sq. cm. 
(1,000<plus-minus>50 p.s.i.).
    (2) Adjust the stroking rate to 1,000<plus-minus>100 strokes per 
hour. Record the fluid level in the master cylinder standpipe.
    S6.13.5  Procedure. Operate the system for 
16,000<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1,000 cycles at 
23 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 deg. C. 
(73.4 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>9 deg. F.). Repair any leakage, readjust 
the brake shoe clearances, and add fluid to the master cylinder 
standpipe to bring to the level originally recorded, if necessary. Start 
the test again and raise the temperature of the cabinet within 
6<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 hours to 120 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 deg. C. 
(248 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>9 deg. F.). During the test observe 
operation of wheel cylinders for improper functioning and record the 
amount of fluid required to replenish any loss, at intervals of 24,000 
strokes. Stop the test at the end of 85,000 total recorded strokes. 
These totals shall include the number of strokes during operation at

[[Page 338]]

23 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 deg. C. 
(73.4 deg.<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>9 deg. F.) and the number of strokes 
required to bring the system to the operating temperature. Allow 
equipment to cool to room temperature. Examine the wheel cylinders for 
leakage. Stroke the assembly an additional 100 strokes, examine wheel 
cylinders for leakage and record volume loss of fluid. Within 16 hours 
after stopping the test, remove the master and wheel cylinders from the 
system, retaining the fluid in the cylinders by immediately capping or 
plugging the ports. Disassemble the cylinders, collecting the fluid from 
the master cylinder and wheel cylinders in a glass jar. When collecting 
the stroked fluid, remove all residue which has deposited on rubber and 
metal internal parts by rinsing and agitating such parts in the stroked 
fluid and using a soft brush to assure that all loose adhering sediment 
is collected. Clean SBR cups in ethanol (isopropanol when testing DOT 5 
fluids) and dry. Inspect the cups for stickiness, scuffing, blistering, 
cracking, chipping, and change in shape from original appearance. Within 
1 hour after disassembly, measure the lip and base diameters of each 
cylinder cup by the procedures specified in S6.13.4 (a) and (b) with the 
exception that lip or base diameters of cups may now differ by more than 
0.08 mm. (0.003 inch). Determine the hardness of each cup according to 
S7.4. Note any sludge or gel present in the test fluid. Within 1 hour 
after draining the cylinders, agitate the fluid in a glass jar to 
suspend and uniformly disperse sediment and transfer a 100 ml. portion 
of this fluid to a centrifuge tube and determine percent sediment as 
described in S7.5. Allow the tube and fluid to stand for 24 hours, 
recentrifuge and record any additional sediment recovered. Inspect 
cylinder parts, note any gumming or any pitting on pistons and cylinder 
walls. Disregard staining or discoloration. Rub any deposits adhering to 
cylinder walls with a clean soft cloth wetted with ethanol (isopropanol 
when testing DOT 5 fluids) to determine abrasiveness and removability. 
Clean cylinder parts in ethanol (isopropanol when testing DOT 5 fluids) 
and dry. Measure and record diameters of pistons and cylinders according 
to S6.13.4(a) and (b). Repeat the test if mechanical failure occurs that 
may affect the evaluation of the brake fluid.
    S6.13.6  Calculation. (a) Calculate the changes in diameters of 
cylinders and pistons (see S5.1.13(b)).
    (b) Calculate the average decrease in hardness of the seven cups 
tested, as well as the individual values (see S5.1.13(c)).
    (c) Calculate the increases in base diameters of the eight cups (see 
S5.1.13(e)).
    (d) Calculate the lip diameter interference set for each of the 
eight cups by the following formula and average the eight values (see 
S5.1.13(f)).

                     [(D<INF>1</INF>-D<INF>2</INF>)/
      (D<INF>1</INF>-D<INF>3</INF>)] x 100=percentage Lip Diameter 
                            Interference Set

where:


D<INF>1</INF>=Original lip diameter.
D<INF>2</INF>=Final lip diameter.
D<INF>3</INF>=Original cylinder bore diameter.

    S6.14 Container information. Each container with information marked 
directly on the container surface or on a label (labels) affixed to the 
container pursuant to S5.2.2.2 or S5.2.2.3 is subjected to the following 
procedure:
    (a) If the container has a label affixed to it, make a single 
vertical cut all the way through the label with the container in the 
vertical position.
    (b) Immerse the container in the same brake fluid or hydraulic 
system mineral oil contained therein for 15 minutes at room temperature 
(23<plus-minus>5  deg.C; 73.4<plus-minus>9  deg.F).
    (c) Within 5 minutes after removing the container from the fluid or 
oil, remove excess liquid from the surface of the container by wiping 
with a clean dry cloth.

Sec. 571.118  Standard No. 118; Power-operated window, partition, and roof panel systems.

    S1. Purpose and scope. This standard specifies requirements for 
power operated window, partition, and roof panel systems to minimize the 
likelihood of death or injury from their accidental operation.
    S2. Application. This standard applies to passenger cars, 
multipurpose passenger vehicles, and trucks with a gross vehicle weight 
rating of 4536 kilograms or less. The standard's requirements for power-
operated roof panel systems need not be met for vehicles manufactured 
before September 1, 1993.
    S3. Definition. ``Power operated roof panel systems'' mean moveable 
panels in the vehicle roof which close by vehicle supplied power either 
by a sliding or hinged motion, and do not include convertible top 
systems.
    S4. Operating requirements. Except as provided in S5, power operated 
window, partition, or roof panel systems may be closed only in the 
following circumstances:
    (a) When the key that controls activation of the vehicle's engine is 
in the ``ON'', ``START'', or ``ACCESSORY'' position;
    (b) By muscular force unassisted by vehicle supplied power;
    (c) Upon continuous activation by a locking system on the exterior 
of the vehicle;
    (d) Upon continuous activation of a remote actuation device, 
provided that the remote actuation device shall be incapable of closing 
the power window, partition or roof panel from a distance of more than 6 
meters from the vehicle;
    (e) During the interval between the time the locking device which 
controls the activation of the vehicle's engine is turned off and the 
opening of either of a two-door vehicle's doors or, in the case of a 
vehicle with more than two doors, the opening of either of its front 
doors;
    (f) If the window, partition, or roof panel is in a static position 
before starting to close and in that position creates an opening so 
small that a 4 mm diameter semi-rigid cylindrical rod cannot be placed 
through the opening at any location around its edge in the manner 
described in S5(b); or
    (g) Upon continuous activation of a remote actuation device, 
provided that the remote actuation device shall be incapable of closing 
the power window, partition or roof panel if the device and the vehicle 
are separated by an opaque surface and provided that the remote 
actuation device shall be incapable of closing the power window, 
partition or roof panel from a distance of more than 11 meters from the 
vehicle.
    S5. (a) Notwithstanding S4, a power operated window, partition or 
roof panel system may close if it meets the following requirements--
    (1) While closing, the window, partition or roof panel system must 
reverse direction before contacting, or before exerting a squeezing 
force of 100 newtons or more on, a semi-rigid cylindrical rod from 4 mm 
to 200 mm in diameter that has the force-deflection ratio described in 
S5(c), and that is placed through the window, partition or roof panel 
system opening at any location, in the manner described in S5(b); and

[[Page 344]]

    (2) Upon such reversal, the window, partition or roof panel system 
must open to one of the following positions, at the manufacturer's 
option:
    (i) A position that is at least as open as the position at the time 
closing was initiated;
    (ii) A position that is not less than 125 millimeters more open than 
the position at the time the window reversed direction; or
    (iii) A position that permits a semi-rigid cylindrical rod that is 
200 mm in diameter to be placed through the opening at the same contact 
point(s) as the rod described in S5(a)(1).
    (b) The test rod is placed through the window, partition or roof 
panel opening from the inside of the vehicle such that the cylindrical 
surface of the rod contacts any part of the structure with which the 
window, partition or roof panel mates. Typical placements of test rods 
are illustrated in Figure 1.
    (c) The force-deflection ratio of the test rod is at least 65 N/mm 
for a rod 25 mm or smaller in diameter, and at least 20 N/mm for a rod 
larger than 25 mm in diameter.

    S6. Requirements. Each tire shall be capable of meeting any of the 
applicable requirements set forth below, when mounted on a model rim 
assembly corresponding to any rim designated by the tire manufacturer 
for use with the tire in accordance with S5. However, a particular tire 
need not meet further requirements after having been subjected to and 
met the endurance test (S6.1), strength test (S6.2), or high speed 
performance test (S6.3).
    S6.1  Endurance.
    S6.1.1  Prior to testing in accordance with the procedures of S7.2, 
a tire shall exhibit no visual evidence of tread, sidewall, ply, cord, 
innerliner, or bead separation, chunking, broken cords, cracking, or 
open splices.
    S6.1.2  When tested in accordance with the procedures of S7.2:
    (a) There shall be no visual evidence of tread, sidewall, ply, cord, 
innerliner, or bead separation, chunking, broken cords, cracking, or

[[Page 347]]

    (b) The tire pressure at the end of the test shall be not less than 
the initial pressure specified in S7.2(a).
    S6.2  Strength. When tested in accordance with the procedures of 
S7.3 a tire's average breaking energy value shall be not less than the 
value specified in Table II for that tire's size and load range.
    S6.3  High speed performance. When tested in accordance with the 
procedures of S7.4, a tire shall meet the requirements set forth in 
S6.1.1 and S6.1.2 (a) and (b). However, this requirement applies only to 
motorcycle tires and to non-speed-restricted tires of 14.5-in nominal 
rim diameter or less marked load range A, B, C, or D.
    S6.4  Treadwear indicators. Except as specified below, each tire 
shall have at least six treadwear indicators spaced approximately 
equally around the circumference of the tire that enable a person 
inspecting the tire to determine visually whether the tire has worn to a 
tread depth of one-sixteenth of an inch. Tires with 12-inch or smaller 
rim diameter shall have at least three such treadwear indicators. 
Motorcycle tires shall have at least three such indicators which permit 
visual determination that the tire has worn to a tread depth of one-
thirty-second of an inch.
    S6.5  Tire markings. Except as specified below, each tire shall be 
marked on each sidewall with the information specified in paragraphs (a) 
through (j) of this section. The markings shall be placed between the 
maximum section width (exclusive of sidewall decorations or curb ribs) 
and the bead on at least one sidewall, unless the maximum section width 
of the tire is located in an area which is not more than one-fourth of 
the distance from the bead to the shoulder of the tire. If the maximum 
section width falls within that area, the markings shall appear between 
the bead and a point one-half the distance from the bead to the shoulder 
of the tire, on at least one sidewall. The markings shall be in letters 
and numerals not less than 0.078 inch high and raised above or sunk 
below the tire surface not less than 0.015 inch, except that the marking 
depth shall be not less than 0.010 inch in the case of motorcycle tires.

tire conforms to applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. This 
symbol may be marked on only one sidewall.
    (b) The tire identification number required by part 574 of this 
chapter. This number may be marked on only one sidewall.
    (c) The tire size designation as listed in the documents and 
publications designated in S5.1.
    (d) The maximum load rating and corresponding inflation pressure of 
the tire, shown as follows:

    (Mark on tires rated for single and dual load):
Max load single ______ lbs at ______ psi cold.
Max load dual ______ lbs at ______ psi cold.
    (Mark on tires rated only for single load:)
Max load ______ lbs at ______ psi cold.

    (e) The speed restriction of the tire, if 55 mi/h or less, shown as 
follows:

Max speed ______ mph.

    (f) The actual number of plies and the composition of the ply cord 
material in the sidewall and, if different, in the tread area;
    (g) The words ``tubeless'' or ``tube type'' as applicable.
    (h) The word ``regroovable'' if the tire is designed for regrooving.
    (i) The word ``radial'' if a radial tire.
    (j) The letter designating the tire load range.
    S6.6  Maximum load rating. If the maximum load rating for a 
particular tire size is shown in one or more of the publications 
described in S5.1(b), each tire of that size designation shall have a 
maximum load rating that is not less than the published maximum load 
rating, or if there are differing published ratings for the same tire 
size designation, not less than the lowest published maximum load rating 
for the size designation.
    S7. Test procedures.
    S7.1  General conditions.
    S7.1.1  The tests are performed using an appropriate new tube, tube 
valve

[[Page 348]]

and flap assembly (as required) that allows no loss of air for testing 
of tube-type tires under S7.2, S7.3, and S7.4, and tubeless tires under 
S7.3.
    S7.1.2  The tire must be capable of meeting the requirements of S7.2 
and S7.4 when conditioned to a temperature of 95 deg. F for 3 hours 
before the test is conducted, and with an ambient temperature maintained 
at 95 deg. F during all phases of testing. The tire must be capable of 
meeting the requirements of S7.3 when conditioned at a temperature of 
70 deg. F for 3 hours before the test is conducted.
    S7.2  Endurance. (a) Mount the tire on a model rim assembly and 
inflate it to the inflation pressure corresponding to the maximum load 
rating marked on the tire. Use a single maximum load value when the tire 
is marked with both single and dual maximum load.
    (b) After conditioning the tire-rim assembly in accordance with 
S7.1.2, adjust the tire pressure to that specified in (a) immediately 
before mounting the tire rim assembly.
    (c) Mount the tire-rim assembly on an axle and press it against a 
flat-faced steel test wheel that is 67.23 inches in diameter and at 
least as wide as the tread of the tire.
    (d) Apply the test load and rotate the test wheel as indicated in 
Table III for the type of tire tested conducting each successive phase 
of the test without interruption.
    (e) Immediately after running the tire the required time, measure 
the tire inflation pressure. Remove the tire from the model rim 
assembly, and inspect the tire.
    S7.3  Strength. (a) Mount the tire on a model rim assembly and 
inflate it to the pressure corresponding to the maximum load, or maximum 
dual load where there is both a single and dual load marked on the tire. 
If the tire is tubeless, a tube may be inserted to prevent loss of air 
during the test in the event of puncture.
    (b) After conditioning the tire-rim assembly in accordance with 
S7.1.2, adjust the tire pressure to that specified in (a).
    (c) Force a cylindrical steel plunger, with a hemispherical end and 
of the diameter specified in Table I for the tire size, perpendicularly 
into a raised tread element as near as possible to the centerline of the 
tread, at a rate of 2 inches per minute, until the tire breaks or the 
plunger is stopped by the rim.
    (d) Record the force and the distance of penetration just before the 
tire breaks, or if it fails to break, just before the plunger is stopped 
by the rim.
    (e) Repeat the plunger application at 72 deg. intervals around the 
circumference of the tire, until five measurements are made. However, in 
the case of tires of 12-in rim diameter or less, repeat the plunger 
application at 120 deg. intervals around the circumference of the tire, 
until three measurements are made.
    (f) Compute the breaking energy for each test point by the following 
formula:

                                W=(FP/2)

where:

W=Breaking energy,
F=Force in pounds, and
P=Penetration in inches.

    (g) Determine the average breaking energy value for the tire by 
computing the average of the values obtained in accordance with 
paragraph (f).
    S7.4  High speed performance. (a) Perform steps (a) through (c) of 
S7.2.
    (b) Apply a force of 88 percent of the maximum load rating marked on 
the tire (use single maximum load value when the tire is marked with 
both single and dual maximum loads), and rotate the test wheel at 250 
rpm for 2 hours.
    (c) Remove the load, allow the tire to cool to 95 deg. F., and then 
adjust the pressure to that marked on the tire for single tire use.
    (d) Reapply the same load, and without interruption or readjustment 
of inflation pressure, rotate the test wheel at 375 rpm for 30 minutes, 
then at 400 rpm for 30 minutes, and then at 425 rpm for 30 minutes.
    (e) Immediately after running the tire the required time, measure 
the tire inflation pressure. Remove the tire from the model rim 
assembly, and inspect the tire.

Sec. 571.120  Standard No. 120; Tire selection and rims for motor vehicles other than passenger cars.

    S1. Scope. This standard specifies tire and rim selection 
requirements and rim marking requirements.
    S2. Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to provide safe 
operational performance by ensuring that vehicles to which it applies 
are equipped with tires of adequate size and load rating and with rims 
of appropriate size and type designation.
    S3. Application. This standard applies to multipurpose passenger 
vehicles, trucks, buses, trailers, and motorcycles, to rims for use on 
those vehicles, and to non-pneumatic spare tire assemblies for use on 
those vehicles.
    S4. Definitions. All terms defined in the Act and the rules and 
standards issued under its authority are used as defined therein.
    Rim base means the portion of a rim remaining after removal of all 
split or continuous rim flanges, side rings, and locking rings that can 
be detached from the rim.
    Rim size designation means rim diameter and width.
    Rim diameter means nominal diameter of the bead seat.
    Rim width means nominal distance between rim flanges.
    Rim type designation means the industry or manufacturer's 
designation for a rim by style or code.
    Weather side means the surface area of the rim not covered by the 
inflated tire.
    S5. Requirements.
    S5.1  Tire and rim selection.
    S5.1.1  Except as specified in S5.1.3, each vehicle equipped with 
pneumatic tires for highway service shall be equipped with tires that 
meet the requirements of Sec. 571.109, New pneumatic tires, or 
Sec. 571.119, New pneumatic tires for vehicles other than passenger 
cars, and rims that are listed by the manufacturer of the tires as 
suitable for use with those tires, in accordance with S4.4 of 
Sec. 571.109 or S5.1 of Sec. 571.119, as applicable, except that 
vehicles may be equipped with a non-pneumatic spare tire assembly that 
meets the requirements of Sec. 571.129, New non-pneumatic tires for 
passenger cars, and S8 of this standard. Vehicles equipped with such an 
assembly shall meet the requirements of S5.3.3, S7, and S9 of this 
standard.
    S5.1.2  Except in the case of a vehicle which has a speed attainable 
in 3.2 kilometers of 80 kilometers per hour or less, the sum of the 
maximum load ratings of the tires fitted to an axle shall be not less 
than the gross axle weight rating (GAWR) of the axle system as specified 
on the vehicle's certification label required by 49 CFR part 567. Except 
in the case of a vehicle which has a speed attainable in 2 miles of 50 
mph or less, the sum of the maximum load ratings of the tires fitted to 
an axle shall be not less than the gross axle weight rating (GAWR) of 
the axle system as specified on the vehicle's certification label 
required by 49 CFR part 567. If the certification label shows more than 
one GAWR for the axle system, the sum shall be not less than the GAWR 
corresponding to the size designation of the tires fitted to the axle. 
If the size designation of the tires fitted to the axle does not appear 
on the certification label, the sum shall be not less than the lowest 
GAWR appearing on the label. When a tire subject to FMVSS No. 109 is 
installed on a multipurpose passenger vehicle, truck, bus, or trailer, 
the tire's load rating shall be reduced by dividing by 1.10 before 
calculating the sum (i.e., the sum of the load ratings of the tires on 
each axle, when the tires' load carrying capacity at the recommended 
tire cold inflation pressure is reduced by dividing by 1.10, must be 
appropriate for the GAWR).
    S5.1.3  In place of tires that meet the requirements of Standard No. 
119, a truck, bus, or trailer may at the request of a purchaser be 
equipped at the place of manufacture of the vehicle with retreaded or 
used tires owned or leased by the purchaser, if the sum of the maximum 
load ratings meets the requirements of S5.1.2. Used tires employed under 
this provision must have been originally manufactured to comply with 
Standard No. 119, as evidenced by the DOT symbol.
    S5.2  Rim marking. Each rim or, at the option of the manufacturer in 
the case of a single-piece wheel, wheel disc shall be marked with the 
information listed in paragraphs (a) through (e) of

[[Page 351]]

this paragraph, in lettering not less than 3 millimeters high, impressed 
to a depth or, at the option of the manufacturer, embossed to a height 
of not less than 0.125 millimeters. The information listed in paragraphs 
(a) through (c) of this paragraph shall appear on the weather side. In 
the case of rims of multi piece construction, the information listed in 
paragraphs (a) through (e) of this paragraph shall appear on the rim 
base and the information listed in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this 
paragraph shall also appear on each other part of the rim.
    (a) A designation which indicates the source of the rim's published 
nominal dimensions, as follows:

brakes.
    Antilock brake system or ABS means a portion of a service brake 
system that automatically controls the degree of rotational wheel slip 
during braking by:
    (1) Sensing the rate of angular rotation of the wheels;
    (2) Transmitting signals regarding the rate of wheel angular 
rotation to one or more controlling devices which

[[Page 354]]

interpret those signals and generate responsive controlling output 
signals; and
    (3) Transmitting those controlling signals to one or more modulators 
which adjust brake actuating forces in response to those signals.

shipping containers, so that when the chassis and container are 
assembled, the units serve the same function as an over the road 
trailer.
    Directly controlled wheel means a wheel for which the degree of 
rotational wheel slip is sensed, either at that wheel or on the axle 
shaft for that wheel and corresponding signals are transmitted to one or 
more modulators that adjust the brake actuating forces at that wheel. 
Each modulator may also adjust the brake actuating forces at other 
wheels that are on the same axle or in the same axle set in response to 
the same signal or signals.

of the vehicle frame; or
    (2) Its body consists only of a platform whose primary cargo-
carrying surface is not more than 40 inches above the ground in an 
unloaded condition, except that it may include sides that are designed 
to be easily removable and a permanent ``front end structure'' as that 
term is used in Sec. 393.106 of this title.
    Independently controlled wheel means a directly controlled wheel for 
which the modulator does not adjust the brake actuating forces at any 
other wheel on the same axle.
    Indirectly controlled wheel means a wheel at which the degree of 
rotational wheel slip is not sensed, but at which the modulator of an 
antilock braking system adjusts its brake actuating forces in response 
to signals from one or more sensed wheel(s).
    Initial brake temperature means the average temperature of the 
service brakes on the hottest axle of the vehicle 0.2 mile before any 
brake application in the case of road tests, or 18 seconds before any 
brake application in the case of dynamometer testing.
    Intermodal shipping container means a reusable, transportable 
enclosure that is especially designed with integral locking devices for 
securing the container to the trailer to facilitate the efficient and 
bulk shipping and transfer of goods by, or between various modes of 
transport, such as highway, rail, sea and air.
    Load divider dolly means a trailer composed of a trailer chassis and

exerted by the brakes on each vehicle designed to be towed by another 
vehicle equipped with air brakes shall be such that the quotient sum of 
the brake retardation forces / sum of GAWR's relative to brake chamber

temperature between 125 deg.F. and 200 deg.F., conduct a stop from 50 
m.p.h., maintaining brake chamber air pressure at a constant 20 psi. 
Measure the average torque exerted by the brake from the time the 
specified air pressure is reached until the brake stops and divide by 
the static loaded tire radius specified by the tire manufacturer to 
determine the retardation force. Repeat the procedure six times, 
increasing the brake chamber air pressure by 10 psi each time. After 
each stop, rotate the brake drum or disc until the temperature of the 
brake falls to between 125 deg.F. And 200 deg.F.
    S5.4.2  Brake power. When mounted on an inertia dynamometer, each

from 20 m.p.h. at an average deceleration rate of 14 f.p.s.p.s. 1 minute 
after the 10th deceleration. The series of decelerations shall be 
conducted as follows:
    S5.4.2.1  With an initial brake temperature between 150 deg.F. and 
200 deg.F. for the first brake application, and the drum or disc 
rotating at a speed equivalent to 50 m.p.h., apply the brake and 
decelerate at an average deceleration rate of 9 f.p.s.p.s. to 15 m.p.h. 
Upon reaching 15 m.p.h., accelerate to 50 m.p.h. and apply the brake for 
a second time 72 seconds after the start of the first application. 
Repeat the cycle until 10 decelerations have been made. The service line 
air pressure shall not exceed 100 psi during any deceleration.
    S5.4.2.2  One minute after the end of the last deceleration required 
by S5.4.2.1 and with the drum or disc rotating at a speed of 20 m.p.h., 
decelerate to a stop at an average deceleration rate of 14 f.p.s.p.s.
    S5.4.3  Brake recovery. Except as provided in S5.4.3(a) and (b), 
starting two minutes after completing the tests required by S5.4.2, a 
vehicle's brake shall be capable of making 20 consecutive stops from 30 
mph at an average deceleration rate of 12 f.p.s.p.s., at equal intervals 
of one minute measured from the start of each brake application. The 
service line air pressure needed to attain a rate of 12 f.p.s.p.s. shall 
be not more than 85 lb/in\2\, and not less than 20lb/in<SUP>2</SUP> for 
a brake not subject to the control of an antilock system, or 12 lb/
in<SUP>2</SUP> for a brake subject to the control of an antilock system.
    (a) Notwithstanding S5.4.3, neither front axle brake of a truck-
tractor is subject to the requirements set forth in S5.4.3.
    (b) Notwithstanding S5.4.3, neither front axle brake of a bus or a 
truck

[[Page 362]]

other than a truck-tractor is subject to the requirement set forth in 
S5.4.3 prohibiting the service line air pressure from being less than 20 
lb/in<SUP>2</SUP> for a brake not subject to the control of an antilock 
system or 12 lb/in<SUP>2</SUP> for a brake subject to the control of an 
antilock system.

    S5.5.1  Antilock system malfunction. On a truck tractor manufactured 
on or after March 1, 1997, that is equipped with an antilock brake 
system and a single unit vehicle manufactured on or after March 1, 1998, 
that is equipped with an antilock brake system, a malfunction that 
affects the generation or transmission of response or control signals of 
any part of the antilock system shall not increase the actuation and 
release times of the service brakes.
    S5.5.2  Antilock system power--trailers. On a trailer (including a 
trailer converter dolly) manufactured on or after March 1, 1998, that is 
equipped with an antilock system that requires electrical power for 
operation, the power shall be obtained from the towing vehicle through 
one or more electrical circuits which provide continuous power whenever 
the powered vehicle's ignition (start) switch is in the ``on'' (``run'') 
position. The antilock system shall automatically receive power from the 
stoplamp circuit, if the primary circuit or circuits are not 
functioning. Each trailer (including a trailer converter dolly) 
manufactured on or after March 1, 1998, that is equipped to tow another 
air-braked vehicle shall be equipped with one or more circuits which 
provide continuous power to the antilock system on the vehicle(s) it 
tows. Such circuits shall be adequate to enable the antilock system on 
each towed vehicle to be fully operable.
    S5.6  Parking brakes.
    (a) Except as provided in S5.6(b) and S5.6(c), each vehicle other 
than a trailer converter dolly shall have a parking brake system that 
under the conditions of S6.1 meets the requirements of:
    (1) S5.6.1 or S5.6.2, at the manufacturer's option, and
    (2) S5.6.3, S5.6.4, S5.6.5, and S5.6.6.
    (b) At the option of the manufacturer, for vehicles equipped with 
brake systems which incorporate a common diaphragm, the performance 
requirements specified in S5.6(a) which must be met with any single 
leakage-type failure in a common diaphragm may instead be met with the 
level of leakage-type failure determined in S5.6.7. The election of this 
option does not affect the performance requirements specified in S5.6(a) 
which apply with single leakage-type failures other than failures in a 
common diaphragm.
    (c) At the option of the manufacturer, the trailer portion of any 
agricultural commodity trailer, heavy hauler trailer, or pulpwood 
trailer may meet the requirements of Sec. 393.43 of this title instead 
of the requirements of S5.6(a).
    S5.6.1  Static retardation force. With all other brakes made 
inoperative, during a static drawbar pull in a forward or rearward 
direction, the static retardation force produced by the application of 
the parking brakes shall be:
    (a) In the case of a vehicle other than a truck-tractor that is 
equipped with more than two axles, such that the quotient static 
retardation force/GAWR is not less than 0.28 for any axle other than a 
steerable front axle; and
    (b) In the case of a truck-tractor that is equipped with more than 
two axles, such that the quotient static retardation force/GVWR is not 
less than 0.14.
    S5.6.2  Grade holding. With all parking brakes applied, the vehicle 
shall remain stationary facing uphill and facing downhill on a smooth, 
dry portland cement concrete roadway with a 20-percent grade, both
    (a) When loaded to its GVWR, and
    (b) At its unloaded vehicle weight plus 500 pounds (including driver 
and instrumentation).
    S5.6.3  Application and holding. Each parking brake system shall 
meet the requirements of S5.6.3.1 through S5.6.3.4.
    S5.6.3.1  The parking brake system shall be capable of achieving the 
minimum performance specified either in S5.6.1 or S5.6.2 with any single 
leakage-type failure, in any other brake system, of a part designed to 
contain compressed air or brake fluid (excluding failure of a component 
of a brake chamber housing but including failure of any brake chamber 
diaphragm that is part of any other brake system including a diaphragm 
which is common

[[Page 363]]

to the parking brake system and any other brake system), when the 
pressures in the vehicle's parking brake chambers are at the levels 
determined in S5.6.3.4.
    S5.6.3.2  A mechanical means shall be provided that, after a parking 
brake application is made with the pressures in the vehicle's parking 
brake chambers at the levels determined in S5.6.3.4, and all air and 
fluid pressures in the vehicle's braking systems are then bled down to 
zero, and without using electrical power, holds the parking brake 
application with sufficient parking retardation force to meet the 
minimum performance specified in S5.6.3.1 and in either S5.6.1 or 
S5.6.2.
    S5.6.3.3  For trucks and buses, with an initial reservoir system 
pressure of 100 psi and, if designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air 
brakes, with a 50 cubic inch test reservoir connected to the supply line 
coupling, no later than three seconds from the time of actuation of the 
parking brake control, the mechanical means referred to in S5.6.3.2 
shall be actuated. For trailers, with the supply line initially 
pressurized to 100 psi using the supply line portion of the trailer test 
rig (Figure 1) and, if designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air 
brakes, with a 50 cubic inch test reservoir connected to the rear supply 
line coupling, no later than three seconds from the time venting to the 
atmosphere of the front supply line coupling is initiated, the 
mechanical means referred to in S5.6.3.2 shall be actuated. This 
requirement shall be met for trucks, buses and trailers both with and 
without any single leakage-type failure, in any other brake system, of a 
part designed to contain compressed air or brake fluid (consistent with 
the parenthetical phrase specified in S5.6.3.1).
    S5.6.3.4  The parking brake chamber pressures for S5.6.3.1 and 
S5.6.3.2 are determined as follows. For trucks and buses, with an 
initial reservoir system pressure of 100 psi and, if designed to tow a 
vehicle equipped with air brakes, with a 50 cubic inch test reservoir 
connected to the supply line coupling, any single leakage type failure, 
in any other brake system, of a part designed to contain compressed air 
or brake fluid (consistent with the parenthetical phrase specified in 
S5.6.3.1), is introduced in the brake system. The parking brake control 
is actuated and the pressures in the vehicle's parking brake chambers 
are measured three seconds after that actuation is initiated. For 
trailers, with the supply line initially pressurized to 100 psi using 
the supply line portion of the trailer test rig (Figure 1) and, if 
designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, with a 50 cubic inch 
test reservoir connected to the rear supply line coupling, any single 
leakage type failure, in any other brake system, of a part designed to 
contain compressed air or brake fluid (consistent with the parenthetical 
phrase specified in S5.6.3.1), is introduced in the brake system. The 
front supply line coupling is vented to the atmosphere and the pressures 
in the vehicle's parking brake chambers are measured three seconds after 
that venting is initiated.
    S5.6.4  Parking brake control--trucks and buses. The parking brake 
control shall be separate from the service brake control. It shall be 
operable by a person seated in the normal driving position. The control 
shall be identified in a manner that specifies the method of control 
operation. The parking brake control shall control the parking brakes of 
the vehicle and of any air braked vehicle that it is designed to tow.
    S5.6.5  Release Performance. Each parking brake system shall meet 
the requirements specified in S5.6.5.1 through S5.6.5.4.
    S5.6.5.1  For trucks and buses, with initial conditions as specified 
in S5.6.5.2, at all times after an application actuation of the parking 
brake control, and with any subsequent level of pressure, or combination 
of levels of pressure, in the reservoirs of any of the vehicle's brake 
systems, no reduction in parking brake retardation force shall result 
from a release actuation of the parking brake control unless the parking 
brakes are capable, after such release, of being reapplied at a level 
meeting the minimum performance specified either in S5.6.1 or S5.6.2. 
This requirement shall be met both with and without the engine on, and 
with and without single leakage-type failure, in any other brake system, 
of a

[[Page 364]]

part designed to contain compressed air or brake fluid (consistent with 
the parenthetical phrase specified in S5.6.3.1).
    S5.6.5.2  The initial conditions for S5.6.5.1 are as follows: The 
reservoir system pressure is 100 psi. If the vehicle is designed to tow 
a vehicle equipped with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch test reservoir is 
connected to the supply line coupling.
    S5.6.5.3  For trailers, with initial conditions as specified in 
S5.6.5.4, at all times after actuation of the parking brakes by venting 
the front supply line coupling to the atmosphere, and with any 
subsequent level of pressure, or combination of levels of pressure, in 
the reservoirs of any of the vehicle's brake systems, the parking brakes 
shall not be releasable by repressurizing the supply line using the 
supply line portion of the trailer test rig (Figure 1) to any pressure 
above 70 psi, unless the parking brakes are capable, after such release, 
of reapplication by subsequent venting of the front supply line coupling 
to the atmosphere, at a level meeting the minimum performance specified 
either in S5.6.1 or S5.6.2. This requirement shall be met both with and 
without any single leakage-type failure, in any other brake system, of a 
part designed to contain compressed air or brake fluid (consistent with 
the parenthetical phrase specified in S5.6.3.1).
    S5.6.5.4  The initial conditions for S5.6.5.3 are as follows: The 
reservoir system and supply line are pressurized to 100 psi, using the 
supply line portion of the trailer test rig (Figure 1). If the vehicle 
is designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch 
test reservoir is connected to the rear supply line coupling.
    S5.6.6  Accumulation of actuation energy. Each parking brake system 
shall meet the requirements specified in S5.6.6.1 through S5.6.6.6.
    S5.6.6.1  For trucks and buses, with initial conditions as specified 
in S5.6.6.2, the parking brake system shall be capable of meeting the 
minimum performance specified either in S5.6.1 or S5.6.2, with any 
single leakage-type failure, in any other brake system, of a part 
designed to contain compressed air or brake fluid (consistent with the 
parenthetical phrase specified in S5.6.3.1) at the conclusion of the 
test sequence specified in S5.6.6.3.
    S5.6.6.2  The initial conditions for S5.6.6.1 are as follows: The 
engine is on. The reservoir system pressure is 100 psi. If the vehicle 
is designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch 
test reservoir is connected to the supply line coupling.
    S5.6.6.3  The test sequence for S5.6.6.1 is as follows: The engine 
is turned off. Any single leakage type failure, in any other brake 
system, of a part designed to contain compressed air or brake fluid 
(consistent with the parenthetical phrase specified in S5.6.3.1), is 
then introduced in the brake system. An application actuation of the 
parking brake control is then made. Thirty seconds after such actuation, 
a release actuation of the parking brake control is made. Thirty seconds 
after the release actuation, a final application actuation of the 
parking brake control is made.
    S5.6.6.4  For trailers, with initial conditions as specified in 
S5.6.6.5, the parking brake system shall be capable of meeting the 
minimum performance specified either in S5.6.1 or S5.6.2, with any 
single leakage-type failure, in any other brake system, of a part 
designed to contain compressed air or brake fluid (consistent with the 
parenthetical phrase specified in S5.6.3.1), at the conclusion of the 
test sequence specified in S5.6.6.6.
    S5.6.6.5  The initial conditions for S5.6.6.4 are as follows: The 
reservoir system and supply line are pressurized to 100 psi, using the 
supply line portion of the trailer test rig (Figure 1). If the vehicle 
is designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch 
test reservoir is connected to the rear supply line coupling.
    S5.6.6.6  The test sequence for S5.6.6.4 is as follows. Any single 
leakage type failure, in any other brake system, of a part designed to 
contain compressed air or brake fluid (consistent with the parenthetical 
phrase specified in S5.6.3.1), is introduced in the brake system. The 
front supply line coupling is vented to the atmosphere. Thirty seconds 
after the initiation of such venting, the supply line is repressurized 
with the trailer test rig

[[Page 365]]

(Figure 1). Thirty seconds after the initiation of such repressurizing 
of the supply line, the front supply line is vented to the atmosphere. 
This procedure is conducted either by connection and disconnection of 
the supply line coupling or by use of a valve installed in the supply 
line portion of the trailer test rig near the supply line coupling.
    S5.6.7  Maximum level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure/ 
Equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that 
diaphragm.
    In the case of vehicles for which the option in S5.6(b) has been 
elected, determine the maximum level of common diaphragm leakage-type 
failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing 
that diaphragm) according to the procedures set forth in S5.6.7.1 
through S5.6.7.2.3.
    S5.6.7.1  Trucks and buses.
    S5.6.7.1.1  According to the following procedure, determine the 
threshold level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent 
level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) at 
which the vehicle's parking brakes become unreleasable. With an initial 
reservoir system pressure of 100 psi, the engine turned off, no 
application of any of the vehicle's brakes, and, if the vehicle is 
designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch test 
reservoir connected to the supply line coupling, introduce a leakage-
type failure of the common diaphragm (or equivalent leakage from the air 
chamber containing that diaphragm). Apply the parking brakes by making 
an application actuation of the parking brake control. Reduce the 
pressures in all of the vehicle's reservoirs to zero, turn on the engine 
and allow it to idle, and allow the pressures in the vehicle's 
reservoirs to rise until they stabilize or until the compressor shut-off 
point is reached. At that time, make a release actuation of the parking 
brake control, and determine whether all of the mechanical means 
referred to in S5.6.3.2 continue to be actuated and hold the parking 
brake applications with sufficient parking retardation force to meet the 
minimum performance specified in either S5.6.1 or S5.6.2. Repeat this 
procedure with progressively decreasing or increasing levels (whichever 
is applicable) of leakage-type diaphragm failures or equivalent 
leakages, to determine the minimum level of common diaphragm leakage-
type failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber 
containing that diaphragm) at which all of the mechanical means referred 
to in S5.6.3.2 continue to be actuated and hold the parking brake 
applications with sufficient parking retardation forces to meet the 
minimum performance specified in either S5.6.1 or S5.6.2.
    S5.6.7.1.2  At the level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure 
(or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that 
diaphragm) determined in S5.6.7.1.1, and using the following procedure, 
determine the threshold maximum reservoir rate (in psi per minute). With 
an initial reservoir system pressure of 100 psi, the engine turned off, 
no application of any of the vehicle's brakes and, if the vehicle is 
designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch test 
reservoir connected to the supply line coupling, make an application 
actuation of the parking brake control. Determine the maximum reservoir 
leakage rate (in psi per minute), which is the maximum rate of decrease 
in air pressure of any of the vehicle's reservoirs that results after 
that parking brake application.
    S5.6.7.1.3  Using the following procedure, introduce a leakage-type 
failure of the common diaphragm (or equivalent leakage from the air 
chamber containing that diaphragm) that results in a maximum reservoir 
leakage rate that is three times the threshold maximum reservoir leakage 
rate determined in S5.6.7.1.2. With an initial reservoir system pressure 
of 100 psi, the engine turned off, no application of any of the 
vehicle's brakes and, if the vehicle is designed to tow a vehicle 
equipped with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch test reservoir connected to 
the supply line coupling, make an application actuation of the parking 
brake control. Determine the maximum reservoir leakage rate (in psi per 
minute), which is the maximum rate of decrease in air pressure of any of 
the vehicle's reservoirs that results after that parking brake 
application. The level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure

[[Page 366]]

(or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that 
diaphragm) associated with this reservoir leakage rate is the level that 
is to be used under the option set forth in S5.6(b).
    S5.6.7.2  Trailers.
    S5.6.7.2.1  According to the following procedure, determine the 
threshold level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent 
level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) at 
which the vehicle's parking brakes become unreleasable. With an initial 
reservoir system and supply line pressure of 100 psi, no application of 
any of the vehicle's brakes, and, if the vehicle is designed to tow a 
vehicle equipped with air brakes, a 50 cubic inch test reservoir 
connected to the supply line coupling, introduce a leakage-type failure 
of the common diaphragm (or equivalent leakage from the air chamber 
containing that diaphragm). Make a parking brake application by venting 
the front supply line coupling to the atmosphere, and reduce the 
pressures in all of the vehicle's reservoirs to zero. Pressurize the 
supply line by connecting the trailer's front supply line coupling to 
the supply line portion of the trailer test rig (Figure 1) with the 
regulator of the trailer test rig set at 100 psi, and determine whether 
all of the mechanical means referred to in S5.6.3.2 continue to be 
actuated and hold the parking brake applications with sufficient parking 
retardation forces to meet the minimum performance specified in either 
S5.6.1 or S5.6.2. Repeat this procedure with progressively decreasing or 
increasing levels (whichever is applicable) of leakage-type diaphragm 
failures or equivalent leakages, to determine the minimum level of 
common diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent level of leakage 
from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) at which all of the 
mechanical means referred to in S5.6.3.2 continue to be actuated and 
hold the parking brake applications with sufficient parking retardation 
forces to meet the minimum performance specified in either S5.6.1 or 
S5.6.2.
    S5.6.7.2.2  At the level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure 
(or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that 
diaphragm) determined in S5.6.7.2.1, and using the following procedure, 
determine the threshold maximum reservoir leakage rate (in psi per 
minute). With an initial reservoir system and supply line pressure of 
100 psi, no application of any of the vehicle's brakes and, if the 
vehicle is designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, a 50 
cubic inch test reservoir connected to the rear supply line coupling, 
make a parking brake application by venting the front supply line 
coupling to the atmosphere. Determine the maximum reservoir leakage rate 
(in psi per minute), which is the maximum rate of decrease in air 
pressure of any of the vehicle's reservoirs that results after that 
parking brake application.
    S5.6.7.2.3  Using the following procedure, a leakage-type failure of 
the common diaphragm (or equivalent leakage from the air chamber 
containing that diaphragm) that results in a maximum reservoir leakage 
rate that is three times the threshold maximum reservoir leakage rate 
determined in S5.6.7.2.2. With an initial reservoir system and supply 
line pressure of 100 psi, no application of any of the vehicle's brakes 
and, if the vehicle is designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air 
brakes, a 50 cubic inch test reservoir connected to the rear supply line 
coupling, make a parking brake application by venting the front supply 
line coupling to the atmosphere. Determine the maximum reservoir leakage 
rate (in psi per minute), which is the maximum rate of decrease in air 
pressure of any of the vehicle's reservoirs that results after that 
parking brake application. The level of common diaphragm leakage-type 
failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing 
that diaphragm) associated with this reservoir leakage rate is the level 
that is to be used under the option set forth in S5.6(b).
    S5.7  Emergency brake system for trucks and buses. Each vehicle 
shall be equipped with an emergency brake system which, under the 
conditions of S6.1, conforms to the requirements of S5.7.1 through 
S5.7.3. However, the truck portion of an auto transporter need not meet 
the road test requirements of S5.7.1 and S5.7.3.

[[Page 367]]

    S5.7.1  Emergency brake system performance. When stopped six times 
for each combination of weight and speed specified in S5.3.1.1, except 
for a loaded truck tractor with an unbraked control trailer, on a road 
surface having a PFC of 0.9, with a single failure in the service brake 
system of a part designed to contain compressed air or brake fluid 
(except failure of a common valve, manifold, brake fluid housing, or 
brake chamber housing), the vehicle shall stop at least once in not more 
than the distance specified in Column 5 of Table II, measured from the 
point at which movement of the service brake control begins, except that 
a truck-tractor tested at its unloaded vehicle weight plus up to 500 
pounds shall stop at least once in not more than the distance specified 
in Column 6 of Table II. The stop shall be made without any part of the 
vehicle leaving the roadway, and with unlimited wheel lockup permitted 
at any speed.
    S5.7.2  Emergency brake system operation. The emergency brake system 
shall be applied and released, and be capable of modulation, by means of 
the service brake control.
    S5.7.3  Towing vehicle emergency brake requirements. In addition to 
meeting the other requirements of S5.7, a vehicle designed to tow 
another vehicle equipped with air brakes shall--
    (a) In the case of a truck-tractor in the unloaded condition and a 
single unit truck which is capable of towing an airbrake equipped 
vehicle and is loaded to GVWR, be capable of meeting the requirements of 
S5.7.1 by operation of the service brake control only, with the trailer 
air supply line and air control line from the towing vehicle vented to 
the atmosphere in accordance with S6.1.14;
    (b) In the case of a truck-tractor loaded to GVWR, be capable of 
meeting S5.7.1 by operation of the service brake control only, with the 
air control line from the towing vehicle vented to the atmosphere in 
accordance with S6.1.14; and
    (c) Be capable of modulating the air in the supply or control line 
to the trailer by means of the service brake control with a single 
failure in the towing vehicle service brake system as specified in 
S5.7.1.
    S5.8  Emergency brakes for trailers. Each trailer shall meet the 
requirements of S5.8.1 through S5.8.3.
    S5.8.1  Emergency braking capability. Each trailer other than a 
trailer converter dolly shall have a parking brake system that conforms 
to S5.6 and that applies with the force specified in S5.6.1 or S5.6.2 
when the air pressure in the supply line is at atmospheric pressure. A 
trailer converter dolly shall have, at the manufacturer's option--
    (a) A parking brake system that conforms to S5.6 and that applies 
with the force specified in S5.6.1 or S5.6.2 when the air pressure in 
the supply line is at atmospheric pressure, or
    (b) An emergency system that automatically applies the service 
brakes when the service reservoir is at any pressure above 20 lb/in\2\ 
and the supply line is at atmospheric pressure. However, any 
agricultural commodity trailer, heavy hauler trailer, or pulpwood 
trailer shall meet the requirements of S5.8.1 or, at the option of the 
manufacturer, the requirements of Sec. 393.43 of this title.
    S5.8.2  Supply line pressure retention. Any single leakage type 
failure in the service brake system (except for a failure of the supply 
line, a valve directly connected to the supply line or a component of a 
brake chamber housing) shall not result in the pressure in the supply 
line falling below 70 psi, measured at the forward trailer supply 
coupling. A trailer shall meet the above supply line pressure retention 
requirement with its brake system connected to the trailer test rig 
shown in Figure 1, with the reservoirs of the trailer and test rig 
initially pressurized to 100 psi and the regulator of the trailer test 
rig set at 100 psi; except that a trailer equipped with an air-applied, 
mechanically-held parking brake system and not designed to tow a vehicle 
equipped with air brakes, at the manufacturer's option, may meet the 
requirements of S5.8.4 rather than those of S5.8.2 and S5.8.3.
    S5.8.3  Automatic application of parking brakes. With an initial 
reservoir system pressure of 100 psi and initial supply line pressure of 
100 psi, and if designed to tow a vehicle equipped with air brakes, with 
a 50 cubic inch test reservoir connected to the rear supply

[[Page 368]]

line coupling, and with any subsequent single leakage type failure in 
any other brake system, of a part designed to contain compressed air or 
brake fluid (consistent with the parenthetical phrase specified in 
S5.6.3.1), whenever the air pressure in the supply line is 70 psi or 
higher, the parking brakes shall not provide any brake retardation as a 
result of complete or partial automatic application of the parking 
brakes.
    S5.8.4 Automatic application of air-applied, mechanically held 
parking brakes. With its brake system connected to the supply line 
portion of the trailer test rig (Figure 1) and the regulator of the 
trailer test rig set at 100 psi, and with any single leakage type 
failure in the service brake system (except for a failure of the supply 
line, a valve directly connected to the supply line or a component of a 
brake chamber, but including failure of any common diaphragm), the 
parking brakes shall not provide any brake retardation as a result of 
complete or partial automatic application of the parking brakes.
    S5.9  Final inspection. Inspect the service brake system for the 
condition of adjustment and for the brake indicator display in 
accordance with S5.1.8 and S5.2.2.
    S6.  Conditions. The requirements of S5 shall be met by a vehicle 
when it is tested according to the conditions set in this S6, without 
replacing any brake system part or making any adjustments to the brake 
system except as specified. Unless otherwise specified, where a range of 
conditions is specified, the vehicle must be capable of meeting the 
requirements at all points within the range. On vehicles equipped with 
automatic brake adjusters, the automatic brake adjusters must remain 
activated at all times. Compliance of vehicles manufactured in two or 
more stages may, at the option of the final-stage manufacturer, be 
demonstrated to comply with this standard by adherence to the 
instructions of the incomplete vehicle manufacturer provided with the 
vehicle in accordance with Sec. 568.4(a)(7)(ii) and Sec. 568.5 of title 
49 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
    S6.1  Road test conditions.
    S6.1.1  Except as otherwise specified, the vehicle is loaded to its 
GVWR, distributed proportionally to its GAWRs. During the burnish 
procedure specified in S6.1.8, truck tractors shall be loaded to their 
GVWR, by coupling them to an unbraked flatbed semitrailer, which 
semitrailer shall be loaded so that the weight of the tractor-trailer 
combination equals the GVWR of the truck tractor. The load on the 
unbraked flatbed semitrailer shall be located so that the truck 
tractor's wheels do not lock during burnish.
    S6.1.2  The inflation pressure is as specified by the vehicle 
manufacturer for the GVWR.
    S6.1.3  Unless otherwise specified, the transmission selector 
control is in neutral or the clutch is disengaged during all 
decelerations and during static parking brake tests.
    S6.1.4  All vehicle openings (doors, windows, hood, trunk, cargo 
doors, etc.) are in a closed position except as required for 
instrumentation purposes.
    S6.1.5  The ambient temperature is between 32 deg. F. and 100 deg. 
F.
    S6.1.6  The wind velocity is zero.
    S6.1.7  Unless otherwise specified, stopping tests are conducted on 
a 12-foot wide level, straight roadway having a peak friction 
coefficient of 0.9. For road tests in S5.3, the vehicle is aligned in 
the center of the roadway at the beginning of a stop. Peak friction 
coefficient is measured using an ASTM E1136 standard reference test tire 
in accordance with ASTM method E1337-90, at a speed of 40 mph, without 
water delivery for the surface with PFC of 0.9, and with water delivery 
for the surface with PFC of 0.5.
    S6.1.8  For vehicles with parking brake systems not utilizing the 
service brake friction elements, burnish the friction elements of such 
systems prior to the parking brake test according to the manufacturer's 
recommendations. For vehicles with parking brake systems utilizing the 
service brake friction elements, burnish the brakes as follows: With the 
transmission in the highest gear appropriate for a speed of 40 mph, make 
500 snubs between 40 mph and 20 mph at a deceleration rate of 10 
f.p.s.p.s., or at the vehicle's maximum deceleration rate if less than 
10 f.p.s.p.s. Except where an adjustment is specified, after each brake 
application accelerate to 40 mph and maintain that

[[Page 369]]

speed until making the next brake application at a point 1 mile from the 
initial point of the previous brake application. If the vehicle cannot 
attain a speed of 40 mph in 1 mph, continue to accelerate until the 
vehicle reaches 40 mph or until the vehicle has traveled 1.5 miles from 
the initial point of the previous brake application, whichever occurs 
first. Any automatic pressure limiting valve is in use to limit pressure 
as designed. The brakes may be adjusted up to three times during the 
burnish procedure, at intervals specified by the vehicle manufacturer, 
and may be adjusted at the conclusion of the burnishing, in accordance 
with the vehicle manufacturer's recommendation.
    S6.1.9  Static parking brake tests for a semitrailer are conducted 
with the front-end supported by an unbraked dolly. The weight of the 
dolly is included as part of the trailer load.
    S6.1.10  In a test other than a static parking test, a truck tractor 
is tested at its GVWR by coupling it to an unbraked flatbed semi-trailer 
(hereafter, control trailer) as specified in S6.1.10.2 to S6.1.10.4.
    S6.1.10.1  [Reserved]
    S6.1.10.2  The center of gravity height of the ballast on the loaded 
control trailer shall be less than 24 inches above the top of the 
tractor's fifth wheel.
    S6.1.10.3  The control trailer has a single axle with a GAWR of 
18,000 pounds and a length, measured from the transverse centerline of 
the axle to the centerline of the kingpin, of 258 <SUP>#</SUP> 6 inches.
    S6.1.10.4  The control trailer is loaded so that its axle is loaded 
at 4,500 pounds and the tractor is loaded to its GVWR, loaded above the 
kingpin only, with the tractor's fifth wheel adjusted so that the load 
on each axle measured at the tire-ground interface is most nearly 
proportional to the axles' respective GAWRs, without exceeding the GAWR 
of the tractor's axle or axles or control trailer's axle.
    S6.1.11  Special drive conditions. A vehicle equipped with an 
interlocking axle system or a front wheel drive system that is engaged 
and disengaged by the driver is tested with the system disengaged.
    S6.1.12  Liftable axles. A vehicle with a liftable axle is tested at 
GVWR with the liftable axle down and at unloaded vehicle weight with the 
liftable axle up.
    S6.1.13  Trailer test rig.
    (a) The trailer test rig shown in Figure 1 is calibrated in 
accordance with the calibration curves shown in Figure 3. For the 
requirements of S5.3.3.1 and S5.3.4.1, the pressure in the trailer test 
rig reservoir is initially set at 100 psi for actuation tests and 95 psi 
for release tests.
    (b) The trailer test rig shown in Figure 1(a) is capable of 
increasing the pressure in a 50 cubic inch reservoir from atmospheric to 
60 lb/in\2\ in 0.06 second, measured from the first movement of the 
service brake control to apply service brake pressure and of releasing 
pressure in such a reservoir from 95 to 5 lb/in\2\ in 0.22 second 
measured from the first movement of the service brake control to release 
service brake pressure.
    S6.1.14  In testing the emergency braking system of towing vehicles 
under S5.7.3(a) and S5.7.3(b), the hose(s) is vented to the atmosphere 
at any time not less than 1 second and not more than 1 minute before the 
emergency stop begins, while the vehicle is moving at the speed from 
which the stop is to be made and any manual control for the towing 
vehicle protection system is in the position to supply air and brake 
control signals to the vehicle being towed. No brake application is made 
from the time the line(s) is vented until the emergency stop begins and 
no manual operation of the parking brake system or towing vehicle 
protection system occurs from the time the line(s) is vented until the 
stop is completed.
    S6.1.15  Initial brake temperature. Unless otherwise specified, the 
initial brake temperature is not less than 150 deg. F and not more than 
200 deg. F.
    6.2  Dynamometer test conditions.
    S6.2.1  The dynamometer inertia for each wheel is equivalent to the 
load on the wheel with the axle loaded to its GAWR. For a vehicle having 
additional GAWRs specified for operation at reduced speeds, the GAWR 
used is that specified for a speed of 50 mph, or, at

[[Page 370]]

the option of the manufacturer, any speed greater than 50 mph.
    S6.2.2  The ambient temperature is between 75 deg. F. and 100 deg. 
F.
    S6.2.3  Air at ambient temperature is directed uniformly and 
continuously over the brake drum or disc at a velocity of 2,200 feet per 
minute.
    S6.2.4  The temperature of each brake is measured by a single plug-
type thermocouple installed in the center of the lining surface of the 
most heavily loaded shoe or pad as shown in Figure 2. The thermocouple 
is outside any center groove.
    S6.2.5  The rate of brake drum or disc rotation on a dynamometer or 
responding to the rate of rotation on a vehicle at a given speed is 
calculated by assuming a tire radius equal to the static loaded radius 
specified by the tire manufacturer.
    S6.2.6  Brakes are burnished before testing as follows: place the 
brake assembly on an inertia dynamometer and adjust the brake as 
recommended by the vehicle manufacturer. Make 200 stops from 40 mph at a 
deceleration of 10 f.p.s.p.s., with an initial brake temperature on each 
stop of not less than 315 deg. F and not more than 385 deg. F. Make 200 
additional stops from 40 mph at a deceleration of 10 f.p.s.p.s. with an 
initial brake temperature on each stop of not less than 450 deg. F and 
not more than 550 deg. F. The brakes may be adjusted up to three times 
during the burnish procedure, at intervals specified by the vehicle 
manufacturer, and may be adjusted at the conclusion of the burnishing, 
in accordance with the vehicle manufacturer's recommendation.
    S6.2.7  The brake temperature is increased to a specified level by 
conducting one or more stops from 40 m.p.h. at a deceleration of 10 
f.p.s.p.s. The brake temperature is decreased to a specified level by 
rotating the drum or disc at a constant 30 m.p.h.

Sec. 571.122  Standard No. 122; Motorcycle brake systems.

    S1. Scope. This standard specifies performance requirements for 
motorcycle brake systems.
    S2. Purpose. The purpose of the standard is to insure safe 
motorcycle braking performance under normal and emergency conditions.
    S3. Application. This standard applies to motorcycles.
    S4. Definitions.
    Braking interval means the distance measured from the start of one 
brake application to the start of the next brake application.
    Initial brake temperature means the temperature of the hottest 
service brake of the vehicle 0.2 mile before any brake application.
    Skid number means the frictional resistance of a pavement measured 
in accordance with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) 
Method E-274-70 (as revised July, 1974) at 40 mph, omitting water 
delivery as specified in paragraphs 7.1 and 7.2 of that method.
    Stopping distance means the distance traveled by a vehicle from the 
start of the brake application to the point where the vehicle stops.
    Split service brake system means a brake system consisting of two or 
more subsystems actuated by a single control designed so that a leakage-
type failure of a pressure component in a single subsystem (except 
structural failure of a housing that is common to all subsystems) shall 
not impair the operation of the other subsystem(s).
    S5. Requirements. Each motorcycle shall meet the following 
requirements under the conditions specified in S6, when tested according 
to the procedures and in the sequence specified in S7. Corresponding 
test procedures of S7 are indicated in parentheses. If a motorcycle is 
incapable of attaining a specified speed, its service brakes shall be 
capable of stopping the vehicle from the multiple of 5 m.p.h. that is 4 
m.p.h. to 8 m.p.h. less than the speed attainable in 1 mile, within 
stopping distances that do not exceed the stopping distances specified 
in Table 1.
    S5.1  Required equipment--split service brake system. Each 
motorcycle shall have either a split service brake system or two 
independently actuated service brake systems.
    S5.1.1  Mechanical service brake system. Failure of any component in 
a mechanical service brake system shall not result in a loss of braking 
ability in the other service brake system on the vehicle.
    S5.1.2  Hydraulic service brake system. A leakage failure in a 
hydraulic service brake system shall not result in a loss of braking 
ability in the other service brake system on the vehicle. Each 
motorcycle equipped with a hydraulic brake system shall have the 
equipment specified in S5.1.2.1 and S5.1.2.2.
    S5.1.2.1  Master cylinder reservoirs. Each master cylinder shall 
have a separate reservoir for each brake circuit, with each reservoir 
filler opening having its own cover, seal, and cover retention device. 
Each reservoir shall have a minimum capacity equivalent to one and one-
half times the total fluid displacement resulting when all the wheel 
cylinders or caliper pistons serviced by the reservoir move from a new 
lining, fully retracted position to a fully worn, fully applied 
position. Where adjustment is a factor, the worst condition of 
adjustment shall be used for this measurement.
    S5.1.2.2  Reservoir labeling. Each motorcycle shall have a brake 
fluid warning statement that reads as follows, in letters at least three 
thirty-seconds of an inch high:
    Warning: Clean filler cap before removing. Use only ______ fluid 
from a sealed container. (Inserting the recommended type of brake fluid 
as specified in 49 CFR 571.116, e.g., DOT 3.)
    The lettering shall be:--
    (a) Permanently affixed, engraved, or embossed;
    (b) Located so as to be visible by direct view, either on or within 
4 inches of the brake-fluid reservoir filler plug or cap; and
    (c) Of a color that contrasts with its background, if it is not 
engraved or embossed.
    S5.1.3  Split service brake system. In addition to the equipment 
required by S5.1.2 each motorcycle equipped with a split service brake 
system shall have a

[[Page 377]]

indicator lamps that is mounted in front of and in clear view of the 
driver, and that is activated--
    (1) In the event of pressure failure in any part of the service 
brake system, other than a structural failure of either a brake master 
cylinder body in a split integral body type master cylinder system or a 
service brake system failure indicator body, before or upon application 
of not more than 20 pounds of pedal force upon the service brake.
    (2) Without the application of pedal force, when the level of brake 
fluid in a master cylinder reservoir drops to less than the recommended 
safe level specified by the manufacturer or to less than one-half the 
fluid reservoir capacity, whichever is the greater.
    (b) All failure indicator lamps shall be activated when the ignition 
switch is turned from the ``off'' to the ``on'' or to the ``start'' 
position.
    (c) Except for the momentary activation required by S5.1.3.1(b), 
each indicator lamp, once activated, shall remain activated as long as 
the condition exists, whenever the ignition switch is in the ``on'' 
position. An indicator lamp activated when the ignition is turned to the 
``start'' position shall be deactivated upon return of the switch to the 
``on'' position unless a failure exists in the service brake system.
    (d) Each indicator lamp shall have a red lens with the legend 
``Brake Failure'' on or adjacent to it in letters not less than three 
thirty-seconds of an inch high that shall be legible to the driver in 
daylight when lighted.

    S7. Test procedures and sequence. Each motorcycle shall be capable 
of meeting all the requirements of this standard when tested according 
to the procedures and in the sequence set forth below without replacing 
any brake system part, or making any adjustments to the brake system 
other than as permitted in S7.4. A motorcycle shall be deemed to comply 
with S5.2, S5.3 and S5.5 if at least one of the stops specified in S7.3, 
S7.5 and S7.8 is made within the stopping distances specified in Table 
I.
    S7.1  Braking warming. If the initial brake temperature for the 
first stop in a test procedure (other than S7.10) has not been reached, 
heat the brakes to the initial brake temperature by making up to 10 
stops from 30 m.p.h. at a deceleration of not more than 10 f.p.s.p.s. On 
independently operated brake systems, the coldest brake shall be within 
10 deg. F. of the hottest brake.
    S7.2  Pretest instrumentation check. Conduct a general check of test 
instrumentation by making not more than 10 stops from a speed of not 
more than 30 m.p.h. at a deceleration of not more than 10 f.p.s.p.s. If 
test instrument repair, replacement, or adjustment is necessary, make 
not more than 10 additional stops after such repair, replacement or 
adjustment.
    S7.3  Service brake system--first (preburnished) effectiveness test.
    S7.3.1  Service brake system. Make six stops from 30 m.p.h. and then 
six stops from 60 m.p.h. with an initial brake temperature between 
130 deg. F. and 150 deg. F.
    S7.3.2  Partial service brake system. For a motorcycle with two 
independently actuated service brake systems, repeat S7.3.1 using each 
service brake system individually.
    S7.4  Service brake system--burnish procedure. Burnish the brakes by 
making 200 stops from 30 m.p.h. at 12 f.p.s.p.s. The braking interval 
shall be either the distance necessary to reduce the initial brake 
temperature to between 130 deg. F. and 150 deg. F. or 1 mile, whichever 
occurs first. Accelerate at maximum rate to 30 m.p.h. immediately after 
each stop and maintain that speed until making the next stop. After 
burnishing adjust the brakes in accordance with the manufacturer's 
recommendation.
    S7.5  Service brake system--second effectiveness test. Repeat 
S7.3.1. Then, make four stops from 80 m.p.h. and four stops from the 
multiple of 5 m.p.h. that is 4 m.p.h. to 8 m.p.h. less than the speed 
attainable in 1 mile if that speed is 95 m.p.h. or greater.
    S7.6  Service brake system--fade and recovery test. These 
requirements do not apply to a motor-driven cycle whose speed attainable 
in 1 mile is 30 m.p.h. or less.
    S7.6.1  Baseline check stops. Make three stops from 30 m.p.h. at 10 
to 11 f.p.s.p.s. for each stop. Compute the average of the maximum brake 
pedal forces and the maximum brake lever forces required for the three 
stops.
    S7.6.2  Fade stops. Make 10 stops from 60 m.p.h. at not less than 15 
f.p.s.p.s. for each stop. The initial brake temperature before the first 
brake application shall be between 130 deg. F. and 150 deg. F. Initial 
brake temperatures before brake applications for subsequent stops shall 
be those occurring at the distance intervals. Attain the required 
deceleration as quickly as possible and maintain at least this rate for 
not less than three-fourths of the total stopping distance for each 
stop. The interval between the starts of service brake applications 
shall be 0.4 mile. Drive 1 mile at 30 m.p.h. after the last fade stop 
and immediately conduct the recovery test specified in S7.6.3.
    S7.6.3  Recovery test. Make five stops from 30 m.p.h. at 10 to 11 
f.p.s.p.s. for each stop. The braking interval shall not be more than 1 
mile. Immediately after each stop accelerate at maximum rate to 30 
m.p.h. and maintain that speed until making the next stop.
    S7.7  Service brake system--reburnish. Repeat S7.4 except make 35 
burnish stops instead of 200 stops. Brakes may be adjusted after 
reburnish if no tools are used. These requirements do not apply to a 
motor-driven cycle whose speed attainable in 1 mile is 30 m.p.h. or 
less.
    S7.8  Service brake system--final effectiveness test. These 
requirements do not apply to a motor-driven cycle whose speed attainable 
in 1 mile is 30 m.p.h. or less.

[[Page 380]]

    S7.8.1  Service brake system. Repeat S7.5 including S7.3.1.
    S7.8.2  Partial service brake system test. Alter the service brake 
system on three-wheeled motorcycles to induce a complete loss of braking 
in any one subsystem. Determine the line pressure or pedal force 
necessary to cause the brake system failure indicator to operate. Make 
six stops from 30 m.p.h. and then six stops from 60 m.p.h. with an 
initial brake temperature between 130 deg. F. and 150 deg. F. Repeat for 
each subsystem. Determine that the brake failure indicator is operating 
when the master cylinder fluid level is less than the level specified in 
S5.1.3.1(a)(2), and that it complies with S5.1.3.1(c). Check for proper 
operation with each reservoir in turn at a low level. Restore the 
service brake system to normal at completion of this test.
    S7.9  Parking brake test. Starting with an initial brake temperature 
of not more than 150 deg. F., drive the motorcycle downhill on the 30 
percent grade with the longitudinal axis of the motorcycle in the 
direction of the grade. Apply the service brakes with a force not 
exceeding 90 pounds to stop the motorcycle and place the transmission in 
neutral. Apply the parking brake by exerting a force not exceeding those 
specified in S5.6. Release the service brake and allow the motorcycle to 
remain at rest (to the limit of traction of the braked wheels) for 5 
minutes. Repeat the test with the motorcycle parked in the reversed 
(uphill) position on the grade.
    S7.10  Service brake system--water recovery test.
    S7.10.1  Baseline check stops. Make three stops from 30 m.p.h. at 10 
to 11 f.p.s.p.s. for each stop. Compute the average of the maximum brake 
pedal forces and of the maximum brake lever forces required for the 
three stops.
    S7.10.2  Wet brake recovery stops. Completely immerse the rear brake 
assembly of the motorcycle in water for 2 minutes with the brake fully 
released. Next completely immerse the front brake assembly of the 
motorcycle in water for 2 minutes with the brake fully released. Perform 
the entire wetting procedure in not more than 7 minutes. Immediately 
after removal of the front brake from water, accelerate at a maximum 
rate to 30 mi/h without a brake application. Immediately upon reaching 
that speed make five stops, each from 30 mi/h at 10 to 11 ft/s <SUP>2</SUP> 
for each stop. After each stop (except the last) accelerate the 
motorcycle immediately at a maximum rate to 30 mi/h and begin the next 
stop.
    S7.11  Final inspection. Upon completion of all the tests inspect 
the brake system in an assembled condition, for compliance with the 
brake lining inspection requirements. Disassemble all brakes and 
inspect:
    (a) The entire brake system for detachment or fracture of any 
component.
    (b) Brake linings for detachment from the shoe or pad.
    (c) Wheel cylinder, master cylinder, and axle seals for fluid or 
lubricant leakage.
    (d) Master cylinder for reservoir capacity and retention device.
    (e) Master cylinder label for compliance with S5.1.2.2.

Sec. 571.123  Standard No. 123; Motorcycle controls and displays.

    S1. Scope. This standard specifies requirements for the location, 
operation, identification, and illumination of motorcycle controls and 
displays, and requirements for motorcycle stands and footrests.
    S2. Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to minimize accidents 
caused by operator error in responding to the motoring environment, by 
standardizing certain motorcycle controls and displays.
    S3. Application. This standard applies to motorcycles equipped with 
handlebars, except for motorcycles that are designed, and sold 
exclusively for use by law enforcement agencies.
    S4. Definitions. Clockwise and counterclockwise mean opposing 
directions of rotation around the following axes, as applicable. (a) The 
operational axis of the ignition control, viewed from in front of the 
ignition lock opening;
    (b) The axis of the right handlebar on which the twist-grip throttle 
is located, viewed from the end of that handlebar;
    (c) The axis perpendicular to the center of the speedometer, viewed 
from the operator's normal eye position.
    S5.  Requirements.
    S5.1. Each motorcycle shall be equipped with a supplemental engine 
stop control, located and operable as specified in Table 1.
    S5.2  Each motorcycle to which this standard applies shall meet the 
following requirements:
    S5.2.1  Control location and operation. If any item of equipment 
listed in Table 1, Column 1, is provided, the control for such item 
shall be located as specified in Column 2, and operable as specified in 
Column 3. Each control located on a right handlebar shall be operable by 
the operator's right hand throughout its full range without removal of 
the operator's right hand from the throttle. Each control located on a 
left handlebar shall be operable by the operator's left hand throughout 
its full range without removal of the operator's left hand from the 
handgrip. If a motorcycle with an automatic clutch is equipped with a 
supplemental rear brake control, the control shall be located on the 
left handlebar. If a motorcycle is equipped with self-proportioning or 
antilock braking devices utilizing a single control for front and rear 
brakes, the control shall be located and operable in the same manner as 
a rear brake control.
    S5.2.2  Display illumination and operation. If an item of equipment 
listed in Table 2, Column 1, is provided, the display for such item 
shall be visible to a seated operator under daylight conditions, shall

<R05>
Sec. 571.124  Standard No. 124; Accelerator control systems.

    S1. Scope. This standard establishes requirements for the return of 
a vehicle's throttle to the idle position when the driver removes the 
actuating force from the accelerator control, or in the event of a 
severance or disconnection in the accelerator control system.
    S2. Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to reduce deaths and 
injuries resulting from engine overspeed caused by malfunctions in the 
accelerator control system.
    S3. Application. This standard applies to passenger cars, multi-
purpose passenger vehicles, trucks, and buses.
    S4. Definitions.
    S4.1  Driver-operated accelerator control system means all vehicle 
components, except the fuel metering device, that regulate engine speed 
in direct response to movement of the driver-operated control and that 
return the throttle to the idle position upon release of the actuating 
force.
    Fuel metering device means the carburetor, or in the case of certain 
engines the fuel injector, fuel distributor or fuel injection pump.
    Throttle means the component of the fuel metering device that 
connects to the driver-operated accelerator control system and that by 
input from the driver-operated accelerator control system controls the 
engine speed.
    Idle position means the position of the throttle at which it first 
comes in contact with an engine idle speed control appropriate for 
existing conditions according to the manufacturers' recommendations. 
These conditions include, but are not limited to, engine speed 
adjustments for cold engine, air conditioning, and emission control, and 
the use of throttle setting devices.
    Ambient temperature means the surrounding air temperature, at a 
distance such that it is not significantly affected by heat from the 
vehicle under test.
    S4.2  In the case of vehicles powered by electric motors, the words 
throttle and idle refer to the motor speed controller and motor 
shutdown, respectively.
    S5. Requirements. The vehicle shall meet the following requirements 
when the engine is running under any load condition, and at any ambient 
temperature between -40 degrees Celsius and +52 degrees Celsius after 12 
hours of conditioning at any temperature within that range.
    S5.1  There shall be at least two sources of energy capable of 
returning the throttle to the idle position within the time limit 
specified by S5.3 from any accelerator position or speed whenever the 
driver removes the opposing actuating force. In the event of failure of 
one source of energy by a single severance or disconnection, the 
throttle shall return to the idle position within the time limits 
specified by S5.3, from any accelerator position or speed whenever the 
driver removes the opposing actuating force.
    S5.2  The throttle shall return to the idle position from any 
accelerator position or any speed of which the engine is capable 
whenever any one component of the accelerator control system is 
disconnected or severed at a single point. The return to idle shall 
occur within the time limit specified by S5.3, measured either from the 
time of severance or disconnection or from the first removal of the 
opposing actuating force by the driver.
    S5.3  Except as provided below, maximum time to return to idle 
position shall be 1 second for vehicles of 4536 kilograms or less GVWR, 
and 2 seconds for vehicles of more than 4536 kilograms GVWR. Maximum 
time to return to idle position shall be 3 seconds for any vehicle that 
is exposed to ambient air at -18 degrees Celsius to -40 degrees Celsius 
during the test or for any portion of the 12-hour conditioning period.
[38 FR 2980, Jan. 31, 1973; as amended at 60 FR 13645, Mar. 14, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 571.125  Standard No. 125; Warning devices.

    S1. Scope. This standard establishes requirements for devices, 
without self-contained energy sources, that are designed to be carried 
in motor vehicles and used to warn approaching traffic of the presence 
of a stopped vehicle, except for devices designed to be permanently 
affixed to the vehicle.

[[Page 387]]

    S2. Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to reduce deaths and

center member. For any inner diameter dimensional specifications, or 
other dimensional specifications that are uniform or uniformly spaced 
around some circumference of the tire, these measurements shall be taken 
at least six points around the tire, or, if specified, at the points 
specified in the listing contained in the submission made by an 
individual manufacturer, pursuant to S4.4(a), or in one of the 
publications described in S4.4(b) for that tire's non-pneumatic tire 
identification code designation.
    S5.2  Lateral Strength.
    S5.2.1  Preparation of the tire.
    S5.2.1.1  If applicable, mount a new tire on a non-pneumatic test 
rim or test wheel center member.
    S5.2.1.2  Mount the tire assembly in a fixture as shown in Figure 1 
with the surface of the tire assembly that would face outward when 
mounted on a vehicle facing toward the lateral strength test block shown 
in Figure 2 and force the lateral strength test block against the tire.
    S5.2.2  Test Procedure.
    S5.2.2.1  Apply a load through the block to the tire at a rate of 2 
inches per minute, with the load arm parallel to the tire assembly at 
the time of engagement and the first point of contact with the test 
block being the test block centerline shown in Figure 2, at the 
following distances, B, in sequence, as shown in Figure 1:

    B=A--1 inch
    B=A--2 inches
    B=A--3 inches
    B=A--4 inches
    B=A--5 inches, and
    B=A--6 inches.

However, if at any time during the conduct of the test, the test block 
comes in contact with the non-pneumatic test rim or test wheel center 
member, the test shall be suspended and no further testing at smaller 
values of the distance B shall be conducted. When tested to the above 
procedure, satisfying the requirements of S4.2.2.3 for all values of B 
greater than that for which contact between the non-pneumatic test rim 
or test wheel center member and the test block is made, shall constitute 
compliance to the requirements set forth in S4.2.2.3.

engraved or embossed.
    S5.4.4. Fluid level indication. Brake fluid reservoirs shall be so 
constructed that the level of fluid can be checked without need for the 
reservoir to be opened. This requirement is deemed to have been met if 
the vehicle is equipped with a transparent brake fluid reservoir or a 
brake fluid level indicator meeting the requirements of S5.5.1(a)(1).

ignition (start) switch is in the ''on'' (''run'') position and whenever 
any of conditions (a) through (g) occur:
    (a) A gross loss of fluid or fluid pressure (such as caused by 
rupture of a brake line but not by a structural failure of a housing 
that is common to two or more subsystems) as indicated by one of the 
following conditions (chosen at the option of the manufacturer):
    (1) A drop in the level of the brake fluid in any master cylinder 
reservoir compartment to less than the recommended safe level specified 
by the manufacturer or to one-fourth of the fluid capacity of that 
reservoir compartment, whichever is greater.
    (2) For vehicles equipped with a split service brake system, a 
differential pressure of 1.5 MPa (218 psi) between the intact and failed 
brake subsystems measured at a master cylinder outlet or a slave 
cylinder outlet.

of the normal system pressure.
    (b) Any electrical functional failure in an antilock or variable 
brake proportioning system.
    (c) Application of the parking brake.
    (d) Brake lining wear-out, if the manufacturer has elected to use an 
electrical device to provide an optical warning to meet the requirements 
of S5.1.2(a).
    (e) For a vehicle with electrically-actuated service brakes, failure 
of the source of electric power to those brakes, or diminution of state 
of charge of the batteries to less than a level specified by the 
manufacturer for the purpose of warning a driver of degraded brake 
performance.

control signal, failure of a brake control circuit.
    (g) For an EV with a regenerative braking system that is part of the 
service brake system, failure of the RBS. An amber lamp may be used 
displaying the symbol ''RBS.'' RBS failure in a system that is part of 
the service brake system may also be indicated by an amber lamp that 
also indicates ABS failure and displays the symbol ''ABS/RBS''.

[[Page 405]]

    S5.5.2. Function check. (a) All indicators shall be activated as a 
check function by either:
    (1) Automatic activation when the ignition (start) switch is turned 
to the ``on'' (``run'') position when the engine is not running, or when 
the ignition (``start'') switch is in a position between ``on'' 
(``run'') and ``start'' that is designated by the manufacturer as a 
check position, or
    (2) A single manual action by the driver, such as momentary 
activation of a test button or switch mounted on the instrument panel in 
front of and in clear view of the driver, or, in the case of an 
indicator for application of the parking brake, by applying the parking 
brake when the ignition is in the ``on'' (``run'') position.
    (b) In the case of a vehicle that has an interlock device that 
prevents the engine from being started under one or more conditions, 
check functions meeting the requirements of S5.5.2(a) need not be 
operational under any condition in which the engine cannot be started.
    (c) The manufacturer shall explain the brake check function test 
procedure in the owner's manual.
    S5.5.3. Duration. Each indicator activated due to a condition 
specified in S5.5.1 shall remain activated as long as the condition 
exists, whenever the ignition (``start'') switch is in the ``on'' 
(``run'') position, whether or not the engine is running.
    S5.5.4. Function. When a visual warning indicator is activated, it 
may be continuous or flashing, except that the visual warning indicator 
on a vehicle not equipped with a split service brake system shall be 
flashing. The audible warning required for a vehicle manufactured 
without a split service brake system may be continuous or intermittent.
    S5.5.5. Labeling. (a) Each visual indicator shall display a word or 
words in accordance with the requirements of Standard No. 101 (49 CFR 
571.101) and this section, which shall be legible to the driver under 
all daytime and nighttime conditions when activated. Unless otherwise 
specified, the words shall have letters not less than 3.2 mm (\1/8\ 
inch) high and the letters and background shall be of contrasting 
colors, one of which is red. Words or symbols in addition to those 
required by Standard No. 101 and this section may be provided for 
purposes of clarity.
    (b) Vehicles manufactured with a split service brake system may use 
a common brake warning indicator to indicate two or more of the 
functions described in S5.5.1(a) through S5.5.1(d). If a common 
indicator is used, it shall display the word ``Brake.''
    (c) A vehicle manufactured without a split service brake system 
shall use a separate indicator to indicate the failure condition in 
S5.5.1(a). This indicator shall display the words ``STOP--BRAKE 
FAILURE'' in block capital letters not less than 6.4 mm (\1/4\ inch) in 
height.
    (d) If separate indicators are used for one or more of the 
conditions described in S5.5.1(a) through S5.5.1(g), the indicators 
shall display the following wording:
    (1) If a separate indicator is provided for the low brake fluid 
condition in S5.5.1(a)(1), the words ``Brake Fluid'' shall be used 
except for vehicles using hydraulic system mineral oil.
    (2) If a separate indicator is provided for the gross loss of 
pressure condition in S5.5.1(a)(2), the words ``Brake Pressure'' shall 
be used.
    (3) If a separate indicator is provided for the condition specified 
in S5.5.1(b), the letters and background shall be of contrasting colors, 
one of which is yellow. The indicator shall be labeled with the words 
``Antilock'' or ``Anti-lock'' or ``ABS''; or ``Brake Proportioning,'' in 
accordance with Table 2 of Standard No. 101.
    (4) If a separate indicator is provided for application of the 
parking brake as specified for S5.5.1(c), the single word ``Park'' or 
the words ``Parking Brake'' may be used.
    (5) If a separate indicator is provided to indicate brake lining 
wear-out as specified in S5.5.1(d), the words ``Brake Wear'' shall be 
used.
    (6) If a separate indicator is provided for any other function, the 
display shall include the word ``Brake'' and appropriate additional 
labeling.
    S5.6. Brake system integrity. Each vehicle shall meet the complete 
performance requirements of this standard without:

[[Page 406]]

    (a) Detachment or fracture of any component of the braking system, 
such as brake springs and brake shoes or disc pad facings other than 
minor cracks that do not impair attachment of the friction facings. All 
mechanical components of the braking system shall be intact and 
functional. Friction facing tearout (complete detachment of lining) 
shall not exceed 10 percent of the lining on any single frictional 
element.
    (b) Any visible brake fluid or lubricant on the friction surface of 
the brake, or leakage at the master cylinder or brake power unit 
reservoir cover, seal, and filler openings.
    S6. General test conditions. Each vehicle must meet the performance 
requirements specified in S7 under the following test conditions and in 
accordance with the test procedures and test sequence specified. Where a 
range of conditions is specified, the vehicle must meet the requirements 
at all points within the range.
    S6.1. Ambient conditions.
    S6.1.1. Ambient temperature. The ambient temperature is any 
temperature between 0  deg.C (32  deg.F) and 40  deg.C (104  deg.F).
    S6.1.2. Wind speed. The wind speed is not greater than 5 m/s (11.2 
mph).
    S6.2. Road test surface.
    S6.2.1. Pavement friction. Unless otherwise specified, the road test 
surface produces a peak friction coefficient (PFC) of 0.9 when measured 
using an American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) E1136 
standard reference test tire, in accordance with ASTM Method E 1337-90, 
at a speed of 64.4 km/h (40 mph), without water delivery.
    S6.2.2. Gradient. Except for the parking brake gradient holding 
test, the test surface has no more than a 1% gradient in the direction 
of testing and no more than a 2% gradient perpendicular to the direction 
of testing.
    S6.2.3. Lane width. Road tests are conducted on a test lane 3.5 m 
(11.5 ft) wide.
    S6.3. Vehicle conditions.
    S6.3.1. Vehicle weight.
    S6.3.1.1. For the tests at GVWR, the vehicle is loaded to its GVWR 
such that the weight on each axle as measured at the tire-ground 
interface is in proportion to its GAWR, with the fuel tank filled to 
100% of capacity. However, if the weight on any axle of a vehicle at 
LLVW exceeds the axle's proportional share of the GVWR, the load 
required to reach GVWR is placed so that the weight on that axle remains 
the same as at LLVW.
    S6.3.1.2. For the test at LLVW, the vehicle is loaded to its LLVW 
such that the added weight is distributed in the front passenger seat 
area.
    S6.3.2. Fuel tank loading. The fuel tank is filled to 100% of 
capacity at the beginning of testing and may not be less than 75% of 
capacity during any part of the testing.
    S6.3.3. Lining preparation. At the beginning of preparation for the 
road tests, the brakes of the vehicle are in the same condition as when 
the vehicle was manufactured. No burnishing or other special preparation 
is allowed, unless all vehicles sold to the public are similarly 
prepared as a part of the manufacturing process.
    S6.3.4. Adjustments and repairs. These requirements must be met 
without replacing any brake system parts or making any adjustments to 
the brake system except as specified in this standard. Where brake 
adjustments are specified (S7.1.3), adjust the brakes, including the 
parking brakes, in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendation. No 
brake adjustments are allowed during or between subsequent tests in the 
test sequence.
    S6.3.5. Automatic brake adjusters. Automatic adjusters are 
operational throughout the entire test sequence. They may be adjusted 
either manually or by other means, as recommended by the manufacturer, 
only prior to the beginning of the road test sequence.
    S6.3.6. Antilock brake system (ABS). If a car is equipped with an 
ABS, the ABS is fully operational for all tests, except where specified 
in the following sections.
    S6.3.7. Variable brake proportioning valve. If a car is equipped 
with a variable brake proportioning system, the proportioning valve is 
fully operational for all tests except the test for failed variable 
brake proportioning system.
    S6.3.8. Tire inflation pressure. Tires are inflated to the pressure 
recommended by the vehicle manufacturer for the GVWR of the vehicle.

[[Page 407]]

    S6.3.9. Engine. Engine idle speed and ignition timing are set 
according to the manufacturer's recommendations. If the vehicle is 
equipped with an adjustable engine speed governor, it is adjusted 
according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
    S6.3.10. Vehicle openings. All vehicle openings (doors, windows, 
hood, trunk, convertible top, cargo doors, etc.) are closed except as 
required for instrumentation purposes.
    S6.3.11 State of charge of batteries for EVs.
    S6.3.11.1 The state of charge of the propulsion batteries is 
determined in accordance with SAE Recommended Practice J227a, Electric 
Vehicle Test Procedure, February 1976. The applicable sections of J227a 
are 3.2.1 through 3.2.4, 3.3.1 through 3.3.2.2, 3.4.1 and 3.4.2, 4.2.1, 
5.2, 5.2.1 and 5.3.
    S6.3.11.2 At the beginning of the burnish procedure (S7.1 of this 
standard) in the test sequence, each propulsion battery is at the 
maximum state of charge recommended by the manufacturer, as stated in 
the vehicle operator's manual or on a label that is permanently attached 
to the vehicle, of, if the manufacturer has made no recommendation, not 
less than 95 percent. During the 200-stop burnish procedure, the 
propulsion batteries are restored to the maximum state of charge 
determined as above, after each increment of 40 burnish stops until the 
burnish procedure is complete. The batteries may be charged at a more 
frequent interval during a particular 40-stop increment only if the EV 
is incapable of achieving the initial burnish test speed during that 
increment. During the burnish procedure, the propulsion batteries may be 
charged by external means or replaced by batteries that are at a state 
of charge of not less than 95 percent. For an EV having a manual control 
for setting the level of regenerative braking, the manual control, at 
the beginning of the burnish procedure, is set to provide maximum 
regenerative braking throughout the burnish.
    S6.3.11.3 At the beginning of each performance test in the test 
sequence (S7.2 through S7.17 of this standard), unless otherwise 
specified, an EV's propulsion batteries are at the state of charge 
recommended by the manufacturer, as stated in the vehicle operator's 
manual or on a label that is permanently attached to the vehicle, or, if 
the manufacturer has made no recommendation, at a state of charge of not 
less than 95 percent. No further charging of any propulsion battery 
occurs during any of the performance tests in the test sequence of this 
standard. If the propulsion batteries are depleted during a test 
sequence such that the vehicle reaches automatic shut-down, will not 
accelerate, or the low state of charge brake warning lamp is 
illuminated, the vehicle is to be accelerated to brake test speed by 
auxiliary means. If a battery is replaced rather than recharged, the 
replacement battery shall be charged and measured for state of charge in 
accordance with these procedures.
    S6.3.12 State of charge of batteries for electrically-actuated 
service brakes. A vehicle equipped with electrically-actuated service 
brakes also performs the following test series. Conduct 10 stopping 
tests from a speed of 100 kph or the maximum vehicle speed, whichever is 
less. At least two of the 10 stopping distances must be less than or 
equal to 70 meters. The vehicle is loaded to GVWR and the transmission 
is in the neutral position when the service brake control is actuated 
and throughout the remainder of the test. Each battery providing power 
to the electrically-actuated service brakes, shall be in a depleted 
state of charge for conditions (a), (b), or (c) of this paragraph as 
appropriate. An auxiliary means may be used to accelerate an EV to test 
speed.
    (a) For an EV equipped with electrically-actuated service brakes 
deriving power from the propulsion batteries and with automatic shut-
down capability of the propulsion motor(s), the propulsion batteries are 
at not more than five percent above the EV actual automatic shut-down 
critical value. The critical value is determined by measuring the state-
of-charge of each propulsion battery at the instant that automatic shut-
down occurs.
    (b) For an EV equipped with electrically-actuated service brakes 
deriving power from the propulsion batteries and with no automatic shut-
down capability of the propulsion

[[Page 408]]

motor(s), the propulsion batteries are at an average of not more than 
five percent above the actual state of charge at which the brake failure 
warning signal, required by S5.5.1(e) of this standard, is illuminated.
    (c) For a vehicle which has one or more auxiliary batteries that 
provides electrical energy to operate the electrically-actuated service 
brakes, each auxiliary battery is at not more than five percent above 
the actual state of charge at which the brake failure warning signal, 
required by S5.5.1(e) of this standard, is illuminated.
    S6.3.13 Electric vehicles.
    S6.3.13.1 (a) For an EV equipped with an RBS that is part of the 
service brake system, the RBS is operational during the burnish and all 
tests, except for the test of a failed RBS.
    (b) For an EV equipped with an RBS that is not part of the service 
brake system, the RBS is operational and set to produce the maximum 
regenerative braking effect during the burnish, and is disabled during 
the test procedures. If the vehicle is equipped with a neutral gear that 
automatically disables the RBS, the test procedures which are designated 
to be conducted in gear may be conducted in neutral.
    S6.3.13.2 For tests conducted ''in neutral'', the operator of an EV 
with no ''neutral'' position (or other means such as a clutch for 
disconnecting the drive train from the propulsion motor(s)) does not 
apply any electromotive force to the propulsion motor(s). Any 
electromotive force that is applied to the propulsion motor(s) 
automatically remains in effect unless otherwise specified by the test 
procedure.
    S6.4. Instrumentation.
    S6.4.1. Brake temperature measurement. The brake temperature is 
measured by plug-type thermocouples installed in the approximate center 
of the facing length and width of the most heavily loaded shoe or disc 
pad, one per brake, as shown in Figure 1. A second thermocouple may be 
installed at the beginning of the test sequence if the lining wear is 
expected to reach a point causing the first thermocouple to contact the 
metal rubbing surface of a drum or rotor. For center-grooved shoes or 
pads, thermocouples are installed within 3 mm (.12 in) to 6 mm (.24 in) 
of the groove and as close to the center as possible.
    S6.4.2. Brake line pressure measurement for the torque wheel test. 
The vehicle shall be fitted with pressure transducers in each hydraulic 
circuit. On hydraulically proportioned circuits, the pressure transducer 
shall be downstream of the operative proportioning valve.
    S6.4.3. Brake torque measurement for the torque wheel test. The 
vehicle shall be fitted with torque wheels at each wheel position, 
including slip ring assemblies and wheel speed indicators to permit 
wheel lock to be detected.

    S6.5. Procedural conditions.
    S6.5.1. Brake control. All service brake system performance 
requirements, including the partial system requirements of S7.7, S7.10 
and S7.11, must be met solely by use of the service brake control.
    S6.5.2. Test speeds. If a vehicle is incapable of attaining the 
specified normal test speed, it is tested at a speed that is a multiple 
of 5 km/h (3.1 mph) that is 4 to 8 km/h (2.5 to 5.0 mph) less than its 
maximum speed and its performance must be within a stopping distance 
given by the formula provided for the specific requirement.
    S6.5.3. Stopping distance.
    S6.5.3.1. The braking performance of a vehicle is determined by 
measuring the stopping distance from a given initial speed.
    S6.5.3.2. Unless otherwise specified, the vehicle is stopped in the 
shortest distance achievable (best effort) on all stops. Where more than 
one stop is required for a given set of test conditions, a vehicle is 
deemed to comply with the corresponding stopping distance requirements 
if at least one of the stops is made within the prescribed distance.
    S6.5.3.3. In the stopping distance formulas given for each 
applicable test (such as S<ls-thn-eq>0.10V+0.0060V<SUP>2</SUP>), S is 
the maximum stopping distance in meters, and V is the test speed in km/
h.
    S6.5.4. Vehicle position and attitude.
    S6.5.4.1. The vehicle is aligned in the center of the lane at the 
start of each brake application. Steering corrections are permitted 
during each stop.
    S6.5.4.2. Stops are made without any part of the vehicle leaving the 
lane and without rotation of the vehicle about its vertical axis of more 
than <plus-minus>15 deg. from the center line of the test lane at any 
time during any stop.
    S6.5.5. Transmission selector control.
    S6.5.5.1. For tests in neutral, a stop or snub is made in accordance 
with the following procedures:
    (a) Exceed the test speed by 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph);
    (b) Close the throttle and coast in gear to approximately 3 km/h 
(1.9 mph) above the test speed;
    (c) Shift to neutral; and
    (d) When the test speed is reached, apply the brakes.
    S6.5.5.2. For tests in gear, a stop or snub is made in accordance 
with the following procedures:
    (a) With the transmission selector in the control position 
recommended by the manufacturer for driving on a level surface at the 
applicable test speed, exceed the test speed by 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 
mph);
    (b) Close the throttle and coast in gear; and
    (c) When the test speed is reached apply the brakes.
    (d) To avoid engine stall, a manual transmission may be shifted to 
neutral (or the clutch disengaged) when the vehicle speed is below 30 
km/h (18.6 mph).
    S6.5.6. Initial brake temperature (IBT). If the lower limit of the 
specified IBT for the first stop in a test sequence (other than a 
parking brake grade holding test) has not been reached, the brakes are 
heated to the IBT by making one or more brake applications from a speed 
of 50 km/h (31.1 mph), at a deceleration rate not greater than 3 m/s\2\ 
(9.8 fps\2\).
    S7. Road test procedures and performance requirements. Each vehicle 
shall meet all the applicable requirements of this section, when tested 
according to the conditions and procedures set forth below and in S6, in 
the sequence specified in Table 1:

    S7.1. Burnish.
    S7.1.1. General information. Any pretest instrumentation checks are 
conducted as part of the burnish procedure, including any necessary 
rechecks after instrumentation repair, replacement or adjustment. 
Instrumentation check test conditions must be in accordance with the 
burnish test procedure specified in S7.1.2 and S7.1.3.
    S7.1.2. Vehicle conditions. (a) Vehicle load: GVWR only.
    (b) Transmission position: In gear.
    S7.1.3. Test conditions and procedures. The road test surface

IBT: <ls-thn-eq>100  deg.C (212  deg.F).
    (b) Test speed: 80 km/h (49.7 mph).
    (c) Pedal force: Adjust as necessary to maintain specified constant 
deceleration rate.
    (d) Deceleration rate: Maintain a constant deceleration rate of 3.0 
m/s\2\ (9.8 fps\2\).
    (e) Wheel lockup: No lockup of any wheel allowed for longer than 0.1 
seconds at speeds greater than 15 km/h (9.3 mph).
    (f) Number of runs: 200 stops.
    (g) Interval between runs: The interval from the start of one 
service brake application to the start of the next is either the time 
necessary to reduce the IBT to 100  deg.C (212  deg.F) or less, or the 
distance of 2 km (1.24 miles), whichever occurs first.
    (h) Accelerate to 80 km/h (49.7 mph) after each stop and maintain 
that speed until making the next stop.
    (i) After burnishing, adjust the brakes as specified in S6.3.4.
    S7.2  Wheel lockup sequence.
    S7.2.1  General information. (a) The purpose of this test is to 
ensure that lockup of both front wheels occurs either simultaneously 
with, or at a lower deceleration rate than, the lockup of both rear 
wheels, when tested on road surfaces affording adhesion such that wheel 
lockup of the first axle occurs at a braking ratio of between 0.15 and 
0.80, inclusive.
    (b) This test is for vehicles without antilock brake systems.
    (c) This wheel lock sequence test is to be used as a screening test 
to evaluate a vehicle's axle lockup sequence and to determine whether 
the torque wheel test in S7.4 must be conducted.
    (d) For this test, a simultaneous lockup of the front and rear 
wheels refers to the conditions when the time interval between the first 
occurrence of lockup of the last (second) wheel on the rear axle and the 
first occurrence of lockup of the last (second) wheel on the front axle 
is <ls-thn-eq> 0.1 second for vehicle speeds > 15 km/h (9.3 mph).
    (e) A front or rear axle lockup is defined as the point in time when 
the last (second) wheel on an axle locks up.
    (f) Vehicles that lock their front axle simultaneously or at lower 
deceleration rates than their rear axle need not be tested to the torque 
wheel procedure.
    (g) Vehicles which lock their rear axle at deceleration rates lower 
than the front axle shall also be tested in accordance with the torque 
wheel procedure in S7.4.
    (h) Any determination of noncompliance for failing adhesion 
utilization requirements shall be based on torque wheel test results.
    S7.2.2  Vehicle conditions. (a) Vehicle load: GVWR and LLVW.
    (b) Transmission position: In neutral.
    S7.2.3. Test Conditions and Procedures. (a) IBT: <ls-thn-eq>65 
deg.C (149  deg.F), <ls-thn-eq>100  deg.C (212  deg.F).
    (b) Test speed: 65 km/h (40.4 mph) for a braking ratio <ls-thn-eq> 
0.50; 100 km/h (62.1 mph) for a braking ratio > 0.50.
    (c) Pedal force:
    (1) Pedal force is applied and controlled by the vehicle driver or 
by a mechanical brake pedal actuator.
    (2) Pedal force is increased at a linear rate such that the first 
axle lockup occurs no less than one-half (0.5) second and no more than 
one and one-half (1.5) seconds after the initial application of the 
pedal.
    (3) The pedal is released when the second axle locks, or when the 
pedal force reaches 1kN (225 lbs), or 0.1 seconds after first axle 
lockup, whichever occurs first.
    (d) Wheel lockup: Only wheel lockups above a vehicle speed of 15 km/
h (9.3 mph) are considered in determining the results of this test.

[[Page 412]]

    (e) Test surfaces: This test is conducted, for each loading 
condition, on two different test surfaces that will result in a braking 
ratio of between 0.15 and 0.80, inclusive. NHTSA reserves the right to 
choose the test surfaces to be used based on adhesion utilization curves 
or any other method of determining ``worst case'' conditions.
    (f) The data recording equipment shall have a minimum sampling rate 
of 40 Hz.
    (g) Data to be recorded. The following information must be 
automatically recorded in phase continuously throughout each test run 
such that values of the variables can be cross referenced in real time.
    (1) Vehicle speed.
    (2) Brake pedal force.
    (3) Angular velocity at each wheel.
    (4) Actual instantaneous vehicle deceleration or the deceleration 
calculated by differentiation of the vehicle speed.
    (h) Speed channel filtration. For analog instrumentation, the speed 
channel shall be filtered by using a low-pass filter having a cut-off 
frequency of less than one fourth the sampling rate.
    (i) Test procedure. For each test surface, three runs meeting the 
pedal force application and time for wheel lockup requirements shall be 
made. Up to a total of six runs will be allowed to obtain three valid 
runs. Only the first three valid runs obtained shall be used for data

vehicle shall be capable of meeting the test requirements on all test 
surfaces that will result in a braking ratio of between 0.15 and 0.80, 
inclusive.
    (b) If all three valid runs on each surface result in the front axle 
locking before or simultaneously with the rear axle, or the front axle 
locks up with only one or no wheels locking on the rear axle, the torque 
wheel procedure need not be run, and the vehicle is considered to meet 
the adhesion utilization requirements of this Standard. This performance 
requirement shall be met for all vehicle braking ratios between 0.15 and 
0.80.
    (c) If any one of the three valid runs on any surface results in the 
rear axle locking before the front axle or the rear axle locks up with 
only one or no wheels locking on the front axle the torque wheel 
procedure shall be performed. This performance requirement shall be met 
for all vehicle braking ratios between 0.15 and 0.80.
    (d) If any one of the three valid runs on any surface results in 
neither axle locking (i.e., only one or no wheels locked on each axle) 
before a pedal force of 1kN (225 lbs) is reached, the vehicle shall be 
tested to the torque wheel procedure.
    (e) If the conditions listed in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section 
occur, vehicle compliance shall be determined from the results of a 
torque wheel test performed in accordance with S7.4.

(brake factor) and pressure axis intercept (brake hold-off pressure) of 
the linear least squares equation best describing the measured torque 
output at each braked wheel as a function of measured line pressure

    S9. Orthogonal Reference System. The approach angles specified in 
S8.13.4 are determined using the reference system specified in S9.1 
through S9.4.
    S9.1 An orthogonal reference system consisting of a longitudinal X 
axis and a transverse Y axis in the same horizontal plane and a vertical 
Z axis through the intersection of X and Y is used to define the 
horizontal direction of approach of the headform. The X-Z plane is the 
vertical longitudinal zero plane and is parallel to the longitudinal 
centerline of the vehicle. The X-Y plane is the horizontal zero plane 
parallel to the ground. The Y-Z plane is the vertical transverse zero 
plane that is perpendicular to the X-Y and X-Z planes. The X coordinate 
is negative forward of the Y-Z plane and positive to the rear. The Y 
coordinate is negative to the left of the X-Z plane and positive to the 
right. The Z coordinate is negative below the X-Y plane and positive 
above it. (See Figure 1.)
    S9.2  The origin of the reference system is the center of gravity of 
the headform at the time immediately prior to launch for each test.
    S9.3  The horizontal approach angle is the angle between the X axis 
and the headform impact velocity vector projected onto the horizontal 
zero plane, measured in the horizontal zero plane in the counter-
clockwise direction. A 0 degree horizontal vector and a 360 degree 
horizontal vector point in the positive X direction; a 90 degree 
horizontal vector points in the positive Y direction; a 180 degree 
horizontal vector points in the negative X direction; and a 270 
horizontal degree vector

[[Page 431]]

points in the negative Y direction. (See Figure 2.)
    S9.4  The vertical approach angle is the angle between the 
horizontal plane and the velocity vector, measured in the midsagittal 
plane of the headform. A 0 degree vertical vector in Table I coincides 
with the horizontal plane and a vertical vector of greater than 0 
degrees in Table I makes a upward angle of the same number of degrees 
with that plane.
    S10  Target Locations.
    (a) The target locations specified in S10.1 through S10.13 are 
located on both sides of the vehicle and, except as specified in S10(b), 
are determined using the procedures specified in those paragraphs.
    (b) Except as specified in S10(c), if there is no combination of 
horizontal and vertical angles specified in S8.13.4 at which the 
forehead impact zone of free motion headform can contact one of the 
targets located using the procedures in S10.1 through S10.13, the center 
of that target is moved to any location within a sphere with a radius of 
25 mm, centered on the center of the original target and measured along 
the vehicle interior, which the forehead impact zone can contact at one 
or more combination of angles.
    (c) If there is no point within the sphere specified in S10(b) which 
the forehead impact zone of the free motion headform can contact at one 
or more combination of horizontal and vertical angles specified in 
S8.13.4, the radius of the sphere is increased by 25 mm increments until 
the sphere contains at least one point that can be contacted at one or 
more combination of angles.
    S10.1  A-pillar targets
    (a) A-pillar reference point and target AP1. On the vehicle 
exterior, locate a transverse vertical plane (Plane 1) which contacts 
the rearmost point of the windshield trim. The intersection of Plane 1 
and the vehicle exterior surface is Line 1. Measuring along the vehicle 
exterior surface, locate a point (Point 1) on Line 1 that is 125 mm 
inboard of the intersection of Line 1 and a vertical plane tangent to 
the vehicle at the outboardmost point on Line 1 with the vehicle side 
door open. Measuring along the vehicle exterior surface in a 
longitudinal vertical plane (Plane 2) passing through Point 1, locate a 
point (Point 2) 50 mm rearward of Point 1. Locate the A-pillar reference 
point (Point APR) at the intersection of the interior roof surface and a

Sec. 571.207  Standard No. 207; Seating systems.

    S1. Purpose and scope. This standard establishes requirements for 
seats, their attachment assemblies, and their installation to minimize 
the possibility of their failure by forces acting on them as a result of 
vehicle impact.
    S2. Application. This standard applies to passenger cars, 
multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks and buses.
    S3. Definitions. Occupant seat means a seat that provides at least 
one designated seating position.
    Seat adjuster means the part of the seat that provides forward and 
rearward positioning of the seat bench and back, and/or rotation around 
a vertical axis, including any fixed portion, such as a seat track. In 
the case of a seat equipped with seat adjusters at different levels, the 
term means the uppermost seat adjuster.
    S4. Requirements.
    S4.1  Driver's seat. Each vehicle shall have an occupant seat for 
the driver.
    S.4.2  General performance requirements. When tested in accordance 
with S5., each occupant seat, other than a side-facing seat or a 
passenger seat on a bus, shall withstand the following forces, in 
newtons.
    (a) In any position to which it can be adjusted--20 times the mass 
of the seat in kilograms multiplied by 9.8 applied in a forward 
longitudinal direction;
    (b) In any position to which it can be adjusted--20 times the mass 
of the seat in kilograms multiplied by 9.8 applied in a rearward 
longitudinal direction;
    (c) For a seat belt assembly attached to the seat--the force 
specified in paragraph (a), if it is a forward facing seat, or paragraph 
(b), if it is a rearward facing seat, in each case applied 
simultaneously with the forces imposed on the seat by the seat belt 
assembly when it is loaded in accordance with S4.2 of Sec. 571.210; and
    (d) In its rearmost position--a force that produces a 373 newton 
meters moment about the seating reference point for each designated 
seating position that the seat provides, applied to the upper cross-
member of the seat back or the upper seat back, in a rearward 
longitudinal direction for forward-facing seats and in a forward 
longitudinal direction for rearward-facing seats.
    4.2.1  Seat adjustment. Except for vertical movement of nonlocking 
suspension type occupant seats in trucks or buses, each seat shall 
remain in its adjusted position when tested in accordance with the test 
procedures specified in S5.
    S4.3. Restraining device for hinged or folding seats or seat backs. 
Except for a passenger seat in a bus or a seat having a back that is 
adjustable only for the comfort of its occupants, a hinged or folding 
occupant seat or occupant seat back shall--
    (a) Be equipped with a self-locking device for restraining the 
hinged or folding seat or seat back, and
    (b) If there are any designated seating positions or auxiliary 
seating accommodations behind the seat, either immediately to the rear 
or to the sides, be equipped with a control for releasing that 
restraining device.
    S4.3.1  Accessibility of release control. If there is a designated 
seating position immediately behind a seat equipped with a restraining 
device, the control for releasing the device shall be readily accessible 
to the occupant of the seat equipped with the device and, if access to

occupant of the designated seating position immediately behind the seat.
    S4.3.2  Performance of restraining device.
    S4.3.2.1  Static force. (a) Once engaged, the restraining device for 
a forward-facing seat shall not release or fail when a forward 
longitudinal force, in newtons, equal to 20 times the mass of the hinged 
or folding portion of the seat in kilograms multiplied by 9.8 is applied 
through the center of gravity of that portion of the seat.
    (b) Once engaged, the restraining device for a rearward-facing seat 
shall not release or fail when a rearward longitudinal force, in 
newtons, equal to 8 times the mass of the hinged or folding portion of 
the seat in kilograms multiplied by 9.8 is applied through the center of 
gravity of that portion of the seat.

[[Page 452]]

    S4.3.2.2  Acceleration. Once engaged, the restraining device shall 
not release or fail when the device is subjected to an acceleration of 
20 g., in the longitudinal direction opposite to that in which the seat 
folds.
    S4.4  Labeling. Seats not designated for occupancy while the vehicle 
is in motion shall be conspicuously labeled to that effect.
    S5. Test procedures.
    S5.1  Apply the forces specified in S4.2(a) and S4.2(b) as follows:
    S5.1.1  For a seat whose seat back and seat bench are attached to 
the vehicle by the same attachments. (a) For a seat whose seat back and 
seat bench are attached to the vehicle by the same attachments and whose 
height is adjustable, the loads are applied when the seat is in its 
highest adjustment position in accordance with the procedure or 
procedures specified in S5.1.1(a)(1), S5.1.1(a)(2), or S5.1.1(a)(3), as 
appropriate.
    (1) For a seat whose center of gravity is in a horizontal plane that 
is above the seat adjuster or that passes through any part of the 
adjuster, use, at the manufacturer's option, either S5.1.1(b) or, if 
physically possible, S5.1.1(c).
    (2) For a seat specified in S5.1.1(a)(1) for which it is not 
physically possible to follow the procedure in S5.1.1(c), use S5.1.1(b).
    (3) For a seat whose center of gravity is in a horizontal plane that 
is below the seat adjuster, use S5.1.1(c).
    (4) For all other seats whose seat back and seat bench are attached 
to the vehicle by the same attachments, use S5.1.1(b).
    (b) Secure a strut on each side of the seat from a point on the 
outside of the seat frame in the horizontal plane of the seat's center 
of gravity to a point on the frame as far forward as possible of the 
seat anchorages. Between the upper ends of the struts attach a rigid 
cross-member, in front of the seat back frame for rearward loading and 
behind the seat back frame for forward loading. Apply the force 
specified by S4.2(a) or S4.2(b) horizontally through the rigid cross-
member as shown in Figure 1.
    (c) Find ``cg<INF>1</INF>,'' the center of gravity of the portion of 
the seat that is above the lowest surface of the seat adjuster. On each 
side of the seat, secure a strut from a point on the outside of the seat 
frame in the horizontal plane of cg<INF>1</INF> to a point on the frame 
as far forward as possible of the seat adjusted position. Between the 
upper ends of the struts attach a rigid cross-member, in front of the 
seat back frame for rearward loading and behind the seat back frame for 
forward loading. Find ``cg<INF>2</INF>,'' the center of gravity of the 
portion of the seat that is below the seat adjuster. Apply a force 
horizontally through cg<INF>1</INF> equal to 20 times the weight of the 
portion of the seat represented by cg<INF>1</INF>, and simultaneously 
apply a force horizontally through cg<INF>2</INF> equal to 20 times the 
weight of the portion of the seat represented by cg<INF>2</INF>.
    S5.1.2  If the seat back and the seat bench are attached to the 
vehicle by different attachments, attach to each component a fixture 
capable of transmitting a force to that component. Apply forces, in 
newtons, equal to 20 times the mass of the seat in kilograms multiplied 
by 9.8 horizontally through the center of gravity of the seat back, as 
shown in Figure 2 and apply forces, in newtons, equal to 20 times the 
mass of the seat in kilograms multiplied by 9.8 horizontally through the 
center of gravity of the seat bench, as shown in Figure 3.
    S5.2  Develop the moment specified in S4.2(d) as shown in Figure 4.
    S5.3  Apply the forces specified in S4.3.2.1(a) and (b) to a hinged 
or folding seat as shown in Figure 1 and to a hinged or folding seat 
back as shown in Figure 5.
    S5.4  Determine the center of gravity of a seat or seat component 
with all cushions and upholstery in place and with the head restraint in 
its fully extended design position.

option of the manufacturer, either by the belt latch mechanism not being 
fastened, or by the belt not being extended at least 4 inches from its 
stowed position.
    S7.4  Seat belt comfort and convenience.
    (a) Automatic seat belts. Automatic seat belts installed in any 
vehicle, other than walk-in van-type vehicles, which has a gross vehicle 
weight rating of 10,000 pounds or less, and which is manufactured on or 
after September 1, 1986, shall meet the requirements of S7.4.1, S7.4.2, 
and S7.4.3.
    (b) Manual seat belts.
    (1) Vehicles manufactured after September 1, 1986. Manual seat belts 
installed in any vehicle, other than manual Type 2 belt systems 
installed in the front outboard seating positions in passenger cars or 
manual belts in walk-in van-type vehicles, which have a gross vehicle 
weight rating of 10,000 pounds or less, shall meet the requirements of 
S7.4.3, S7.4.4, S7.4.5, and S7.4.6.
    (2) Vehicles manufactured after September 1, 1989.
    (i) If the automatic restraint requirement of S4.1.4 is rescinded 
pursuant to S4.1.5, then manual seat belts installed in a passenger car 
shall meet the requirements of S7.1.1.3(a), S7.4.2, S7.4.3, S7.4.4, 
S7.4.5, and S7.4.6.
    (ii) Manual seat belts installed in a bus, multipurpose passenger

    S7.4.1  Convenience hooks. Any manual convenience hook or other 
device that is provided to stow seat belt webbing to facilitate entering 
or exiting the vehicle shall automatically release the webbing when the 
automatic belt system is otherwise operational and shall remain in the 
released mode for as long as (a) exists simultaneously with (b), or, at 
the manufacturer's option, for as long as (a) exists simultaneously with 
(c)--
    (a) The vehicle ignition switch is moved to the ``on'' or ``start'' 
position;
    (b) The vehicle's drive train is engaged;
    (c) The vehicle's parking brake is in the released mode 
(nonengaged).
    S7.4.2  Webbing tension-relieving device. Each vehicle with an 
automatic seat belt assembly or with a Type 2 manual seat belt assembly 
that must meet the occupant crash protection requirements of S5.1 of 
this standard installed at a front outboard designated seating position, 
and each vehicle with a Type 2 manual seat belt assembly installed at a 
rear outboard designated seating position in compliance with a 
requirement of this standard, that has either automatic or manual 
tension-relieving devices permitting the introduction of slack in the 
webbing of the shoulder belt (e.g., ``comfort clips'' or ``window-
shade'' devices) shall:
    (a) Comply with the requirements of S5.1 with the shoulder belt 
webbing adjusted to introduce the maximum amount of slack recommended by 
the vehicle manufacturer pursuant to S7.4.2(b).
    (b) Have a section in the vehicle owner's manual that explains how 
the tension-relieving device works and specifies the maximum amount of 
slack (in inches) recommended by the vehicle

[[Page 478]]

manufacturer to be introduced into the shoulder belt under normal use 
conditions. The explanation shall also warn that introducing slack 
beyond the amount specified by the manufacturer could significantly 
reduce the effectiveness of the shoulder belt in a crash; and
    (c) Have, except for open-body vehicles with no doors, an automatic 
means to cancel any shoulder belt slack introduced into the belt system 
by a tension-relieving device. In the case of an automatic safety belt 
system, cancellation of the tension-relieving device shall occur each 
time the adjacent vehicle door is opened. In the case of a manual seat 
belt required to meet S5.1, cancellation of the tension-relieving device 
shall occur, at the manufacturer's option, either each time the adjacent 
door is opened or each time the latchplate is released from the buckle. 
In the case of a Type 2 manual seat belt assembly installed at a rear 
outboard designated seating position, cancellation of the tension-
relieving device shall occur, at the manufacturer's option either each 
time the door designed to allow the occupant of that seating position 
entry and egress of the vehicle is opened or each time the latchplate is 
released from the buckle. In the case of open-body vehicles with no 
doors, cancellation of the tension-relieving device may be done by a 
manual means.
    S7.4.3  Belt contact force. Except for manual or automatic seat belt 
assemblies that incorporate a webbing tension-relieving device, the 
upper torso webbing of any seat belt assembly shall not exert more than 
0.7 pounds of contact force when measured normal to and one inch from 
the chest of an anthropomorphic test dummy, positioned in accordance 
with S10 of this standard in the seating position for which that seat 
belt assembly is provided, at the point where the centerline of the 
torso belt crosses the midsagittal line on the dummy's chest.
    S7.4.4  Latchplate access. Any seat belt assembly latchplate that is 
located outboard of a front outboard seating position in accordance with 
S4.1.2 shall also be located within the outboard reach envelope of 
either the outboard arm or the inboard arm described in S10.7 and Figure 
3 of this standard, when the latchplate is in its normal stowed position 
and any adjustable anchorages are adjusted to the manufacturer's nominal 
design position for a 50th percentile adult male occupant. There shall 
be sufficient clearance between the vehicle seat and the side of the 
vehicle interior to allow the test block defined in Figure 4 of this 
standard unhindered transit to the latchplate or buckle.
    S7.4.5  Retraction. When tested under the conditions of S8.1.2 and 
S8.1.3, with anthropomorphic dummies whose arms have been removed and 
which are positioned in accordance with S10 of this standard in the 
front outboard seating positions and restrained by the belt systems for 
those positions, the torso and lap belt webbing of any of those seat 
belt systems shall automatically retract to a stowed position either 
when the adjacent vehicle door is in the open position and the seat belt 
latchplate is released, or, at the option of the manufacturer, when the 
latchplate is released. That stowed position shall prevent any part of 
the webbing or hardware from being pinched when the adjacent vehicle 
door is closed. A belt system with a tension-relieving device in an 
open-bodied vehicle with no doors shall fully retract when the tension-
relieving device is deactivated. For the purposes of these retraction 
requirements, outboard armrests, which are capable of being stowed, on 
vehicle seats shall be placed in their stowed position.
    S7.4.6  Seat belt guides and hardware.
    S7.4.6.1  (a) Any manual seat belt assembly whose webbing is 
designed to pass through the seat cushion or between the seat cushion 
and seat back shall be designed to maintain one of the following three 
seat belt parts (the seat belt latchplate, the buckle, or the seat belt 
webbing) on top of or above the seat cushion under normal conditions 
(i.e., conditions other than when belt hardware is intentionally pushed 
behind the seat by a vehicle occupant). In addition, the remaining two 
seat belt parts must be accessible under normal conditions.
    (b) The requirements of S7.4.6.1(a) do not apply to: (1) seats whose 
seat cushions are movable so that the seat back

[[Page 479]]

serves a function other than seating, (2) seats which are removable, or 
(3) seats which are movable so that the space formerly occupied by the 
seat can be used for a secondary function.
    S7.4.6.2  The buckle and latchplate of a manual seat belt assembly 
subject to S7.4.6.1 shall not pass through the guides or conduits 
provided for in S7.4.6.1 and fall behind the seat when the events listed 
below occur in the order specified: (a) The belt is completely retracted 
or, if the belt is nonretractable, the belt is unlatched; (b) the seat 
is moved to any position to which it is designed to be adjusted; and (c) 
the seat back, if foldable, is folded forward as far as possible and 
then moved backward into position. The inboard receptacle end of a seat 
belt assembly installed at a front outboard designated seating position 
shall be accessible with the center arm rest in any position to which it 
can be adjusted (without having to move the armrest).
    S8. Test conditions.
    S8.1  General conditions. The following conditions apply to the 
frontal, lateral, and rollover tests. Except for S8.1.1(d), the 
following conditions apply to the alternative unbelted sled test set 
forth in S13 from March 19, 1997 until September 1, 2001.
    S8.1.1  Except as provided in paragraph (c) of S8.1.1, the vehicle, 
including test devices and instrumentation, is loaded as follows:
    (a) Passenger cars. A passenger car is loaded to its unloaded 
vehicle weight plus its rated cargo and luggage capacity weight, secured 
in the luggage area, plus the weight of the necessary anthropomorphic 
test devices.
    (b) Multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, and buses. A 
multipurpose passenger vehicle, truck, or bus is loaded to its unloaded 
vehicle weight plus 300 pounds or its rated cargo and luggage capacity 
weight, whichever is less, secured in the load carrying area and 
distributed as nearly as possible in proportion to its gross axle weight 
ratings, plus the weight of the necessary anthropomorphic test devices. 
For the purposes of Sec. 8.1.1, unloaded vehicle weight does not include 
the weight of work-performing accessories. Vehicles are tested to a 
maximum unloaded vehicle weight of 5,500 pounds.
    (c) Fuel system capacity. With the test vehicle on a level surface, 
pump the fuel from the vehicle's fuel tank and then operate the engine 
until it stops. Then, add Stoddard solvent to the test vehicle's fuel 
tank in an amount which is equal to not less than 92 and not more than 
94 percent of the fuel tank's usable capacity stated by the vehicle's 
manufacturer. In addition, add the amount of Stoddard solvent needed to 
fill the entire fuel system from the fuel tank through the engine's 
induction system.
    (d) Vehicle test attitude. Determine the distance between a level 
surface and a standard reference point on the test vehicle's body, 
directly above each wheel opening, when the vehicle is in its ``as 
delivered'' condition. The ``as delivered'' condition is the vehicle as 
received at the test site, with 100 percent of all fluid capacities and 
all tires inflated to the manufacturer's specifications as listed on the 
vehicle's tire placard. Determine the distance between the same level 
surface and the same standard reference points in the vehicle's ``fully 
loaded condition.'' The ``fully loaded condition'' is the test vehicle 
loaded in accordance with S8.1.1 (a) or (b), as applicable. The load 
placed in the cargo area shall be center over the longitudinal 
centerline of the vehicle. The pretest vehicle attitude shall be equal 
to either the as delivered or fully loaded attitude or between the as 
delivered attitude and the fully loaded attitude.
    S8.1.2  Adjustable seats are in the adjustment position midway 
between the forwardmost and rearmost positions, and if separately 
adjustable in a vertical direction, are at the lowest position. If an 
adjustment position does not exist midway between the forwardmost and 
rearmost positions, the closest adjustment position to the rear of the 
midpoint is used.
    S8.1.3  Place adjustable seat backs in the manufacturer's nominal 
design riding position in the manner specified by the manufacturer. 
Place any adjustable anchorages at the manufacturer's nominal design 
position for a 50th percentile adult male occupant. Place each 
adjustable head restraint in its

[[Page 480]]

highest adjustment position. Adjustable lumbar supports are positioned 
so that the lumbar support is in its lowest adjustment position.

    S8.1.4  Adjustable steering controls are adjusted so that the 
steering wheel hub is at the geometric center of the locus it describes 
when it is moved through its full range of driving positions.
    S8.1.5  Movable vehicle windows and vents are, at the manufacturer's 
option, placed in the fully closed position.
    S8.1.6  Convertibles and open-body type vehicles have the top, if 
any, in place in the closed passenger compartment configuration.
    S8.1.7  Doors are fully closed and latched but not locked.
    S8.1.8  Anthropomorphic test dummies.
    S8.1.8.1  The anthropomorphic test dummies used for evaluation of 
occupant protection systems manufactured pursuant to applicable portions 
of S4.1.2, S4.1.3, and S4.1.4 of this standard shall conform to the 
requirements of subpart E of part 572 of this chapter.
    S8.1.8.2  Each test dummy is clothed in formfitting cotton stretch 
garments with short sleeves and midcalf length pants specified in 
drawings 78051-292 and 78051-293 incorporated by reference in part 572, 
subpart E of this chapter, respectively or their equivalents. A size 
11EE shoe specified in drawings 78051-294 (left) and 78051-295 (right) 
incorporated by reference in part 572, subpart E of this chapter, or its 
equivalent is placed on each foot of the test dummy.
    S8.1.8.3  Limb joints are set at 1g, barely restraining the weight 
of the limb when extended horizontally. Leg joints are adjusted with the 
torso in the supine position.
    S8.1.8.4  Instrumentation does not affect the motion of the dummies 
during impact or rollover.
    S8.1.8.5  The stabilized test temperature of the test dummy is at 
any temperature level between 69 degrees F and 72 degrees F, inclusive.
    S8.2  Lateral moving barrier crash test conditions. The following 
conditions apply to the lateral moving barrier crash test.
    S8.2.1  The moving barrier, including the impact surface, supporting 
structure, and carriage, weighs 4,000 pounds.
    S8.2.2  The impact surface of the barrier is a vertical, rigid, flat 
rectangle, 78 inches wide and 60 inches high, perpendicular to its 
direction of movement, with its lower edge horizontal and 5 inches above 
the ground surface.
    S8.2.3  During the entire impact sequence the barrier undergoes no 
significant amount of dynamic or static deformation, and absorbs no 
significant portion of the energy resulting from the impact, except for 
energy that results in translational rebound movement of the barrier.
    S8.2.4  During the entire impact sequence the barrier is guided so 
that it travels in a straight line, with no significant lateral, 
vertical or rotational movement.
    S8.2.5  The concrete surface upon which the vehicle is tested is 
level, rigid and of uniform construction, with a skidnumber of 75 when 
measured in accordance with American Society for Testing and Materials 
Method E-274-65T at 40 m.p.h., omitting water delivery as specified in 
paragraph 7.1 of that method.
    S8.2.6  The tested vehicle's brakes are disengaged and the 
transmission is in neutral.
    S8.2.7  The barrier and the test vehicle are positioned so that at 
impact--
    (a) The vehicle is at rest in its normal attitude;
    (b) The barrier is traveling in a direction perpendicular to the 
longitudinal axis of the vehicle at 20 m.p.h.; and
    (c) A vertical plane through the geometric center of the barrier 
impact surface and perpendicular to that surface passes through the 
driver's seating reference point in the tested vehicle.
    S8.3  Rollover test conditions. The following conditions apply to 
the rollover test.
    S8.3.1  The tested vehicle's brakes are disengaged and the 
transmission is in neutral.
    S8.3.2  The concrete surface on which the test is conducted is 
level, rigid, of uniform construction, and of a sufficient size that the 
vehicle remains on it throughout the entire rollover cycle.

[[Page 481]]

It has a skid number of 75 when measured in accordance with American 
Society for Testing and Materials Method E-274-65T at 40 m.p.h. omitting 
water delivery as specified in paragraph 7.1 of that method.
    S8.3.3  The vehicle is placed on a device, similar to that 
illustrated in Figure 2, having a platform in the form of a flat, rigid 
plane at an angle of 23 deg. from the horizontal. At the lower edge of 
the platform is an unyielding flange, perpendicular to the platform with 
a height of 4 inches and a length sufficient to hold in place the tires 
that rest against it. The intersection of the inner face of the flange 
with the upper face of the platform is 9 inches above the rollover 
surface. No other restraints are used to hold the vehicle in position 
during the deceleration of the platform and the departure of the 
vehicle.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AU91.084

    S8.3.4  With the vehicle on the test platform, the test devices 
remain as nearly as possible in the posture specified in S8.1.
    S8.3.5  Before the deceleration pulse, the platform is moving 
horizontally, and perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the 
vehicle, at a constant speed of 30 m.p.h. for a sufficient period of 
time for the vehicle to become motionless relative to the platform.
    S8.3.6  The platform is decelerated from 30 to 0 m.p.h. in a 
distance of not more than 3 feet, without change of direction and 
without transverse or rotational movement during the deceleration of the 
platform and the departure of the vehicle. The deceleration rate is at 
least 20g for a minimum of 0.04 seconds.
    S8.4  Frontal test condition. If the vehicle is equipped with a 
cutoff device permitted by S4.5.4 of this standard, the device is 
deactivated.
    S9. Pressure vessels and explosive devices.
    S9.1  Pressure vessels. A pressure vessel that is continuously 
pressurized shall conform to the requirements of Secs. 178.65-2, 178.65-
6(b), 178.65-7, 178.65-9 (a) and (b), and 178.65-10 of this title. It 
shall not leak or evidence visible distortion when tested in accordance 
with Sec. 178.65-11(a) of this title and shall not fail in any of the 
ways enumerated in Sec. 178.65-11(b) of this title when hydrostatically 
tested to destruction. It shall not crack when flattened in accordance 
with Sec. 178.65-12(a) of this title to the limit specified in 
Sec. 178.65-12(a)(4) of this title.
    S9.2  Explosive devices. An explosive device shall not exhibit any 
of the characteristics prohibited by Sec. 173.51 of this title. All 
explosive material shall be enclosed in a structure that is capable of 
containing the explosive energy

[[Page 482]]

without sudden release of pressure except through overpressure relief 
devices or parts designed to release the pressure during actuation.
    S10.  Test dummy positioning procedures.
    S10.1  Head. The transverse instrumentation platform of the head 
shall be level within \1/2\ degree. To level the head of the test dummy, 
the following sequences must be followed. First, adjust the position of 
the H point within the limits set forth in S10.4.2.1 to level the 
transverse instrumentation platform of the head of the test dummy. If 
the transverse instrumentation platform of the head is still not level, 
then adjust the pelvic angle of the test dummy within the limits 
specified in S10.4.2.2 of this standard. If the transverse 
instrumentation platform of the head is still not level, then adjust the 
neck bracket of the dummy the minimum amount necessary from the non-
adjusted ``0'' setting to ensure that the transverse instrumentation 
platform of the head is horizontal within \1/2\ degree. The test dummy 
shall remain within the limits specified in S10.4.2.1 and S10.4.2.2. 
after any adjustment of the neck bracket.

the driver and passenger test dummies shall rest against the seat back. 
The midsagittal plane of the driver dummy shall be vertical and parallel 
to the vehicle's longitudinal centerline, and pass through the center of 
the steering wheel rim. The midsagittal plane of the passenger dummy 
shall be vertical and parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal centerline 
and the same distance from the vehicle's longitudinal centerline as the 
midsagittal plane of the driver dummy.
    S10.4.1.2  In vehicles equipped with bucket seats, the upper torso 
of the driver and passenger test dummies shall rest against the seat 
back. The midsagittal plane of the driver and the passenger dummy shall 
be vertical and shall coincide with the longitudinal centerline of the 
bucket seat.
    S10.4.2    Lower Torso.
    S10.4.2.1  H-point. The H-points of the driver and passenger test 
dummies shall coincide within \1/2\ inch in the vertical dimension and 
\1/2\ inch in the horizontal dimension of a point \1/4\ inch below the 
position of the H-point determined by using the equipment and procedures 
specified in SAE J826 (APR 1980) except that the length of the lower leg 
and thigh segments of the H-point machine shall be adjusted to 16.3 and 
15.8 inches, respectively, instead of the 50th percentile values 
specified in Table 1 of SAE J826.
    S10.4.2.2  Pelvic angle. As determined using the pelvic angle gage 
(GM drawing 78051-532, incorporated by reference in part 572, subpart E 
of this chapter) which is inserted into the H-point gaging hole of the 
dummy, the angle measured from the horizontal on the three inch flat 
surface of the gage shall be 22\1/2\ degrees plus or minus 2\1/2\ 
degrees.
    S10.5  Legs. The upper legs of the driver and passenger test dummies 
shall rest against the seat cushion to the extent permitted by placement 
of the feet. The initial distance between the outboard knee clevis 
flange surfaces shall be 10.6 inches. To the extent practicable, the 
left leg of the driver dummy and both legs of the passenger dummy shall 
be in vertical longitudinal planes. To the extent practicable,

[[Page 483]]

the right leg of the driver dummy shall be in a vertical plane. Final 
adjustment to accommodate the placement of feet in accordance with S10.6 
for various passenger compartment configurations is permitted.
    S10.6  Feet.
    S10.6.1  Driver's position.
    S10.6.1.1  Rest the right foot of the test dummy on the undepressed 
accelerator pedal with the rearmost point of the heel on the floor pan 
in the plane of the pedal. If the foot cannot be placed on the 
accelerator pedal, set it initially perpendicular to the lower leg and 
place it as far forward as possible in the direction of the pedal 
centerline with the rearmost point of the heel resting on the floor pan.
    S10.6.1.2  Place the left foot on the toeboard with the rearmost 
point of the heel resting on the floor pan as close as possible to the 
point of intersection of the planes described by the toeboard and the 
floor pan and not on the wheelwell projection. If the foot cannot be 
positioned on the toeboard, set it initially perpendicular to the lower 
leg and place it as far forward as possible with the heel resting on the 
floor pan. If necessary to avoid contact with the vehicle's brake or 
clutch pedal, rotate the test dummy's left foot about the lower leg. If 
there is still pedal interference, rotate the left leg outboard about 
the hip the minimum distance necessary to avoid the pedal interference. 
For vehicles with a foot rest that does not elevate the left foot above 
the level of the right foot, place the left foot on the foot rest so 
that the upper and lower leg centerlines fall in a vertical plane.
    S10.6.2  Passenger's position.
    S10.6.2.1  Vehicles with a flat floor pan/toeboard. Place the right 
and left feet on the vehicle's toeboard with the heels resting on the 
floor pan as close as possible to the intersection point with the 
toeboard. If the feet cannot be placed flat on the toeboard, set them 
perpendicular to the lower leg centerlines and place them as far forward 
as possible with the heels resting on the floor pan.
    S10.6.2.2  Vehicles with wheelhouse projections in passenger 
compartment. Place the right and left feet in the well of the floor pan/
toeboard and not on the wheelhouse projection. If the feet cannot be 
placed flat on the toeboard, initially set them perpendicular to the 
lower leg centerlines and then place them as far forward as possible 
with the heels resting on the floor pan.
    S10.7  Test dummy positioning for latchplate access. The reach 
envelopes specified in S7.4.4 of this standard are obtained by 
positioning a test dummy in the driver's or passenger's seating position 
and adjusting that seating position to its forwardmost adjustment 
position. Attach the lines for the inboard and outboard arms to the test 
dummy as described in Figure 3 of this standard. Extend each line 
backward and outboard to generate the compliance arcs of the outboard 
reach envelope of the test dummy's arms.
    S10.8  Test dummy positioning for belt contact force. To determine 
compliance with S7.4.3 of this standard, position the test dummy in the 
vehicle in accordance with S10.1 through S10.6 of this standard and 
adjust the seating position in accordance with S8.1.2 and S8.1.3 of this 
standard. Pull the belt webbing three inches from the test dummy's chest 
and release until the webbing is within one inch of the test dummy's 
chest and measure the belt contact force.
    S10.9  Manual belt adjustment for dynamic testing. With the test 
dummy positioned in accordance with S10.1 through S10.6 of this standard 
and the seating position adjusted in accordance with S8.1.2 and S8.1.3 
of this standard, place the Type 2 manual belt around the test dummy and 
fasten the latch. Remove all slack from the lap belt portion. Pull the 
upper torso webbing out of the retractor and allow it to retract; repeat 
this four times. Apply a 2 to 4 pound tension load to the lap belt. If 
the belt system is equipped with a tension-relieving device, introduce 
the maximum amount of slack into the upper torso belt that is 
recommended by the vehicle manufacturer in the vehicle's owner's manual. 
If the belt system is not equipped with a tension-relieving device, 
allow the excess webbing in the upper torso belt to be retracted by the 
retractive force of the retractor.

provide such an estimate.
    S12.6  Processing an application for a temporary exemption. (a) 
NHTSA will process any application for temporary exemption that contains 
the information specified in S12.4 and S12.5. If an application fails to 
provide the information specified in S12.4 and S12.5, NHTSA will not 
process the application, but will advise the manufacturer of the 
information that must be provided if the agency is to process the 
application.
    (b) Notice of each application for temporary exemption shall be 
published in the Federal Register.
    (c) NHTSA will issue its decision to grant or deny the requested 
temporary

[[Page 487]]

exemption not later than 15 days after the agency receives a complete 
petition, as defined in paragraph (a). However, a failure to issue a

    (d) Notice of each decision to grant or deny a temporary exemption, 
and the reasons for granting or denying it, will be published in the 
Federal Register.
    (e) The Administrator may attach such conditions as he or she deems 
appropriate to a temporary exemption, including but not limited to 
requiring manufacturers to provide progress reports at specified times 
(including, as appropriate and to the extent possible, estimate of dates 
and times concerning when a supply disruption will be corrected and when 
recall will take place) and requiring manufacturers to take specific 
steps to ensure that as many exempted vehicles as possible will be 
returned for installation of missing inflatable restraint systems.
    (f) Unless a later effective date is specified in a notice 
announcing an agency decision to grant a temporary exemption, a 
temporary exemption from the inflatable restraint requirement will 
become effective upon the date the decision is issued.

Section, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., room 5109, Washington, DC, or at the 
Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, N.W., Suite 
700, Washington, DC. The accelerometer sensitive axis is parallel to the 
direction of test platform travel. The test is conducted at a velocity 
change approximating 30 mph with acceleration of the test platform such 
that all points on the crash pulse curve within the corridor identified 
in Figure 6 are covered. An inflatable restraint is to be activated at 
20 ms +/-2 ms from the time that 0.5 g is measured on the dynamic test 
platform. The test dummy specified in S8.1.8.2, placed in each front 
outboard designated seating position as specified in S11, shall meet the 
injury criteria of S6.1, S6.2, S6.3, S6.4, S6.5, and S13.2 of this 
standard.
    S13.2  Neck injury criteria. A vehicle certified to this alternative 
test requirement shall, in addition to meeting the criteria specified in 
S13.1, meet the following injury criteria for the neck, measured with 
the six axis load cell (ref. Denton drawing C-1709) that is mounted 
between the bottom of the skull and the top of the neck as shown in 
drawing 78051-218, in the unbelted sled test:
    (a) Flexion Bending Moment--190 Nm. SAE Class 600.
    (b) Extension Bending Moment--57 Nm. SAE Class 600.
    (c) Axial Tension--3300 peak N. SAE Class 1000.
    (d) Axial Compression--4000 peak N. SAE Class 1000.
    (e) Fore-and-Aft Shear--3100 peak N. SAE Class 1000.
    S13.3 Vehicle test attitude. When the vehicle is in its ``as 
delivered'' condition, measure the angle between the driver's door sill 
and the horizontal. Mark where the angle is taken on the door sill. The 
``as delivered'' condition is the vehicle as received at the test site, 
with 100 percent of all fluid capacities and all tires inflated to the 
manufacturer's specifications as listed on the vehicle's tire placard. 
When the vehicle is in its ``fully loaded'' condition, measure the angle 
between the driver's door sill and the horizontal, at the same place the 
``as delivered'' angle was measured. The ``fully loaded'' condition is 
the test vehicle loaded in accordance with S8.1.1(a) or (b) of Standard 
No. 208, as applicable. The load placed in the cargo area shall be 
centered over the longitudinal centerline of the vehicle. The pretest 
door sill angle, when the vehicle is on the sled, (measured at the same 
location as the as delivered and fully loaded condition) shall be equal 
to or between the as delivered and fully loaded door sill angle 
measurements.

webbing (A) shall be attached to a weight (B) which has a mass of 
5.2<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.1 pounds or 2.35<SUP>plus-minus</SUP> 0.05 
kilograms, except that a mass of 3.3<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>.1 pounds 
(1.5<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>.05 kg) shall be used for webbing in pelvic and 
upper torso restraints of a belt assembly used in a child restraint 
system. The webbing shall be passed over the two new abrading edges of 
the hexagon bar (C) and the other end attached to an oscillating drum 
(D) which has a stroke of 13 inches or 33 centimeters. Suitable guides 
shall be used to prevent movement of the webbing along the axis of 
hexagonal bar C. Drum D shall be oscillated for 5,000 strokes or 2,500 
cycles at a rate of 60<SUP>plus-minus</SUP> 2 strokes per minute or 
30<SUP>plus-minus</SUP> 1 cycles per minute. The abraded webbing shall 
be conditioned as prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section and tested 
for breaking strength by the procedure described in paragraph (b) of 
this section. The median values for the breaking strengths determined on 
abraded and unabraded specimens shall be used to calculate the 
percentage of breaking strength retained.
    (e) Resistance to light. Webbing at least 20 inches or 50 
centimeters in length from three seat belt assemblies shall be suspended 
vertically on the inside of the specimen rack in a Type E carbon-arc 
light-exposure apparatus described in Standard Practice for Operating

by the American Society for Testing and Materials, except that the 
filter used for 100 percent polyester yarns shall be chemically 
strengthened soda-lime glass with a transmittance of less than 5 percent 
for wave lengths equal to or less than 305 nanometers and 90 percent or 
greater transmittance for wave lengths of 375 to 800 nanometers. The 
apparatus shall be operated without water spray at an air temperature of 
60<SUP>plus-minus</SUP> 2 degrees Celsius or 140<SUP>plus-minus</SUP> 
3.6 degrees Fahrenheit measured at a point 1.0<SUP>plus-minus</SUP> 0.2 
inch or 25<SUP>plus-minus</SUP> 5 millimeters outside the specimen rack 
and midway in height. The temperature sensing element shall be shielded 
from radiation. The specimens shall be exposed to light from the carbon-
arc for 100 hours and then conditioned as prescribed in paragraph (a) of 
this section. The colorfastness of the exposed and conditioned specimens 
shall be determined on the Geometric Gray Scale issued by the American 
Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists. The breaking strength of 
the specimens shall be determined by the procedure prescribed in 
paragraph (b) of this section. The median values for the breaking 
strengths determined on exposed and unexposed specimens shall be used to 
calculate the percentage of breaking strength retained.
    (f) Resistance to microorganisms. Webbing at least 20 inches or 50 
centimeters in length from three seat belt assemblies shall first be 
preconditioned in accordance with appendix A (1) and (2) of American 
Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists Test Method 30-81, 
``Fungicides Evaluation on Textiles; Mildew and Rot Resistance of 
Textiles,'' and then subjected to Test I, ``Soil Burial Test'' of that 
test method. After soil-burial for a period of 2 weeks, the specimen 
shall be washed in water, dried and conditioned as prescribed in 
paragraph (a) of this section. The breaking strengths of the specimens 
shall be determined by the procedure prescribed in paragraph (b) of this 
section. The median values for the breaking strengths determined on

of 24 hours exposure to salt spray followed by 1 hour drying and 25 
hours for all other hardware, consisting of

[[Page 502]]

one period of 24 hours exposure to salt spray followed by 1 hour drying. 
In the salt spray test chamber, the parts from the three assemblies 
shall be oriented differently, selecting those orientations most likely 
to develop corrosion on the larger areas. At the end of test, the seat 
belt assembly shall be washed thoroughly with water to remove the salt. 
After drying for at least 24 hours under standard laboratory conditions 
specified in S5.1(a) attachment hardware shall be examined for ferrous 
corrosion on significant surfaces, that is, all surfaces that can be 
contacted by a sphere 0.75 inch or 2 centimeters in diameter, and other 
hardware shall be examined for ferrous and nonferrous corrosion which 
may be transferred, either directly or by means of the webbing, to a 
person or his clothing during use of a seat belt assembly incorporating 
the hardware.

    Note: When attachment and other hardware are permanently fastened, 
by sewing or other means, to the same piece of webbing, separate 
assemblies shall be used to test the two types of hardware. The test for 
corrosion resistance shall not be required for attachment hardware made 
from corrosion-resistant steel containing at least 11.5 percent chromium 
or for attachment hardware protected with an electrodeposited coating of 
nickel, or copper and nickel, as prescribed in S4.3(a). The assembly 
that has been used to test the corrosion resistance of the buckle shall 
be used to measure adjustment force, tilt-lock adjustment, and buckle 
latch in paragraphs (e), (f), and (g), respectively, of this section, 
assembly performance in S5.3 and buckle release force in paragraph (d) 
of this section.

    (b) Temperature resistance. Three seat belt assemblies having 
plastic or nonmetallic hardware or having retractors shall be subjected 
to the conditions prescribed in Procedure D of American Society for 
Testing and Materials D756-78, ``Standard Practice for Determination of 
Weight and Shape Changes of Plastics under Accelerated Service 
Conditions.'' The dimension and weight measurement shall be omitted. 
Buckles shall be unlatched and retractors shall be fully retracted 
during conditioning. The hardware parts after conditioning shall be used 
for all applicable tests in S4.3 and S4.4.
    (c) Attachment hardware. (1) Attachment bolts used to secure the 
pelvic restraint of a seat belt assembly to a motor vehicle shall be 
tested in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 3. The load shall be 
applied at an angle of 45 deg. to the axis of the bolt through 
attachment hardware from the seat belt assembly, or through a special 
fixture which simulates the loading applied by the attachment hardware. 
The attachment hardware or simulated fixture shall be fastened by the 
bolt to the anchorage shown in Figure 3, which has a standard \7/16\-20 
-2B or \1/2\-13 -2B threaded hole in a hardened steel plate at least 0.4 
inch or 1 centimeter in thickness. The bolt shall be installed with two 
full threads exposed from the fully seated position. The appropriate 
force required by S4.3(c) shall be applied. A bolt from each of three 
seat belt assemblies shall be tested.
    (2) Attachment hardware, other than bolts, designed to receive the 
ends of two seat belt assemblies shall be subjected to a tensile force 
of 6,000 pounds or 2,720 kilograms in a manner simulating use. The 
hardware shall be examined for fracture after the force is released. 
Attachment hardware from three seat belt assemblies shall be tested.
    (3) Single attachment hook for connecting webbing to any eye bolt 
shall be tested in the following manner: The hook shall be held rigidly 
so that the retainer latch or keeper, with cotter pin or other locking 
device in place, is in a horizontal position as shown in Figure 4. A 
force of 150<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 pounds or 68<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 
kilograms shall be applied vertically as near as possible to the free 
end of the retainer latch, and the movement of the latch by this force 
at the point of application shall be measured. The vertical force shall 
be released, and a force of 150<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 pounds or 
68<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 kilograms shall be applied horizontally as near 
as possible to the free end of the retainer latch. The movement of the 
latch by this force at the point of load application shall be measured. 
Alternatively, the hook may be held in other positions, provided the 
forces are applied and the movements of the latch are measured at the 
points indicated in Figure 4. A single attachment hook from each of 
three seat belt assemblies shall be tested.

    (d) Buckle release. (1) Three seatbelt assemblies shall be tested to 
determine compliance with the maximum buckle release force requirements, 
following the assembly test in S5.3. After subjection to the force 
applicable for the assembly being tested, the force shall be reduced and 
maintained at 150 pounds on the assembly loop of a Type 1 seatbelt 
assembly, 75 pounds on the components of a Type 2 seatbelt assembly. The 
buckle release force shall be measured by applying a force on the buckle 
in a manner and direction typical of those which would be employed by a 
seatbelt occupant. For pushbutton-release buckles, the force shall be 
applied at least 0.125 inch from the edge of the pushbutton access 
opening of the buckle in a direction that produces maximum releasing 
effect. For lever-release buckles, the force shall be applied on the 
centerline of the buckle lever or finger tab in a direction that 
produces maximum releasing effect.
    (2) The area for application of release force on pushbutton actuated 
buckle shall be measured to the nearest 0.05 square inch or 0.3 square 
centimeter. The cylinder specified in S4.3(d) shall be inserted in the 
actuation portion of a lever released buckle for determination of 
compliance with the requirement. A buckle with other release actuation 
shall be examined for access of release by fingers.
    (3) The buckle of a Type 1 or Type 2 seatbelt assembly shall be 
subjected to a compressive force of 400 pounds applied anywhere on a 
test line that is coincident with the centerline of the belt extended 
through the buckle or on any line that extends over the center of the 
release mechanism and intersects the extended centerline of the belt at 
an angle of 60 deg.. The load shall be applied by using a curved 
cylindrical bar having a cross section diameter of 0.75 inch and a 
radius of curvature of 6 inches, placed with its longitudinal centerline 
along the test line and its center directly above the point on the 
buckle to which the load will be applied. The buckle shall be latched, 
and a tensile force of 75 pounds shall be applied to the connected 
webbing during the application of the compressive force. Buckles from 
three seatbelt assemblies shall be tested to determine compliance with 
paragraph S4.3(d)(3).
    (e) Adjustment force. Three seat belt assemblies shall be tested for 
adjustment force on the webbing at the buckle, or other manual adjusting 
device normally used to adjust the size of the assembly. With no load on 
the anchor end, the webbing shall be drawn through the adjusting device 
at a rate of 20<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 inches per minute or 
50<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 centimeters per minute and the maximum force 
shall be measured to the nearest 0.25 pound or 0.1 kilogram after the 
first 1 inch or 25 millimeters of webbing movement. The webbing shall be 
precycled 10 times prior to measurement.
    (f) Tilt-lock adjustment. This test shall be made on buckles or 
other manual adjusting devices having tilt-lock adjustment normally used 
to adjust the size of the assembly. Three buckles or devices shall be 
tested. The base of the adjustment mechanism and the anchor end of the 
webbing shall be oriented in planes normal to each other. The webbing 
shall be drawn through the adjustment mechanism in a direction to 
increase belt length at a rate of 20<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 inches per 
minute or 50<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 centimeters per minute while the 
plane of the base is slowly rotated in a direction to lock the webbing. 
Rotation shall be stopped when the webbing locks, but the pull on the 
webbing shall be continued until there is a resistance of at least 20 
pounds or 9 kilograms. The locking angle between the anchor end of the 
webbing and the base of the adjustment mechanism shall be measured to 
the nearest degree. The webbing shall be precycled 10 times prior to 
measurement.
    (g) Buckle latch. The buckles from three seat belt assemblies shall 
be opened fully and closed at least 10 times. Then the buckles shall be 
clamped or firmly held against a flat surface so as to permit normal 
movement of buckle part, but with the metal mating plate (metal-to-metal 
buckles) or of webbing end (metal-to-webbing buckles) withdrawn from the 
buckle. The release mechanism shall be moved 200 times through the 
maximum possible travel against its stop with a force of 
30<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>3 pounds or 14<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>1 kilograms at 
a rate not to exceed 30 cycles per

[[Page 504]]

minute. The buckle shall be examined to determine compliance with the 
performance requirements of S4.3(g). A metal-to-metal buckle shall be 
examined to determine whether partial engagement is possible by means of 
any technique representative of actual use. If partial engagement is 
possible, the maximum force of separation when in such partial 
engagement shall be determined.
    (h) Nonlocking retractor. After the retractor is cycled 10 times by 
full extension and retraction of the webbing, the retractor and webbing 
shall be suspended vertically and a force of 4 pounds or 1.8 kilograms 
shall be applied to extend the webbing from the retractor. The force 
shall be reduced to 3 pounds or 1.4 kilograms when attached to a pelvic 
restraint, or to 1.1 pounds or 0.5 kilogram per strap or webbing that 
contacts the shoulder of an occupant when retractor is attached to an 
upper torso restraint. The residual extension of the webbing shall be 
measured by manual rotation of the retractor drum or by disengaging the 
retraction mechanism. Measurements shall be made on three retractors. 
The location of the retractor attached to upper torso restraint shall be 
examined for visibility of reel during use of seat belt assembly in a 
vehicle.

    Note: This test shall not be required on a nonlocking retractor 
attached to the free-end of webbing which is not subjected to any 
tension during restraint of an occupant by the assembly.

    (i) Automatic-locking retractor. Three retractors shall be tested in 
a manner to permit the retraction force to be determined exclusive of 
the gravitational forces on hardware or webbing being retracted. The 
webbing shall be fully extended from the retractor. While the webbing is 
being retracted, the average force or retraction within plus or minus 2 
inches or 5 centimeters of 75 percent extension (25 percent retraction) 
shall be determined and the webbing movement between adjacent locking 
segments shall be measured in the same region of extension. A seat belt 
assembly with automatic locking retractor in upper torso restraint shall 
be tested in a vehicle in a manner prescribed by the installation and 
usage instructions. The retraction force on the occupant of the seat 
belt assembly shall be determined before and after traveling for 10 
minutes at a speed of 15 miles per hour or 24 kilometers per hour or 
more over a rough road (e.g., Belgian block road) where the occupant is 
subjected to displacement with respect to the vehicle in both horizontal 
and vertical directions. Measurements shall be made with the vehicle 
stopped and the occupant in the normal seated position.
    (j) Emergency-locking retractor. A retractor shall be tested in a 
manner that permits the retraction force to be determined exclusive of 
the gravitational forces on hardware or webbing being retracted. The 
webbing shall be fully extended from the retractor, passing over or 
through any hardware or other material specified in the installation 
instructions. While the webbing is being retracted, the lowest force of 
retraction within plus or minus 2 inches of 75 percent extension shall 
be determined. A retractor that is sensitive to webbing withdrawal shall 
be subjected to an acceleration of 0.3g within a period of 50 ms. while 
the webbing is at 75 percent extension, to determine compliance with 
S4.3(j)(2). The retractor shall be subjected to an acceleration of 0.7g 
within a period of 50 milliseconds, while the webbing is at 75 percent 
extension, and the webbing movement before locking shall be measured 
under the following conditions: For a retractor sensitive to webbing 
withdrawal, the retractor shall be accelerated in the direction of 
webbing retraction while the retractor drum's central axis is oriented 
horizontally and at angles of 45 deg., 90 deg., 135 deg., and 180 deg. 
to the horizontal plane. For a retractor sensitive to vehicle 
acceleration, the retractor shall be:
    (1) Accelerated in the horizontal plane in two directions normal to 
each other, while the retractor drum's central axis is oriented at the 
angle at which it is installed in the vehicle; and,
    (2) Accelerated in three directions normal to each other while the 
retractor drum's central axis is oriented at angles of 45 deg., 90 deg., 
135 deg., and 180 deg. from the angle at which it is installed in the 
vehicle, unless the retractor locks by gravitational force when tilted 
in any direction to any angle greater than 45 deg.

[[Page 505]]

from the angle at which it is installed in the vehicle.
    (k) Performance of retractor. After completion of the corrosion-
resistance test described in paragraph (a) of this section, the webbing 
shall be fully extended and allowed to dry for at least 24 hours under 
standard laboratory conditions specified in S5.1(a). The retractor shall 
be examined for ferrous and nonferrous corrosion which may be 
transferred, either directly or by means of the webbing, to a person or 
his clothing during use of a seat belt assembly incorporating the 
retractor, and for ferrous corrosion on significant surfaces if the 
retractor is part of the attachment hardware. The webbing shall be 
withdrawn manually and allowed to retract for 25 cycles. The retractor 
shall be mounted in an apparatus capable of extending the webbing fully, 
applying a force of 20 pounds or 9 kilograms at full extension, and 
allowing the webbing to retract freely and completely. The webbing shall 
be withdrawn from the retractor and allowed to retract repeatedly in 
this apparatus until 2,500 cycles are completed. The retractor and 
webbing shall then be subjected to the temperature resistance test 
prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section. The retractor shall be 
subjected to 2,500 additional cycles of webbing withdrawal and 
retraction. Then, the retractor and webbing shall be subjected to dust 
in a chamber similar to one illustrated in Figure 8 containing about 2 
pounds or 0.9 kilogram of coarse grade dust conforming to the 
specification given in Society of Automotive Engineering Recommended 
Practice J726, ``Air Cleaner Test Code'' Sept. 1979. The dust shall be 
agitated every 20 minutes for 5 seconds by compressed air, free of oil 
and moisture, at a gage pressure of 80<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>8 pounds per 
square inch or 5.6<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.6 kilograms per square 
centimeter entering through an orifice 0.060<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.004 
inch or 1.5<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.1 millimeters in diameter. The webbing 
shall be extended to the top of the chamber and kept extended at all 
times except that the webbing shall be subjected to 10 cycles of 
complete retraction and extension within 1 to 2 minutes after each 
agitation of the dust. At the end of 5 hours, the assembly shall be 
removed from the chamber. The webbing shall be fully withdrawn from the 
retractor manually and allowed to retract completely for 25 cycles. An 
automatic-locking retractor or a nonlocking retractor attached to pelvic 
restraint shall be subjected to 5,000 additional cycles of webbing 
withdrawal and retraction. An emergency-locking retractor or a 
nonlocking retractor attached to upper torso restraint shall be 
subjected to 45,000 additional cycles of webbing withdrawal and 
retraction between 50 and 100 percent extension. The locking mechanism 
of an emergency locking retractor shall be actuated at least 10,000 
times within 50 to 100 percent extension of webbing during the 50,000 
cycles. At the end of test, compliance of the retractors with applicable 
requirements in S4.3 (h), (i), and (j) shall be determined. Three 
retractors shall be tested for performance.
    S5.3  Assembly performance--(a) Type 1 seat belt assembly. Three 
complete seat belt assemblies, including webbing, straps, buckles, 
adjustment and attachment hardware, and retractors, arranged in the form 
of a loop as shown in Figure 5, shall be tested in the following manner:
    (1) The testing machine shall conform to the requirements specified 
in S5.1(b). A double-roller block shall be attached to one head of the 
testing machine. This block shall consist of two rollers 4 inches or 10 
centimeters in diameter and sufficiently long so that no part of the 
seat belt assembly touches parts of the block other than the rollers 
during test. The rollers shall be mounted on antifriction bearings and 
spaced 12 inches or 30 centimeters between centers, and shall have 
sufficient capacity so that there is no brinelling, bending or other 
distortion of parts which may affect the results. An anchorage bar shall 
be fastened to the other head of the testing machine.
    (2) The attachment hardware furnished with the seat belt assembly 
shall be attached to the anchorage bar. The anchor points shall be 
spaced so that the webbing is parallel in the two sides of the loop. The 
attaching bolts shall be parallel to, or at an angle of 45 deg. or 
90 deg. to the webbing, whichever results in an angle nearest to 90 deg. 
between webbing and attachment hardware except that eye bolts shall be 
vertical,

[[Page 506]]

and attaching bolts or nonthreaded anchorages of a seat belt assembly 
designed for use in specific models of motor vehicles shall be installed 
to produce the maximum angle in use indicated by the installation 
instructions, utilizing special fixtures if necessary to simulate 
installation in the motor vehicle. Rigid adapters between anchorage bar 
and attachment hardware shall be used if necessary to locate and orient 
the adjustment hardware. The adapters shall have a flat support face 
perpendicular to the threaded hole for the attaching bolt and adequate 
in area to provide full support for the base of the attachment hardware 
connected to the webbing. If necessary, a washer shall be used under a 
swivel plate or other attachment hardware to prevent the webbing from 
being damaged as the attaching bolt is tightened.
    (3) The length of the assembly loop from attaching bolt to attaching 
bolt shall be adjusted to about 51 inches or 130 centimeters, or as near 
thereto as possible. A force of 55 pounds or 25 kilograms shall be 
applied to the loop to remove any slack in webbing at hardware. The 
force shall be removed and the heads of the testing machine shall be 
adjusted for an assembly loop between 48 and 50 inches or 122 and 127 
centimeters in length. The length of the assembly loop shall then be 
adjusted by applying a force between 20 and 22 pounds or 9 and 10 
kilograms to the free end of the webbing at the buckle, or by the 
retraction force of an automatic-locking or emergency-locking retractor. 
A seat belt assembly that cannot be adjusted to this length shall be 
adjusted as closely as possible. An automatic-locking or emergency-
locking retractor when included in a seat belt assembly shall be locked 
at the start of the test with a tension on the webbing slightly in 
excess of the retractive force in order to keep the retractor locked. 
The buckle shall be in a location so that it does not touch the rollers 
during test, but to facilitate making the buckle release test in S5.2(d) 
the buckle should be between the rollers or near a roller in one leg.
    (4) The heads of the testing machine shall be separated at a rate 
between 2 and 4 inches per minute or 5 and 10 centimeters per minute 
until a force of 5,000<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>50 pounds or 
2,270<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>20 kilograms is applied to the assembly loop. 
The extension of the loop shall be determined from measurements of head 
separation before and after the force is applied. The force shall be 
decreased to 150<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>10 pounds or 
68<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>4 kilograms and the buckle release force measured 
as prescribed in S5.2(d).
    (5) After the buckle is released, the webbing shall be examined for 
cutting by the hardware. If the yarns are partially or completely 
severed in a line for a distance of 10 percent or more of the webbing 
width, the cut webbing shall be tested for breaking strength as 
specified in S5.1(b) locating the cut in the free length between grips. 
If there is insufficient webbing on either side of the cut to make such 
a test for breaking strength, another seat belt assembly shall be used 
with the webbing repositioned in the hardware. A tensile force of 
2,500<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>25 pounds or 1,135<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>10 
kilograms shall be applied to the components or a force of 
5,000<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>50 pounds or 2,270<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>20 
kilograms shall be applied to an assembly loop. After the force is 
removed, the breaking strength of the cut webbing shall be determined as 
prescribed above.
    (6) If a Type 1 seat belt assembly includes an automatic-locking 
retractor or an emergency-locking retractor, the webbing and retractor 
shall be subjected to a tensile force of 2,500<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>25 
pounds or 1,135<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>10 kilograms with the webbing fully 
extended from the retractor.
    (7) If a seat belt assembly has a buckle in which the tongue is 
capable of inverted insertion, one of the three assemblies shall be 
tested with the tongue inverted.
    (b) Type 2 seat belt assembly. Components of three seat belt 
assemblies shall be tested in the following manner:
    (1) The pelvic restraint between anchorages shall be adjusted to a 
length between 48 and 50 inches or 122 and 127 centimeters, or as near 
this length as possible if the design of the pelvic restraint does not 
permit its adjustment to this length. An automatic-locking or emergency-
locking retractor when included in a seat belt assembly shall be locked 
at the start of the test with

[[Page 507]]

a tension on the webbing slightly in excess of the retractive force in 
order to keep the retractor locked. The attachment hardware shall be 
oriented to the webbing as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
and illustrated in Figure 5. A tensile force of 
2,500<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>25 pounds or 1,135<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>10 
kilograms shall be applied on the components in any convenient manner 
and the extension between anchorages under this force shall be measured. 
The force shall be reduced to 75<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 pounds or 
34<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 kilograms and the buckle release force measured 
as prescribed in S5.2(d).
    (2) The components of the upper torso restraint shall be subjected 
to a tensile force of 1,500<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>15 pounds or 
680<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 kilograms following the procedure prescribed 
above for testing pelvic restraint and the extension between anchorages 
under this force shall be measured. If the testing apparatus permits, 
the pelvic and upper torso restraints may be tested simultaneously. The 
force shall be reduced to 75<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 pounds or 
34<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>2 kilograms and the buckle release force measured 
as prescribed in S5.2(d).
    (3) Any component of the seat belt assembly common to both pelvic 
and upper torso restraint shall be subjected to a tensile force of 
3,000<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>30 pounds or 1,360<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>15 
kilograms.
    (4) After the buckle is released in tests of pelvic and upper torso 
restraints, the webbing shall be examined for cutting by the hardware. 
If the yarns are partially or completely severed in a line for a 
distance of 10 percent or more of the webbing width the cut webbing 
shall be tested for breaking strength as specified in S5.1(b) locating 
the cut in the free length between grips. If there is insufficient 
webbing on either side of the cut to make such a test for breaking 
strength, another seat belt assembly shall be used with the webbing 
repositioned in the hardware. The force applied shall be 
2,500<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>25 pounds or 1,135<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>10 
kilograms for components of pelvic restraint, and 
1,500<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>15 pounds or 680<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 
kilograms for components of upper torso restraint. After the force is 
removed the breaking strength of the cut webbing shall be determined as 
prescribed above.
    (5) If a Type 2 seat belt assembly includes an automatic-locking 
retractor or an emergency-locking retractor the webbing and retractor 
shall be subjected to a tensile force of 2,500<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>25 
pounds or 1,135<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>10 kilograms with the webbing fully 
extended from the retractor, or to a tensile force of 
1,500<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>15 pounds or 680<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>5 
kilograms with the webbing fully extended from the retractor if the 
design of the assembly permits only upper torso restraint forces on the 
retractor.
    (6) If a seat belt assembly has a buckle in which the tongue is 
capable of inverted insertion, one of the three assemblies shall be 
tested with the tongue inverted.
    (c) Resistance to buckle abrasion. Seat belt assemblies shall be 
tested for resistance to abrasion by each buckle or manual adjusting 
device normally used to adjust the size of the assembly. The webbing of 
the assembly to be used in this test shall be exposed for 4 hours to an 
atmosphere having relative humidity of 65 percent and temperature of 70 
deg.F. The webbing shall be pulled back and forth through the buckle or 
manual adjusting device as shown schematically in Figure 7. The anchor 
end of the webbing (A) shall be attached to a weight (B) of 3 pounds. 
The webbing shall pass through the buckle (C), and the other end (D) 
shall be attached to a reciprocating device so that the webbing forms an 
angle of 8 deg. with the hinge stop (E). The reciprocating device shall 
be operated for 2,500 cycles at a rate of 18 cycles per minute with a 
stroke length of 8 inches. The abraded webbing shall be tested for 
breaking strength by the procedure described in paragraph S5.1(b).

the webbing or straps, involved in transferring seat belt loads to the 
vehicle structure, including, but not limited to, the attachment 
hardware, seat frames, seat pedestals, the vehicle structure itself, and 
any part of the vehicle whose failure causes separation of the belt from 
the vehicle structure.
    S4. Requirements.
    S4.1  Type.
    S4.1.1  Seat belt anchorages for a Type 1 or a Type 2 seat belt 
assembly shall be installed for each designated seating position for 
which a Type 1 or a Type 2 seat belt assembly is required by Standard 
No. 208 (49 CFR 571.208). Seat belt anchorages for a Type 2 seat belt 
assembly shall be installed for each designated seating position for 
which a Type 2 seat belt assembly is required by Standard No. 208 (49 
CFR 571.208).
    S4.1.2  (a) Notwithstanding the requirement of S4.1.1, each vehicle 
manufactured on or after September 1, 1987 that is equipped with an 
automatic restraint at the front right outboard designated seating 
position, which automatic restraint cannot be used for securing a child 
restraint system or cannot be adjusted by the vehicle owner to secure a 
child restraint system solely through the use of attachment hardware 
installed as an item of original equipment by the vehicle manufacturer, 
shall have, at the manufacturer's option, either anchorages for a Type 1 
seat belt assembly installed at that position or a Type 1 or Type 2 seat 
belt assembly installed at that position. If a manufacturer elects to 
install anchorages for a Type 1 seat belt assembly to comply with this 
requiremen t, those anchorages shall consist of, at a minimum, holes 
threaded to accept bolts that comply with S4.1(f) of Standard No. 209 
(49 CFR 571.209).
    (b) The requirement in S4.1.1 of this standard that seat belt 
anchorages for a Type 1 or a Type 2 seat belt assembly shall be 
installed for certain designated seating positions does not apply to any 
such seating positions that are equipped with a seat belt assembly that 
meets the frontal crash protection requirements of S5.1 of Standard No. 
208 (49 CFR 571.208).
    S4.2  Strength.
    S4.2.1 Except as provided in S4.2.5, and except for side-facing 
seats, the anchorages, attachment hardware, and attachment bolts for any 
of the following seat belt assemblies shall withstand a 5,000-pound 
force when tested in accordance with S5.1 of this standard:

assembly, if such seat belt assembly is equipped with a detachable upper 
torso belt.
    S4.2.2 Except as provided in S4.2.5, the anchorages, attachment 
hardware, and attachment bolts for all Type 2 and automatic seat belt 
assemblies that are installed to comply with Standard No. 208 (49 CFR 
571.208) shall withstand 3,000-pound forces when tested in accordance 
with S5.2.
    S4.2.3  Permanent deformation or rupture of a seat belt anchorage or 
its surrounding area is not considered to be a failure, if the required 
force is sustained for the specified time.
    S4.2.4 Anchorages, attachment hardware, and attachment bolts shall 
be tested by simultaneously loading them in accordance with the 
applicable procedures set forth in S5 of this standard if the anchorages 
are either:
    (a) For designated seating positions that are common to the same 
occupant seat and that face in the same direction, or
    (b) For laterally adjacent designated seating positions that are not 
common to the same occupant seat, but that face in the same direction, 
if the vertical centerline of the bolt hole for at least one of the 
anchorages for one of

[[Page 512]]

those designated seating positions is within 12 inches of the vertical 
centerline of the bolt hole for an anchorage for one of the adjacent 
seating positions.
    S4.2.5 The attachment hardware of a seat belt assembly, which is 
subject to the requirements of S5.1 of Standard No. 208 (49 CFR 571.208) 
by virtue of any provision of Standard No. 208 other than S4.1.2.1(c)(2) 
of that standard, does not have to meet the requirements of S4.2.1 and 
S4.2.2 of this standard.
    S4.3 Location. As used in this section, ``forward'' means the 
direction in which the seat faces, and other directional references are 
to be interpreted accordingly. Anchorages for seat belt assemblies that 
meet the frontal crash protection requirements of S5.1 of Standard No. 
208 (49 CFR 571.208) are exempt from the location requirements of this 
section.
    S4.3.1  Seat belt anchorages for Type 1 seat belt assemblies and the 
pelvic portion of Type 2 seat belt assemblies.
    S4.3.1.1 In an installation in which the seat belt does not bear 
upon the seat frame:
    (a) If the seat is a nonadjustable seat, then a line from the 
seating reference point to the nearest contact point of the belt with 
the anchorage shall extend forward from the anchorage at an angle with 
the horizontal of not less than 30 degrees and not more than 75 degrees.
    (b) If the seat is an adjustable seat, then a line from a point 2.50 
inches forward of and 0.375 inches above the seating reference point to 
the nearest contact point of the belt with the anchorage shall extend 
forward from the anchorage at an angle with the horizontal of not less

<R05>
Sec. 571.211  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 571.212  Standard No. 212; Windshield mounting.

    S1. Scope. This standard establishes windshield retention 
requirements for motor vehicles during crashes.
    S2. Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to reduce crash 
injuries and fatalities by providing for retention of the vehicle 
windshield during a crash, thereby utilizing fully the penetration-
resistance and injury-avoidance properties of the windshield glazing 
material and preventing the ejection of occupants from the vehicle.
    S3. Application. This standard applies to passenger cars, and to 
multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, and buses having a gross 
vehicle weight rating of 4536 kilograms or less. However, it does not 
apply to forward control vehicles, walk-in van-type vehicles, or to 
open-body type vehicles with fold-down or removable windshields.
    S4. Definition. Passive restraint system means a system meeting the 
occupant crash protection requirements of S5. of Standard No. 208 by 
means that require no action by vehicle occupants.

[[Page 518]]

    S5. Requirements. When the vehicle travelling longitudinally forward 
at any speed up to and including 48 kilometers per hour impacts a fixed 
collision barrier that is perpendicular to the line of travel of the 
vehicle, under the conditions of S6, the windshield mounting of the 
vehicle shall retain not less than the minimum portion of the windshield 
periphery specified in S5.1 and S5.2.
    S5.1  Vehicles equipped with passive restraints. Vehicles equipped 
with passive restraint systems shall retain not less than 50 percent of 
the portion of the windshield periphery on each side of the vehicle 
longitudinal centerline.
    S5.2  Vehicles not equipped with passive restraints. Vehicles not 
equipped with passive restraint systems shall retain not less than 75 
percent of the windshield periphery.
    S6. Test conditions. The requirements of S5. shall be met under the 
following conditions:
    S6.1  The vehicle, including test devices and instrumentation, is 
loaded as follows:
    (a) Except as specified in S6.2, a passenger car is loaded to its 
unloaded vehicle weight plus its cargo and luggage capacity weight, 
secured in the luggage area, plus a 50th-percentile test dummy as 
specified in part 572 of this chapter at each front outboard designated 
seating position and at any other position whose protection system is 
required to be tested by a dummy under the provisions of Standard No. 
208. Each dummy is restrained only by means that are installed for 
protection at its seating position.
    (b) Except as specified in S6.2, a multipurpose passenger vehicle, 
truck or bus is loaded to its unloaded vehicle weight, plus 136 
kilograms or its rated cargo and luggage capacity, whichever is less, 
secured to the vehicle, plus a 50th-percentile test dummy as specified 
in part 572 of this chapter at each front outboard designated seating 
position and at any other position whose protection system is required 
to be tested by a dummy under the provisions of Standard No. 208. Each 
dummy is restrained only by means that are installed for protection at 
its seating position. The load is distributed so that the weight on each 
axle as measured at the tire-ground interface is in proportion to its 
GAWR. If the weight on any axle when the vehicle is loaded to its 
unloaded vehicle weight plus dummy weight exceeds the axle's 
proportional share of the test weight, the remaining weight is placed so 
that the weight on that axle remains the same. For the purposes of this 
section, unloaded vehicle weight does not include the weight of work-
performing accessories. Vehicles are tested to a maximum unloaded 
vehicle weight of 2,495 kilograms.
    S6.2  The fuel tank is filled to any level from 90 to 95 percent of 
capacity.
    S6.3  The parking brake is disengaged and the transmission is in 
neutral.
    S6.4  Tires are inflated to the vehicle manufacturer's 
specifications.
    S6.5  The windshield mounting material and all vehicle components in 
direct contact with the mounting material are at any temperature between 
-9 degrees Celsius and +43 degrees Celsius.

    S6.  Test conditions and procedures.
    S6.1  Dynamic systems test for child restraint systems.
    The test conditions described in S6.1.1 apply to the dynamic systems 
test. The test procedure for the dynamic systems test is specified in 
S6.1.2. The test dummy specified in S7 is placed in the test specimen 
(child restraint), clothed as described in S9 and positioned according 
to S10.
    S6.1.1  Test conditions.
    (a) Test devices
    (1) The test device for add-on restraint systems is a standard seat 
assembly consisting of a simulated vehicle bench seat, with three 
seating positions, which is described in Drawing Package SAS-100-1000 
(consisting of drawings and a bill of materials) with addendum A, Seat 
Base Weldment, dated July 1, 1993 (incorporated by reference; see 
Sec. 571.5). The assembly is mounted on a dynamic test platform so that 
the center SORL of the seat is parallel to the direction of the test 
platform travel and so that movement between the base of the assembly 
and the platform is prevented.
    (2) The test device for built-in child restraint systems is either 
the specific vehicle shell or the specific vehicle.
    (i) Specific vehicle shell.
    (A) The specific vehicle shell, if selected for testing, is mounted 
on a dynamic test platform so that the longitudinal center line of the 
shell is parallel to the direction of the test platform travel and so 
that movement between the base of the shell and the platform is 
prevented. Adjustable seats are in the adjustment position midway 
between the forwardmost and rearmost positions, and if separately 
adjustable in a vertical direction, are at the lowest position. If an 
adjustment position does not exist midway between the forwardmost and 
rearmost position, the closest adjustment position to the rear of the 
midpoint is used. Adjustable seat backs are in the manufacturer's 
nominal design riding position. If such a position is not specified, the 
seat

[[Page 530]]

back is positioned so that the longitudinal center line of the child 
test dummy's neck is vertical, and if an instrumented test dummy is 
used, the accelerometer surfaces in the dummy's head and thorax, as 
positioned in the vehicle, are horizontal. If the vehicle seat is 
equipped with adjustable head restraints, each is adjusted to its 
highest adjustment position.
    (B) The platform is instrumented with an accelerometer and data 
processing system having a frequency response of 60 Hz channel class as 
specified in Society of Automotive Engineers Recommended Practice J211 
JUN80 ``Instrumentation for Impact Tests.'' The accelerometer sensitive 
axis is parallel to the direction of test platform travel.
    (ii) Specific vehicle. For built-in child restraint systems, an 
alternate test device is the specific vehicle into which the built-in 
system is fabricated. The following test conditions apply to this 
alternate test device.
    (A) The vehicle is loaded to its unloaded vehicle weight plus its 
rated cargo and luggage capacity weight, secured in the luggage area, 
plus the appropriate child test dummy and, at the vehicle manufacturer's 
option, an anthropomorphic test dummy which conforms to the requirements 
of subpart B or subpart E of part 572 of this title for a 50th 
percentile adult male dummy placed in the front outboard seating 
position. If the built-in child restraint system is installed at one of 
the seating positions otherwise requiring the placement of a part 572 
test dummy, then in the frontal barrier crash specified in (c), the 
appropriate child test dummy shall be substituted for the part 572 adult 
dummy, but only at that seating position. The fuel tank is filled to any 
level from 90 to 95 percent of capacity.
    (B) Adjustable seats are in the adjustment position midway between 
the forward-most and rearmost positions, and if separately adjustable in 
a vehicle direction, are at the lowest position. If an adjustment 
position does not exist midway between the forward-most and rearmost 
positions, the closest adjustment position to the rear of the midpoint 
is used.
    (C) Adjustable seat backs are in the manufacturer's nominal design 
riding position. If a nominal position is not specified, the seat back 
is positioned so that the longitudinal center line of the child test 
dummy's neck is vertical, and if an anthropomorphic test dummy is used, 
the accelerometer surfaces in the test dummy's head and thorax, as 
positioned in the vehicle, are horizontal. If the vehicle is equipped 
with adjustable head restraints, each is adjusted to its highest 
adjustment position.
    (D) Movable vehicle windows and vents are, at the manufacturer's 
option, placed in the fully closed position.
    (E) Convertibles and open-body type vehicles have the top, if any, 
in place in the closed passenger compartment configuration.
    (F) Doors are fully closed and latched but not locked.
    (G) All instrumentation and data reduction is in conformance with 
SAE J211 JUN80.
    (b) The tests are frontal barrier impact simulations of the test 
platform or frontal barrier crashes of the specific vehicles as 
specified in S5.1 of Sec. 571.208 and for:
    (1) Test Configuration I, are at a velocity change of 48 km/h with 
the acceleration of the test platform entirely within the curve shown in 
Figure 2, or for the specific vehicle test with the deceleration 
produced in a 48 km/h frontal barrier crash.
    (2) Test Configuration II, are set at a velocity change of 32 km/h 
with the acceleration of the test platform entirely within the curve 
shown in Figure 3, or for the specific vehicle test, with the 
deceleration produced in a 32 km/h frontal barrier crash.
    (c) Attached to the seat belt anchorage points provided on the 
standard seat assembly (illustrated in Figures 1A and 1B) are Type I 
seat belt assemblies in the case of add-on child restraint systems other 
than belt-positioning seats, or Type II seat belt assemblies in the case 
of belt-positioning seats. These seat belt assemblies meet the 
requirements of Standard No. 209 (Sec. 571.209) and have webbing with a 
width of not more than 50 mm, and are

[[Page 531]]

attached to the anchorage points without the use of retractors or reels 
of any kind.
    (d) Performance tests under S6.1 are conducted at any ambient 
temperature from 19  deg.C to 26  deg.C and at any relative humidity 
from 10 percent to 70 percent.
    (e) In the case of add-on child restraint systems, the restraint 
shall meet the requirements of S5 at each of its seat back angle 
adjustment positions and restraint belt routing positions, when the 
restraint is oriented in the direction recommended by the manufacturer 
(e.g., forward, rearward or laterally) pursuant to S5.6, and tested with 
the test dummy specified in S7.
    S6.1.2  Dynamic test procedure.
    (a) Activate the built-in child restraint or attach the add-on child 
restraint to the seat assembly as described below:
    (1) Test configuration I. (i) In the case of each add-on child 
restraint system other than a belt-positioning seat, a child harness, a 
backless child restraint system with a top anchorage strap, or a 
restraint designed for use by physically handicapped children, install 
the add-on child restraint system at the center seating position of the 
standard seat assembly in accordance with the manufacturer's 
instructions provided with the system pursuant to S5.6.1, except that 
the add-on restraint shall be secured to the standard vehicle seat using 
only the standard vehicle lap belt. A child harness, a backless child 
restraint system with a top anchorage strap, or a restraint designed for 
use by physically handicapped children shall be installed at the center 
seating position of the standard seat assembly in accordance with the 
manufacturer's instructions provided with the system pursuant to S5.6.1. 
An add-on belt-positioning seat shall be installed at either outboard 
seating position of the standard seat assembly in accordance with the

specified in S7 and S9 and Part 572 of this chapter, as appropriate.
    (c) Place the dummy in the child restraint. Position it, and attach 
the child restraint belts, if appropriate, as specified in S10.
    (d) Belt adjustment.
    (1) Add-on systems other than belt-positioning seats.
    (i) If appropriate, shoulder and pelvic belts that directly restrain 
the dummy shall be adjusted as follows: Tighten the belts until a 9 N 
force applied (as illustrated in figure 5) to the webbing at the top of 
each dummy shoulder and to the pelvic webbing 50 mm on either side of 
the torso midsagittal plane pulls the webbing 7 mm from the dummy.
    (ii) All Type I belt systems used to attach an add-on child 
restraint system to the standard seat assembly, and any provided 
additional anchorage belt (tether), are tightened to a tension of not 
less than 53.5 N and not more than 67 N, as measured by a load cell used 
on the webbing portion of the belt.
    (2) Add-on belt-positioning seats.

[[Page 532]]

    (i) The lap portion of Type II belt systems used to attach the child 
restraint to the standard seat assembly is tightened to a tension of not 
less than 53.5 N and not more than 67 N, as measured by a load cell used 
on the webbing portion of the belt.
    (ii) The shoulder portion of Type II belt systems used to restrain 
the dummy is tightened to a tension of not less than 9 N and not more 
than 18 N, as measured by a load cell used on the webbing portion of the 
belt.
    (3) Built-in child restraint systems.
    (i) The lap portion of Type II belt systems used to secure a dummy 
to the built-in child restraint system is tightened to a tension of not 
less than 53.5 N and not more than 67 N, as measured by a load cell used 
on the webbing portion of the belt.
    (ii) The shoulder portion of Type II belt systems used to secure a 
child is tightened to a tension of not less than 9 N and not more than 
18 N, as measured by a load cell used on the webbing portion of the 
belt.
    (iii) If provided, and if appropriate to attach the child restraint 
belts under S10, shoulder (other than the shoulder portion of a Type II 
vehicle belt system) and pelvic belts that directly restrain the dummy 
shall be adjusted as follows: Tighten the belts until a 9 N force 
applied (as illustrated in figure 5) to the webbing at the top of each 
dummy shoulder and to the pelvic webbing 50 mm on either side of the 
torso midsagittal plane pulls the webbing 7 mm from the dummy.
    (e) Accelerate the test platform to simulate frontal impact in 
accordance with Test Configuration I or II, as appropriate.
    (f) Determine conformance with the requirements in S5.1.
    S6.2  Buckle release test procedure.
    The belt assembly buckles used in any child restraint system shall 
be tested in accordance with S6.2.1 through S6.2.4 inclusive.
    S6.2.1  Before conducting the testing specified in S6.1, place the 
loaded buckle on a hard, flat, horizontal surface. Each belt end of the 
buckle shall be pre-loaded in the following manner. The anchor end of 
the buckle shall be loaded with a 9 N force in the direction away from 
the buckle. In the case of buckles designed to secure a single latch 
plate, the belt latch plate end of the buckle shall be pre-loaded with a 
9 N force in the direction away from the buckle. In the case of buckles 
designed to secure two or more latch plates, the belt latch plate ends 
of the buckle shall be loaded equally so that the total load is 9 N, in 
the direction away from the buckle. For pushbutton-release buckles, the 
release force shall be applied by a conical surface (cone angle not 
exceeding 90 degrees). For pushbutton-release mechanisms with a fixed 
edge (referred to in Figure 7 as ``hinged button''), the release force 
shall be applied at the centerline of the button, 3 mm away from the 
movable edge directly opposite the fixed edge, and in the direction that 
produces maximum releasing effect. For pushbutton-release mechanisms 
with no fixed edge (referred to in Figure 7 as ``floating button''), the 
release force shall be applied at the center of the release mechanism in 
the direction that produces the maximum releasing effect. For all other 
buckle release mechanisms, the force shall be applied on the centerline 
of the buckle lever or finger tab in the direction that produces the 
maximum releasing effect. Measure the force required to release the 
buckle. Figure 7 illustrates the loading for the different buckles and 
the point where the release force should be applied, and Figure 8 
illustrates the conical surface used to apply the release force to 
pushbutton-release buckles.
    S6.2.2  After completion of the testing specified in S6.1 and before 
the buckle is unlatched, tie a self-adjusting sling to each wrist and 
ankle of the test dummy in the manner illustrated in Figure 4, without 
disturbing the belted dummy and the child restraint system.
    S6.2.3  Pull the sling tied to the dummy restrained in the child 
restraint system and apply a force whose magnitude is: 50 N for a system 
tested with a newborn dummy; 90 N for a system tested with a 9-month-old 
dummy; 200 N for a system tested with a 3-year-old dummy; or 270 N for a 
system tested with a 6-year-old dummy. The force is applied in the 
manner illustrated in Figure 4 and as follows:

[[Page 533]]

    (a) Add-on Child Restraints. For an add-on child restraint other 
than a car bed, apply the specified force by pulling the sling 
horizontally and parallel to the SORL of the standard seat assembly. For 
a car bed, apply the force by pulling the sling vertically.
    (b) Built-in Child Restraints. For a built-in child restraint other 
than a car bed, apply the force by pulling the sling parallel to the 
longitudinal center line of the specific vehicle shell or the specific 
vehicle. In the case of a car bed, apply the force by pulling the sling 
vertically.
    S6.2.4  While applying the force specified in S6.2.3, and using the 
device shown in Figure 8 for pushbutton-release buckles, apply the 
release force in the manner and location specified in S6.2.1, for that 
type of buckle. Measure the force required to release the buckle.
    S6.3  Head impact protection--energy absorbing material test 
procedure.
    S6.3.1  Prepare and test specimens of the energy absorbing material 
used to comply with S5.2.3 in accordance with the applicable 25 percent 
compression-deflection test described in the American Society for 
Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard D1056-73, ``Standard Specification 
for Flexible Cellular Materials--Sponge or Expanded Rubber,'' or D1564-
71 ``Standard Method of Testing Flexible Cellular Materials--Slab 
Urethane Foam'' or D1565-76 ``Standard Specification for Flexible 
Cellular Materials--Vinyl Chloride Polymer and Copolymer open-cell 
foams.''

in child restraint system.
    (b)(2) When testing rear-facing child restraint systems, place the 
newborn or 9-month old dummy in the child restraint system so that the 
back of the dummy torso contacts the back support surface of the system. 
For a child restraint system which is equipped with a fixed or movable 
surface described in S5.2.2.2 which is being tested under the conditions 
of test configuration II, do not attach any of the child restraint belts 
unless they are an integral part of the fixed or movable surface. For 
all other child restraint systems and for a child restraint system with 
a fixed or movable surface which is being tested under the conditions of 
test configuration I, attach all appropriate child restraint belts and 
tighten them as specified in S6.1.2. Attach all appropriate vehicle 
belts and tighten them as specified in S6.1.2. Position each movable 
surface in accordance with the instructions that the manufacturer 
provided under S5.6.1 or S5.6.2. If the dummy's head does not remain in 
the proper position, it shall be taped against the front of the seat 
back surface of the system by means of a single thickness of 6 mm-wide 
paper masking

[[Page 536]]

tape placed across the center of the dummy's face.
    (c)(1)(i) When testing forward-facing child restraint systems, 
extend the arms of the 9-month-old test dummy as far as possible in the 
upward vertical direction. Extend the legs of the 9-month-old dummy as 
far as possible in the forward horizontal direction, with the dummy feet 
perpendicular to the centerline of the lower legs. Using a flat square 
surface with an area of 2,580 square mm, apply a force of 178 N, 
perpendicular to:
    (A) The plane of the back of the standard seat assembly, in the case 
of an add-on system, or
    (B) The back of the vehicle seat in the specific vehicle shell or 
the specific vehicle, in the case of a built-in system, first against 
the dummy crotch and then at the dummy thorax in the midsagittal plane 
of the dummy. For a child restraint system with a fixed or movable 
surface described in S5.2.2.2, which is being tested under the 
conditions of test configuration II, do not attach any of the child 
restraint belts unless they are an integral part of the fixed or movable 
surface. For all other child restraint systems and for a child restraint 
system with a fixed or movable surface which is being tested under the 
conditions of test configuration I, attach all appropriate child 
restraint belts and tighten them as specified in S6.1.2. Attach all 
appropriate vehicle belts and tighten them as specified in S6.1.2. 
Position each movable surface in accordance with the instructions that 
the manufacturer provided under S5.6.1 or S5.6.2.
    (ii) After the steps specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
section, rotate each dummy limb downwards in the plane parallel to the 
dummy's midsagittal plane until the limb contacts a surface of the child 
restraint system or the standard seat assembly, in the case of an add-on 
system, or the specific vehicle shell or specific vehicle, in the case 
of a built-in system, as appropriate. Position the limbs, if necessary, 
so that limb placement does not inhibit torso or head movement in tests 
conducted under S6.
    (2) When testing rear-facing child restraints, position the newborn 
and 9-month-old dummy arms vertically upwards and then rotate each arm 
downward toward the dummy's lower body until the arm contacts a surface 
of the child restraint system or the standard seat assembly in the case 
of an add-on child restraint system, or the specific vehicle shell or 
the specific vehicle, in the case of a built-in child restraint system. 
Ensure that no arm is restrained from movement in other than the 
downward direction, by any part of the system or the belts used to 
anchor the system to the standard seat assembly, the specific shell, or 
the specific vehicle.
    (c)(2) When testing rear-facing child restraints, position the 
newborn and 9-month-old dummy arms and legs vertically upwards and then 
rotate each arm and leg downward toward the dummy's lower body until the 
arm contacts a surface of the child restraint system or the standard 
seat assembly in the case of an add-on child restraint system, or the 
specific vehicle shell or the specific vehicle, in the case of a built-
in child restraint system. Ensure that no arm is restrained from 
movement in other than the downward direction, by any part of the system 
or the belts used to anchor the system to the standard seat assembly, 
the specific shell, or the specific vehicle.
    S10.2.2  Three-year-old and six-year-old test dummy. Position the 
test dummy according to the instructions for child positioning that the 
restraint manufacturer provided with the system in accordance with 
S5.6.1 or S5.6.2, while conforming to the following:
    (a) Holding the test dummy torso upright until it contacts the 
system's design seating surface, place the test dummy in the seated 
position within the system with the midsagittal plane of the test dummy 
head--
    (1) Coincident with the center SORL of the standard seating 
assembly, in the case of the add-on child restraint system, or
    (2) Vertical and parallel to the longitudinal center line of the 
specific vehicle, in the case of a built-in child restraint system.
    (b) Extend the arms of the test dummy as far as possible in the 
upward vertical direction. Extend the legs of the dummy as far as 
possible in the forward horizontal direction, with the

[[Page 537]]

dummy feet perpendicular to the center line of the lower legs.
    (c) Using a flat square surface with an area of 2580 square 
millimeters, apply a force of 178 N, perpendicular to:
    (1) The plane of the back of the standard seat assembly, in the case 
of an add-on system, or
    (2) The back of the vehicle seat in the specific vehicle shell or 
the specific vehicle, in the case of a built-in system, first against 
the dummy crotch and then at the dummy thorax in the midsagittal plane 
of the dummy. For a child restraint system with a fixed or movable 
surface described in S5.2.2.2, which is being tested under the 
conditions of test configuration II, do not attach any of the child 
restraint belts unless they are an integral part of the fixed or movable 
surface. For all other child restraint systems and for a child restraint 
system with a fixed or movable surface which is being tested under the 
conditions of test configuration I, attach all appropriate child 
restraint belts and tighten them as specified in S6.1.2. Attach all 
appropriate vehicle belts and tighten them as specified in S6.1.2. 
Position each movable surface in accordance with the instructions that 
the manufacturer provided under S5.6.1 or S5.6.2.
    (d) After the steps specified in paragraph (c) of this section, 
rotate each dummy limb downwards in the plane parallel to the dummy's 
midsagittal plane until the limb contacts a surface of the child 
restraint system or the standard seat assembly, in the case of an add-on 
system, or the specific vehicle shell or specific vehicle, in the case 
of a built-in system, as appropriate. Position the limbs, if necessary, 
so that limb placement does not inhibit torso or head movement in tests 
conducted under S6.

    S1. Scope and purpose.
    (a) Scope. This standard specifies performance requirements for 
protection of occupants in side impact crashes.
    (b) Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to reduce the risk of 
serious and fatal injury to occupants of passenger cars in side impact 
crashes by specifying vehicle crashworthiness requirements in terms of 
accelerations measured on anthropomorphic dummies in test crashes, by 
specifying strength requirements for side doors, and by other means.
    S2. Applicability. This standard applies to passenger cars. 
Effective September 1, 1993, sections S3(a), S3(e), S3.1 through S3.2.3, 
and S4 of the standard apply to multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, 
and buses with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less, except for walk-in vans.
    S2.1  Definitions.
    Contoured means, with respect to a door, that the lower portion of 
its front or rear edge is curved upward, typically to conform to a wheel 
well.
    Double side doors means a pair of hinged doors with the lock and 
latch mechanisms located where the door lips overlap.
    Walk-in van means a van in which a person can enter the occupant 
compartment in an upright position.
    S3. Requirements. (a)(1) Except as provided in section S3(e), each 
passenger car shall be able to meet the requirements of either, at the 
manufacturer's option, S3.1 or S3.2, when any of its side doors that can 
be used for occupant egress is tested according to S4.

[[Page 551]]

    (2) Except as provided in section S3(e), each multipurpose passenger 
vehicle, truck and bus manufactured on or after September 1, 1994 shall 
be able to meet the requirements of either, at the manufacturer's 
option, S3.1 or S3.2, when any of its side doors that can be used for 
occupant egress is tested according to S4.
    (b) When tested under the conditions of S6, each pasenger car 
manufactured on or after September 1, 1996 shall meet the requirements 
of S5.1, S5.2, and S5.3 in a 33.5 miles per hour impact in which the car 
is struck on either side by a moving deformable barrier. Part 572, 
subpart F test dummies are placed in the front and rear outboard seating 
positions on the struck side of the car. However, the rear seat 
requirements do not apply to passenger cars with a wheelbase greater 
than 130 inches, or to passenger cars which have rear seating areas that 
are so small that the part 572, subpart F dummies cannot be accommodated 
according to the positioning procedure specified in S7.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, from 
September 1, 1993 to August 31, 1996, a specified percentage of each 
manufacturer's yearly passenger car production, as set forth in S8, 
shall, when tested under the conditions of S6, meet the requirements of 
S5.1, S5.2, and S5.3 in a 33.5 miles per hour impact in which the car is 
struck on either side by a moving deformable barrier. Part 572, subpart 
F test dummies are placed in the front and rear outboard seating 
positions on the struck side of the car. However, the rear seat 
requirements do not apply to passenger cars with a wheelbase greater 
than 130 inches, or to passenger cars which have rear seating areas that 
are so small that the part 572, subpart F dummies cannot be accommodated 
according to the positioning procedure specified in S7.
    (d) A manufacturer may, at its option, comply with the requirements 
of this paragraph instead of paragraph (c) of this section. When tested 
under the conditions of S6, each passenger car manufactured from 
September 1, 1994 to August 31, 1996 shall meet the requirements of 
S5.1, S5.2, and S5.3 in a 33.5 miles per hour impact in which the car is

    S4. Test procedures. The following procedures apply to determining 
compliance with paragraph S3:
    (a) Place side windows in their uppermost position and all doors in 
locked position. Place the sill of the side of the vehicle opposite to 
the side being tested against a rigid unyielding vertical surface. Fix 
the vehicle rigidly in position by means of tiedown attachments located 
at or forward of the front wheel centerline and at or rearward of the 
rear wheel centerline.
    (b) Prepare a loading device consisting of a rigid steel cylinder or 
semicylinder 305 mm (12 inches) in diameter with an edge radius of 13 mm 
(\1/2\ inch). The length of the loading device shall be such that--
    (1) For doors with windows, the top surface of the loading device is 
at least 13 mm (\1/2\ inch) above the bottom edge of the door window 
opening but not of a length that will cause contact with any structure 
above the bottom edge of the door window opening during the test.
    (2) For doors without windows, the top surface of the loading device 
is at the same height above the ground as when the loading device is 
positioned in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section for 
purposes of testing a front door with windows on the same vehicle.
    (c) Locate the loading device as shown in Figure 1 (side view) of 
this section so that--
    (1) Its longitudinal axis is vertical.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) (i) and (ii) of this 
section, its longitudinal axis is laterally opposite the midpoint of a 
horizontal line drawn across the outer surface of the door 127 mm (5 
inches) above the lowest point of the door, exclusive of any decorative 
or protective molding that is not permanently affixed to the door panel.
    (i) For contoured doors on trucks, buses, and multipurpose passenger 
vehicles with a GVWR of 4,545 kg (10,000 pounds) or less, if the length 
of the horizontal line specified in (c)(2) is not equal to or greater 
than 559 mm (22 inches), the line is moved vertically up the side of the 
door to the point at which the line is 559 mm (22 inches) long. The 
longitudinal axis of the loading device is then located laterally 
opposite the midpoint of that line.
    (ii) For double side doors on trucks, buses, and multipurpose 
passenger vehicles with a GVWR of 4,545 kg (10,000 pounds) or less, its 
longitudinal axis is laterally opposite the midpoint of a horizontal 
line drawn across the outer surface of the double door span, 127 mm (5 
inches) above the lowest point on the doors, exclusive of any decorative 
or protective molding that is not permanently affixed to the door panel.
    (3) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(3) (i) and (ii) of this 
section, its bottom surface is in the same horizontal plane as the 
horizontal line drawn across the outer surface of the door 127 mm (5 
inches) above the lowest point of the door, exclusive of any decorative 
or protective molding that is not permanently affixed to the door panel.

[[Page 553]]

    (i) For contoured doors on trucks, buses, and multipurpose passenger 
vehicles with a GVWR of 4,545 kg (10,000 pounds) or less, its bottom 
surface is in the lowest horizontal plane such that every point on the 
lateral projection of the bottom surface of the device on the door is at 
least 127 mm (5 inches), horizontally and vertically, from any edge of 
the door panel, exclusive of any decorative or protective molding that 
is not permanently affixed to the door panel.
    (ii) For double side doors, its bottom surface is in the same 
horizontal plane as a horizontal line drawn across the outer surface of 
the double door span, 127 mm (5 inches) above the lowest point of the 
doors, exclusive of any decorative or protective molding that is not 
permanently affixed to the door panel.
    (d) Using the loading device, apply a load to the outer surface of 
the door in an inboard direction normal to a vertical plane along the 
vehicle's longitudinal centerline. Apply the load continuously such that 
the loading device travel rate does not exceed one-half inch per second 
until the loading device travels 18 inches. Guide the loading device to 
prevent it from being rotated or displaced from its direction of travel. 
The test must be completed within 120 seconds.
    (e) Record applied load versus displacement of the loading device, 
either continuously or in increments of not more than 1 inch or 200 
pounds for the entire crush distance of 18 inches.
    (f) Determine the initial crush resistance, intermediate crush 
resistance, and peak crush resistance as follows:
    (1) From the results recorded in paragraph (e) of this section, plot 
a curve of load versus displacement and obtain the integral of the 
applied load with respect to the crush distances specified in paragraphs 
(f) (2) and (3) of this section. These quantities, expressed in inch-
pounds and divided by the specified crush distances, represent the 
average forces in pounds required to deflect the door those distances.
    (2) The initial crush resistance is the average force required to 
deform the door over the initial 6 inches of crush.
    (3) The intermediate crush resistance is the average force required 
to deform the door over the initial 12 inches of crush.
    (4) The peak crush resistance is the largest force recorded over the 
entire 18-inch crush distance.

    S5. Dynamic performance requirements.
    S5.1  Thorax. The Thoracic Trauma Index (TTI(d)) shall not exceed 85 
g for passenger cars with four side doors, and shall not exceed 90 g for 
passenger cars with two side doors, when calculated in accordance with 
the following formula:

TTI(d) = \1/2\(G<INF>R</INF> + G<INF>LS</INF>)

The term ``G<INF>R</INF>'' is the greater of the peak accelerations of 
either the upper or lower rib, expressed in g's and the term 
``G<INF>LS</INF>'' is the lower spine (T12) peak acceleration, expressed 
in g's. The peak acceleration values are obtained in accordance with the 
procedure specified in S6.13.5.
    S5.2  Pelvis. The peak lateral acceleration of the pelvis, as 
measured in accordance with S6.13.5, shall not exceed 130 g's.
    S5.3  Door opening.
    S5.3.1  Any side door, which is struck by the moving deformable 
barrier, shall not separate totally from the car.
    S5.3.2   Any door (including a rear hatchback or tailgate), which is 
not

[[Page 555]]

struck by the moving deformable barrier, shall meet the following 
requirements:
    S5.3.2.1  The door shall not disengage from the latched position;
    S5.3.2.2  The latch shall not separate from the striker, and the 
hinge components shall not separate from each other or from their 
attachment to the vehicle.
    S5.3.2.3  Neither the latch nor the hinge systems of the door shall 
pull out of their anchorages.
    S6. Test conditions.
    S6.1  Test weight. Each passenger car is loaded to its unloaded 
vehicle weight, plus its rated cargo and luggage capacity, secured in 
the luggage area, plus the weight of the necessary anthropomorphic test 
dummies. Any added test equipment is located away from impact areas in 
secure places in the vehicle. The car's fuel system is filled in 
accordance with the following procedure. With the test vehicle on a 
level surface, pump the fuel from the vehicle's fuel tank and then 
operate the engine until it stops. Then, add Stoddard solvent to the 
test vehicle's fuel tank in an amount which is equal to not less than 92 
percent and not more than 94 percent of the fuel tank's usable capacity 
stated by the vehicle's manufacturer. In addition, add the amount of 
Stoddard solvent needed to fill the entire fuel system from the fuel 
tank through the engine's induction system.
    S6.2  Vehicle test attitude. Determine the distance between a level 
surface and a standard reference point on the test vehicle's body, 
directly above each wheel opening, when the vehicle is in its ``as 
delivered'' condition. The ``as delivered'' condition is the vehicle as 
received at the test site, filled to 100 percent of all fluid capacities 
and with all tires inflated to the manufacturer's specifications listed 
on the vehicle's tire placard. Determine the distance between the same 
level surface and the same standard reference points in the vehicle's 
``fully loaded condition.'' The ``fully loaded condition'' is the test 
vehicle loaded in accordance with S6.1. The load placed in the cargo 
area is centered over the longitudinal centerline of the vehicle. The 
pretest vehicle attitude is equal to either the as delivered or fully 
loaded attitude or between the as delivered attitude and the fully 
loaded attitude.
    S6.3  Adjustable seats. Adjustable seats are placed in the 
adjustment position midway between the forward most and rearmost 
positions, and if separately adjustable in a vertical direction, are at 
the lowest position. If an adjustment position does not exist midway 
between the forwardmost and rearmost positions, the closest adjustment 
position to the rear of the midpoint is used.
    S6.4  Adjustable seat back placement. Place adjustable seat backs in 
the manufacturer's nominal design riding position in the manner 
specified by the manufacturer. If the position is not specified, set the 
seat back at the first detent rearward of 25 deg. from the vertical. 
Place each adjustable head restraint in its highest adjustment position. 
Position adjustable lumbar supports so that they are set in their 
released, i.e., full back position.
    S6.5  Adjustable steering wheels. Adjustable steering controls are 
adjusted so that the steering wheel hub is at the geometric center of 
the locus it describes when it is moved through its full range of 
driving positions.
    S6.6  Windows. Movable vehicle windows and vents are placed in the 
fully closed position on the struck side of the vehicle.
    S6.7  Convertible tops. Convertibles and open-body type vehicles 
have the top, if any, in place in the closed passenger compartment 
configuration.
    S6.8  Doors. Doors, including any rear hatchback or tailgate, are 
fully closed and latched but not locked.
    S6.9  Transmission and brake engagement. For a vehicle equipped with 
a manual transmission, the transmission is placed in second gear. For a 
vehicle equipped with an automatic transmission, the transmission is 
placed in neutral. For all vehicles, the parking brake is engaged.
    S6.10  Moving deformable barrier. The moving deformable barrier 
conforms to the dimensions shown in Figure 2 and specified in part 587.
    6.11  Impact reference line. For vehicles with a wheelbase of 114 
inches or less, on the side of the vehicle that will be struck by the 
moving deformable

[[Page 556]]

barrier, place a vertical reference line which is 37 inches forward of 
the center of the vehicle's wheelbase. For vehicles with a wheelbase 
greater than 114 inches, on the side of the vehicle that will be struck 
by the moving deformable barrier, place a vertical reference line which 
is 20 inches rearward of the centerline of the vehicle's front axle.
    S6.12  Impact configuration. The test vehicle (vehicle A in Figure 
3) is stationary. The line of forward motion of the moving deformable 
barrier (vehicle B in Figure 3) forms an angle of 63 degrees with the 
centerline of the test vehicle. The longitudinal centerline of the 
moving deformable barrier is perpendicular to the longitudinal 
centerline of the test vehicle when the barrier strikes the test 
vehicle. In a test in which the test vehicle is to be struck on its left 
(right) side: All wheels of the moving deformable barrier are positioned 
at an angle of 27 <plus-minus> 1 degrees to the right (left) of the 
centerline of the moving deformable barrier; and the left (right) 
forward edge of the moving deformable barrier is aligned so that a 
longitudinal plane tangent to that side passes through the impact 
reference line within a tolerance of <plus-minus> 2 inches when the 
barrier strikes the test vehicle.
    S6.13  Anthropomorphic test dummies.
    S6.13.1  The anthropomorphic test dummies used for evaluation of a 
vehicle's side impact protection conform to the requirements of subpart 
F of part 572 of this chapter. In a test in which the test vehicle is to 
be struck on its left side, each dummy is to be configured and 
instrumented to be struck on its left side, in accordance with subpart F 
of part 572. In a test in which the test vehicle is to be struck on its 
right side, each dummy is to be configured and instrumented to be struck 
on its right side, in accordance with subpart F of part 572.
    S6.13.2  Each part 572, subpart F test dummy specified is clothed in 
formfitting cotton stretch garments with short sleeves and midcalf 
length pants. Each foot of the test dummy is equipped with a size 11EEE 
shoe, which meets the configuration size, sole, and heel thickness 
specifications of MIL-S-13192 (1976) and weighs 1.25 <plus-minus>0.2 
pounds.
    S6.13.3  Limb joints are set at between 1 and 2 g's. Leg joints are 
adjusted with the torso in the supine position.
    S6.13.4  The stabilized temperature of the test dummy at the time of

    S7. Positioning procedure for the part 572 subpart F test dummy. 
Position a correctly configured test dummy, conforming to subpart F of 
part 572 of this chapter, in the front outboard seating position on the 
side of the test vehicle to be struck by the moving deformable barrier 
and position another conforming test dummy in the rear outboard position 
on the same side of the vehicle, as specified in S7.1 through S7.4. Each 
test dummy is restrained using all available belt systems in all seating 
positions where such belt restraints are provided. In addition, any 
folding armrest is retracted.
    S7.1  Torso.
    S7.1.1  For a test dummy in the driver position.
    (a) For a bench seat. The upper torso of the test dummy rests 
against the seat back. The midsagittal plane of the test dummy is 
vertical and parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal centerline, and 
passes through the center of the steering wheel.
    (b) For a bucket seat. The upper torso of the test dummy rests 
against the seat back. The midsagittal plane of the test dummy is 
vertical and parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal centerline, and 
coincides with the longitudinal centerline of the bucket seat.
    S7.1.2  For a test dummy in the front outboard passenger position.
    (a) For a bench seat. The upper torso of the test dummy rests 
against the seat back. The midsagittal plane of the test dummy is 
vertical and parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal centerline, and the 
same distance from the vehicle's longitudinal centerline as would be the 
midsagittal plane of a test dummy positioned in the driver position 
under S7.1.1.
    (b) For a bucket seat. The upper torso of the test dummy rests 
against the seat back. The midsagittal plane of the test dummy is 
vertical and parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal centerline, and 
coincides with the longitudinal centerline of the bucket seat.
    S7.1.3  For a test dummy in either of the rear outboard passenger 
positions.
    (a) For a bench seat. The upper torso of the test dummy rests 
against the seat back. The midsagittal plane of the test dummy is 
vertical and parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal centerline, and, if 
possible, the same distance from the vehicle's longitudinal centerline 
as the midsagittal plane of a test dummy positioned in the driver 
position under S7.1.1. If it is not possible to position the test dummy 
so that its midsagittal plane is parallel to the vehicle longitudinal 
centerline and is at this distance from the vehicle's longitudinal 
centerline, the test dummy is positioned so that some portion of the 
test dummy just touches, at or above the seat level, the side surface of 
the vehicle, such as the upper quarter panel, an armrest, or any 
interior trim (i.e., either the broad trim panel surface or a smaller, 
localized trim feature).
    (b) For a bucket or contoured seat. The upper torso of the test 
dummy rests against the seat back. The midsagittal plane of the test 
dummy is vertical and parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal centerline, 
and coincides with the longitudinal centerline of the bucket or 
contoured seat.
    S7.2  Pelvis.
    S7.2.1  H-point. The H-points of each test dummy coincide within \1/
2\ inch in the vertical dimension and \1/2\ inch in the horizontal 
dimension of a point \1/4\ inch below the position of the H-point 
determined by using the equipment for the 50th percentile and procedures 
specified in SAE J826 (1980) (incorporated by reference; see 
Sec. 571.5), except that Table 1 of SAE J826 is not applicable. The 
length of the lower leg and thigh segments of the H-point machine are 
adjusted to 16.3 and 15.8 inches, respectively.
    S7.2.2  Pelvic angle. As determined using the pelvic angle gauge (GM 
drawing 78051-532 incorporated by reference in part 572, subpart E of 
this chapter) which is inserted into the H-point gauging hole of the 
dummy, the angle of the plane of the surface on the lumbar-pelvic 
adaptor on which the lumbar spine attaches is 23 to 25 degrees from the 
horizontal, sloping upward toward the front of the vehicle.
    S7.3  Legs.
    S7.3.1  For a test dummy in the driver position. The upper legs of 
each test dummy rest against the seat cushion to the extent permitted by 
placement of the feet. The left knee of the dummy is positioned such 
that the distance from the outer surface of the knee

[[Page 560]]

pivot bolt to the dummy's midsagittal plane is six inches. To the extent 
practicable, the left leg of the test dummy is in a vertical 
longitudinal plane.
    S7.3.2  For a test dummy in the outboard passenger positions. The 
upper legs of each test dummy rest against the seat cushion to the 
extent permitted by placement of the feet. The initial distance between 
the outboard knee clevis flange surfaces is 11.5 inches. To the extent 
practicable, both legs of the test dummies in outboard passenger 
positions are in vertical longitudinal planes. Final adjustment to 
accommodate placement of feet in accordance with S7.4 for various 
passenger compartment configurations is permitted.
    S7.4  Feet.
    S7.4.1  For a test dummy in the driver position. The right foot of 
the test dummy rests on the undepressed accelerator with the heel 
resting as far forward as possible on the floorpan. The left foot is set 
perpendicular to the lower leg with the heel resting on the floorpan in 
the same lateral line as the right heel.
    S7.4.2  For a test dummy in the front outboard passenger position. 
The feet of the test dummy are placed on the vehicle's toeboard with the 
heels resting on the floorpan as close as possible to the intersection 
of the toeboard and floorpan. If the feet cannot be placed flat on the 
toeboard, they are set perpendicular to the lower legs and placed as far 
forward as possible so that the heels rest on the floorpan.
    S7.4.3  For a test dummy in either of the rear outboard passenger 
positions. The feet of the test dummy are placed flat on the floorpan 
and beneath the front seat as far as possible without front seat 
interference. If necessary, the distance between the knees can be 
changed in order to place the feet beneath the seat.

emergency exit door shall allow manual release of the door by a single 
person, from both inside and outside the passenger compartment, using a 
force application that conforms to S5.3.3.1 (a) through (c) of this 
section, except a school bus with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less is not 
required to conform to S5.3.3.1 (a). The release mechanism shall operate 
without the use of remote controls or tools, and notwithstanding any 
failure of the vehicle's power system. When the release mechanism is not 
in the position that causes an emergency exit door to be closed and the 
vehicle's ignition is in the ``on'' position, a continuous warning sound 
shall be audible at the driver's seating position and in the vicinity of 
the emergency exit door.
    (a) Location: Within the high force access region shown in Figure 3A 
for a side emergency exit door, and in figure 3D for a rear emergency 
exit door.
    (b) Type of motion: Upward from inside the bus and, at the 
discretion of the manufacturer, from outside the bus. Buses with a GVWR 
of 10,000 pounds or less shall provide interior release mechanisms that 
operate by either an upward or pull-type motion. The pull-type motion 
shall be used only when the release mechanism is recessed in such a 
manner that the handle, level, or other activating device, before being

release mechanisms located in specified low-force or high-force regions 
(at the option of the manufacturer) with force applications and types of 
motions that conform to either S5.3.3.2 (a) or (b) of this section. In 
the case of windows with one release mechanism, the mechanism shall 
require two force applications to release the exit. In the case of 
windows with two release mechanisms, each mechanism shall require one 
application to release the exit. At least one of the force applications 
for each window shall differ from the direction of the initial motion to 
open the exit by no less than 90 deg. and no more than 180 deg.. Each 
release mechanism shall operate without the use of remote controls or 
tools, and notwithstanding any failure of the vehicle's power system. 
When a release mechanism is open and the vehicle's ignition is in the 
``on'' position, a continuous warning shall be audible at the drivers 
seating position and in the vicinity of that emergency exit.
    (a) Emergency exit windows--Low-force application.

after the window retention test required by S5.1, each school bus 
emergency roof exit shall allow manual release of the exit by a single 
person from both inside and outside the passenger compartment, using not 
more than two release mechanisms located at specified low-force or high-
force regions (at the option of the manufacturer) with force 
applications and types of motions that conform either to S5.3.3.3 (a) or 
(b) of this section. In the case of roof exits with one release 
mechanism, the mechanism shall

[[Page 569]]

require two force applications to release the exit. In the case of roof 
exits with two release mechanisms, each mechanism shall require one 
application to release the exit. At least one of the force applications 
for each roof exit shall differ from the direction of the initial push-
out motion of the exit by no less than 90 deg. and no more than 
180 deg..
    (a) Emergency roof exits--Low-force application.
    (1) Location: Within the low force access regions shown in Figure 
3B, in the case of buses whose roof exits are not offset from the plane 
specified in S5.2.3.2(b)(5). In the case of buses which have roof exits 
offset from the plane specified in S5.2.3.2(b)(5), the amount of offset 
shall be used to recalculate the dimensions in Figure 3B for the offset 
exits.

    S6. Preliminary test procedures. Before subjecting a helmet to the 
testing sequence specified in S7., prepare it according to the 
procedures in S6.1, S6.2, and S6.3.
    S6.1 Selection of appropriate headform.
    S6.1.1 A helmet with a manufacturer's designated discrete size or 
size range which does not exceed 6\3/4\ (European size: 54) is tested on 
the small headform. A helmet with a manufacturer's designated discrete 
size or size range which exceeds 6\3/4\, but does not exceed 7\1/2\ 
(European size: 60) is tested on the medium headform. A helmet with a 
manufacturer's designated discrete size or size range which exceeds 7\1/
2\ is tested on the large headform.
    S6.1.2 A helmet with a manufacturer's designated size range which 
includes sizes falling into two or all three size ranges described in 
S6.1.1 is tested on each headform specified for each size range.
    S6.2 Reference marking.
    S6.2.1 Use a reference headform that is firmly seated with the basic 
and reference planes horizontal. Place the complete helmet to be tested 
on the appropriate reference headform, as specified in S6.1.1 and 
S6.1.2.
    S6.2.2 Apply a 10-pound (4.5 kg) static verticle load through the 
helmet's apex. Center the helmet laterally and seat it firmly on the 
reference headform according to its helmet positioning index.
    S6.2.3 Maintaining the load and position described in S6.2.2, draw a 
line (hereinafter referred to as ``test line'') on the outer surface of 
the helmet coinciding with portions of the intersection of that service 
with the following planes, as shown in Figure 2:
    (a) A plane 1 inch (2.5 cm) above and parallel to the reference 
plane in the anterior portion of the reference headform;
    (b) A vertical transverse plane 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) behind the point 
on the anterior surface of the reference headform at the intersection of 
the mid-sagittal and reference planes;
    (c) The reference plane of the reference headform;
    (d) A vertical transverse plane 2.5 inches (6.4. cm) behind the 
center of

[[Page 583]]

the external ear opening in a side view; and
    (e) A plane 1 inch (2.5 cm) below and parallel to the reference 
plane in the posterior portion of the reference headform.
    S6.3 Helmet positioning.
    S6.3.1 Before each test, fix the helmet on a test headform in the 
position that conforms to its helmet positioning index. Secure the 
helmet so that it does not shift position before impact or before 
application of force during testing.
    S6.3.2 In testing as specified in S7.1 and S7.2, place the retention 
system in a position such that it does not interfere with free fall, 
impact or penetration.
    S6.4 Conditioning.
    S6.4.1 Immediately before conducting the testing sequence specified 
in S7, condition each test helmet in accordance with any one of the 
following procedures:
    (a) Ambient conditions. Expose to a temperature of 
70 deg.F(21 deg.C) and a relative humidity of 50 percent for 12 hours.
    (b) Low temperature. Expose to a temperature of 14 deg.F(-10 deg.C) 
for 12 hours.
    (c) High temperature. Expose to a temperature of 122 deg.F(50 deg.C) 
for 12 hours.
    (d) Water immersion. Immerse in water at a temperature of 
77 deg.F(25 deg.C) for 12 hours.
    S6.4.2 If during testing, as specified in S7.1.3 and S7.2.3, a 
helmet is returned to the conditioning environment before the time out 
of that environment exceeds 4 minutes, the helmet is kept in the 
environment for a minimum of 3 minutes before resumption of testing with 
that helmet. If the time out of the environment exceeds 4 minutes, the 
helmet is returned to the environment for a minimum of 3 minutes for 
each minute or portion of a minute that the helmet remained out of the 
environment in excess of 4 minutes or for a maximum of 12 hours, 
whichever is less, before the resumption of testing with that helmet.
    S7. Test conditions.
    S7.1  Impact attenuation test.
    S7.1.1 Impact attenuation is measured by determining acceleration 
imparted to an instrumented test headform on which a complete helmet is 
mounted as specified in S6.3, when it is dropped in guided free fall 
upon a fixed hemispherical anvil and a fixed flat steel anvil.
    S7.1.2 Each helmet is impacted at four sites with two successive 
identical impacts at each site. Two of these sites are impacted upon a 
flat steel anvil and two upon a hemispherical steel anvil as specified 
in S7.1.10 and S7.1.11. The impact sites are at any point on the area 
above the test line described in paragraph S6.2.3, and separated by a 
distance not less than one-sixth of the maximum circumference of the 
helmet in the test area.
    S7.1.3 Impact testing at each of the four sites, as specified in 
S7.1.2, shall start at two minutes, and be completed by four minutes, 
after removal of the helmet from the conditioning environment.
    S7.1.4 (a) The guided free fall drop height for the helmet and test 
headform combination onto the hemispherical anvil shall be such that the 
minimum impact speed is 17.1 feet/second (5.2 m/sec). The minimum drop 
height is 54.5 inches (138.4 cm). The drop height is adjusted upward 
from the minimum to the extent necessary to compensate for friction 
losses.
    (b) The guided free fall drop height for the helmet and test 
headform combination onto the flat anvil shall be such that the minimum 
impact speed is 19.7 ft./sec (6.0 m/sec). The minimum drop height is 72 
inches (182.9 cm). The drop height is adjusted upward from the minimum 
to the extent necessary to compensate for friction losses.
    S7.1.5 Test headforms for impact attenuation testing are constructed 
of magnesium alloy (K-1A), and exhibit no resonant frequencies below 
2,000 Hz.
    S7.1.6 The monorail drop test system is used for impact attenuation 
testing.
    S7.1.7 The weight of the drop assembly, as specified in Table 1, is 
the combined weight of the test headform and the supporting assembly for 
the drop test. The weight of the supporting assembly is not less than 
2.0 lbs. and not more than 2.4 lbs. (0.9 to 1.1 kg). The supporting 
assembly weight for the monorail system is the drop assembly weight 
minus the combined weight of the test headform, the headform's

[[Page 584]]

clamp down ring, and its tie down screws.
    S7.1.8 The center of gravity of the test headform is located at the 
center of the mounting ball on the supporting assembly and lies within a 
cone with its axis vertical and forming a 10 deg. included angle with 
the vertex at the point of impact. The center of gravity of the drop 
assembly lies within the rectangular volume bounded by x = -0.25 inch 
(-0.64 cm), x = 0.85 inch (2.16 cm), y = 0.25 inch (0.64 cm), and y = 
-0.25 inch (-0.64 cm) with the origin located at the center of gravity 
of the test headform. The rectangular volume has no boundary along the 
z-axis. The x-y-z axes are mutually perpendicular and have positive or 
negative designations in accordance with the right-hand rule (See Figure 
5). The origin of the coordinate axes also is located at the center of 
the mounting ball on the supporting assembly (See Figures 6, 7, and 8). 
The x-y-z axes of the test headform assembly on a monorail drop test 
equipment are oriented as follows: From the origin, the x-axis is 
horizontal with its positive direction going toward and passing through 
the vertical centerline of the monorail. The positive z-axis is 
downward. The y-axis also is horizontal and its direction can be decided 
by the z- and x-axes, using the right-hand rule.
    S7.1.9 The acceleration transducer is mounted at the center of 
gravity of the test headform with the sensitive axis aligned to within 
5 deg. of vertical when the test headform assembly is in the impact 
position. The acceleration data channel complies with SAE Recommended 
Practice J211 JUN 80, Instrumentation for Impact Tests, requirements for 
channel class 1,000.
    S7.1.10 The flat anvil is constructed of steel with a 5-inch (12.7 
cm) minimum diameter impact face, and the hemispherical anvil is 
constructed of steel with a 1.9 inch (4.8 cm) radius impact face.
    S7.1.11 The rigid mount for both of the anvils consists of a solid 
mass of at least 300 pounds (136.1 kg), the outer surface of which 
consists of a steel plate with minimum thickness of 1 inch (2.5 cm) and 
minimum surface area of 1 ft \2\ (929 cm \2\ ).
    S7.1.12 The drop system restricts side movement during the impact 
attenuation test so that the sum of the areas bounded by the 
acceleration-time response curves for both the x- and y-axes (horizontal 
axes) is less than five percent of the area bounded by the acceleration-
time response curve for the vertical axis.
    S7.2 Penetration test.
    S7.2.1 The penetration test is conducted by dropping the penetration 
test striker in guided free fall, with its axis aligned vertically, onto 
the outer surface of the complete helmet, when mounted as specified in 
S6.3, at any point above the test line, described in S6.2.3, except on a 
fastener or other rigid projection.
    S7.2.2 Two penetration blows are applied at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) 
apart, and at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the centers of any impacts 
applied during the impact attenuation test.
    S7.2.3 The application of the two penetration blows, specified in 
S7.2.2, starts at two minutes and is completed by four minutes, after 
removal of the helmet from the conditioning environment.
    S7.2.4 The height of the guided free fall is 118.1 inches (3 m), as 
measured from the striker point to the impact point on the outer surface 
of the test helmet.
    S7.2.5 The contactable surface of the penetration test headform is 
constructed of a metal or metallic alloy having a Brinell hardness 
number no greater than 55, which will permit ready detection should 
contact by the striker occur. The surface is refinished if necessary 
before each penetration test blow to permit detection of contact by the 
striker.
    S7.2.6 The weight of the penetration striker is 6 pounds, 10 ounces 
(3 kg).
    S7.2.7 The point of the striker has an included angle of 60 deg., a 
cone height of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm), a tip radius of 0.02 inch (standard 
0.5 millimeter radius) and a minimum hardness of 60 Rockwell, C-scale.
    S7.2.8 The rigid mount for the penetration test headform is as 
described in S7.1.11.
    S7.3 Retention system test.
    S7.3.1 The retention system test is conducted by applying a static 
tensile

[[Page 585]]

load to the retention assembly of a complete helmet, which is mounted, 
as described in S6.3, on a stationary test headform as shown in Figure 
4, and by measuring the movement of the adjustable portion of the 
retention system test device under tension.
    S7.3.2 The retention system test device consists of both an 
adjustable loading mechanism by which a static tensile load is applied 
to the helmet retention assembly and a means for holding the test 
headform and helmet stationary. The retention assembly is fastened 
around two freely moving rollers, both of which have a 0.5 inch (1.3 cm) 
diameter and a 3-inch (7.6 cm) center-to-center separation, and which 
are mounted on the adjustable portion of the tensile loading device 
(Figure 4). The helmet is fixed on the test headform as necessary to 
ensure that it does not move during the application of the test loads to 
the retention assembly.
    S7.3.3 A 50-pound (22.7 kg) preliminary test load is applied to the 
retention assembly, normal to the basic plane of the test headform and 
symmetrical with respect to the center of the retention assembly for 30 
seconds, and the maximum distance from the extremity of the adjustable 
portion of the retention system test device to the apex of the helmet is 
measured.
    S7.3.4 An additional 250-pound (113.4 kg) test load is applied to 
the retention assembly, in the same manner and at the same location as 
described in S7.3.3, for 120 seconds, and the maximum distance from the 
extremity of the adjustable portion of the retention system test device 
to the apex of the helmet is measured.

Sec. 571.219  Standard No. 219; Windshield zone intrusion.

    S1. Scope. This standard specifies limits for the displacement into 
the windshield area of motor vehicle components during a crash.
    S2. Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to reduce crash 
injuries and fatalities that result from occupants contacting vehicle 
components displaced near or through the windshield.
    S3. Application. This standard applies to passenger cars and to 
multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks and buses of 10,000 pounds or 
less gross vehicle weight rating. However, it does not apply to forward 
control vehicles, walk-in van-type vehicles, or to open-body-type 
vehicles with fold-down or removable windshields.
    S4. Definitions. Daylight Opening (DLO) means the maximum 
unobstructed opening through the glazing surface, including reveal or 
garnish moldings adjoining the surface, as measured parallel to the 
outer surface of the glazing material.
    S5. Requirement. When the vehicle traveling longitudinally forward 
at any speed up to and including 30 mph impacts a fixed collision 
barrier that is perpendicular to the line of travel of the vehicle, 
under the conditions of S7., no part of the vehicle outside the occupant 
compartment, except windshield molding and other components designed to 
be normally in contact with the windshield, shall penetrate the 
protected zone template, affixed according to S6., to a depth of more 
than one-quarter inch, and no such part of a vehicle shall penetrate the 
inner surface of that portion of the windshield, within the DLO, below 
the protected zone defined in S6.
    S6.  Protected zone template.
    S6.1  The lower edge of the protected zone is determined by the 
following procedure (see Figure 1).
    (a) Place a 6.5-inch diameter rigid sphere, weighing 15 pounds, in a 
position such that it simultaneously contacts the inner surface of the 
windshield glazing and the surface of the instrument panel, including 
padding. If any accessories or equipment such as the steering control 
system obstruct positioning of the sphere, remove them for the purposes 
of this procedure.
    (b) Draw the locus of points on the inner surface of the windshield 
contactable by the sphere across the width of the instrument panel. From 
the outermost contactable points, extend the locus line horizontally to 
the edges of the glazing material.
    (c) Draw a line on the inner surface of the windshield below and 
one-half inch distant from the locus line.
    (d) The lower edge of the protected zone is the longitudinal 
projection onto the outer surface of the windshield of the line 
determined in S6.1(c).
    S6.2  The protected zone is the space enclosed by the following 
surfaces, as shown in Figure 1:
    (a) The outer surface of the windshield in its precrash 
configuration.
    (b) The locus of points 3 inches outward along perpendiculars drawn 
to each point on the outer surface of the windshield.
    (c) The locus of lines forming a 45 deg. angle with the outer 
surface of the windshield at each point along the top and side edges of 
the outer surface of the windshield and the lower edge of the protected 
zone determined in S6.1, in the plane perpendicular to the edge at that 
point.
    S6.3  A template is cut or formed from Styrofoam, type DB, cut cell, 
to the dimensions of the zone as determined in S6.2. The template is 
affixed to the windshield so that it delineates the protected zone and 
remains affixed throughout the crash test.
    S7. Test conditions. The requirement of S5. shall be met under the 
following conditions:
    S7.1  The protected zone template is affixed to the windshield in 
the manner described in S6.
    S7.2  The hood, hood latches, and any other hood retention 
components are engaged prior to the barrier crash.
    S7.3  Adjustable cowl tops or other adjustable panels in front of 
the windshield are in the position used under normal operating 
conditions when windshield wiping systems are not in use.
    S7.4  The parking brake is disengaged and the transmission is in

[[Page 598]]

    S7.6  The fuel tank is filled to any level from 90 to 95 per cent of 
capacity.
    S7.7  The vehicle, including test devices and instrumentation, is 
loaded as follows:
    (a) Except as specified in S7.6, a passenger car is loaded to its 
unloaded vehicle weight plus its rated cargo and luggage capacity 
weight, secured in the luggage area, plus a 50th-percentile test dummy 
as specified in part 572 of this chapter at each front outboard 
designated seating position and at any other position whose protection 
system is required to be tested by a dummy under the provisions of 
Standard No. 208. Each dummy is restrained only by means that are 
installed for protection at its seating position.
    (b) Except as specified in S7.6, a multipurpose passenger vehicle, 
truck or bus is loaded to its unloaded vehicle weight, plus 300 pounds 
or its rated cargo and luggage capacity, whichever is less, secured to 
the vehicle, plus a 50th-percentile test dummy as specified in part 572 
of this chapter at each front outboard designated seating position and 
at any other position whose protection system is required to be tested 
by a dummy under the provisions of Standard No. 208. Each dummy is 
restrained only by means that are installed for protection at its 
seating position. The load is distributed so that the weight on each 
axle as measured at the tire-ground interface is in proportion to its 
GAWR. If the weight on any axle when the vehicle is loaded to its 
unloaded vehicle weight plus dummy weight exceeds the axle's 
proportional share of the test weight, the remaining weight is placed so 
that the weight on that axle remains the same. For the purposes of this 
section, unloaded vehicle weight does not include the weight of work-
performing accessories. Vehicles are tested to a maximum unloaded 
vehicle weight of 5,500 pounds.

plate shall not exceed 5\1/8\ inches; and
    (b) Each emergency exit of the vehicle provided in accordance with 
Standard No. 217 (Sec. 571.217) shall be capable of opening as specified 
in that standard during the full application of the force and after 
release of the force, except that an emergency exit located in the roof 
of the vehicle is not required to be capable of being opened during the 
application of the force. A particular vehicle (i.e., test specimen) 
need not meet the emergency exit opening requirement after release of 
force if it is subjected to the emergency exit opening requirements 
during the full application of the force.
    S5. Test procedures. Each vehicle shall be capable of meeting the 
requirements of S4. when tested in accordance with the procedures set 
forth below.
    S5.1  With any non-rigid chassis-to-body mounts replaced with 
equivalent rigid mounts, place the vehicle on a rigid horizontal surface 
so that the vehicle is entirely supported by means of the vehicle frame. 
If the vehicle is constructed without a frame, place the vehicle on its 
body sills. Remove any components which extend upward from the vehicle 
roof.

12 inches shorter than the vehicle roof and 36 inches wide; and
    (b) In the case of a vehicle with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less, 5 
inches longer and 5 inches wider than the vehicle roof. For purposes of 
these measurements, the vehicle roof is that structure, seen in the top 
projected view, that coincides with the passenger and driver compartment 
of the vehicle.
    S5.3  Position the force application plate on the vehicle roof so 
that its rigid surface is perpendicular to a vertical longitudinal plane 
and it contacts the roof at not less than two points, and so that, in 
the top projected view, its longitudinal centerline coincides with the 
longitudinal centerline of the vehicle, and its front and rear edges are 
an equal distance inside the front and rear edges of the vehicle roof at 
the centerline.

direction to the force application plate at any rate not more than 0.5 
inch per second, until a force of 500 pounds has been applied.
    S5.5  Apply additional vertical force in the downward direction to 
the force application plate at a rate of not more than 0.5 inch per 
second until the force specified in S4. has been applied, and maintain 
this application of force.
    S5.6  Measure the downward movement of any point on the force 
application plate which occurred during the application of force in 
accordance with S5.5.
    S5.7  To test the capability of the vehicle's emergency exits to 
open in accordance with S4.(b)--
    (a) In the case of testing under the full application of force, open 
the emergency exits as specified in S4.(b) while maintaining the force 
applied in accordance with S5.4 and S5.5; and
    (b) In the case of testing after the release of all force, release 
all downward force applied to the force application plate and open the 
emergency exits as specified in S4.(b).

manufacturer of a rear impact guard for one of its own vehicles shall 
prepare and keep a copy of installation procedures applicable to each 
vehicle/guard combination for a period of one year from the date of 
vehicle manufacture and provide them to NHTSA on request. The 
instructions or procedures shall specify:
    (a) Vehicles on which the guard can be installed. Vehicles may be 
designated by listing the make and model of the vehicles for which the 
guard is suitable, or by specifying the design elements that would make 
any vehicle an appropriate host for the particular guard (e.g., vehicles 
with frame rails of certain spacing and gauge of steel).
    (b) A description of the chassis surface to which the guard will be 
attached, including frame design types with dimensions, material

horizontal member of the guard is deflected in a forward direction until 
the hydraulic unit(s) have reached the full extent of their designed 
travel or 610 mm, whichever occurs first. The hydraulic units are 
compressed before the application of force to the guard in accordance 
with S6.6 of this section and maintained in this condition throughout 
the testing under S6.6 of this section.
    S6.2 Guard Installation for Strength and Energy Absorption Tests.
    (a) The rear impact guard is attached to a test device.
    (b) The test device for the compliance test will be whichever of the 
following devices, if either was used, the manufacturer used as a basis 
for its certification of the guard in S5.3(c) of this section. If the 
manufacturer did not use one of these devices or does not specify a 
device when asked by the agency, the agency may choose either of the 
following devices--
    (1) A rigid test fixture. In the case of testing on a rigid test 
fixture NHTSA will consult the installation instructions or procedures 
to determine the surface or structure that the guard is supposed to be 
mounted to and mount it to the rigid test fixture in the same way.
    (2) A complete trailer for which installation of the guard is 
suitable, as provided in the manufacturer's installation instructions or 
procedures required by S5.5 of this section. The trailer chassis is 
secured so that it behaves essentially as a fixed object during the 
test, such that the test must be passed no matter how little it moves 
during the test.

[[Page 617]]

    (c) The guard is attached in accordance with the instructions or 
procedures for guard attachment provided by the guard manufacturer for 
that guard as required by S5.5 of this section.
    S6.3 Force Application Device. The force application device employed 
in S6.6 of this section consists of a rectangular solid made of rigid 
steel. The steel solid is 203 mm in height, 203 mm in width, and 25 mm 
in thickness. The 203 mm by 203 mm face of the block is used as the 
contact surface for application of the forces specified in S5.2.1 (a) 
through (c) of this section. Each edge of the contact surface of the 
block has a radius of curvature of 5 mm plus or minus 1 mm.
    S6.4 Test Locations. With the guard mounted to the rigid test 
fixture or to a complete trailer, determine the test locations P1, P2, 
and P3 in accordance with the procedure set forth in S6.4 (a) through 
(c) of this section. See Figure 1 of this section.
    (a) Test location P1 is the point on the rearmost surface of the 
horizontal member of the guard that:
    (1) Is located at a distance of \3/8\ of the guard width from the 
vertical longitudinal plane passing through center of the guard;
    (2) Lies on either side of the center of the guard's horizontal 
member; and
    (3) Is 50 mm above the bottom of the guard.
    (b) Test location P2 is the point on the rearmost surface of the 
horizontal member of the guard that:
    (1) Lies in the longitudinal vertical plane passing through the 
center of the guard's horizontal member; and
    (2) Is 50 mm above the bottom of the guard.
    (c) Test location P3 is any point on the rearmost surface of the 
horizontal member of the guard that:
    (1) Is not less than 355 mm and not more than 635 mm from the 
vertical longitudinal plane passing through center of the guard;
    (2) Lies on either the right or left side of the horizontal member 
of the guard; and
    (3) Is 50 mm above the bottom of the guard.
    S6.5 Positioning of Force Application Device. Before applying any 
force to the guard, locate the force application device such that:

    (a) The center point of the contact surface of the force application 
device is aligned with and touching the guard test location, as defined 
by the specifications of S6.4 of this section.

    (b) The longitudinal axis of the force application device passes 
through the test location and is perpendicular to the transverse 
vertical plane that is tangent to the rearmost surface of the guard's 
horizontal member.

    S6.6 Force Application. After the force application device has been 
positioned according to S6.5 of this section, apply the loads specified 
in S5.2.1 of this section. Load application procedures are specified in 
the S6.6 (a) through (d) of this section.

    (a) Using the force application device, apply force to the guard in 
a forward direction such that the displacement rate of the force 
application device is constant and not less than 1 mm and not more than 
1.5 mm per second.

    (b) If conducting a strength test to satisfy the requirement of 
S5.2.1 of this section, the force is applied until the forces specified 
in S5.2.1 of this section have been exceeded, or until the displacement 
of the force application device has reached at least 125 mm, whichever 
occurs first.

    (c) If conducting a test to be used for the calculation of energy 
absorption levels to satisfy the requirement of S5.2.2 of this section, 
apply the force to the guard until displacement of the force application 
device has reached 125 mm. For calculation of guard energy absorption, 
the value of force is recorded at least ten times per 25 mm of 
displacement of the contact surface of the loading device. Reduce the 
force until the guard no longer offers resistance to the force 
application device. Produce a force vs. deflection diagram of the type 
shown in Figure 2 of this section using this information. Determine the 
energy absorbed by the guard by calculating the shaded area bounded by 
the curve in the force vs. deflection diagram and the abscissa (X-axis).

[[Page 618]]

    (d) During each force application, the force application device is 
guided so that it does not rotate. At all times during the application 
of force, the location of the longitudinal axis of the force application 
device remains constant.

Sec. 571.302  Standard No. 302; Flammability of interior materials.

    S1. Scope. This standard specifies burn resistance requirements for 
materials used in the occupant compartments of motor vehicles.
    S2. Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to reduce the deaths 
and injuries to motor vehicle occupants caused by vehicle fires, 
especially those originating in the interior of the vehicle from sources 
such as matches or cigarettes.
    S3. Application. This standard applies to passenger cars, 
multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, and buses.
    S3A. Definitions. Occupant compartment air space means the space 
within the occupant compartment that normally contains refreshable air.
    S4. Requirements.
    S4.1  The portions described in S4.2 of the following components of 
vehicle occupant compartments shall meet the requirements of S4.3: Seat 
cushions, seat backs, seat belts, headlining, convertible tops, arm 
rests, all trim panels including door, front, rear, and side panels, 
compartment shelves, head restraints, floor coverings, sun visors, 
curtains, shades, wheel housing covers, engine compartment covers, 
mattress covers, and any other interior materials, including padding and 
crash-deployed elements, that are designed to absorb energy on contact 
by occupants in the event of a crash.
    S4.1.1  [Reserved]
    S4.2  Any portion of a single or composite material which is within 
\1/2\ inch of the occupant compartment air space shall meet the 
requirements of S4.3.
    S4.2.1  Any material that does not adhere to other material(s) at 
every point of contact shall meet the requirements of S4.3 when tested 
separately.
    S4.2.2  Any material that adheres to other material(s) at every 
point of contact shall meet the requirements of S4.3 when tested as a 
composite with the other material(s).

                          Illustrative Example
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AU91.150

    Material A has a non-adhering interface with material B and is 
tested separately. Part of material B is within \1/2\ inch of the 
occupant compartment air space, and materials B and C adhere at every 
point of contact; therefore B and C are tested as a composite. The cut 
is in material C as shown, to make a specimen \1/2\ inch thick.
    S4.3(a)  When tested in accordance with S5, material described in 
S4.1 and S4.2 shall not burn, nor transmit a flame front across its 
surface, at a rate of more than 4 inches per minute. However, the 
requirement concerning transmission of a flame front shall not apply to 
a surface created by the cutting of a test specimen for purposes of 
testing pursuant to S5.
    (b) If a material stops burning before it has burned for 60 seconds 
from the start of timing, and has not burned more than 2 inches from the 
point where timing was started, it shall be considered to meet the burn-
rate requirement of S4.3(a).
    S5. Test procedure.
    S5.1  Conditions.
    S5.1.1  The test is conducted in a metal cabinet for protecting the 
test specimens from drafts. The interior of the cabinet is 15 inches 
long, 8 inches deep, and 14 inches high. It has a glass observation 
window in the front, a closable opening to permit insertion of the 
specimen holder, and a hole to accommodate tubing for a gas burner. For 
ventilation, it has a \1/2\-inch clearance space around the top of the 
cabinet, ten \3/4\-inch-diameter holes in the base of the cabinet, and 
legs to elevate the bottom of the cabinet by three-eighths of an inch, 
all located as shown in Figure 1.

[[Page 629]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AU91.151


    S5.1.2  Prior to testing, each specimen is conditioned for 24 hours 
at a temperature of 70 deg. F. and a relative humidity of 50 percent, 
and the test is conducted under those ambient conditions.
    S5.1.3  The test specimen is inserted between two matching U-shaped 
frames of metal stock 1-inch wide and \3/8\ of an inch high. The 
interior dimensions of the U-shaped frames are 2 inches wide by 13 
inches long. A specimen that softens and bends at the flaming end so as 
to cause erratic burning is kept horizontal by supports consisting of 
thin, heat-resistant wires, spanning the width of the U-shaped frame 
under the specimen at 1-inch intervals. A device that may be used for 
supporting this type of material is an additional U-shaped frame, wider 
than the U-shaped frame containing the specimen, spanned by 10-mil wires 
of heat-resistant composition at 1-inch intervals, inserted over the 
bottom U-shaped frame.
    S5.1.4  A bunsen burner with a tube of \3/8\-inch inside diameter is 
used. The gas adjusting valve is set to provide a flame, with the tube 
vertical, of 1\1/2\ inches in height. The air inlet to the burner is 
closed.
    S5.1.5  The gas supplied to the burner has a flame temperature 
equivalent to that of natural gas.
    S5.2  Preparation of specimens.
    S5.2.1  Each specimen of material to be tested shall be a rectangle 
4 inches wide by 14 inches long, wherever possible. The thickness of the 
specimen is that of the single or composite material used in the 
vehicle, except that if the material's thickness exceeds \1/2\ inch, the 
specimen is cut down to that thickness measured from the surface of the 
specimen closest to the occupant compartment air space. Where it is not 
possible to obtain a flat specimen because of surface curvature, the 
specimen is cut to not more than \1/2\ inch in thickness at any point. 
The maximum available length or width of a specimen is used where either 
dimension is less than 14 inches or 4 inches, respectively,

[[Page 630]]

unless surrogate testing is required under S4.1.1.
    S5.2.2  The specimen is produced by cutting the material in the 
direction that provides the most adverse test results. The specimen is 
oriented so that the surface closest to the occupant compartment air 
space faces downward on the test frame.
    S5.2.3  Material with a napped or tufted surface is placed on a flat 
surface and combed twice against the nap with a comb having seven to 
eight smooth, rounded teeth per inch.
    S5.3  Procedure.
    (a) Mount the specimen so that both sides and one end are held by 
the U-shaped frame, and one end is even with the open end of the frame. 
Where the maximum available width of a specimen is not more than 2 
inches, so that the sides of the specimen cannot be held in the U-shaped 
frame, place the specimen in position on wire supports as described in 
S5.1.3, with one end held by the closed end of the U-shaped frame.
    (b) Place the mounted specimen in a horizontal position, in the 
center of the cabinet.
    (c) With the flame adjusted according to S5.1.4, position the bunsen 
burner and specimen so that the center of the burner tip is three-
fourths of an inch below the center of the bottom edge of the open end 
of the specimen.
    (d) Expose the specimen to the flame for 15 seconds.
    (e) Begin timing (without reference to the period of application of 
the burner flame) when the flame from the burning specimen reaches a 
point 1\1/2\ inches from the open end of the specimen.
    (f) Measure the time that it takes the flame to progress to a point 
1\1/2\ inches from the clamped end of the specimen. If the flame does 
not reach the specified end point, time its progress to the point where 
flaming stops.
    (g) Calculate the burn rate from the formula

                              B=60 x (D/T)

Where:

B=Burn rate in inches per minute,
D=Length the flame travels in inches, and
T=Time in seconds for the flame to travel D inches.

Sec. 571.304  Standard No. 304; Compressed natural gas fuel container integrity.

    S1. Scope. This standard specifies requirements for the integrity of 
compressed natural gas (CNG), motor vehicle fuel containers.
    S2. Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to reduce deaths and 
injuries occurring from fires that result from fuel leakage during and 
after motor vehicle crashes.
    S3. Application. This standard applies to containers designed to 
store CNG as motor fuel on-board any motor vehicle.
    S4. Definitions.
    Brazing means a group of welding processes wherein coalescence is 
produced by heating to a suitable temperature above 800  deg. F and by 
using a nonferrous filler metal, having a melting point below that to 
the base metals. The filler metal is distributed between the closely 
fitted surfaces of the joint by capillary attraction.
    Burst pressure means the highest internal pressure reached in a CNG 
fuel container during a burst test at a temperature of 21  deg. C (70 
deg. F).
    CNG fuel container means a container designed to store CNG as motor 
fuel on-board a motor vehicle.
    Fill pressure means the internal pressure of a CNG fuel container 
attained at the time of filling. Fill pressure varies according to the 
gas temperature in the container which is dependent on the charging 
parameters and the ambient conditions.
    Full wrapped means applying the reinforcement of a filament or resin 
system over the entire liner, including the domes.
    Hoop wrapped means winding of filament in a substantially 
circumferential pattern over the cylindrical portion of the liner so 
that the filament does not transmit any significant stresses in a 
direction parallel to the cylinder longitudinal axis.
    Hydrostatic pressure means the internal pressure to which a CNG fuel 
container is taken during testing set forth in S5.4.1.
    Liner means the inner gas tight container or gas cylinder to which 
the overwrap is applied.
    Service pressure means the internal settled pressure of a CNG fuel 
container at a uniform gas temperature of 21  deg. C (70  deg. F) and 
full gas content. It is the pressure for which the container has been 
constructed under normal conditions.
    Stress ratio means the stress in the fiber at minimum burst pressure 
divided by the stress in the fiber at service pressure.

adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension 
calculations shall be based on an elastic modulus of 69 GPa (10,000,000 
psi) for aluminum, or 207 GPa (30,000,000 psi) for steel. If the elastic

container or with separate containers.
    S8.3.2  The CNG fuel container is positioned so that its 
longitudinal axis is horizontal. Attach three thermocouples to measure 
temperature on the container's bottom side along a line parallel to the 
container longitudinal centerline. Attach one at the midpoint of the 
container, and one at each end at the point where the dome end 
intersects the container sidewall. Subject the entire length to flame 
impingement, except that the flame shall not be allowed to impinge 
directly on any pressure relief device. Shield the pressure relief 
device with a metal plate.
    S8.3.3  If the test container is 165 cm (65 inches) in length or 
less, place it in the upright position. Attach three thermocouples to 
measure temperature on the container's bottom side along a line which 
intersects the container longitudinal centerline. Attach one at the 
midpoint of the bottom of the container, and one each at the point where 
the dome end intersects the container sidewall. Subject the container to 
total fire engulfment in the vertical. The flame shall not be allowed to 
impinge directly on any pressure relief device. For containers equipped 
with a pressure relief device on one end, the container is positioned 
with the relief device on top. For containers equipped with pressure 
relief devices on both ends, the bottom pressure relief device shall be 
shielded with a metal plate.
    S8.3.4  The lowest part of the container is suspended at a distance 
above the fire such that the container bottom surface temperatures 
specified in S8.3.6 are achieved.
    S8.3.5  The CNG fuel container is tested with the valve and pressure 
relief device or devices in place.
    S8.3.6  The fire is generated by any fuel that maintains a flame 
temperature between 850 and 900 C for the duration of the test, as 
verified by each of the three thermocouples in S8.3.2 or S8.3.3.
    S8.3.7  The fuel specified in S8.3.6 is such that there is 
sufficient fuel to burn for at least 20 minutes. To ensure that the 
sides of the fuel container are exposed to the flame, the surface area 
of the fire on a horizontal plane is such that it exceeds the fuel 
container projection on a horizontal plane by at least 20 cm (8 inches) 
but not more than 50 cm (20 inches).
    S8.3.8  Time-pressure readings are recorded at 30 second intervals, 
beginning when the fire is lighted and continuing until the container is 
completely tested.
    S8.3.9  The CNG fuel container is exposed to the bonfire for 20 
minutes or until its contents are completely vented.
    S8.3.10  The average wind velocity at the container is any velocity 
up to and including 2.24 meters/second (5 mph).

amounts not greater than 1.1 inches and 1.7 inches, respectively. The 
internal hysteresis in each impact shall not be less than 50 percent and 
not more than 70 percent.
    (d) Test procedure: (1) With the dummy seated without back support 
on a surface as specified in Sec. 572.11(i) and in the orientation 
specified in Sec. 572.11(i), adjust the dummy arms and legs until they 
are extended horizontally forward parallel to the midsagittal plane.
    (2) Place the longitudinal center line of the test probe so that it 
is 17.7<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.1 inches above the seating surface at 
impact.
    (3) Align the test probe specified in Sec. 572.11(a) so that at 
impact its longitudinal centerline coincides within 2 degrees of a 
horizontal line in the dummy's midsagittal plane.
    (4) Adjust the dummy so that the surface area on the thorax 
immediately adjacent to the projected longitudinal center line of the 
test probe is vertical. Limb support, as needed to achieve and maintain 
this orientation, may be provided by placement of a steel rod of any 
diameter not less than one-quarter of an inch and not more than three-
eighths of an inch, with hemispherical ends, vertically under the limb 
at its projected geometric center.
    (5) Impact the thorax with the test probe so that its longitudinal 
centerline falls within 2 degrees of a horizontal line in the dummy's 
midsagittal plane at the moment of impact.
    (6) Guide the probe during impact so that it moves with no 
significant lateral, vertical, or rotational movement.
    (7) Measure the horizontal deflection of the sternum relative to the 
thoracic spine along the line established by the longitudinal centerline 
of the probe at the moment of impact, using a potentiometer mounted 
inside the sternum.
    (8) Measure hysteresis by determining the ratio of the area between 
the loading and unloading portions of the force deflection curve to the 
area under the loading portion of the curve.

cavity rear face at the four \1/4\' cap screw holes and attach the front 
mounting at the femur axial rotation joint. Tighten the

[[Page 643]]

mountings so that the pelvic-lumbar adapter is horizontal and adjust the 
femur friction plungers at each hip socket joint to 240 inch-pounds 
torque.
    (3) Flex the thorax forward 50 deg. and then rearward as necessary 
to return it to its initial position in accordance with Figure 11 
unsupported by external means.
    (4) Apply a forward force perpendicular to the thorax instrument 
cavity rear face in the midsagittal plane 15 inches above the top 
surface of the pelvic-lumbar adapter. Apply the force at any torso 
deflection rate between .5 and 1.5 degrees per second up to 40 deg. of 
flexion but no further, continue to apply for 10 seconds that force 
necessary to maintain 40 deg. of flexion, and record the force with an 
instrument mounted to the thorax as shown in Figure 5. Release all force 
as rapidly as possible and measure the return angle 3 minutes after the 
release.
    (d) When the abdomen is subjected to continuously applied force in 
accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, the abdominal force-
deflection curve shall be within the two curves plotted in Figure 10.
    (e) Test procedure: (1) Place the assembled thorax, lumbar spine and 
pelvic assemblies in a supine position on a flat, rigid, smooth, dry, 
clean horizontal surface, ensuring that all component surfaces are 
clean, dry, and untreated unless otherwise specified.
    (2) Place a rigid cylinder 6 inches in diameter and 18 inches long 
transversely across the abdomen, so that the cylinder is symmetrical 
about the midsagittal plane, with its longitudinal centerline horizontal 
and perpendicular to the midsagittal plane at a point 9.2 inches above 
the bottom line of the buttocks, measured with the dummy positioned in 
accordance with Figure 11.
    (3) Establish the zero deflection point as the point at which a 
force of 10 pounds has been reached.
    (4) Apply a vertical downward force through the cylinder at any rate 
between 0.25 and 0.35 inches per second.
    (5) Guide the cylinder so that it moves without significant lateral 
or rotational movement.

Sec. 572.11  Test conditions and instrumentation.

    (a) The test probe used for thoracic and knee impact tests is a 
cylinder 6

[[Page 644]]

inches in diameter that weighs 51.5 pounds including instrumentation. 
Its impacting end has a flat right face that is rigid and that has an 
edge radius of 0.5 inches.
    (b) Accelerometers are mounted in the head on the horizontal 
transverse bulkhead shown in the drawings subreferenced under assembly 
No. SA 150 M010 in Figure 1, so that their sensitive axes intersect at a 
point in the midsagittal plane 0.5 inches above the horizontal bulkhead 
and 1.9 inches ventral of the vertical mating surface of the skull with 
the skull cover. One accelerometer is aligned with its sensitive axis 
perpendicular to the horizontal bulkhead in the midsagittal plane and 
with its seismic mass center at any distance up to 0.3 inches superior 
to the axial intersection point. Another accelerometer is aligned with 
its sensitive axis parallel to the horizontal bulkhead and perpendicular 
to the midsagittal plane, and with its seismic mass center at any 
distance up to 1.3 inches to the left of the axial intersection point 
(left side of dummy is the same as that of man). A third accelerometer 
is aligned with its sensitive axis parallel to the horizontal bulkhead 
in the midsagittal plane, and with its seismic mass center at any 
distance up to 1.3 inches dorsal to the axial intersection point.
    (c) Accelerometers are mounted in the thorax by means of a bracket 
attached to the rear vertical surface (hereafter ``attachment surface'') 
of the thoracic spine so that their sensitive axes intersect at a point 
in the midsagittal plane 0.8 inches below the upper surface of the plate 
to which the neck mounting bracket is attached and 3.2 inches 
perpendicularly forward of the surface to which the accelerometer 
bracket is attached. One accelerometer has its sensitive axis oriented 
parallel to the attachment surface in the midsagittal plane, with its 
seismic mass center at any distance up to 1.3 inches inferior to the 
intersection of the sensitive axes specified above. Another 
accelerometer has its sensitive axis oriented parallel to the attachment 
surface and perpendicular to the midsagittal plane, with its seismic 
mass center at any distance up to 0.2 inches to the right of the 
intersection of the sensitive axes specified above. A third 
accelerometer has its sensitive axis oriented perpendicular to the 
attachment surface in the midsagittal plane, with its seismic mass 
center at any distance up to 1.3 inches dorsal to the intersection of 
the sensitive axes specified above. Accelerometers are oriented with the 
dummy in the position specified in Sec. 572.11(i).
    (d) A force-sensing device is mounted axially in each femur shaft so 
that the transverse centerline of the sensing element is 4.25 inches 
from the knee's center of rotation.
    (e) The outputs of acceleration and force-sensing devices installed 
in the dummy and in the test apparatus specified by this part are 
recorded in individual data channels that conform to the requirements of 
SAE Recommended Practice J211a, December 1971, with channel classes as 
follows:

    (1) Head acceleration--Class 1000.
    (2) Pendulum acceleration--Class 60.
    (3) Thorax acceleration--Class 180.
    (4) Thorax compression--Class 180.

    (f) The mountings for sensing devices have no resonance frequency 
within a range of 3 times the frequency range of the applicable channel 
class.
    (g) Limb joints are set at 1g, barely restraining the weight of the 
limb when it is extended horizontally. The force required to move a limb 
segment does not exceed 2g throughout the range of limb motion.
    (h) Performance tests are conducted at any temperature from 66 deg.F 
to 78 deg.F and at any relative humidity from 10 percent to 70 percent 
after exposure of the dummy to these conditions for a period of not less 
than 4 hours.
    (i) For the performance tests specified in Secs. 572.8, 572.9, and 
572.10, the dummy is positioned in accordance with Figure 11 as follows:
    (1) The dummy is placed on a flat, rigid, smooth, clean, dry, 
horizontal, steel test surface whose length and width dimensions are not 
less than 16 inches, so that the dummy's midsagittal plane is vertical 
and centered on the test surface and the rearmost points on its lower 
legs at the level of the test surface are at any distance not less than 
5 inches and not

[[Page 645]]

more than 6 inches forward of the forward edge of the test surface.
    (2) The pelvis is adjusted so that the upper surface of the lumbar-
pelvic adapter is horizontal.
    (3) The shoulder yokes are adjusted so that they are at the midpoint 
of their anterior-posterior travel with their upper surfaces horizontal.
    (4) The dummy is adjusted so that the rear surfaces of the shoulders 
and buttocks are tangent to a transverse vertical plane.
    (5) The upper legs are positioned symmetrically about the 
midsagittal plane so that the distance between the knee pivot bolt heads 
is 11.6 inches.
    (6) The lower legs are positioned in planes parallel to the 
midsagittal plane so that the lines between the midpoint of the knee 
pivots and the ankle pivots are vertical.
    (j) The dummy's dimensions, as specified in drawing number SA 150 
M002, are determined as follows:
    (1) With the dummy seated as specified in paragraph (i) of this 
section, the head is adjusted and secured so that its occiput is 1.7 
inches forward of the transverse vertical plane with the vertical mating 
surface of the skull with its cover parallel to the transverse vertical 
plane.
    (2) The thorax is adjusted and secured so that the rear surface of 
the chest accelerometer mounting cavity is inclined 3 deg. forward of 
vertical.
    (3) Chest and waist circumference and chest depth measurements are 
taken with the dummy positioned in accordance with paragraphs (j) (1) 
and (2) of this section.
    (4) The chest skin and abdominal sac are removed and all following 
measurements are made without them.
    (5) Seated height is measured from the seating surface to the 
uppermost point on the head-skin surface.
    (6) Shoulder pivot height is measured from the seating surface to 
the center of the arm elevation pivot.
    (7) H-point locations are measured from the seating surface to the 
center of the holes in the pelvis flesh covering in line with the hip 
motion ball.
    (8) Knee pivot distance from the backline is measured to the center 
of the knee pivot bolt head.
    (9) Knee pivot distance from floor is measured from the center of 
the knee pivot bolt head to the bottom of the heel when the foot is 
horizontal and pointing forward.
    (10) Shoulder width measurement is taken at arm elevation pivot 
center height with the centerlines between the elbow pivots and the 
shoulder pivots vertical.
    (11) Hip width measurement is taken at widest point of pelvic 
section.
    (k) Performance tests of the same component, segment, assembly, or 
fully assembled dummy are separated in time by a period of not less than 
30 minutes unless otherwise noted.
    (l) Surfaces of dummy components are not painted except as specified 
in this part or in drawings subtended by this part.

<R05>
Sec. 572.44  Instrumentation and test conditions.

    (a) The test probe used for lateral thoracic and pelvis impact tests 
is a 6 inch diameter cylinder that weighs 51.5 pounds including 
instrumentation. Its impacting end has a flat right angle face that is 
rigid and has an edge radius of 0.5 inches.
    (b) Three accelerometers are mounted in the thorax for measurement 
of lateral accelerations with each accelerometer's sensitive axis 
aligned to be closely perpendicular to the thorax's midsagittal plane. 
The accelerometers are mounted in the following locations:
    (1) One accelerometer is mounted on the thorax to lumbar adaptor 
(SID-005 revision F, dated May 18, 1994, incorporated by reference; see 
Sec. 572.40) with seismic mass center located 0.5 inches toward the 
impact side, 0.1 inches upward and 1.86 inches rearward from the 
reference point shown in Figure 30 in

[[Page 682]]

appendix A to subpart F of part 572. Maximum permissible variation of 
the seismic location must not exceed 0.2 inches spherical radius.
    (2) Two accelerometers are mounted, one on the top and the other at 
the bottom part of the Rib Bar (SID-024) on the struck side. Their 
seismic mass centers are at any distance up to .4 inches from a point on 
the Rib Bar surface located on its longitudinal center line .75 inches 
from the top for the top accelerometer and .75 inches from the bottom, 
for the bottom accelerometer.
    (c) One accelerometer is mounted in the pelvis for measurement of 
the lateral acceleration with its sensitive axis perpendicular to the 
pelvic midsagittal plane. The accelerometer is mounted on the rear wall 
of the instrumentation cavity of the pelvis (SID-087 revision H, dated 
May 18, 1994, incorporated by reference; see Sec. 572.40). The 
accelerometer's seismic mass with respect to the mounting bolt center 
line is 0.9 inches up, 0.7 inches to the left for left side impact and 
0.03 inches to the left for right side impact, and 0.5 inches rearward 
from the rear wall mounting surface as shown in Figure 31 in appendix A 
to subpart F of part 572. Maximum permissible variation of the seismic 
location must not exceed 0.2 inches spherical radius.
    (d) Instrumentation and sensors used must conform to the SAE J-211 
(1980) recommended practice requirements (incorporated by reference; see 
Sec. 572.40). The outputs of the accelerometers installed in the dummy 
are then processed with the software for the Finite Impulse Response 
(FIR) filter (FIR 100 software). The FORTRAN program for this FIR 100 
software (FIR100 Filter Program, Version 1.0, July 16, 1990) is 
incorporated by reference in this part (see Sec. 572.40). The data are 
processed in the following manner:
    (1) Analog data recorded in accordance with SAE J-211 (1980) 
recommended practice channel class 1000 specification.
    (2) Filter the data with a 300 Hz, SAE Class 180 filter;
    (3) Subsample the data to a 1600 Hz sampling rate;
    (4) Remove the bias from the subsampled data, and
    (5) Filter the data with the FIR100 Filter Program (Version 1.0, 
July 16, 1990), which has the following characteristics--
    (i) Passband frequency, 100 Hz.
    (ii) Stopband frequency, 189 Hz.
    (iii) Stopband gain, -50 db.
    (iv) Passband ripple, 0.0225 db.
    (e) The mountings for the spine, rib and pelvis accelerometers shall 
have no resonance frequency within a range of 3 times the frequency 
range of the applicable channel class.
    (f) Limb joints of the test dummy are set at the force between 1-2 
g's, which just supports the limbs' weight when the limbs are extended 
horizontally forward. The force required to move a limb segment does not 
exceed 2 g's throughout the range of limb motion.

[[Page 683]]

    (g) Performance tests are conducted at any temperature from 66 
deg.F to 78  deg.F and at any relative humidity from 10 percent to 70 
percent after exposure of the dummy to these conditions for a period of 
not less than 4 hours.
    (h) For the performance of tests specified in Secs. 572.42 and 
572.43, the dummy is positioned as follows:
    (1) The dummy is placed on a flat, rigid, clean, dry, horizontal 
smooth aluminum surface whose length and width dimensions are not less 
than 16 inches, so that the dummy's midsagittal plane is vertical and 
centered on the test surface. The dummy's torso is positioned to meet 
the requirements of Sec. 572.42 and Sec. 572.43. The seating surface is 
without the back support and the test dummy is positioned so that the 
dummy's midsagittal plane is vertical and centered on the seat surface.
    (2) The legs are positioned so that their centerlines are in planes 
parallel to the midsagittal plane.
    (3) Performance pre-tests of the assembled dummy are separated in 
time by a period of not less than 20 minutes unless otherwise specified.
    (4) Surfaces of the dummy components are not painted except as 
specified in this part or in drawings subtended by this part.

Sec. 572.81  General description.

    (a) The dummy consists of: (1) The assembly specified in drawing LP 
1049/A, March 1979, which is described in its entirety by means of 
approximately 54 separate drawings and specifications, 1049/1 through 
1049/54; and (2) a parts list LP 1049/0 (5 sheets); and (3) a report 
entitled, ``The TNO P3/4 Child Dummy Users Manual,'' January 1979, 
published by Instituut voor Wegtransportmiddelen TNO.
    (b) Adjacent dummy segments are joined in a manner such that 
throughout the range of motion and also under simulated crash-impact 
conditions there is no contact between metallic elements except for 
contacts that exist under static conditions.
    (c) The structural properties of the dummy are such that the dummy 
conforms to this part in every respect both before and after being used 
in dynamic tests such as that specified in Standard No. 213 of this 
chapter (Sec. 571.213).


<R05>
Sec. 572.82  Head.

    The head consists of the assembly shown in drawing LP 1049/A and 
conforms to each of the applicable drawings listed under LP 1049/0 
through 54.


<R05>
Sec. 572.83  Head-neck.

    The head-neck assembly shown in drawing 1049/A consists of parts 
specified as items 1 through 16 and in item 56.


<R05>
Sec. 572.84  Thorax.

    The thorax consists of the part of the torso shown in assembly 
drawing LP 1049/A and conforms to each of the applicable drawings listed 
under LP 1049/0 through 54.


<R05>
Sec. 572.85  Lumbar spine flexure.

    (a) When subjected to continuously applied force in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section, the lumbar spine assembly shall flex by 
an amount that permits the thoracic spine to rotate from its initial 
position in accordance with Figure No. 18 of Sec. 572.21 (49 CFR part 
572) by 40 degrees at a force level of not less than 18 pounds and not 
more than 22 pounds, and straighten upon removal of the force to within 
5 degrees of its initial position.
    (b) Test procedure. (1) The lumbar spine flexure test is conducted 
on a dummy assembly as shown in drawing LP 1049/A, but with the arms 
(which consist of parts identified as items 17 through 30) and all head-
neck parts (identified as items 1 through 13 and 59 through 63), 
removed.
    (2) With the torso assembled in an upright position, adjust the 
lumbar cable by tightening the adjustment nut for the lumbar vertebrae 
until the spring is compressed to \2/3\ of its unloaded length.
    (3) Position the dummy in an upright seated position on a seat as 
indicated in Figure No. 18 of Sec. 572.21 (lower legs do not need to be 
removed, but must be clamped firmly to the seating surface), ensuring 
that all dummy component surfaces are clean, dry and untreated unless 
otherwise specified.
    (4) Firmly affix the dummy to the seating surface through the pelvis 
at the hip joints by suitable clamps that also prevent any relative 
motion with respect to the upper legs during the test in 
Sec. 572.65(c)(3) of this part. Install a pull attachment at the neck to 
torso

[[Page 698]]

juncture as shown in Figure 18 of Sec. 572.21.
    (5) Flex the thorax forward 50 degrees and then rearward as 
necessary to return it to its initial position.
    (6) Apply a forward pull force in the midsagittal plane at the top 
of the neck adapter so that at 40 degrees of the lumbar spine flexion 
the applied force is perpendicular to the thoracic spine box. Apply the 
force at any torso deflection rate between 0.5 and 1.5 degrees per 
second up to 40 degrees of flexion but no further; maintain 40 degrees 
of flexion for 10 seconds, and record the highest applied force during 
that time. Release all force as rapidly as possible and measure the 
return angle three minutes after release.


<R05>
Sec. 572.86  Test conditions and dummy adjustment.

    (a) With the complete torso on its back lying on a horizontal 
surface and the neck assembly mounted and shoulders on the edge of the 
surface, adjust the neck such that the head bolt is lowered 0.40 
<plus-minus> 0.05 inches (10 <plus-minus> 1 mm) after a vertically 
applied load of 11.25 pounds (50 N) applied to the head bolt is 
released.
    (b) With the complete torso on its back with the adjusted neck 
assembly as specified in Sec. 572.66(a), and lying on a horizontal 
surface with the shoulders on the edge of the surface, mount the head 
and tighten the head bolt and nut firmly, with the head in horizontal 
position. Adjust the head joint at the force between 1-2g, which just 
supports the head's weight.
    (c) Using the procedures described below, limb joints are set at the 
force between 1-2g, which just supports the limbs' weight when the limbs 
are extended horizontally forward:
    (1) With the complete torso lying with its front down on a 
horizontal surface, with the hip joint just over the edge of the 
surface, mount the upper leg and tighten hip joint nut firmly. Adjust 
the hip joint by releasing the hip joint nut until the upper leg just 
starts moving.
    (2) With the complete torso and upper leg lying with its front up on 
a horizontal surface, with the knee joint just over the edge of the 
surface, mount the lower leg and tighten knee joint firmly. Adjust the 
knee joint by releasing the knee joint nut until the lower leg just 
starts moving.
    (3) With the torso in an upright position, mount the upper arm and 
tighten firmly the adjustment bolts for the shoulder joint with the 
upper arm placed in a horizontal position. Adjust the shoulder joint by 
releasing the shoulder joint nut until the upper arm just starts moving.
    (4) With the complete torso in an upright position and upper arm in 
a vertical position, mount the forearm in a horizontal position and 
tighten the elbow hinge bolt and nut firmly. Adjust the elbow joint nut 
until the forearm just starts moving.
    (d) With the torso assembled in an upright position, the adjustment 
nut for the lumbar vertebrae is tightened until the spring is compressed 
to \2/3\ of its unloaded length.
    (e) Performance tests are conducted at any temperature from 66 to 78 
degrees F and at any relative humidity from 10 percent to 70 percent 
after exposure of the dummy to these conditions for a period of not less 
than four hours.
    (f) Performance tests of the same component, segment, assembly or 
fully assembled dummy are separated in time by a period of not less than 
20 minutes unless otherwise specified.
    (g) Surfaces of the dummy components are not painted except as 
specified in the part or in drawings incorporated by this part.

Sec. 573.5  Defect and noncompliance information report.

    (a) Each manufacturer shall furnish a report to the NHTSA for each 
defect in his vehicles or in his items of original or replacement 
equipment that he or the Administrator determines to be related to motor 
vehicle safety, and for each noncompliance with a motor vehicle safety 
standard in such vehicles or items of equipment which either he or the 
Administrator determines to exist.
    (b) Each report shall be submitted not more than 5 working days 
after a defect in a vehicle or item of equipment has been determined to 
be safety related, or a noncompliance with a motor vehicle safety 
standard has been determined to exist. Information required by paragraph 
(c) of this section that is not available within that period shall be 
submitted as it becomes available. Each manufacturer submitting new 
information relative to a previously submitted report shall refer to the 
notification campaign number when a number has been assigned by the 
NHTSA.

Seventh St., SW., Washington, DC 20950.
    (ii) The estimated date on which it will begin sending notifications 
to owners that there is a safety-related defect or noncompliance and 
that a remedy without charge will be available, and the estimated date 
on which it will have completed such notification. If a manufacturer 
subsequently becomes aware that either the beginning or the completion 
date reported to the agency will be delayed by more than two weeks, it 
shall promptly advise the agency of the delay and the reasons therefor, 
and furnish a revised estimate.
    (iii) If a manufacturer intends to file a petition for an exemption 
from the recall requirements of the Act on the basis that a defect or 
noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety, 
it shall notify NHTSA of that intention in its report to NHTSA of the 
defect or noncompliance under this section. If such a petition is filed 
and subsequently denied, the manufacturer shall provide the information 
required by paragraph (c)(8)(ii) of this section within five Federal 
government business days from the date the petition denial is published 
in the Federal Register.

    Editorial Note: An interpretation of manufacturer's designee issued 
by NHTSA and published at 36 FR 9780, May 28, 1971, provides as follows:

    ``A request for an interpretation has been received from the Rubber 
Manufacturers Association asking that it be made clear that, under the 
Tire Identification and Recordkeeping Regulation (part 574), 
particularly Secs. 574.7 and 574.8, only the tire manufacturer, brand 
name owner, or retreader may designate a third party to provide the 
necessary recording forms or to maintain the records required by the 
regulation.
    ``Another person has requested an interpretation concerning the 
questions whether: (1) A tire manufacturer, brand name owner or 
retreader may designate one or more persons to be its designee for the 
purpose of maintaining the information, (2) an independent distributor 
or dealer may select a designee for the retention of the manufacturer's 
records, provided the manufacturer approves the designation, and (3) the 
independent distributor or dealer may seek administrative relief in the 
event he believes the information retained by the manufacturer is being 
used to his detriment.
    ``Under section 113(f) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle 
Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1402(f) and part 574, it is the tire manufacturer 
who has the ultimate responsibility for maintaining the records of first 
purchasers. Therefore, it is the tire manufacturer or his designee who 
must maintain these records. The term designee, as used in the 
regulation, was not intended to preclude multiple designees; if the tire 
manufacturer desires, he may designate more than one person to maintain 
the required information. Furthermore, neither the Act nor the 
regulation prohibits the distributor or dealer from being the 
manufacturer's designee nor do they prohibit a distributor or dealer 
from selecting someone to be the manufacturer's designee provided the 
manufacturer approves of the selection.
    ``With respect to the possibility of manufacturers using the 
maintained information to the detriment of a distributor or dealer, the 
NHTSA will of course investigate claims by distributors or dealers of 
alleged misconduct and, if the maintained information is being misused, 
take appropriate action.
    ``Issued under the authority of sections 103, 113, and 119 of the

by which independent tire dealers and distributors shall record, on 
registration forms, their names and addresses and the identification 
number of the tires sold to tire purchasers

[[Page 708]]

and provide the forms to the purchasers, so that the purchasers may 
report their names to the new tire manufacturers and new tire brand name 
owners, and by which other tire dealers and distributors shall record 
and report the names of tire purchasers to the new tire manufacturers 
and new tire brand name owners.

Sec. 574.5  Tire identification requirements.

    Each tire manufacturer shall conspicuously label on one sidewall of 
each tire it manufactures, except tires manufactured exclusively for 
mileage-contract purchasers, or non-pneumatic tires or non-pneumatic 
tire assemblies, by permanently molding into or onto the sidewall, in 
the manner and location specified in Figure 1, a tire identification 
number containing the information set forth in paragraphs (a) through 
(d) of this section. Each tire retreader, except tire retreaders who 
retread tires solely for their own use, shall conspicuously label one 
sidewall of each tire it retreads by permanently molding or branding 
into or onto the sidewall, in the manner and location specified in 
Figure 2, a tire identification number containing the information set 
forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. In addition, the 
DOT symbol required by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards shall be 
located as shown in Figures 1 and 2. The DOT symbol shall not appear on 
tires to

[[Page 709]]

which no Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard is applicable, except 
that the DOT symbol on tires for use on motor vehicles other than 
passenger cars may, prior to retreading, be removed from the sidewall or 
allowed to remain on the sidewall, at the retreader's option. The 
symbols to be used in the tire identification number for tire 
manufacturers and retreaders are: ``A, B, C, D, E, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, 
P, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0''. Tires 
manufactured or retreaded exclusively for mileage-contract purchasers 
are not required to contain a tire identification number if the tire 
contains the phrase ``for mileage contract use only'' permanently molded 
into or onto the tire sidewall in lettering at least one-quarter inch 
high. Each manufacturer of a non-pneumatic tire or a non-pneumatic tire 
assembly shall permanently mold, stamp or otherwise permanently mark 
into or onto one side of the non-pneumatic tire or non-pneumatic tire 
assembly a tire identification number containing the information set 
forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. In addition, the 
DOT symbol required by the Federal motor vehicle safety standards shall 
be positioned relative to the tire identification number as shown in 
Figure 1, and the symbols to be used for the other information are those 
listed above. The labeling for a non-pneumatic tire or a non-pneumatic 
tire assembly shall be in the manner specified in Figure 1 and 
positioned on the non-pneumatic tire or non-pneumatic tire assembly such 
that it is not placed on the tread or the outermost edge of the tire and 
is not obstructed by any portion of the non-pneumatic rim or wheel 
center member designated for use with that non-pneumatic tire in S4.4 of 
Standard No. 129 (49 CFR 571.129).
    (a) First grouping. The first group, of two or three symbols, 
depending on whether the tire is new or retreaded, shall represent the 
manufacturer's assigned identification mark (see Sec. 574.6).
    (b) Second grouping. For new tires, the second group, of no more 
than two symbols, shall be used to identify the tire size. For a new 
non-pneumatic tire or a non-pneumatic tire assembly, the second group, 
of not more than two symbols, shall be used to identify the non-
pneumatic tire identification code. For retreaded tires, the second 
group, of no more than two symbols, shall identify the retread matrix in 
which the tire was processed or a tire size code if a matrix was not 
used to process the retreaded tire. Each new-tire manufacturer and 
retreader shall maintain a record of each symbol used, with the 
corresponding matrix or tire size and shall provide such record to the 
NHTSA upon written request.
    (c) Third grouping. The third group, consisting of no more than four 
symbols, may be used at the option of the manufacturer or retreader as a 
descriptive code for the purpose of identifying significant 
characteristics of the tire. However, if the tire is manufactured for a 
brand name owner, one of the functions of the third grouping shall be to 
identify the brand name owner. Each manufacturer or retreader who uses 
the third grouping shall maintain a detailed record of any descriptive 
or brand name owner code used, which shall be provided to the Bureau 
upon written request.
    (d) Fourth grouping. The fourth group, of three symbols, shall 
identify the week and year of manufacture. The first two symbols shall 
identify the week of the year using ``01'' for the first full calendar 
week in each year. The final week of each year may include not more than 
6 days of the following year. The third symbol shall identify the year. 
(Example: 311 means the 31st week of 1971, or August 1 through 7, 1971; 
012 means the first week of 1972, or January 2 through 8, 1972.) The 
symbols signifying the date of manufacture shall immediately follow the 
optional descriptive code (paragraph (c) of this section). If no 
optional descriptive code is used the symbols signifying the date of 
manufacture shall be placed in the area shown in Figures 1 and 2 for the 
optional descriptive code.

<R05>
Sec. 575.5  Separability.

    If any section established in this part or its application to any 
person or circumstances is held invalid, the remainder of the part and 
the application of that section to other persons or circumstances is not 
affected thereby.


<R05>
Sec. 575.6  Requirements.

    (a)(1) At the time a motor vehicle is delivered to the first 
purchaser for purposes other than resale, the manufacturer of that 
vehicle shall provide to the purchaser, in writing and in the English 
language, the information specified in Secs. 575.103 and 575.104 of this 
part that is applicable to that vehicle and its tires. The document 
provided with a vehicle may contain more than one table, but the 
document must either (1) clearly and unconditionally indicate which of 
the tables apply to the vehicle with which it is provided, or (2) 
contain a statement on its cover referring the reader to the vehicle 
certification label for specific information concerning which of the 
tables apply to that vehicle. If the manufacturer chooses option (a)(2) 
of this section, the vehicle certification label shall include such 
specific information.

    Example 1. Manufacturer X furnishes a document containing several 
tables, which apply to various groups of vehicles that it produces. The 
document contains the following notation on its front page: ``The 
information that applies to this vehicle is contained in Table 5.'' The 
notation satisfies the requirement.
    Example 2. Manufacturer Y furnishes a document containing several 
tables as in Example 1, with the following notation on its front page:
    Information applies as follows:

Model P. 6-cylinder engine--Table 1.
Model P. 8-cylinder engine--Table 2.
Model Q--Table 3.

This notation does not satisfy the requirement, since it is conditioned 
on the model or the equipment of the vehicle with which the document is 
furnished, and therefore additional information is required to select 
the proper table.

    (2)(i) At the time a motor vehicle manufactured on or after 
September 1, 1990 is delivered to the first purchaser for purposes other 
than resale, the manufacturer shall provide to the purchaser, in writing 
in the English language and not less than 10 point type, the following 
statement in the owner's manual, or, if there is no owner's manual, on a 
one-page document:

    If you believe that your vehicle has a defect which could cause a 
crash or could cause injury or death, you should immediately inform the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in addition to 
notifying [INSERT NAME OF MANUFACTURER].
    If NHTSA receives similar complaints, it may open an investigation, 
and if it finds that a safety defect exists in a group of vehicles, it 
may order a recall and remedy campaign. However, NHTSA cannot become 
involved in individual problems between you, your dealer, or [INSERT 
NAME OF MANUFACTURER].
    To contact NHTSA, you may either call the Auto Safety Hotline toll-
free at 1-800-424-9393 (or 366-0123 in Washington, DC area) or write to: 
NHTSA, U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590. You can 
also obtain other information about motor vehicle safety from the 
Hotline.

    (ii) The manufacturer shall specify in the table of contents of the 
owner's manual the location of the statement in 575.6(a)(2)(i). The 
heading in the table of contents shall state ``Reporting Safety 
Defects.''
    (b) At the time a motor vehicle tire is delivered to the first 
purchaser for a purpose other than resale, the manufacturer of that 
tire, or in the case of a tire marketed under a brand name, the brand 
name owner, shall provide to that purchaser the information specified in 
subpart B of this part that is applicable to that tire.
    (c) Each manufacturer of motor vehicles, each brand name owner of 
tires, and each manufacturer of tires for which there is no brand name 
owner

[[Page 720]]

shall provide for examination by prospective purchasers, at each 
location where its vehicles or tires are offered for sale by a person 
with whom the manufacturer or brand name owner has a contractual, 
proprietary, or other legal relationship, or by a person who has such a 
relationship with a distributor of the manufacturer or brand name owner 
concerning the vehicle or tire in question, the information specified in 
subpart B of this part that is applicable to each of the vehicles or 
tires offered for sale at that location. The information shall be 
provided without charge and in sufficient quantity to be available for 
retention by prospective purchasers or sent by mail to a prospective 
purchaser upon his request. With respect to newly introduced vehicles or 
tires, the information shall be provided for examination by prospective 
purchasers not later than the day on which the manufacturer or brand 
name owner first authorizes those vehicles or tires to be put on general 
public display and sold to consumers.
    (d)(1)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this 
section, in the case of all sections of subpart B, other than 
Sec. 575.104, as they apply to information submitted prior to new model 
introduction, each manufacturer of motor vehicles shall submit to the 
Administrator 10 copies of the information specified in subpart B of 
this part that is applicable to the vehicles offered for sale, at least 
90 days before it is first provided for examination by prospective 
purchasers pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
    (ii) Where an unforeseen preintroduction modification in vehicle 
design or equipment results in a change in vehicle performance for a 
characteristic included in subpart B of this part, a manufacturer of 
motor vehicles may revise information previously furnished under 
paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section by submission to the Administrator 
of 10 copies of revised information reflecting the performance changes, 
at least 30 days before information on the subject vehicles is first 
provided to prospective purchasers pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (2) In the case of Sec. 575.104, and all other sections of subpart B 
as they apply to post-introduction changes in information submitted for 
the current model year, each manufacturer of motor vehicles, each brand 
name owner of tires, and each manufacturer of tires for which there is 
no brand name owner shall submit to the Administrator 10 copies of the 
information specified in subpart B of this part that is applicable to 
the vehicles or tires offered for sale, at least 30 days before it is 
first provided for examination by prospective purchasers pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section.

Sec. 575.101--575.102  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 575.103  Truck-camper loading.

    (a) Scope. This section requires manufacturers of slide-in campers 
to affix to each camper a label that contains information relating to 
identification and proper loading of the camper and to provide more 
detailed loading information in the owner's manual. This section also 
requires manufacturers of trucks that would accommodate slide-in campers 
to specify the cargo weight ratings and the longitudinal limits within 
which the center of gravity for the cargo weight rating should be 
located.
    (b) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide information 
that can be used to reduce overloading and improper load placement in 
truck-camper combinations and unsafe truck- camper matching in order to 
prevent accidents resulting from the adverse effects of

[[Page 721]]

these conditions on vehicle steering and braking.
    (c) Application. This section applies to slide-in campers and to 
trucks that are capable of accommodating slide- in campers.
    (d) Definitions.
    Camper means a structure designed to be mounted in the cargo area of 
a truck, or attached to an incomplete vehicle with motive power, for the 
purpose of providing shelter for persons.
    Cargo Weight Rating means the value specified by the manufacturer as 
the cargo-carrying capacity, in pounds or kilograms, of a vehicle, 
exclusive of the weight of occupants in designated seating positions, 
computed as 68 kilograms or 150 pounds times the number of designated 
seating positions.
    Slide-in Camper means a camper having a roof, floor, and sides, 
designed to be mounted on and removable from the cargo area of a truck 
by the user.
    (e) Requirements--(1) Slide-in Camper--(i) Labels. Each slide-in 
camper shall have permanently affixed to it, in such a manner that it 
cannot be removed without defacing or destroying it, and in a plainly 
visible location on an exterior rear surface other than the roof, steps, 
or bumper extension, a label containing the following information in the 
English language lettered in block capitals and numerals not less than 
2.4 millimeters (three thirty-seconds of an inch) high, of a color 
contrasting with the background, in the order shown below and in the 
form illustrated in Figure 1.
    (A) Name of camper manufacturer. The full corporate or individual 
name of the actual assembler of the camper shall be spelled out, except 
that such abbreviations as ``Co.'' or ``Inc.'' and their foreign 
equivalents, and the first and middle initials of individuals may be 
used. The name of the manufacturer shall be preceded by the words 
``Manufactured by'' or ``Mfd by.''
    (B) Month and year of manufacture. It may be spelled out, such as 
``June 1995'' or expressed in numerals, such as ``695.''
    (C) The following statement completed as appropriate:
    ``Camper weight is ____________ kg. (____________ lbs.) maximum when 
it contains standard equipment, ____________ liters (____________ gal.) 
of water, ____________ kg. (____________ lbs.) of bottled gas, and 
____________ cubic meters (____________ cubic ft.) refrigerator (or 
icebox with ____________ kg. (____________ lbs.) of ice, as applicable). 
Consult owner's manual (or data sheet, as applicable) for weights of 
additional or optional equipment.''
    (D) ``Liters (or gal.) of water'' refers to the volume of water 
necessary to fill the camper's fresh water tanks to capacity. ``Kg. (or 
lbs.) of bottled gas'' refers to the amount of gas necessary to fill the 
camper's bottled gas tanks to capacity. The statement regarding a 
``refrigerator'' or ``icebox'' refers to the capacity of the 
refrigerator with which the vehicle is equipped or the weight of the ice 
with which the icebox may be filled. Any of these items may be omitted 
from the statement if the corresponding accessories are not included 
with the camper, provided that the omission is noted in the camper 
owner's manual as required in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Owner's manual. Each slide-in camper manufacturer shall provide 
with each camper a manual or other document containing the information 
specified in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) (A) through (F) of this section.
    (A) The statement and information provided on the label as specified 
in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section. Instead of the information 
required by paragraphs (e)(1)(i)(B) of this section, a manufacturer may 
use the statements ``See camper identification label located (as 
applicable) for month and year of manufacture.'' If water, bottled gas, 
or refrigerator (icebox) has been omitted from this statement, the 
manufacturer's information shall note such omission and advise that the 
weight of any such item when added to the camper should be added to the 
maximum camper weight figure used in selecting an appropriate truck.
    (B) A list of other additional or optional equipment that the camper 
is designed to carry, and the maximum weight of each if its weight is 
more than 9 kg. (20 lbs) when installed.
    (C) The statement: ``To estimate the total cargo load that will be 
placed on a truck, add the weight of all passengers in the camper, the 
weight of

[[Page 722]]

supplies, tools, and all other cargo, the weight of installed additional 
or optional camper equipment, and the manufacturer's camper weight 
figure. Select a truck that has a cargo weight rating that is equal to 
or greater than the total cargo load of the camper and whose 
manufacturer recommends a cargo center of gravity zone that will contain 
the camper's center of gravity when it is installed.''
    (D) The statements: ``When loading this camper, store heavy gear 
first, keeping it on or close to the camper floor. Place heavy things 
far enough forward to keep the loaded camper's center of gravity within 
the zone recommended by the truck manufacturer. Store only light objects 
on high shelves. Distribute weight to obtain even side-to-side balance 
of the loaded vehicle. Secure loose items to prevent weight shifts that 
could affect the balance of your vehicle. When the truck-camper is 
loaded, drive to a scale and weigh on the front and on the rear wheels 
separately to determine axle loads. The load on an axle should not 
exceed its gross axle weight rating (GAWR). The total of the axle loads 
should not exceed the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). These weight 
ratings are given on the vehicle certification label that is located on 
the left side of the vehicle, normally on the dash panel, hinge pillar, 
door latch post, or door edge next to the driver on trucks manufactured 
on or after January 1, 1972. If weight ratings are exceeded, move or 
remove items to bring all weights below the ratings.''
    (E) A picture showing the location of the longitudinal center of 
gravity of the camper within an accuracy of 5 centimeters (2 inches) 
under the loaded condition specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(D) of this 
section in the manner illustrated in Figure 2.
    (F) A picture showing the proper match of a truck and slide-in 
camper in the form illustrated in Figure 3.
    (2) Trucks. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this 
section, each manufacturer of a truck that is capable of accommodating a 
slide-in camper shall provide to the purchaser in the owner's manual or 
other document delivered with the truck, in writing and in the English 
language, the information specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) (A) through 
(E) of this section.
    (A) A picture showing the manufacturer's recommended longitudinal 
center of gravity zone for the cargo weight rating in the form 
illustrated in Figure 4. The boundaries of the zone shall be such that 
when a slide-in camper equal in weight to the truck's cargo weight 
rating is installed, no GAWR of the truck is exceeded.
    (B) The truck's cargo weight rating.
    (C) The statements: ``When the truck is used to carry a slide-in 
camper, the total cargo load of the truck consists of the manufacturer's 
camper weight figure, the weight of installed additional camper 
equipment not included in the manufacturer's camper weight figure, the 
weight of camper cargo, and the weight of passengers in the camper. The 
total cargo load should not exceed the truck's cargo weight rating and 
the camper's center of gravity should fall within the truck's 
recommended center of gravity zone when installed.''
    (D) A picture showing the proper match of a truck and slide-in 
camper in the form illustrated in Figure 3.
    (E) The statements: ``Secure loose items to prevent weight shifts 
that could affect the balance of your vehicle. When the truck camper is 
loaded, drive to a scale and weigh on the front and on the rear wheels 
separately to determine axle loads. Individual axle loads should not 
exceed either of the gross axle weight ratings (GAWR). The total of the 
axle loads should not exceed the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). 
These ratings are given on the vehicle certification label that is 
located on the left side of the vehicle, normally the dash, hinge 
pillar, door latch post, or door edge next to the driver. If weight 
ratings are exceeded, move or remove items to bring all weights below 
the ratings.''
    (ii) If a truck would accommodate a slide-in camper but the 
manufacturer of the truck recommends that the truck not be used for that 
purpose, the information specified in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(E) of this 
section shall not be provided but instead the manufacturer shall provide 
a statement that the truck should not be used to carry a slide-in 
camper.

Sec. 575.104  Uniform tire quality grading standards.

    (a) Scope. This section requires motor vehicle and tire 
manufacturers and tire brand name owners to provide information 
indicating the relative performance of passenger car tires in the areas 
of treadwear, traction, and temperature resistance.
    (b) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to aid the consumer in 
making an informed choice in the purchase of passenger car tires.
    (c) Application. (1) This section applies to new pneumatic tires for 
use on passenger cars. However, this section does not apply to deep 
tread, winter-type snow tires, space-saver or temporary use spare tires, 
tires with nominal rim diameters of 10 to 12 inches, or to limited 
production tires as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) ``Limited production tire'' means a tire meeting all of the 
following criteria, as applicable:
    (i) The annual domestic production or importation into the United 
States by the tire's manufacturer of tires of the same design and size 
as the tire does not exceed 15,000 tires;
    (ii) In the case of a tire marketed under a brand name, the annual 
domestic purchase or importation into the United States by a brand name 
owner of tires of the same design and size as the tire does not exceed 
15,000 tires;
    (iii) The tire's size was not listed as a vehicle manufacturer's 
recommended tire size designation for a new motor vehicle produced in or 
imported into the United States in quantities greater than 10,000 during 
the calendar year preceeding the year of the tire's manufacture; and
    (iv) The total annual domestic production or importation into the 
United States by the tire's manufacturer, and in the case of a tire 
marketed under a brand name, the total annual domestic purchase or 
purchase for importation into the United States by the tire's brand name 
owner, of tires meeting the criteria of paragraphs (c)(2) (i), (ii), and 
(iii) of this section, does not exceed 35,000 tires.

Tire design is the combination of general structural characteristics, 
materials, and tread pattern, but does include cosmetic, identifying or 
other minor variations among tires.
    (d) Requirements--(1) Information. (i) Each manufacturer of tires, 
or in the case of tires marketed under a brand name, each brand name 
owner, shall provide grading information for each tire of which he is 
the manufacturer or brand name owner in the manner set forth in 
paragraphs (d)(1)(i) (A) and (B) of this section. The grades for each 
tire shall be only those specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. 
Each tire shall be able to achieve the level of performance represented 
by each grade with which it is labeled. An individual tire need not, 
however, meet further requirements after having been subjected to the 
test for any one grade.
    (A) Except for a tire of a new tire line, manufactured within the 
first six months of production of the tire line, each tire shall be 
graded with the words, letters, symbols, and figures specified in 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section, permanently molded into or onto the 
tire sidewall between the tire's maximum section width and shoulder in 
accordance with one of the methods described in Figure 1. For purposes 
of this paragraph, new tire line shall mean a group of tires differing 
substantially in construction, materials, or design from those 
previously sold by the manufacturer or brand name owner of the tires. As 
used in this paragraph, the term ``construction'' refers to the internal 
structure of the tire (e.g., cord angles, number and placement of 
breakers), ``materials'' refers to the substances used in manufacture of 
the tire (e.g., belt fiber, rubber compound), and ``design'' refers to 
properties or conditions imposed by the tire mold (e.g., aspect ratio, 
tread pattern).
    (B) Each tire manufactured on and after the effective date of these 
amendments, other than a tire sold as original equipment on a new 
vehicle, shall have affixed to its tread surface so as not to be easily 
removable a label or labels containing its grades and other information 
in the form illustrated in Figure 2, Parts I and II. The treadwear grade 
attributed to the tire shall be either imprinted or indelibly stamped on 
the label containing the material in Part I of Figure 2, directly to the 
right of or below the word ``TREADWEAR.''

[[Page 728]]

The traction grade attributed to the tire shall be indelibly circled in 
an array of the potential grade letters AA, A, B, or C, directly to the 
right of or below the word ``TRACTION'' in Part I of Figure 2. The 
temperature resistance grade attributed to the tire shall be indelibly 
circled in an array of the potential grade letters A, B, or C, directly 
to the right of or below the word ``TEMPERATURE'' in Part I of Figure 2. 
The words ``TREADWEAR,'' ``TRACTION,'' AND ``TEMPERATURE,'' in that 
order, may be laid out vertically or horizontally. The text of Part II 
of Figure 2 may be printed in capital letters. The text of Part I and 
the text of Part II of Figure 2 need not appear on the same label, but 
the edges of the two texts must be positioned on the tire tread so as to 
be separated by a distance of no more than one inch. If the text of Part 
I and the text of Part II of Figure 2 are placed on separate labels, the 
notation ``See EXPLANATION OF DOT QUALITY GRADES'' shall be added to the 
bottom of the Part I text, and the words ``EXPLANATION OF DOT QUALITY 
GRADES'' shall appear at the top of the Part II text. The text of Figure 
2 shall be oriented on the tire tread surface with lines of type running 
perpendicular to the tread circumference. If a label bearing a tire size 
designation is attached to the tire tread surface and the tire size 
designation is oriented with lines type running perpendicular to the 
tread circumference, the text of Figure 2 shall read in the same 
direction as the tire size designation.
    (ii) In the case of information required in accordance with 
Sec. 575.6(c) to be furnished to prospective purchasers of motor 
vehicles and tires, each vehicle manufacturer and each tire manufacturer 
or brand name owner shall as part of that information list all possible 
grades for traction and temperature resistance, and restate verbatim the 
explanations for each performance area specified in Figure 2. The 
information need not be in the same format as in Figure 2. In the case 
of a tire manufacturer or brand name owner, the information must 
indicate clearly and unambiguously the grade in each performance area 
for each tire of that manufacturer or brand name owner offered for sale 
at the particular location.
    (iii) In the case of information required in accordance with 
Sec. 575.6(a) to be furnished to the first purchaser of a new motor 
vehicle, each manufacturer of motor vehicles shall, as part of the 
required information, list all possible grades for traction and 
temperature resistance and restate verbatim the explanation for each 
performance area specified in Figure 2. The information need not be in 
the format of Figure 2, but it must contain a statement referring the 
reader to the tire sidewall for the specific tire grades for the tires 
with which the vehicle is equipped.
    (2) Performance--(i) Treadwear. Each tire shall be graded for 
treadwear performance with the word ``TREADWEAR'' followed by a number 
of two or three digits representing the tire's grade for treadwear, 
expressed as a percentage of the NHTSA nominal treadwear value, when 
tested in accordance with the conditions and procedures specified in 
paragraph (e) of this section. Treadwear grades shall be expressed in 
multiples of 20 (for example, 80, 120, 160).
    (ii) Traction. Each tire shall be graded for traction performance 
with the word ``TRACTION,'' followed by the symbols AA, A, B, or C, when 
the tire is tested in accordance with the conditions and procedures 
specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (A) The tire shall be graded C when the adjusted traction 
coefficient is either:
    (1) 0.38 or less when tested in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of 
this section on the asphalt surface specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of 
this section, or
    (2) 0.26 or less when tested in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of 
this section on the concrete surface specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of 
this section.
    (B) The tire may be graded B only when its adjusted traction 
coefficient is both:
    (1) More than 0.38 when tested in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) 
of this section on the asphalt surface specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) 
of this section, and
    (2) More than 0.26 when tested in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) 
of this

[[Page 729]]

section on the concrete surface specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this 
section.
    (C) The tire may be graded A only when its adjusted traction 
coefficient is both:
    (1) More than 0.47 when tested in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) 
of this section on the asphalt surface specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) 
of this section, and
    (2) More than 0.35 when tested in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) 
of this section on the concrete surface specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) 
of this section.
    (D) The tire may be graded AA only when its adjusted traction 
coefficient is both:
    (1) More than 0.54<greek-m> when tested in accordance with paragraph 
(f)(2) of this section on the asphalt surface specified in paragraph 
(f)(1)(i) of this section; and
    (2) More than 0.38<greek-m> when tested in accordance with paragraph 
(f)(2) of this section on the concrete surface specified in paragraph 
(f)(1)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Temperature resistance. Each tire shall be graded for 
temperature resistance performance with the word ``TEMPERATURE'' 
followed by the letter A, B, or C, based on its performance when the 
tire is tested in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraph 
(g) of this section. A tire shall be considered to have successfully 
completed a test stage in accordance with this paragraph if, at the end 
of the test stage, it exhibits no visual evidence of tread, sidewall, 
ply, cord, innerliner, or bead separation, chunking, broken cords, 
cracking or open splices as defined in Sec. 571.109 of this chapter, and 
the tire pressure is not less than the pressure specified in paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section.
    (A) The tire shall be graded C if it fails to complete the 500 rpm 
test stage specified in paragraph (g)(9) of this section.
    (B) The tire may be graded B only if it successfully completes the 
500 rpm test stage specified in paragraph (g)(9) of this section.
    (C) The tire may be graded A only if it successfully completes the 
575 rpm test stage specified in paragraph (g)(9) of this section.
    (e) Treadwear grading conditions and procedures--(1) Conditions.
    (i) Tire treadwear performance is evaluated on a specific roadway 
course approximately 400 miles in length, which is established by the 
NHTSA both for its own compliance testing and for that of regulated 
persons. The course is designed to produce treadwear rates that are 
generally representative of those encountered by tires in public use. 
The course and driving procedures are described in appendix A of this 
section.
    (ii) Treadwear grades are evaluated by first measuring the 
performance of a candidate tire on the government test course, and then 
correcting the projected mileage obtained to account for environmental 
variations on the basis of the performance of the course monitoring 
tires run in the same convoy. The course monitoring tires are made 
available by the NHTSA at Goodfellow Air Force Base, San Angelo, Tex., 
for purchase by any persons conducting tests at the test course.
    (iii) In convoy tests, each vehicle in the same convoy, except for 
the lead vehicle, is throughout the test within human eye range of the 
vehicle immediately ahead of it.
    (iv) A test convoy consists of two or four passenger cars, each 
having only rear-wheel drive.
    (v) On each convoy vehicle, all tires are mounted on identical rims 
of design or measuring rim width specified for tires of that size in 
accordance with 49 CFR 571.109, S4.4.1 (a) or (b), or a rim having a 
width within -0 to +0.50 inches of the width listed.
    (2) Treadwear grading procedure. (i) Equip a convoy as follows: 
Place four course monitoring tires on one vehicle. Place four candidate 
tires with identical size designations on each other vehicle in the 
convoy. On each axle, place tires that are identical with respect to 
manufacturer and line.
    (ii) Inflate each candidate and each course monitoring tire to the 
applicable pressure specified in Table 1 of this section.
    (iii) Load each vehicle so that the load on each course monitoring 
and

[[Page 730]]

candidate tire is 85 percent of the test load specified in 
Sec. 575.104(h).
    (iv) Adjust wheel alignment to the midpoint of the vehicle 
manufacturer's specifications, unless adjustment to the midpoint is not 
recommended by the manufacturer; in that case, adjust the alignment to 
the manufacturer's recommended setting. In all cases, the setting is 
within the tolerance specified by the manufacturer of the alignment 
machine.
    (v) Subject candidate and course monitoring tires to ``break-in'' by 
running the tires in the convoy for two circuits of the test roadway 
(800 miles). At the end of the first circuit, rotate each vehicle's 
tires by moving each front tire to the same side of the rear axle and 
each rear tire to the opposite side of the front axle. Visually inspect 
each tire for any indication of abnormal wear, tread separation, bulging 
of the sidewall, or any sign of tire failure. Void the grading results 
from any tire with any of these anomalies, and replace the tire.
    (vi) After break-in, allow the air pressure in the tires to fall to 
the applicable pressure specified in Table 1 of this section or for 2 
hours, whichever occurs first. Measure, to the nearest 0.001 inch, the 
tread depth of each candidate and each course monitoring tire, avoiding 
treadwear indicators, at six equally spaced points in each groove. For 
each tire compute the average of the measurements. Do not measure those 
shoulder grooves which are not provided with treadwear indicators.
    (vii) Adjust wheel alignment to the midpoint of the manufacturer's 
specifications, unless adjustment to the midpoint is not recommended by 
the manufacturer; in that case, adjust the alignment according to the 
manufacturer's recommended setting. In all cases, the setting is within 
the tolerance specified by the manufacturer of the alignment machine.
    (viii) Drive the convoy on the test roadway for 6,400 miles.
    (A) After each 400 miles, rotate each vehicle's tires by moving each 
front tire to the same side of the rear axle and each rear tire to the 
opposite side of the front axle. Visually inspect each tire for 
treadwear anomalies.
    (B) After each 800 miles, rotate the vehicles in the convoy by 
moving the last vehicle to the lead position. Do not rotate driver 
positions within the convoy. In four-car convoys, vehicle one shall 
become vehicle two, vehicle two shall become vehicle three, vehicle 
three shall become vehicle four, and vehicle four shall become vehicle 
one.
    (C) After each 800 miles, if necessary, adjust wheel alignment to 
the midpoint of the vehicle manufacturer's specification, unless 
adjustment to the midpoint is not recommended by the manufacturer; in 
that case, adjust the alignment to the manufacturer's recommended 
setting. In all cases, the setting is within the tolerance specified by 
the manufacturer of the alignment machine.
    (D) After each 800 miles, if determining the projected mileage by 
the 9-point method set forth in (e)(2)(ix)(A)(1), measure the average 
tread depth of each tire following the procedure set forth in paragraph 
(e)(2)(vi) of this section.
    (E) After each 1,600 miles, move the complete set of four tires to 
the following vehicle. Move the tires on the last vehicle to the lead 
vehicle. In moving the tires, rotate them as set forth in 
(e)(2)(viii)(A) of this section.
    (F) At the end of the test, measure the tread depth of each tire 
pursuant to the procedure set forth in paragraph (e)(2)(vi) of this 
section.
    (ix)(A) Determine the projected mileage for each candidate tire 
either by the nine-point method of least squares set forth in paragraph 
(e)(2)(ix)(A)(1) of this section and appendix C to this section, or by 
the two-point arithmetical method set forth in paragraph 
(e)(2)(ix)(A)(2) of this section. Notify NHTSA about which of the 
alternative grading methods is being used.
    (1) Nine-Point Method of Least Squares. For each course monitoring 
and candidate tire in the convoy, using the average tread depth 
measurements obtained in accordance with paragraphs (e)(2)(vi) and 
(e)(2)(viii)(D) of this section and the corresponding mileages as data 
points, apply the method of least squares as described in appendix C to 
this section to determine the estimated regression line of y on x given 
by the following formula:

[[Page 731]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AU91.184


Where:
y = average tread depth in mils
x = miles after break-in,
a = y intercept of regression line (reference tread depth) in mils, 
          calculated using the method of least squares; and
b = the slope of the regression line in mils of tread depth per 1,000 
          miles, calculated using the method of least squares. This 
          slope will be negative in value. The tire's wear rate is 
          defined as the absolute value of the slope of the regression 
          line.

    (2) Two-Point Arithmetical Method. For each course monitoring and 
candidate tire in the convoy, using the average tread depth measurements 
obtained in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(vi) and (e)(2)(viii)(F) of 
this section and the corresponding mileages as data points, determine 
the slope (m) of the tire's wear in mils of tread depth per 1,000 miles 
by the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AU91.185

Where:
Yo = average tread depth after break-in, mils
Y1 = average tread depth at 6,400 miles, mils
Xo = 0 miles (after break-in).
X1 = 6,400 miles of travel

This slope (m) will be negative in value. The tire's wear rate is 
defined as the slope (m) expressed in mils per 1,000 miles.
    (B) Average the wear rates of the four course monitoring tires as 
determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(ix)(A) of this section.
    (C) Determine the course severity adjustment factor by assigning a 
base course wear rate of 1.34 to the course monitoring tires and 
dividing that rate by the average wear rate for the four course 
monitoring tires.
    (D) Determine the adjusted wear rate for each candidate tire by 
multiplying its wear rate determined in accordance with paragraph 
(e)(2)(ix)(A) of this section by the course severity adjustment factor 
determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(ix)(C) of this section.
    (E) Determine the projected mileage for each candidate tire by 
applying the appropriate formula set forth below:
    (1) If the projected mileage is calculated pursuant to paragraph 
(e)(2)(ix)(A)(1) of this section, then:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AU91.186

Where:
a = y intercept of regression line (reference tread depth) for the 
          candidate tire as determined in accordance with paragraph 
          (e)(2)(ix)(A)(1) of this section.
b\1\ = the adjusted wear rate for the candidate tire as determined in 
accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(ix)(D) of this section.

    (2) If the projected mileage is calculated pursuant to 
(e)(2)(ix)(a)(2) of this section, then:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AU91.187

Where:
Yo = average tread depth after break-in, mils
mc = the adjusted wear rate for the candidate tires as determined in 
          accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(ix)(D) of this section.

    (F) Compute the percentage (P) of the NHTSA nominal treadwear value 
for each candidate tire using the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AU91.188

    On and before August 31, 1993, round off the percentage to the 
nearest lower 10-point increment. On and after September 1, 1993, round 
off the percentage to the nearest lower 20-point increment.
    (f) Traction grading conditions and procedures--(1) Conditions. (i) 
Tire traction performance is evaluated on skid pads that are 
established, and whose severity is monitored, by the NHTSA both for its 
compliance testing and for that of regulated persons. The test pavements 
are asphalt and concrete surfaces constructed in accordance with the 
specifications for pads ``C'' and ``A'' in the ``Manual for the 
Construction and Maintenance of Skid Surfaces,'' National Technical 
Information Service No. DOT-HS-800-814. The surfaces have locked wheel 
traction coefficients when evaluated in accordance with paragraphs 
(f)(2)(i) through (f)(2)(vii) of this section of 
0.50<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.10 for the asphalt and 
0.35<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>0.10 for the concrete. The location of the skid

[[Page 732]]

pads is described in appendix B to this section.

    (iii) The pavement surface is wetted in accordance with paragraph 
3.5, ``Pavement Wetting System,'' of ASTM Method E 274-79, ``Skid 
Resistance of Paved Surfaces Using a Full-Scale Tire.''
    (iv) The test apparatus is a test trailer built in conformity with 
the specifications in paragraph 3, ``Apparatus,'' of ASTM Method E 274-
79, and instrumented in accordance with paragraph 3.3.2 of that method, 
except that ``wheel load'' in paragraph 3.2.2 and tire and rim 
specifications in paragraph 3.2.3 of that method are as specified in the 
procedures in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for standard and 
candidate tires.
    (v) The test apparatus is calibrated in accordance with ASTM Method 
F 377-74, ``Standard Method for Calibration of Braking Force for Testing 
of Pneumatic Tires'' with the trailer's tires inflated to 24 psi and 
loaded to 1,085 pounds.
    (vi) Consecutive tests on the same surface are conducted not less 
than 30 seconds apart.
    (vii) A standard tire is discarded in accordance with ASTM Method E 
501.
    (2) Procedure. (i) Prepare two standard tires as follows:
    (A) Condition the tires by running them for 200 miles on a pavement 
surface.
    (B) Mount each tire on a rim of design or measuring rim width 
specified for tires of its size in accordance with 49 CFR 571.109, 
S4.4.1 (a) or (b), or a rim having a width within -0 to +0.50 inches of 
the width listed. Then inflate the tire to 24 psi, or, in the case of a 
tire with inflation pressure measured in kilopascals, to 180 kPa.
    (C) Statically balance each tire-rim combination.
    (D) Allow each tire to cool to ambient temperature and readjust its 
inflation pressure to 24 psi, or, in the case of a tire with inflation 
pressure measured in kilopascals, to 180 kPa.
    (ii) Mount the tires on the test apparatus described in paragraph 
(f)(1)(iv) of this section and load each tire to 1,085 pounds.
    (iii) Tow the trailer on the asphalt test surface specified in 
paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section at a speed of 40 mph, lock one 
trailer wheel, and record the locked-wheel traction coefficient on the 
tire associated with that wheel between 0.5 and 1.5 seconds after 
lockup.
    (iv) Repeat the test on the concrete surface, locking the same 
wheel.
    (v) Repeat the tests specified in paragraphs (f)(2) (iii) and (iv) 
of this section for a total of 10 measurements on each test surface.
    (vi) Repeat the procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(2) (iii) 
through (v) of this section, locking the wheel associated with the other 
tire.
    (vii) Average the 20 measurements taken on the asphalt surface to 
find the standard tire traction coefficient for the asphalt surface. 
Average the 20 measurements taken on the concrete surface to find the 
standard tire traction coefficient for the concrete surface. The 
standard tire traction coefficient so determined may be used in the 
computation of adjusted traction coefficients for more than one 
candidate tire.
    (viii) Prepare two candidate tires of the same construction type, 
manufacturer, line, and size designation in accordance with paragraph 
(f)(2)(i) of this section, mount them on the test apparatus, and test 
one of them according to the procedures of paragraph (f)(2)(ii) through 
(v) of this section, except load each tire to 85% of the test load 
specified in Sec. 575.104(h). For CT tires, the test inflation of 
candidate tires shall be 230 kPa. Candidate tire measurements may be 
taken either before or after the standard tire measurements used to 
compute the standard tire traction coefficient. Take all standard tire 
and candidate tire measurements used in computation of a candidate 
tire's adjusted traction coefficient within a single three hour period. 
Average the 10 measurements taken on the asphalt surface to find the 
candidate tire traction coefficient for the asphalt surface. Average the 
10 measurements taken on the concrete surface to find the candidate tire 
traction coefficient for the concrete surface.

[[Page 733]]

    (1) Mount the tire on a rim of design or measuring rim width 
specified for tires of its size in accordance with Sec. 571.109, 
paragraph S4.4.1 (a) or (b) and inflate it to the applicable pressure 
specified in Table 1 of this section.
    (2) Condition the tire-rim assembly to a temperature of 95 deg. F 
for at least 3 hours.
    (3) Adjust the pressure again to the applicable pressure specified 
in Table 1 of this section.
    (4) Mount the tire-rim assembly on an axle, and press the tire tread 
against the surface of a flat-faced steel test wheel that is 67.23 
inches in diameter and at least as wide as the section width of the 
tire.
    (5) During the test, including the pressure measurements specified 
in paragraphs (g) (1) and (3) of this section, maintain the temperature 
of the ambient air, as measured 12 inches from the edge of the rim 
flange at any point on the circumference on either side of the tire at 
95 deg. F. Locate the temperature sensor so that its readings are not 
affected by heat radiation, drafts, variations in the temperature of the 
surrounding air, or guards or other devices.
    (6) Press the tire against the test wheel with a load of 88 percent 
of the tire's maximum load rating as marked on the tire sidewall.
    (7) Rotate the test wheel at 250 rpm for 2 hours.
    (8) Remove the load, allow the tire to cool to 95 deg. F or for 2 
hours, whichever occurs last, and readjust the inflation pressure to the 
applicable pressure specified in Table 1 of this section.
    (9) Reapply the load and without interruption or readjustment of 
inflation pressure, rotate the test wheel at 375 rpm for 30 minutes, and 
then at successively higher rates in 25 rpm increments, each for 30 
minutes, until the tire has run at 575 rpm for 30 minutes, or to 
failure, whichever occurs first.

    (h) Determination of test load. (1) To determine test loads for 
purposes of paragraphs (e)(2)(iii) and (f)(2)(viii), follow the 
procedure set forth in paragraphs (h) (2) through (5) of this section.
    (2) Determine the tire's maximum inflation pressure and maximum load 
rating both as specified on the tire's sidewall.
    (3) Determine the appropriate multiplier corresponding to the tire's 
maximum inflation pressure, as set forth in Table 2.
    (4) Multiply the tire's maximum load rating by the multiplier 
determined in paragraph (h)(3). This is the tire's calculated load.
    (5) Round the product determined in paragraph (h)(4) (the calculated 
load) to the nearest multiple of ten pounds or, if metric units are 
used, 5 kilograms. For example, 903 pounds would be rounded to 900 and 
533 kilograms

TRACTION  AA  A  B  C

TEMPERATURE  A  B  C

    (Part II) All Passenger Car Tires Must Conform to Federal Safety 
Requirements In Addition To These Grades

                                Treadwear

    The treadwear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear rate 
of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified 
government test course. For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one 
and one-half (1\1/2\) times as well on the government course as a tire 
graded 100. The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual 
conditions of their use, however, and may depart significantly from the 
norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices and 
differences in road characteristics and climate.

                                TRACTION

    The traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B, and C. 
Those grades represent the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement as 
measured under controlled conditions on specified government test 
surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A tire marked C may have poor traction 
performance. Warning: The traction grade assigned to this tire is based 
on straight-ahead braking traction tests, and does not include 
acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak traction characteristics.

                               Temperature

    The temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing 
the tire's resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to 
dissipate heat when tested under controlled conditions on a specified 
indoor laboratory test wheel. Sustained high temperature can cause the 
material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive 
temperature can lead to sudden tire failure. The grade C corresponds to 
a level of performance which all passenger car tires must meet under the 
Federal Motor Safety Standard No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher 
levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel than the minimum 
required by law. Warning: The temperature grade for this tire is 
established for a tire that is properly inflated and not overloaded. 
Excessive speed, underinflation, or excessive loading, either separately 
or in combination, can cause heat buildup and possible tire failure.

        Appendix A--Treadwear Test Course and Driving Procedures

    Introduction. The test course consists of three loops of a total of 
400 miles in the geographical vicinity of Goodfellow AFB, San Angelo, 
Tex.
    The first loop runs south 143 miles through the cities of Eldorado, 
Sonora, and Juno, Tex. to the Camp Hudson Historical Marker, and returns 
by the same route.
    The second loop runs east over Farm and Ranch Roads (FM) and returns 
to its starting point.
    The third loop runs northwest to Water Valley, northeast toward 
Robert Lee and returns via Texas 208 to the vicinity of Goodfellow AFB.
    Route. The route is shown in Figure 3. The table identifies key 
points by number. These numbers are encircled in Figure 3 and in 
parentheses in the descriptive material that follows.
    Southern Loop. The course begins at the intersection (1) of Ft. 
McKavitt Road and Paint Rock Road (FM388) at the northwest corner of 
Goodfellow AFB.
    Drive east via FM 388 to junction with Loop Road 306 (2). Turn right 
onto Loop Road 306 and proceed south to junction with US277 (3). Turn 
onto US277 and proceed south through Eldorado and Sonora (4), continuing 
on US277 to junction with FM189 (5). Turn right onto FM189 and proceed 
to junction with Texas 163 (6). Turn left onto Texas 163, proceed south 
to Camp Hudson Historical Marker and onto the paved shoulder (7). 
Reverse route to junction of Loop Road 306 and FM 388 (2).
    Eastern Loop. From junction of Loop Road 306 and FM388 (2), make 
right turn onto FM388 and drive east to junction with FM2334 (13). Turn 
right onto FM2334 and proceed south across FM765 (14) to junction of 
FM2334 and US87 (15). For convoys that originate at Goodfellow AFB, make 
U-turn and return to junction of FM388 and Loop Road 306 (2) by the same 
route. For

[[Page 737]]

convoys that do not originate at Goodfellow AFB, upon reaching junction 
of FM2334 and US87 (15), make U-Turn and continue north on FM2334 past 
the intersection with FM388 to Veribest Cotton Gin, a distance of 1.8 
miles beyond the intersection. Make U-turn and return to junction of 
FM2334 and FM388. Turn right onto FM388, proceed west to junction FM388 
and Loop Road 306.
    Northwestern Loop. From junction of Loop Road 306 and FM388 (2), 
make right turn onto Loop Road 306. Proceed onto US277, to junction with 
FM2105 (8). Turn left onto FM2105 and proceed west to junction with US87 
(10). Turn right on US87 and proceed northwest to the junction with 
FM2034 near the town of Water Valley (11). Turn right onto FM2034 and 
proceed north to Texas 208 (12). Turn right onto Texas 208 and proceed 
south to junction with FM2105 (9). Turn left onto FM2105 and proceed 
east to junction with US277 (8). Turn right onto US277 and proceed south 
onto Loop Road 306 to junction with FM388 (2). For convoys that 
originate at Goodfellow AFB, turn right onto FM388 and proceed to 
starting point at junction of Ft. McKavitt Road and FM388 (1). For 
convoys that do not originate at Goodfellow AFB, do not turn right onto 
FM388 but continue south on Loop Road 306.
    Driving instructions. The drivers shall run at posted speed limits 
throughout the course unless an unsafe condition arises. If such 
condition arises, the speed should be reduced to the maximum safe 
operating speed.
    Braking Procedures at STOP signs. There are a number of 
intersections at which stops are required. At each of these 
intersections a series of signs is placed in a fixed order at follows:

                               Sign Legend

Highway Intersection 1000 (or 2000) Feet

STOP AHEAD

Junction XXX

Direction Sign (Mereta<r-arrow>)

STOP or YIELD
    Procedures. 1. Approach each intersection at posted speed limit.
    2. When abreast of the STOP AHEAD sign, apply the brakes so that the 
vehicle decelerates smoothly to 20 mph when abreast of the direction 
sign.
    3. Come to a complete stop at the STOP sign or behind any vehicle 
already stopped.

                     Appendix B--Traction Skid Pads

    Two skid pads have been laid on an unused runway and taxi strip on 
Goodfellow AFB. Their location is shown in Figure 4.
    The asphalt skid pad is 600 ft. x 60 ft. and is shown in black on 
the runway in Figure 4. The pad is approached from either end by a 75 
ft. ramp followed by 100 ft. of level pavement. This arrangement permits 
the skid trailers to stabilize before reaching the test area. The 
approaches are shown on the figure by the hash-marked area.
    The concrete pad is 600 ft. x 48 ft. and is on the taxi strip. The 
approaches to the concrete pad are of the same design as those for the 
asphalt pads.
    A two lane asphalt road has been built to connect the runway and 
taxi strip. The road is parallel to the northeast-southwest runway at a 
distance of 100 ft. The curves have super-elevation to permit safe exit 
from the runway at operating speeds.

                   Appendix C--Method of Least Squares

    The method of least squares is a method of calculation by which it 
is possible to obtain a reliable estimate of a true physical 
relationship from a set of data which involve random error. The method 
may be used to establish a regression line that minimizes the sum of the 
squares of the deviations of the measured data points from the line. The 
regression line is consequently described as the line of ``best fit'' to 
the data points. It is described in terms of its slope and its ``y'' 
intercept.
    The graph in Figure 5 depicts a regression line calculated using the 
least squares method from data collected from a hypothetical treadwear 
test of 6,400 miles, with tread depth measurements made at every 500 
miles.


[[Page 741]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AU91.193



    In this graph, x<INF>j</INF>,y<INF>j(j=0,1,...8)</INF> are the 
individual data points representing the tread depth measurements (the 
overall average for the tire with 6 measurements in each tire groove) at 
the beginning of the test (after break-in) and at the end of each 800-
mile segment of the test.
    The absolute value of the slope of the regression line is an 
expression of the mils of tread worn per 1,000 miles, and is calculated 
by the following formula:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AU91.194


    The ``y'' intercept of the regression line (a) in mils is calculated 
by the following formula:

    (B)(1) Each tire manufactured before April 1, 1982, other than a 
tire sold as original equipment on a new vehicle, shall have affixed to 
its tread surface in a manner such that it is not easily removable a 
label containing its grades and other information in the form 
illustrated in Figure 2, Part II, bearing the heading ``DOT QUALITY 
GRADES.'' The treadwear grade attributed to the tire shall be either 
imprinted or indelibly stamped on the label adjacent to the description 
of the treadwear grade. The label shall also depict all possible grades 
for traction and temperature resistance. The traction and temperature 
resistance performance grades attributed to the tire shall be indelibly 
circled. However, each tire labeled in conformity with the requirements 
of paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B)(2) of this section need not comply with the 
provisions of this paragraph.
    (2) Each tire manufactured on or after April 1, 1982, other than a 
tire sold as original equipment on a new vehicle, shall have affixed to 
its tread surface so as not to be easily removable a label or labels 
containing its grades and other information in the form illustrated in 
Figure 2, Parts I and II. The treadwear grade attributed to the tire 
shall be either imprinted or indelibly stamped on the label containing 
the material in Part I of Figure 2, directly to the right of or below 
the word ``TREADWEAR''. The traction and temperature resistance 
performance grades attributed to the tire shall be indelibly circled in 
an array of the potential grade letters (ABC) directly to the right of 
or below the words ``TRACTION'' and ``TEMPERATURE'' in Part I of Figure 
2. The words ``TREADWEAR,'' ``TRACTION,'' and ``TEMPERATURE,'' in that 
order, may be laid out vertically or horizontally. The text of Part II 
of Figure 2 may be printed in capital letters. The text of Part I and 
the text of Part II of Figure 2 need not appear on the same label, but 
the edges of the two texts must be positioned on the tire tread so as to 
be separated by a distance of no more than one inch. If the text of Part 
I and the text of Part II are placed on separate labels, the notation 
``See EXPLANATION OF DOT QUALITY GRADES'' shall be added to the bottom 
of the Part I text, and the words ``EXPLANATION OF DOT QUALITY GRADES'' 
shall appear at the top of the Part II text. The text of Figure 2 shall

Sec. 575.105  Utility vehicles.

    (a) Purpose and scope. This section requires manufacturers of 
utility vehicles to alert drivers that the particular handling and 
maneuvering characteristics of utility vehicles require special driving 
practices when those vehicles are operated on paved roads.
    (b) Application. This section applies to multipurpose passenger 
vehicles (other than those which are passenger car derivatives) which 
have a wheelbase of 110 inches or less and special features for 
occasional off-road operation (``Utility vehicles'').
    (c) Required information. Each manufacturer shall prepare and affix 
a vehicle sticker as specified in paragraph 1 of this subsection and 
shall provide in the vehicle Owner's Manual the information specified in 
paragraph 2 of this subsection.
    (1) A sticker shall be permanently affixed to the instrument panel, 
windshield frame, driver's side sun visor, or in some other location in 
each vehicle prominent and visible to the driver. The sticker shall be 
printed in a typeface and color which are clear and conspicuous. The 
sticker shall have the following or similar language:

    This is a multipurpose passenger vehicle which will handle and 
maneuver differently from an ordinary passenger car, in driving 
conditions which may occur on streets and highways and off road. As with 
other vehicles of this type, if you make sharp turns or abrupt 
maneuvers, the vehicle may roll over or may go out of control and crash. 
You should read driving guidelines and instructions in the Owner's 
Manual, and WEAR YOUR SEAT BELTS AT ALL TIMES.


The language on the sticker required by paragraph (1) and in the Owner's 
Manual, as required in paragraph (2), may be modified as is desired by 
the manufacturer to make it appropriate for a specific vehicle design, 
to ensure that consumers are adequately informed concerning the unique 
propensities of a particular vehicle model.
    (2)(i) The vehicle Owner's Manual shall include the following 
statement in its introduction.
    As with other vehicles of this type, failure to operate this vehicle 
correctly may result in loss of control or an accident. Be sure to read 
``on-pavement'' and ``off-road'' driving guidelines which follow.
    (ii) The vehicle Owner's Manual shall include the following or 
similar statement:

    Utility vehicles have higher ground clearance and a narrower track 
to make them capable of performing in a wide variety of off-road 
applications. Specific design characteristics give them a higher center 
of gravity than ordinary cars. An advantage of the higher ground 
clearance is a better view of the road allowing you to anticipate 
problems. They are not designed for cornering at the same speeds as 
conventional 2-wheel drive vehicles any more than low-slung sports cars 
are designed to perform satisfactorily under off-road conditions. If at 
all possible, avoid sharp turns or abrupt maneuvers. As with other 
vehicles of this type, failure to operate this vehicle correctly may 
result in loss of control or vehicle rollover.

<R05>
Sec. 577.7  Time and manner of notification.

    (a) The notification required by Sec. 577.5 shall--
    (1) Be furnished within a reasonable time after the manufacturer 
first decides that either a defect that relates

[[Page 752]]

to motor vehicle safety or a noncompliance exists. The Administrator may 
order a manufacturer to send the notification to owners on a specific 
date where the Administrator finds, after consideration of available 
information and the views of the manufacturer, that such notification is 
in the public interest. The factors that the Administrator may consider 
include, but are not limited to, the severity of the safety risk; the 
likelihood of occurrence of the defect or noncompliance; whether there 
is something that an owner can do to reduce either the likelihood of 
occurrence of the defect or noncompliance or the severity of the 
consequences; whether there will be a delay in the availability of the 
remedy from the manufacturer; and the anticipated length of any such 
delay.
    (2) Be accomplished--
    (i) In the case of a notification required to be sent by a motor 
vehicle manufacturer, by first class mail to each person who is 
registered under State law as the owner of the vehicle and whose name 
and address are reasonably ascertainable by the manufacturer through 
State records or other sources available to him. If the owner cannot be 
reasonably ascertained, the manufacturer shall notify the most recent 
purchaser known to the manufacturer. The manufacturer shall also provide 
notification to each lessee of a leased motor vehicle that is covered by 
an agreement between the manufacturer and a lessor under which the 
manufacturer is to notify lessees directly of safety-related defects and 
noncompliances.
    (ii) In the case of a notification required to be sent by a 
replacement equipment manufacturer--
    (A) By first class mail to the most recent purchaser known to the 
manufacturer, and
    (B) (Except in the case of a tire) if decided by the Administrator 
to be required for motor vehicle safety, by public notice in such manner 
as the Administrator may require after consultation with the 
manufacturer.
    (iii) In the case of a manufacturer required to provide notification 
concerning any defective or noncomplying tire, by first class or 
certified mail.
    (iv) In the case of a notification to be sent by a lessor to a 
lessee of a leased motor vehicle, by first-class mail to the most recent 
lessee known to the lessor. Such notification shall be mailed within ten 
days of the lessor's receipt of the notification from the vehicle 
manufacturer.
    (b) The notification required by any paragraph of Sec. 577.6 shall 
be provided:
    (1) Within 60 days after the manufacturer's receipt of the 
Administrator's order to provide the notification, except that the 
notification shall be furnished within a shorter or longer period if the 
Administrator incorporates in his order a finding that such period is in 
the public interest; and
    (2) In the manner and to the recipient specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section.

<R05>
Sec. 577.8  Disclaimers.

    (a) A notification sent pursuant to Secs. 577.5, 577.6, 577.9 or 
577.10 regarding a defect which relates to motor vehicle safety shall 
not, except as specifically provided in this part, contain any statement 
or implication that there is no defect, that the defect does not relate 
to motor vehicle safety, or that the defect is not present in the 
owner's or lessee's vehicle or item of replacement equipment. This 
section also applies to any notification sent to a lessor or directly to 
a lessee by a manufacturer.
    (b) A notification sent pursuant to Secs. 577.5, 577.6, 577.9 or 
577.10 regarding a noncompliance with an applicable motor vehicle safety 
standard shall not, except as specifically provided in this part, 
contain any statement or implication that there is not a noncompliance, 
or that the noncompliance is not present in the owner's or lessee's 
vehicle or item of replacement equipment. This section also applies to 
any notification sent to a lessor or directly to a lessee by a 
manufacturer.

Sec. 577.9  Conformity to statutory requirements.

    A notification that does not conform to the requirements of this 
part is a violation of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 577.10  Follow-up notification.

    (a) If, based on quarterly reports submitted pursuant to Sec. 573.6 
of this part or other available information, the Administrator decides 
that a notification of a safety-related defect of a noncompliance with a 
Federal motor vehicle safety standard sent by a manufacturer has not 
resulted in an adequate number of vehicles or items of equipment being 
returned for remedy, the Administrator may direct the manufacturer to 
send a follow-up notification in accordance with this section. The 
scope, timing, form, and content of such follow-up notification will be 
established by the Administrator, in consultation with the manufacturer, 
to maximize the number of owners, purchasers, and lessees who will 
present their vehicles or items of equipment for remedy.
    (b) The Administrator may consider the following factors in deciding 
whether or not to require a manufacturer to undertake a follow-up 
notification campaign:
    (1) The percentage of covered vehicles or items of equipment that 
have been presented for the remedy;
    (2) The amount of time that has elapsed since the prior 
notification(s);
    (3) The likelihood that a follow-up notification will increase the 
number of vehicles or items of equipment receiving the remedy;
    (4) The seriousness of the safety risk from the defect or 
noncompliance;
    (5) Whether the prior notification(s) undertaken by the manufacturer 
complied with the requirements of the statute and regulations; and
    (6) Such other factors as are consistent with the purpose of the 
statute.
    (c) A manufacturer shall be required to provide a follow-up 
notification under this section only with respect to vehicles or items 
of equipment that have not been returned for remedy pursuant to the 
prior notification(s).
    (d) Except where the Administrator determines otherwise, the follow-
up notification shall be sent to the same categories of recipients that 
received the prior notification(s).
    (e) A follow-up notification must include:
    (1) A statement that identifies it as a follow-up to an earlier 
communication;
    (2) A statement urging the recipient to present the vehicle or item 
of equipment for remedy; and
    (3) Except as determined by the Administrator, the information 
required to be included in the initial notification.
    (f) The manufacturer shall mark the outside of each envelope in 
which it sends a follow-up notification in a manner which meets the 
requirements of Sec. 577.5(a) of this part.
    (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the 
Administrator may authorize the use of other media besides first-class 
mail for a follow-up notification.

Sec. 580.1  Scope.

    This part prescribes rules requiring transferors and lessees of 
motor vehicles to make written disclosure to transferees and lessors 
respectively, concerning the odometer mileage and its accuracy as 
directed by sections 408 (a) and (e) of the Motor Vehicle Information 
and Cost Savings Act as amended, 15 U.S.C. 1988 (a) and (e). In 
addition, this part prescribes the rules requiring the retention of 
odometer disclosure statements by motor vehicle dealers, distributors 
and lessors and the retention of certain other information by auction 
companies as directed by sections 408(g) and 414 of the Motor Vehicle 
Information and Cost Savings Act as amended, 15 U.S.C. 1990(d) and 
1988(g).


<R05>
Sec. 580.2  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to provide purchasers of motor vehicles 
with odometer information to assist them in determining a vehicle's 
condition and value by making the disclosure of a vehicle's mileage a 
condition of title and by requiring lessees to disclose to their lessors 
the vehicle's mileage at the time the lessors transfer the vehicle. In 
addition, the purpose of this part is to preserve records that are 
needed for the proper investigation of possible violations of the Motor 
Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act and any subsequent 
prosecutorial, adjudicative or other action.

<R05>
Sec. 580.4  Security of title documents and power of attorney forms.

    Each title shall be set forth by means of a secure printing process 
or other secure process. In addition, power of attorney forms issued 
pursuant to Secs. 580.13 and 580.14 and documents which are used to

Sec. 580.5  Disclosure of odometer information.

    (a) Each title, at the time it is issued to the transferee, must 
contain the mileage disclosed by the transferor when ownership of the 
vehicle was transferred and contain a space for the information required 
to be disclosed under paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this section 
at the time of future transfer.
    (b) Any documents which are used to reassign a title shall contain a 
space for the information required to be disclosed under paragraphs (c), 
(d), (e) and (f) of this section at the time of transfer of ownership.
    (c) In connection with the transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle, 
each transferor shall disclose the mileage to the transferee in writing 
on the title or, except as noted below, on the document being used to 
reassign the title. In the case of a transferor in whose name the 
vehicle is titled, the transferor shall disclose the mileage on the 
title, and not on a reassignment document. This written disclosure must 
be signed by the transferor, including the printed name. In connection 
with the transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle in which more than one 
person is a transferor, only one transferor need sign the written 
disclosure. In addition to the signature and printed name of the 
transferor, the written disclosure must contain the following 
information:
    (1) The odometer reading at the time of transfer (not to include 
tenths of miles);
    (2) The date of transfer;
    (3) The transferor's name and current address;
    (4) The transferee's name and current address; and
    (5) The identity of the vehicle, including its make, model, year, 
and body type, and its vehicle identification number.
    (d) In addition to the information provided under paragraph (c) of 
this section, the statement shall refer to the Federal law and shall 
state that failure to complete or providing false information may result 
in fines and/or imprisonment. Reference may also be made to applicable 
State law.
    (e) In addition to the information provided under paragraphs (c) and 
(d) of this section,
    (1) The transferor shall certify that to the best of his knowledge 
the odometer reading reflects the actual mileage, or;
    (2) If the transferor knows that the odometer reading reflects the 
amount of mileage in excess of the designed mechanical odometer limit, 
he shall include a statement to that effect; or
    (3) If the transferor knows that the odometer reading differs from 
the mileage and that the difference is greater

[[Page 758]]

than that caused by odometer calibration error, he shall include a 
statement that the odometer reading does not reflect the actual mileage, 
and should not be relied upon. This statement shall also include a 
warning notice to alert the transferee that a discrepancy exists between 
the odometer reading and the actual mileage.
    (f) The transferee shall sign the disclosure statement, print his 
name, and return a copy to his transferor.
    (g) If the vehicle has not been titled or if the title does not 
contain a space for the information required, the written disclosure 
shall be executed as a separate document.
    (h) No person shall sign an odometer disclosure statement as both 
the transferor and transferee in the same transaction, unless permitted 
by Secs. 580.13 or 580.14.

The transferee shall submit the original power of attorney form to the 
State that issued it, with a copy of the transferor's title or with the 
actual title when the transferee submits a new title application at the 
same time. The State shall retain the power of attorney form and title 
for three years or a period equal to the State titling record retention 
period, whichever is shorter. If the mileage disclosed on the power of 
attorney form is lower than the mileage appearing on the title, the 
power of attorney is void and the dealer shall not complete the mileage

   Appendix A to Part 580--Secure Printing Processes and Other Secure 
                                Processes

    1. Methods to deter or detect counterfeiting and/or unauthorized 
reproduction.
    (a) Intaglio printing--a printing process utilized in the production 
of bank-notes and other security documents whereby an engraved plate 
meets the paper under extremely high pressure forcing the paper into the 
incisions below the surface of the plate.
    (b) Intaglio Printing With Latent Images--a printing process 
utilized in the production of bank-notes and other security documents 
whereby an engraved plate meets the paper under extremely high pressure 
forcing the paper into the incisions below the surface of the plate. The 
three dimensional nature of intaglio printing creates latent images that 
aid in verification of authenticity and deter counterfeiting.
    (c) High Resolution Printing--a printing process which achieves 
excellent art clarity

[[Page 763]]

and detail quality approaching that of the intaglio process.
    (d) Micro-line Printing--a reduced line of type that appears to be a 
solid line to the naked eye but contains readable intelligence under 
strong magnification.
    (e) Pantograph Void Feature--wording incorporated into a pantograph 
by varying screen density in the pantograph. The wording will appear 
when attempts are made to photocopy on color copiers.
    (f) Hologram--a defraction foil substrate, produced from a negative 
which was made by splitting a laser beam into two separate beams to 
produce a three dimensional effect.
    (g) Security Paper--paper containing a security watermark and/or a 
security thread.
    2. Methods to allow alterations to be visible to the naked eye.
    (a) Erasure Sensitive Background Inks--a process whereby the text is 
printed in a dark color ink over a fine line erasure-sensitive prismatic

[58 FR 12550, Mar. 5, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 582.5  Information form.

    The information made available pursuant to Sec. 582.4 shall be 
presented in writing in the English language and in not less than 10-
point type. It shall be presented in the format set forth below, and 
shall include the complete explanatory text and the updated data 
published annually by NHTSA.

                       MARCH [YEAR TO BE INSERTED]

COMPARISON OF DIFFERENCES IN INSURANCE COSTS FOR PASSENGER CARS, STATION 
  WAGONS/PASSENGER VANS, PICKUPS AND UTILITY VEHICLES ON THE BASIS OF 
                          DAMAGE SUSCEPTIBILITY

    The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has 
provided the information in this booklet in compliance with Federal law 
as an aid to consumers considering the purchase of a new vehicle. The 
booklet compares differences in insurance costs for different makes and 
models of passenger cars, station wagons/passenger vans, pickups, and 
utility vehicles on the basis of damage susceptibility. However, it does 
not indicate a vehicle's relative safety.
    The following table contains the best available information 
regarding the effect of damage susceptibility on insurance premiums. It 
was taken from data compiled by the Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI) 
in

[[Page 769]]

its December [YEAR TO BE INSERTED] Insurance Collision Report, and 
reflects the collision loss experience of passenger cars, utility 
vehicles, light trucks, and vans sold in the United States in terms of 
the average loss payment per insured vehicle year for [THREE APPROPRIATE 
YEARS TO BE INSERTED]. NHTSA has not verified the data in this table.
    The table represents vehicles' collision loss experience in relative 
terms, with 100 representing the average for all passenger vehicles. 
Thus, a rating of 122 reflects a collision loss experience that is 22 
percent higher (worse) than average, while a rating of 96 reflects a 
collision loss experience that is 4 percent lower (better) than average. 
The table is not relevant for models that have been substantially 
redesigned for [YEAR TO BE INSERTED], and it does not include 
information about models without enough claim experience.
    Although many insurance companies use the HLDI information to adjust 
the ``base rate'' for the collision portion of their insurance premiums, 
the amount of any such adjustment is usually small. It is unlikely that 
your total premium will vary more than ten percent depending upon the 
collision loss experience of a particular vehicle.
    If you do not purchase collision coverage or your insurance company 
does not use the HLDI information, your premium will not vary at all in 
relation to these rankings.
    In addition, different insurance companies often charge different 
premiums for the same driver and vehicle. Therefore, you should contact 
insurance companies or their agents directly to determine the actual 
premium that you will be charged for insuring a particular vehicle.

    Please Note: In setting insurance premiums, insurance companies 
mainly rely on factors that are not directly related to the vehicle 
itself (except for its value). Rather, they mainly consider driver 
characteristics (such as age, gender, marital status, and driving 
record), the geographic area in which the vehicle is driven, how many 
miles are traveled, and how the vehicle is used. Therefore, to obtain 
complete information about insurance premiums, you should contact 
insurance companies or their agents directly.
    Insurance companies do not generally adjust their premiums on the 
basis of data reflecting the crashworthiness of different vehicles. 
However, some companies adjust their premiums for personal injury 
protection and medical payments coverage if the insured vehicle has 
features that are likely to improve its crashworthiness, such as air 
bags and automatic seat belts.
    Test data relating to vehicle crashworthiness are available from 
NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). NCAP test results demonstrate 
relative frontal crash protection in new vehicles. Information on 
vehicles that NHTSA has tested in the NCAP program can be obtained by 
calling the agency's toll-free Auto Safety Hotline at (800) 424-9393.

Safety Administration]

Sec. 583.1  Scope.

    This part establishes requirements for the disclosure of information 
relating to the countries of origin of the equipment of new passenger 
motor vehicles.


<R05>
Sec. 583.2  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to aid potential purchasers in the 
selection of

[[Page 770]]

new passenger motor vehicles by providing them with information about 
the value of the U.S./Canadian and foreign parts content of each 
vehicle, the countries of origin of the engine and transmission, and the 
site of the vehicle's final assembly.


<R05>
Sec. 583.3  Applicability.

    This part applies to manufacturers of new passenger motor vehicles 
manufactured or imported for sale in the United States, suppliers of 
passenger motor vehicle equipment, and dealers of new passenger motor 
vehicles.


<R05>
Sec. 583.4  Definitions.

    (a) Statutory terms. The terms allied supplier, carline, country of 
origin, dealer, foreign content, manufacturer, new passenger motor 
vehicle, of U.S./Canadian origin, outside supplier, passenger motor 
vehicle, passenger motor vehicle equipment, percentage (by value), 
State, and value added in the United States and Canada, defined in 49 
U.S.C. 32304(a), are used in accordance with their statutory meanings 
except as further defined in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Other terms and further definitions.
    (1) Administrator means the Administrator of the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration.
    (2) Allied supplier means a supplier of passenger motor vehicle 
equipment that is wholly owned by the manufacturer, or in the case of a 
joint venture vehicle assembly arrangement, any supplier that is wholly 
owned by one member of the joint venture arrangement. A supplier is 
considered to be wholly owned by the manufacturer if a common parent 
company owns both the manufacturer and the supplier, or if a group of 
related companies own both the manufacturer and the supplier and no 
outside interests (interests other than the manufacturer itself or 
companies which own the manufacturer) own the supplier.
    (3) Carline means a name denoting a group of vehicles which has a 
degree of commonality in construction (e.g., body, chassis). Carline 
does not consider any level of decor or opulence and is not generally 
distinguished by such characteristics as roof line, number of doors, 
seats, or windows, except for light duty trucks. Carline is not 
distinguished by country of manufacture, final assembly point, engine 
type, or driveline. Light duty trucks are considered to be different 
carlines than passenger cars. A carline includes all motor vehicles of a 
given nameplate. Special purpose vehicles, vans, and pickup trucks are 
classified as separate carlines.
    (4) Final assembly means all operations involved in the assembly of 
a vehicle, performed at the final assembly point including but not 
limited to assembly of body panels, painting, final chassis assembly, 
trim installation, except engine and transmission fabrication and 
assembly and the fabrication of motor vehicle equipment components 
produced at the same final assembly point using forming processes such 
as stamping, machining or molding processes.
    (5) Final assembly point means the plant, factory, or other place, 
which is a building or series of buildings in close proximity, where a 
new passenger motor vehicle is produced or assembled from passenger 
motor vehicle equipment and from which such vehicle is delivered to a 
dealer or importer in such a condition that all component parts 
necessary to the mechanical operation of such automobile are included 
with such vehicle whether or not such component parts are permanently 
installed in or on such vehicle. For multi-stage vehicles, the final 
assembly point is the location where the first stage vehicle is 
assembled.
    (6) Outside supplier means:
    (i) A non-allied supplier of passenger motor vehicle equipment to a 
manufacturer's allied supplier and
    (ii) Anyone other than an allied supplier who ships directly to the 
manufacturer's final assembly point.
    (7) Passenger motor vehicle equipment means any system, subassembly, 
or component received at the final assembly point for installation on, 
or attachment to, such vehicle at the time of its initial shipment by 
the manufacturer to a dealer for sale to an ultimate purchaser except: 
Nuts, bolts, clips, screws, pins, braces, gasoline, oil, blackout, 
phosphate rinse, windshield washer fluid, fasteners, tire assembly 
fluid, rivets, adhesives, grommets, and

[[Page 771]]

wheel weights. Passenger motor vehicle equipment also includes any 
system, subassembly, or component received by an allied supplier from an 
outside supplier for incorporation into equipment supplied by the allied 
supplier to the manufacturer with which it is allied.
    (8) Person means an individual, partnership, corporation, business 
trust, or any organized group of persons.
    (9) Ultimate purchaser means with respect to any new passenger motor 
vehicle, the first person, other than a dealer purchasing in its 
capacity as a dealer, who in good faith purchases such new passenger 
motor vehicle for purposes other than resale.


<R05>
Sec. 583.5  Label requirements.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, 
each manufacturer of new passenger motor vehicles shall cause to be 
affixed to each passenger motor vehicle manufactured on or after October 
1, 1994, a label that provides the following information:
    (1) U.S./Canadian parts content. The overall percentage, by value, 
of the passenger motor vehicle equipment that was installed on vehicles

countries other than the United States and Canada which contributed at 
least 15 percent of the average overall percentage, by value, of the 
passenger motor vehicle equipment installed on vehicles within the 
carline of which the vehicle is part, and the percentages attributable 
to each such country (if there are more than two such countries, the 
manufacturer need only provide the information for the two countries 
with the highest percentages; the procedure for determining major 
foreign sources of passenger motor vehicle equipment is set forth in 
Sec. 583.7);

<R05>
Sec. 583.6  Procedure for determining U.S./Canadian parts content.

    (a) Each manufacturer, except as specified in Sec. 583.5(f) and (g), 
shall determine the percentage U.S./Canadian Parts Content for each 
carline on a model year basis, before the beginning of each model year. 
Items of equipment produced at the final assembly point (but not as part 
of final assembly) are treated in the same manner as if they were 
supplied by an allied supplier. All value otherwise added at the final 
assembly point and beyond, including all final assembly costs, are 
excluded from the calculation of U.S./Canadian parts content.
    (b) Determining the value of items of equipment.
    (1) For items of equipment received at the final assembly point, the 
value is the price paid by the manufacturer for the equipment as 
delivered to the final assembly point.
    (2) For items of equipment produced at the final assembly point (but 
not as part of final assembly), the value is the fair market price that 
a manufacturer of similar size and location would pay a supplier for 
such equipment.
    (3) For items of equipment received at the factory or plant of an 
allied supplier, the value is the price paid by the allied supplier for 
the equipment as delivered to its factory or plant.
    (c) Determining the U.S./Canadian percentage of the value of items 
of equipment.
    (1) Equipment supplied by an outside supplier to a manufacturer or 
allied supplier is considered:
    (i) 100 percent U.S./Canadian, if 70 percent or more of its value is 
added in the United States and/or Canada; and
    (ii) 0 percent U.S./Canadian, if less than 70 percent of its value 
is added in the United States and/or Canada.
    (2) The extent to which an item of equipment supplied by an allied 
supplier is considered U.S./Canadian is determined by dividing the value 
added in the United States and/or Canada by the total value of the 
equipment. The resulting number is multiplied by 100 to determine the 
percentage U.S./Canadian content of the equipment.
    (3) In determining the value added in the United States and/or 
Canada of equipment supplied by an allied supplier, any equipment that 
is delivered to the allied supplier by an outside supplier and is 
incorporated into the allied supplier's equipment, is considered:
    (i) 100 percent U.S./Canadian, if at least 70 percent of its value 
is added in the United States and/or Canada; and
    (ii) 0 percent U.S./Canadian, if less than 70 percent of its value 
is added in the United States and/or Canada.
    (4)(i) Value added in the United States and/or Canada by an allied 
supplier or outside supplier includes--
    (A) The value added in the U.S. and/or Canada for materials used by 
the supplier, determined according to (4)(ii) for outside suppliers and 
(4)(iii) for allied suppliers, plus,
    (B) For passenger motor vehicle equipment assembled or produced in 
the U.S. or Canada, the value of the difference between the price paid 
by the manufacturer or allied supplier for the equipment, as delivered 
to its factory or plant, and the total value of the materials in the 
equipment.
    (ii) Outside suppliers of passenger motor vehicle equipment will 
determine the value added in the U.S. and/or

[[Page 774]]

Canada for materials in the equipment as specified in paragraphs (A) and 
(B).
    (A)(1) For any material used by the supplier which was produced or 
assembled in the U.S. or Canada, the supplier will subtract from the 
total value of the material any value that was not added in the U.S. 
and/or Canada. The determination of the value that was not added in the 
U.S. and/or Canada shall be a good faith estimate based on information 
that is available to the supplier, e.g., information in its records, 
information it can obtain from its suppliers, the supplier's knowledge 
of manufacturing processes, etc.
    (2) The supplier shall consider the amount of value added and the 
location in which that value was added--
    (i) At each earlier stage, counting from the time of receipt of a 
material by the supplier, back to and including the two closest stages 
each of which represented a substantial transformation into a new and 
different product with a different name, character and use.
    (ii) The value of materials used to produce a product in the 
earliest of these two substantial transformation stages shall be treated 
as value added in the country in which that stage occurred.
    (B) For any material used by the supplier which was imported into 
the United States or Canada from a third country, the value added in the 
United States and/or Canada is presumed to be zero. However, if 
documentation is available to the supplier which identifies value added 
in the United States and/or Canada for that material (determined 
according to the principles set forth in (A), such value added in the 
United States and/or Canada is counted.
    (iii) Allied suppliers of passenger motor vehicle equipment shall 
determine the value that is added in the U.S. and/or Canada for 
materials in the equipment in accordance with (c)(3).
    (iv) For the minor items listed in the Sec. 583.4 definition of 
``passenger motor vehicle equipment'' as being excluded from that term, 
outside and allied suppliers may, to the extent that they incorporate 
such items into their equipment, treat the cost of the minor items as 
value added in the country of assembly.
    (v) For passenger motor vehicle equipment which is imported into the 
territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada from a third 
country, the value added in the United States and/or Canada is presumed 
to be zero. However, if documentation is available to the supplier which 
identifies value added in the United States and/or Canada for that 
equipment (determined according to the principles set forth in the rest 
of (c)(4)), such value added in the United States and/or Canada is 
counted.
    (vi) The payment of duty does not result in value added in the 
United States and/or Canada.
    (5) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, if a 
manufacturer or allied supplier does not receive information from one or 
more of its suppliers concerning the U.S./Canadian content of particular 
equipment, the U.S./Canadian content of that equipment is considered 
zero. This provision does not affect the obligation of manufacturers and 
allied suppliers to request this information from their suppliers or the 
obligation of the suppliers to provide the information.
    (6) For carlines which are first offered for sale to ultimate 
purchasers before January 1, 1999, if a manufacturer or allied supplier 
requests information in a timely manner from one or more of its outside 
suppliers concerning the U.S./Canadian content of particular equipment, 
but does not receive that information despite a good faith effort to 
obtain it, the manufacturer or allied supplier may make its own good 
faith value added determinations, subject to the following provisions:
    (i) The manufacturer or allied supplier shall make the same value 
added determinations as would be made by the outside supplier, i.e., 
whether 70 percent or more of the value of equipment is added in the 
United States and/or Canada;
    (ii) The manufacturer or allied supplier shall consider the amount 
of value added and the location in which the value was added for all of 
the stages that the outside supplier would be required to consider;

[[Page 775]]

    (iii) The manufacturer or allied supplier may determine that the 
value added in the United States and/or Canada is 70 percent or more 
only if it has a good faith basis to make that determination;
    (iv) A manufacturer and its allied suppliers may, on a combined 
basis, make value added determinations for no more than 10 percent, by 
value, of a carline's total parts content from outside suppliers;
    (v) Value added determinations made by a manufacturer or allied 
supplier under this paragraph shall have the same effect as if they were 
made by the outside supplier;
    (vi) This provision does not affect the obligation of outside 
suppliers to provide the requested information.
    (d) Determination of the U.S./Canadian percentage of the total value 
of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment. The percentage of the 
value of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment that is U.S./
Canadian is determined by--
    (1) Adding the total value of all of the equipment (regardless of 
country of origin) expected to be installed in that carline during the 
next model year;
    (2) Dividing the value of the U.S./Canadian content of such 
equipment by the amount calculated in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 
and
    (3) Multiplying the resulting number by 100.
    (e) Alternative calculation procedures.
    (1) A manufacturer may submit a petition to use calculation 
procedures based on representative or statistical sampling, as an 
alternative to the calculation procedures specified in this section to 
determine U.S./Canadian parts content and major sources of foreign parts 
content.
    (2) Each petition must--
    (i) Be submitted at least 120 days before the manufacturer would use 
the alternative procedure;
    (ii) Be written in the English language;
    (iii) Be submitted in three copies to: Administrator, National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., 
Washington, DC 20590;
    (iv) State the full name and address of the manufacturer;
    (v) Set forth in full the data, views and arguments of the 
manufacturer that would support granting the petition, including--
    (A) the alternative procedure, and
    (B) analysis demonstrating that the alternative procedure will 
produce substantially equivalent results to the procedure set forth in 
this section;
    (vi) Specify and segregate any part of the information and data 
submitted in the petition that is requested to be withheld from public 
disclosure in accordance with part 512 of this chapter (the basic 
alternative procedure and basic supporting analysis must be provided as 
public information, but confidential business information may also be 
used in support of the petition).
    (3) The NHTSA publishes in the Federal Register, affording 
opportunity for comment, a notice of each petition containing the 
information required by this part. A copy of the petition is placed in 
the public docket. However, if NHTSA finds that a petition does not 
contain the information required by this part, it so informs the 
petitioner, pointing out the areas of insufficiency and stating that the 
petition will not receive further consideration until the required 
information is submitted.
    (4) If the Administrator determines that the petition does not 
contain adequate justification, he or she denies it and notifies the 
petitioner in writing, explaining the reasons for the denial. A copy of 
the letter is placed in the public docket.
    (5) If the Administrator determines that the petition contains 
adequate justification, he or she grants it, and notifies the petitioner 
in writing. A copy of the letter is placed in the public docket.
    (6) The Administrator may attach such conditions as he or she deems 
appropriate to a grant of a petition, which the manufacturer must follow 
in order to use the alternative procedure.

Sec. 583.7  Procedure for determining major foreign sources of passenger motor vehicle equipment.

    (a) Each manufacturer, except as specified in Sec. 583.5 (f) and 
(g), shall determine the countries, if any, which are major foreign 
sources of passenger motor vehicle equipment and the percentages 
attributable to each such country for each carline on a model year 
basis, before the beginning of each model year. The manufacturer need 
only determine this information for the two such countries with the 
highest percentages. Items of equipment produced at the final assembly 
point (but not as part of final assembly) are treated in the same manner 
as if they were supplied by an allied supplier. In making determinations 
under this section, the U.S. and Canada are treated together as if they 
were one (non-foreign) country.
    (b) Determining the value of items of equipment. The value of each 
item of equipment is determined in the manner specified in 
Sec. 583.6(b).
    (c) Determining the country of origin of items of equipment.
    (1) Except as provided in (c)(2), the country of origin of each item 
is the country which contributes the greatest amount of value added to 
that item (treating the U.S. and Canada together).
    (2) Instead of making country of origin determinations in the manner 
specified in (c)(1), a manufacturer may, at its option, use any other 
methodology that is used for customs purposes (U.S. or foreign), so long 
as a consistent methodology is employed for all items of equipment, and 
the U.S. and Canada are treated together.
    (d) Determination of the percentage of the total value of a 
carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment which is attributable to 
individual countries other than the U.S. and Canada. The percentage of 
the value of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment that is 
attributable to each country other than the U.S. and Canada is 
determined on a model year basis by--
    (1) Adding up the total value of all of the passenger motor vehicle 
equipment (regardless of country of origin) expected to be installed in 
that carline during the next model year;
    (2) Adding up the value of such equipment which originated in each 
country other than the U.S. or Canada;
    (3) Dividing the amount calculated in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section for each country by the amount calculated in paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section, and multiplying each result by 100.
    (e) A country is a major foreign source of passenger motor vehicle 
equipment for a carline only if the country is one other than the U.S. 
or Canada and if 15 or more percent of the total value of the carline's 
passenger motor vehicle equipment is attributable to the country.
    (f) In determining the percentage of the total value of a carline's 
passenger motor vehicle equipment which is attributable to individual 
countries other than the U.S. and Canada, no value which is counted as 
U.S./Canadian parts content is also counted as being value which 
originated in a country other than the U.S. or Canada.

Sec. 583.8  Procedure for determining country of origin for engines and transmissions (for purposes of determining the information specified by 
          Secs. 583.5(a)(4) and 583.5(a)(5) only).

    (a) Each supplier of an engine or transmission shall determine the 
country of origin once a year for each engine and transmission. The 
origin of engines shall be calculated for engines of the same 
displacement produced at the same plant. The origin for transmissions 
shall be calculated for transmissions of the same type produced at the 
same plant. Transmissions are of the same type if they have the same 
attributes including: Drive line application, number of forward gears, 
controls, and layout. The U.S. and Canada are treated separately in 
making such determination.
    (b) The value of an engine or transmission is determined by adding 
up the prices paid by the manufacturer of the engine/transmission for 
each component comprising the engine/ transmission, as delivered to the 
assembly plant of the engine/transmission, and the fair market value of 
each individual part produced at the plant. All

[[Page 777]]

value added at the engine/transmission plant is otherwise excluded from 
the calculation of origin. Individual parts refers to the most basic 
level of parts used to assemble an engine or transmission and not

    (e) A decision to mitigate a forfeiture upon condition that a stated 
amount is paid shall be effective for not more than 60 days from the 
date of notice to the petitioner of such decision. If payment of the 
stated amount is not made,

preparing the application, and the name, address, and telephone number 
of the person for whom application is made.

shareholders, partners, or sole proprietors, of the person for whom 
application is made.
    (5) If any of the owners listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section 
are corporations, sets forth the names of all shareholders of such 
corporation whose ownership interest is 10 percent or greater.
    (6) Contains a statement that the applicant has never had a

directly or indirectly, owned or controlled by, or under common 
ownership or control with, a person who has had a registration revoked 
pursuant to Sec. 592.7.
    (7) Contains a certified check payable to the Treasurer of the 
United States, for the amount of the initial annual fee

[[Page 803]]

established pursuant to part 594 of this chapter.
    (8) Contains a copy of a contract to acquire, effective upon its 
registration as an importer, a prepaid mandatory service insurance 
policy underwritten by an independent insurance company, or a copy of 
such policy, in an amount that equals $2,000 for each motor vehicle for 
which the applicant will furnish a certificate of conformity to the 
Administrator, for the purpose of ensuring that the applicant will be 
able financially to remedy any noncompliance or safety related defect 
determined to exist in any such motor vehicle in accordance with part 
573 and part 577 of this chapter. If the application is accompanied by a 
copy of a contract to acquire such a policy, the applicant shall provide 
NHTSA with a copy of the policy within 10 days after it has been issued 
to the applicant.
    (9) Sets forth in full data, views, and arguments of the applicant 
sufficient to establish that the applicant will be able, through a 
records system of acquiring and maintaining names and addresses of 
owners of vehicles for which it furnishes a certificate of conformity, 
and Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) of such vehicles, to notify 
such owners that a noncompliance or safety related defect exists in such 
vehicles, and that it will be financially able to remedy a noncompliance 
or safety related defect through repurchase or replacement of such 
vehicles, or technically able through repair of such vehicles, in 
accordance with part 573 and part 577 of this chapter.

    (b) If the information submitted is incomplete, the Administrator 
notifies the applicant of the areas of insufficiency, and that the 
application is in abeyance.
    (c) If the Administrator deems it necessary for a determination upon 
the application, NHTSA conducts an inspection of the applicant. 
Subsequent to the inspection, NHTSA calculates the costs attributable to 
such inspection, and notifies the applicant in writing that such costs 
comprise a component of the initial annual fee and must be paid before a 
determination is made upon its application.
    (d) When the application is complete (and, if applicable, when a sum 
representing the inspection component of the initial annual fee is 
paid), it is reviewed and a determination made whether the applicant 
should be granted the status of Registered Importer. Such determination 
may be based, in part, upon an inspection by NHTSA of the conformance, 
storage, and recordkeeping facilities of the applicant. If the 
Administrator determines that the application is acceptable, (s)he 
informs the applicant in writing that its application is approved, and 
issues it a Registered Importer Number. If the information is not 
acceptable, the Administration informs the applicant in writing that its 
application is not approved. No refund is made of those components of 
the initial annual fee representing the costs of processing the 
application, and conducting an inspection. Refund is made of that 
component of the initial annual fee representing the remaining costs of 
administration of the registration program.
    (e) In order to maintain its registration, a Registered Importer 
shall provide an annual statement that affirms that all information 
provided under paragraphs (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), (a)(9), and (a)(11) of 
this section remains correct, and that includes a current copy of its 
insurance policy procured pursuant to paragraph (a)(8) of this section. 
Such statement shall be titled ``Yearly Statement of Registered

Sec. 592.6  Duties of a registered importer.

    Each Registered Importer shall:
    (a) With respect to each motor vehicle that it imports into the 
United States, furnish to the Secretary of the Treasury (acting on 
behalf of the Administrator) a bond in an amount equal to 150 per cent 
of the entered value of the vehicle, as determined by the Secretary of 
the Treasury, to ensure that such vehicle either will be brought into 
conformity with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards 
prescribed under part 571 of this chapter within 120 calendar days after 
such importation, or will be exported (at no cost to the United States) 
by the importer or the Secretary of the Treasury, or abandoned to the 
United States. However, if the Registered Importer has procured a 
continuous entry bond, it shall furnish the Administrator with such 
bond, and shall furnish the Secretary of the Treasury (acting on behalf 
of the Administrator) with a photocopy of such bond and Customs Form CF 
7501 at the time of importation of each motor vehicle.
    (b) Establish, maintain, and retain for 8 years from the date of 
entry of any nonconforming vehicle for which it furnishes a certificate 
of conformity pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, organized 
records, correspondence and other documents relating to the importation, 
modification, and substantiation of certification of conformity to the 
Administrator, including but not limited to:
    (1) The declaration required by Sec. 591.5 of this chapter, and 19 
CFR 12.80.
    (2) All vehicle or equipment purchase or sales orders or agreements, 
conformance agreements with importers other than Registered Importers, 
and correspondence between the Registered Importer and the owner or 
purchaser of each vehicle for which it has furnished a certificate of 
conformity.
    (3) The last known name and address of the owner or purchaser of 
each motor vehicle for which it has furnished a certificate of 
conformity, and the VIN number of such vehicle.
    (4) Records, both photographic and documentary, reflecting the 
modifications made and submitted to the Administrator pursuant to 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (c) Records, both photographic and documentary, sufficient to 
substantiate each subsequent certificate furnished to the Administrator 
for a vehicle of the same model and model year for which documentation 
has been furnished NHTSA in support of the initial certificate.
    (d) Permanently affix to each motor vehicle, upon completion of 
modifications, a label that meets the requirements of Sec. 567.4 of this 
chapter, which identifies the Registered Importer, and provide to the 
Administrator a photocopy of the label attesting that such vehicle has 
been brought into conformity with all applicable Federal motor vehicle 
safety and bumper standards.
    (e) Certify to the Administrator, upon completion of modifications, 
that the vehicle has been brought into conformity with all applicable 
Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards, and that it is the 
person legally responsible for bringing the vehicle into conformity.
    (f) In substantiation of the initial certification provided for a 
specific model and model year, submit to the Administrator photographic 
and documentary evidence of conformance with each applicable Federal 
motor vehicle safety and bumper standard, and with respect to subsequent 
certifications of such model and model year, such information, if any, 
as the Administrator may request.
    (g) With respect to any motor vehicle for which it has furnished a 
certificate of conformity to the Administrator, provide notification and 
remedy according to part 573 and part 577 of this chapter, under any 
determination.

[[Page 805]]

    (1) That a vehicle to which it is substantially similar, as 
determined under part 593 of this chapter, incorporates a safety related 
defect or fails to conform with an applicable Federal motor vehicle 
safety standard. However, this obligation does not exist if the 
manufacturer of the vehicle or Registered Importer demonstrates to the 
Administrator that the defect or noncompliance is not present in such 
vehicle.
    (2) That the vehicle incorporates a safety related defect or fails 
to conform with an applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standard, 
without reference to whether such may exist in a vehicle to which it is 
substantially similar, or whether such exists because it was created by 
the original manufacturer or by the Registered Importer.
    (i) The requirement of 49 U.S.C. 30120 that remedy shall be provided 
without charge shall not apply if the noncompliance or safety related 
defect exists in a motor vehicle whose first sale after importation 
occurred more than 8 calendar years before notification respecting the 
failure to comply is furnished pursuant to part 577 of this chapter, 
except that if a safety related defect exists and is attributable to the 
original manufacturer and not the Registered Importer, the requirements 
of 49 U.S.C. 30120 shall not apply to a motor vehicle whose date of 
first purchase, if known, or if not known, whose date of manufacture as 
determined by the Administrator, is more than 8 years from the date on 
which notification is furnished pursuant to part 577 of this chapter.
    (ii) Notification furnished pursuant to this paragraph and part 577 
of this chapter shall include the statement that in the absence of the 
Registered Importer's facility being within 50 miles of the owner's 
mailing address for performance of repairs, such repairs may be 
performed at a specific facility designated by the Registered Importer 
within 50 miles, or, if no such facility is designated, anywhere, and 
shall also include an explanation how repair is to be accomplished 
without charge to the vehicle owner.
    (h) In order to allow the Administrator to determine whether a 
Registered Importer is meeting its statutory responsibilities, admit 
representatives of NHTSA during operating hours, upon demand, and upon 
presentation of credentials, to copy documents, or to inspect, monitor, 
or photograph any of the following:
    (1) Any facility where any vehicle, for which a Registered Importer 
has the responsibility of providing a certificate of conformity to 
applicable safety standards, is being modified, tested, or stored;
    (2) Any facility where any record or other document relating to 
modification, testing, or storage of vehicles being conformed, is filed;
    (3) Any part or aspect of activities relating to the modification, 
testing, and/or storage of vehicles by the Registered Importer.
    (4) Any motor vehicle for which it has provided a certification of 
conformity to the Administrator, and which remains in its custody or 
under its control.
    (i) Maintain in effect a prepaid mandatory service insurance policy 
underwritten by an independent insurance company as a guarantor of its 
performance under paragraph (g) of this section.
    (j) With respect to any motor vehicle it has imported and for which 
it has furnished a performance bond, to deliver such vehicle to the 
Secretary of the Treasury for export, or to abandon it to the United 
States, upon demand by the Administrator if such vehicle has not been 
brought into conformity with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety 
standards.

Sec. 592.7  Revocation, suspension and reinstatement of registration.

    (a) If the Administrator has not received any fee assessed and owing 
by the end of the 30th calendar day after such fee is due and payable, a 
registration is automatically suspended at the beginning of the 31st 
calendar day, and the Registered Importer is immediately notified in 
writing of the suspension at the address contained in its most recent 
annual statement or amendment thereof.

[[Page 806]]

    (b) If the Administrator has reason to believe that a Registered 
Importer has knowingly filed a false or misleading certification, and 
that its registration should be automatically suspended or revoked, 
(s)he notifies the Registered Importer in writing of the facts giving 
rise to such reason to believe, affording an opportunity to present 
data, views, and arguments, either in writing or in person, within 30 
calendar days after receipt of the Administrator's letter, as to whether 
it has submitted false or misleading certification, and as to why the 
registration ought not to be revoked or suspended. The Administrator 
then makes a decision after the 30-day period on the basis of all 
information then available. If, after consideration of all the data 
available, the Administrator determines that the Registered Importer has 
knowingly filed a false or misleading certification, the registration is 
automatically suspended or revoked, and the Registered Importer notified 
in writing. Any suspension or revocation is effective as of the date of 
the Administrator's determination. The Administrator shall state the 
period of any suspension in the notice to the Registered Importer.
    (c) The Administrator may suspend a registration if a Registered 
Importer fails to comply with any requirement set forth in 49 U.S.C. 
30141(c), Sec. 592.5(c), or Sec. 592.6, or if (s)he denies an 
application filed under Sec. 592.5(d). The Administrator may revoke a 
registration after any failure to comply with any such requirement, or 
if (s)he denies an application filed under Sec. 592.5(d). If the 
Administrator has reason to believe that there has been such a failure 
to comply and that the Registered Importer's registration should be 
revoked or suspended, (s)he notifies the Registered Importer in writing, 
affording an opportunity to present data, views, and arguments, either 
in writing or in person, within 30 calendar days after receipt of the 
Administrator's letter, as to whether there has been a failure to comply 
and as to why the registration ought not to be revoked or suspended. The 
Administrator then makes a decision after the 30-day period on the basis 
of all information then available. If the Administrator determines that 
a registration should be revoked or suspended, (s)he notifies the 
Registered Importer in writing. A revocation is effective immediately. A 
suspension is effective beginning with a date specified in the written 
notification.
    (d) A Registered Importer whose registration has been revoked or 
suspended may request reconsideration of the revocation or suspension if 
the request is supported by factual matter which was not available to 
the Administrator at the time the registration was suspended or revoked.
    (e) If its registration has been revoked, a Registered Importer is 
ineligible to apply for reregistration under this part. No refund is 
provided of any annual or other fees the Registered Importer has paid 
for the fiscal year in which its registration is revoked. If its 
registration has been suspended, it may file an application for 
reinstatement of its registration.
    (f) The Administrator shall reinstate a suspended registration if 
the cause that led to the suspension no longer exists, as determined by 
the Administrator, either upon the Administrator's motion, or upon the 
submission of further information or fees by the Registered Importer.

<R05>
Sec. 592.8  Inspection; release of vehicle and bond.

    (a) With respect to any motor vehicle for which it is obligated to 
provide a certificate of conformity to the Administrator as required by 
Sec. 592.6(d), a Registered Importer shall not obtain licensing or 
registration of the motor vehicle for use on the public roads, or 
release custody of it for such licensing and registration, except in 
accordance with the provisions of this section.
    (b) When conformance modifications to a motor vehicle have been 
completed, a Registered Importer shall submit the certification required 
by Sec. 592.6(d) to the Administrator. In certifying a vehicle that the 
Administrator has determined to be substantially similar to one that has 
been certified by its original manufacturer for sale in the United 
States, the Registered Importer may rely on any certification by the 
original manufacturer

[[Page 807]]

with respect to identical safety features if it also certifies that any 
modification that it undertook did not affect the compliance of such 
safety features. Each submission shall be mailed by certified mail, 
return receipt requested, or by private carriers such as Federal 
Express, to: Administrator, National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration, Room 6115, 400 7th Street SW., Washington, DC, 20590, 
Attn: NEF-32, or be submitted electronically by FAX (202-366-1024), or 
in person. Each submission shall identify the location where the vehicle 
will be stored and is available for inspection, pending NHTSA action 
upon the submission.
    (c) Before the end of the 30th calendar day after receipt of 
certification of a motor vehicle pursuant to Sec. 592.6(d), the 
Administrator may inform the Registered Importer in writing that an 
inspection of the vehicle is required to ascertain the veracity of the 
certification. Written notice includes a proposed inspection date, which 
is as soon as practicable. If inspection of the vehicle indicates that 
the vehicle has been properly certified, at the conclusion of the 
inspection the Registered Importer is provided an instrument of release. 
If inspection of the vehicle shows that the vehicle has not been 
properly certified, the Registered Importer shall either make the 
modifications necessary to substantiate its certification, and provide a 
new certification for the standard(s) in the manner provided for in 
paragraph (b) of this section, or deliver the vehicle to the Secretary 
of the Treasury for export, or abandon it to the United States. Before 
the end of the 30th calendar day after receipt of new certification, the 
Administrator may require a further inspection in accordance with the 
provisions of this subsection.
    (d) The Administrator may by written notice request certification 
verification by the Registered Importer before the end of the 30th 
calendar day after the date the certification was received by the 
Administrator. If the basis for such request is that the certification 
is false or contains a misrepresentation, the Registered Importer shall 
be afforded an opportunity to present written data, views, and arguments 
as to why the certification is not false or misleading or does not 
contain a misrepresentation. The Administrator may require an inspection 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. The motor vehicle and 
performance bond involved shall not be released unless the Administrator 
is satisfied with the certification.
    (e) If a Registered Importer has received no written notice from the 
Administrator by the end of the 30th calendar day after it has furnished 
a certification to the Administrator, the Registered Importer may 
release from custody the vehicle that is covered by the certification, 
or have it licensed or registered for use on the public roads.
    (f) If the Administrator accepts a certification without requiring 
an inspection, (s)he notifies the Registered Importer in writing, and 
provides a copy to the importer of record. Such notification shall be 
provided not later than the 25th calendar day after the Administrator 
has received such certification.
    (g) Release of the performance bond shall constitute acceptance of 
certification or completion of inspection of the vehicle concerned, but 
shall not preclude a subsequent decision by the Administrator pursuant 
to 49 U.S.C. 30118 that the vehicle fails to conform to any applicable 
Federal motor vehicle safety standard.

 Appendix A to Part 593--List of Vehicles Determined To Be Eligible for 
                               Importation

    Editorial Note: At 62 FR 52267, Oct. 7, 1997, NHTSA/DOT published a 
document in the Federal Register revising Appendix A to part 593.

    Each vehicle on the following list is preceded by a vehicle 
eligibility number. The importer of a vehicle admissible under any 
eligibility decision must enter that number on the HS-7 Declaration Form 
accompanying entry to indicate that the vehicle is eligible for 
importation.
    ``VSA'' eligibility numbers are assigned to all vehicles that are 
decided to be eligible for importation on the initiative of the

where a formal agreement has been executed between the recipient and all 
private charter operators it has determined to be willing and able in 
accordance with this part, provided that:
    (i) The agreement specifically allows the recipient to provide the 
particular type of charter trip;
    (ii) The recipient has provided for such an agreement in its annual 
public charter notice published pursuant to this part before undertaking 
any charter service pursuant to this exception; and
    (iii) If a recipient has received several responses to its annual 
public charter notice but ceased its review process after determining 
that one private operator was willing and able, it must, before 
concluding a formal charter agreement under this section, complete the 
review process to ensure that all the willing and able private operators 
are valid parties to the agreement.
    (8) During the demonstration period described in paragraph 
(b)(8)(iv) of this section, recipients in the FTA-selected sites may 
submit applications to provide charter service to an advisory panel 
equally representative of public transit providers or local business 
organizations and local private operators, and which has either been 
created for such purpose by the grantee, the State Department of 
Transportation (State DOT), or metropolitan planning organization (MPO), 
or which is part of the recipient's existing private sector consultation 
process.
    (i) The advisory panel will forward these applications to the State 
DOT or MPO, which will grant those recommended by unanimous vote of the 
advisory panel.
    (ii) If the advisory panel does not unanimously endorse an 
application, the State DOT or MPO will make a decision to grant or deny 
the application based on the following criteria:
    (A) Cost evaluation. A recipient may provide charter service when it 
can do so at a significantly lower cost than can private charter 
operators. Cost differences may be considered significant when there is 
approximately a twenty percent difference between the average charge for 
service by private operators and the recipient's fully allocated cost of 
providing the service, or when the advisory panel determines them to be 
significant.
    (B) Equipment uniqueness. A recipient may provide charter service 
using equipment that is not available from a private source, when such 
equipment is essential to the purpose of the charter trip.
    (C) Service nature. A recipient may provide unscheduled or demand 
responsive service that could not be provided by a private operator 
without advance notice or at a substantial surcharge to the customer.
    (D) Specific local factors. A recipient may provide service which 
responds to a clear need that cannot be met by the

[[Page 830]]

local private sector, and which is important to the economic or social 
health and vitality of the local area.
    (iii) The State DOT or MPO may not grant applications to provide 
service that would jeopardize the economic vitality of individual 
private charter operators or would seriously detract from private 
charter business.
    (iv) The service described in this subsection may be provided only 
during the demonstration program to be conducted through October 31, 
1995, in the following sites:
    (A) Monterey, California;
    (B) Oklahoma City, Oklahoma;
    (C) St. Louis, Missouri;
    (D) Yolo County, California;
    (E) Four sites within the State of Michigan.
    (c) The process for requesting and granting an exception under 49 
CFR 604.9(b)(3):
    (1) The recipient must provide the private charter operators that it 
has determined are willing and able in accordance with this part with a 
written notice explaining why it is seeking an exception and state that 
they have at least 30 days to submit written comments to the recipient 
on the request;
    (2) The recipient must send a copy of the notice, all comments 
received, and any further information it desires in support of its 
request to the Chief Counsel.
    (3) The Chief Counsel shall review the materials submitted and issue 
a written decision denying or granting in whole or in part the request. 
In making this decision, the Chief Counsel may seek such additional 
information as the Chief Counsel determines is needed.
    (4) Any exception that the Chief Counsel grants under 49 CFR 
604.9(b)(3) shall be effective for not longer than 12 months from the 
date that the Chief Counsel grants it.
    (d) The process for requesting and granting and exception under 49 
CFR 604.9(b)(4):
    (1) The recipient must submit its petition for an exception to the 
Administrator at least 90 days prior to the day or days on which it 
desires to provide charter service.
    (2) The petition must describe the event, explain how it is special, 
and explain the amount of charter service which private charter 
operators are not capable of providing.
    (3) The Administrator will review the materials and issue a written 
decision denying or granting in whole or in part the request. In making 
this decision, the Administrator may seek such additional information as 
the Administrator determines is needed.
    (4) Any exception granted by the Administrator under 49 CFR 
604.9(b)(4) shall be effective solely for the event for which the 
recipient requests an exception.
    (e) Any charter service that a recipient provides under any of the 
exceptions in this part must be incidental charter service.

operator has the requisite legal authority to provide the proposed 
charter service and that it meets all necessary safety certification, 
licensing and other legal requirements to provide the proposed charter 
service.
    (6) Include a statement that the recipient shall review only that 
evidence submitted by the deadline, shall complete its review within 30 
days of the deadline, and within 60 days of the deadline shall inform 
each private operator that submitted evidence what the results of the 
review are.
    (7) Include a statement that the recipient shall not provide any 
charter service using equipment or facilities funded under the Acts to 
the extent that there is at least one willing and able private charter 
operator unless the recipient qualifies for one or more of the 
exceptions in 49 CFR 604.9(b).
    (d) Any recipient that desires to continue to provide charter 
service using FTA funded equipment or facilities shall follow the 
procedures in 49 CFR 604.11 (b) and (c) annually during the month in 
which it published its first newspaper notice to redetermine the extent 
to which there is at least one willing and able private charter 
operator.
    (e) Any recipient, including the State in State administered 
programs, may elect to comply with this procedure for all of its 
subrecipients, or delegate this responsibility to the subrecipients, or

evidence submitted by private charter operators when the recipient has 
determined that there is one or more private charter operators willing 
and able to provide all of the charter service that the recipient

evidence submitted by all private charter operators and create a roster 
of willing and able private charter operators.

Sec. 605.1  Purpose.

    (a) The purpose of this part is to prescribe policies and procedures 
to implement section 109(a) of the National Mass Transportation 
Assistance Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-503; November 26, 1974; 88 Stat. 
1565). Section 109(a) adds a new section 3(g) to the Federal Mass 
Transit Act of 1964, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1602(g)) and differs from 
section 164(b) of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973 (49 U.S.C. 
1602a(b)) in that section 3(g) applies to all grants for the 
construction or operation of mass transportation facilities and 
equipment under the Federal Mass Transit Act, and is not limited to 
grants for the purchase of buses as is section 164(b).
    (b) By the terms of section 3(g) no Federal financial assistance may 
be provided for the construction or operation of facilities and 
equipment for use in providing public mass transportation service to an 
applicant unless the applicant and the Administrator enter into an 
agreement that the applicant will not engage in school bus operations 
exclusively for the transportation of students and school personnel, in 
competition with private school bus operators.


<R05>
Sec. 605.2  Scope.

    These regulations apply to all recipients of financial assistance 
for the construction or operation of facilities and equipment for use in 
providing mass transportation under: (a) The Federal Mass Transit Act of 
1964, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.); (b) 23 U.S.C. 142 (a) and 
(c); and 23 U.S.C. 103 (e)(4).


<R05>
Sec. 605.3  Definitions.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided, terms defined in the Federal Mass 
Transit Act of 1964, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1604, 1608) are used in this 
part as so defined.
    (b) For purposes of this part--
    The Acts means the Federal Mass Transit Act of 1964, as amended (49 
U.S.C. 1601 et seq.); 23 U.S.C. 142 (a) and (c); and 23 U.S.C. 
103(e)(4).
    Administrator means the Federal Mass Transit Administrator or his 
designee.

[[Page 835]]

    Adequate transportation means transportation for students and school 
personnel which the Administrator determines conforms to applicable 
safety laws; is on time; poses a minimum of discipline problems; is not 
subject to fluctuating rates; and is operated efficiently and in harmony 
with state educational goals and programs.
    Agreement means a contractual agreement required under section 3(g) 
of the Federal Mass Transit Act of 1964, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1602(g)).
    Applicant means applicant for assistance under the Acts.
    Assistance means Federal financial assistance for the purchase of 
buses and the construction or operation of facilities and equipment for 
use in providing mass transportation services under the Acts, but does 
not include research, development and demonstration projects funded 
under the Acts.
    Grant contract means the contract between the Government and the 
grantee which states the terms and conditions for assistance under the 
Acts.
    Government means the Government of the United States of America.
    Grantee means a recipient of assistance under the Acts.
    Incidental means the transportation of school students, personnel 
and equipment in charter bus operations during off peak hours which does 
not interfere with regularly scheduled service to the public (as defined 
in the Opinion of the Comptroller General of the United States, B160204, 
December 7, 1966, which is attached as appendix A of this part).

vehicles as defined in Highway Safety Program Standard No. 17.
    Tripper service means regularly scheduled mass transportation 
service which is open to the public, and which is designed or modified 
to accommodate the needs of school students and personnel, using various 
fare collections or subsidy systems. Buses used in tripper service must 
be clearly marked as open to the public and may not carry designations 
such as ``school bus'' or ``school special''. These buses may stop only 
at a grantee or operator's regular service stop. All routes traveled by 
tripper buses must be within a grantee's or operator's regular route 
service as indicated in their published route schedules.
    Urban area means the entire area in which a local public body is 
authorized by appropriate local, State and Federal law to provide 
regularly scheduled mass transportation service. This includes all areas 
which are either: (a) Within an ``urbanized area'' as defined and fixed 
in accordance with 23 CFR part 470, subpart B; or (b) within an ``urban 
area'' or other built-up place as determined by the Secretary under 
section 12(c)(4) of the Federal Mass Transit Act of 1964, as amended (49 
U.S.C. 1608(c)(4)).


<R05>
Sec. 605.4  Public hearing requirement.

    Each applicant who engages or wishes to engage in school bus 
operations shall afford an adequate opportunity for the public to 
consider such operations at the time the applicant conducts public 
hearings to consider the economic, social or environmental effects of 
its requested Federal financial assistance under section 3(d) of the 
Federal Mass Transit Act of 1964, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1602(d)).

    A grantee or applicant may not engage in school bus operations in 
competition with private school bus operators unless it demonstrates to 
the satisfaction of the Administrator as follows:
    (a) That it operates a school system in its urban area and also 
operates a separate and exclusive school bus program for that school 
system; or
    (b) That private school bus operators in the urban area are unable 
to provide adequate transportation, at a reasonable rate, and in 
conformance with applicable safety standards; or
    (c) That it is a state or local public body or agency thereof (or a 
direct predecessor in interest which has acquired the function of so 
transporting schoolchildren and personnel along with facilities to be 
used therefor) who was so engaged in school bus operations:
    (1) In the case of a grant involving the purchase of buses--anytime 
during the 12-month period immediately prior to August 13, 1973.

<R05>
Sec. 605.12  Use of project equipment.

    No grantee or operator of project equipment shall engage in school 
bus operations using buses, facilities or equipment funded under the 
Acts. A grantee or operator may, however, use such buses, facilities and 
equipment for the transportation of school students, personnel and 
equipment in incidental charter bus operations. Such use of project 
equipment is subject to part 604 of Federal Mass Transit Regulations.


<R05>

                         Appendix A to Part 605

                                          Comptroller General of the    
                                                        United States,  
                                       Washington, DC, December 7, 1966.
    Dear Mr. Wilson: The enclosure with your letter of October 4, 1966, 
concerns the legality of providing a grant under the Federal Mass 
Transit Act of 1964 to the City of San Diego, (City), California. The 
problem involved arises in connection with the definition in subsection 
9(d)(5) of the Act, 49 U.S.C. 1608(d)(5), excluding charter or 
sightseeing service from the term ``mass transportation.''
    It appears from the enclosure with your letter that the City 
originally included in its grant application a request for funds to 
purchase 8 buses designed for charter service. Subsequently the City 
amended its application by deleting a request for a portion of the funds 
attributable to the charter bus coaches. However, in addition to the 8 
specially designed charter buses initially applied for, the City 
allegedly uses about 40 of its transit type buses to a substantial 
extent for charter-type services. In light of these factors surrounding 
the application by the City, the enclosure requests our opinion with 
regard to the legality of grants under the Act as it applies to certain 
matters (in effect questions), which are numbered and quoted below and 
answered in the order presented.
    Number one:
    ``The grant of funds to a City to purchase buses and equipment which 
are intended for substantial use in the general charter bus business as 
well as in the Mass Transportation type business.''
    The Federal Mass Transit Act of 1964 does not authorize grants to 
assist in the purchase of buses or other equipment for any service other 
than urban mass transportation service. Section 3(a) of the Act limits 
the range of eligible facilities and equipment to ``* * * buses and 
other rolling stock, and other real or personal property needed for an 
efficient and coordinated mass transportation system.'' In turn, ``mass 
transportation'' is defined, in section 9(d)(5) of the Act, specifically 
to exclude charter service. We are advised by the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development (HUD) that under these provisions, the Department 
has limited its grants to the purchase of buses of types suitable to 
meet the needs of the particular kind of urban mass transportation 
proposed to be furnished by the applicant.''
    HUD further advises that:
    ``One of the basic facts of urban mass transportation operations is 
that the need for rolling stock is far greater during the morning and 
evening rush hours on weekdays than at any other time. For that reason, 
any system which has sufficient rolling stock to meet the weekday rush-
hour needs of its customers must have a substantial amount of equipment 
standing idle at other times, as well as drivers and other personnel 
being paid when there is little for them to do. To relieve this 
inefficient and uneconomical situation, quite a number of cities have 
offered incidental charter service using this idle equipment and 
personnel during the hours when the same are not needed for regularly 
scheduled runs. Among the cities so doing are Cleveland, Pittsburgh, 
Alameda, Tacoma, Detroit and Dallas.
    ``Such service contributes to the success of urban mass 
transportation operations by bringing in additional revenues and 
providing full employment to drivers and other employees. It may in some 
cases even reduce the need for Federal capital grant assistance.
    ``We do not consider that there is any violation of either the 
letter or the spirit of the Act as a result of such incidental use of 
buses in charter service. To guard against

[[Page 840]]

abuses, every capital facilities grant contract made by this Department 
contains the following provisions:
    `` `Sec. 4. Use of Project Facilities and Equipment--The Public Body 
agrees that the Project facilities and equipment will be used for the 
provision of mass transportation service within its urban area for the 
period of the useful life of such facilities and equipment. . . . The 
Public Body further agrees that during the useful life of the Project 
facilities and equipment it will submit to HUD such financial statements 
and other data as may be deemed necessary to assure compliance with this 
Section.' ''
    It is our view that grants may be made to a city under section 3(a) 
of the Act to purchase buses needed by the city for an efficient and 
coordinated mass transportation system, even though the city may intend 
to use such buses for charter use when the buses are not needed on 
regularly scheduled runs (i.e. for mass transportation purposes) and 
would otherwise be idle.
    Number two:
    ``Whether a grant of such funds is proper if charter bus use is 
incidental to mass public transportation operations. If so, what is the 
definition of incidental use.''
    We are advised by HUD that under its legislative authority, it 
cannot and does not take charter service requirements into consideration 
in any way in evaluating the needs of a local mass transportation system 
for buses or other equipment.
    HUD further advises that:
    ``However, as indicated above, we are of the opinion that any lawful 
use of project equipment which does not detract from or interfere with 
the urban mass transportation service for which the equipment is needed 
would be deemed an incidental use of such equipment, and that such use 
of project equipment is entirely permissible under our legislation. What 
uses are in fact incidental, under this test, can be determined only on 
a case-by-case basis.''
    In view of what we stated above in answer to the first question, the 
first part of question two is answered in the affirmative.
    As to the second part of the question, in Security National 
Insurance Co. v. Secuoyah Marina, 246F.2d 830, ``incident'' is defined 
as meaning ``that which appertains to something else which is primary.'' 
Thus, we cannot say HUD's definition of incidental use as set forth 
above is unreasonable. Under the Act involved grants may be made to 
purchase buses only if the buses are needed for an efficient and 
coordinated mass transportation system. It would appear that if buses 
are purchased in order to meet this need, and are, in fact, used to meet 
such need, the use of such buses for charter service when not needed for 
mass transportation services would, in effect, be an ``incidental use,'' 
insofar as pertinent here. In our opinion such incidental use would not 
violate the provisions of the 1964 Act.
    Number three:
    ``The grant of funds for mass public transportation purposes to a 
City which has expressed an intent to engage in the general charter bus 
business when such funds would in effect constitute a subsidy to the 
City of its intended charter bus operations; i.e. freeing Municipal 
funds with which to purchase charter bus equipment.''
    Section 4(a) of the 1954 Act (49 U.S.C. 1603(a)) provides, in part, 
as follows:
    ``* * * The Administrator (now Secretary), on the basis of 
engineering studies, studies of economic feasibility, and data showing 
the nature and extent of expected utilization of the facilities and 
equipment, shall estimate what portion of the cost of a project to be 
assisted under section 1602 of this title cannot be reasonably financed 
from revenues--which portion shall hereinafter be called `net project 
cost'. The Federal grant for such a project shall not exceed two-thirds 
of the net project cost. The remainder of the net project cost shall be 
provided, in cash, from sources other than Federal funds * * *.''
    It is clear from the legislative history of the Act involved that 
the ``revenues'' to be considered are mass transportation system 
revenues including any revenues from incidental charter operations. 
There is nothing in the language of the Act which requires HUD to take 
into account the status of the general funds of an applicant city in 
determining how much capital grant assistance to extend to that city.
    It should be noted that in a sense nearly every capital grant to a 
city constitutes a partial subsidy of every activity of the city which 
is supported by tax revenues, since it frees tax revenues for such other 
uses.
    Number four:
    ``With specific reference to the application of the City of San 
Diego for funds under its application to the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development dated June 2, 1966, whether the Act permits a grant to 
purchase equipment wherein 25 percent of such equipment will be used 
either exclusively or substantially in the operation of charter bus 
services.''
    As to the City of San Diego's grant application, we have been 
advised by HUD as follows:
    ``As explained above, the Act authorizes assistance only for 
facilities to be used in mass transportation service. We could not, 
therefore, assist San Diego in purchasing any equipment to be used 
`exclusively' in the operation of charter bus service. Furthermore, as 
also explained above, assisted mass transportation equipment can be used 
only incidentally for such charter services.
    ``Whether equipment used `substantially' in such service qualifies 
under this rule can be answered only in the light of the specifics

[[Page 841]]

of the San Diego situation. * * * we have already, during our 
preliminary review of the City's application, disallowed about $150,000 
of the proposed project cost which was allocated to the purchase of 
eight charter-type buses.
    ``The final application of the City of San Diego is presently under 
active consideration by this Department. In particular, we have 
requested the City to furnish additional information as to the nature 
and extent of the proposed use, if any, of project facilities and 
equipment in charter service, so that we can further evaluate the 
application under the criteria above set forth. We have also requested 
similar information from Mr. Fredrick J. Ruane, who has filed a 
taxpayers' suit (Superior Court for San Diego County Civil 297329) 
against the City, contesting its authority to engage in charter bus 
operations.''
    As indicated above, it is clear that under the Act in question 
grants may not legally be made to purchase buses to be used 
``exclusively'' in the operation of charter bus service. However, in 
view of the purposes of the Act involved it is our opinion that a city 
which has purchased with grant funds buses needed for an efficient mass 
transportation system, is not precluded by the act from using such buses 
for charter service during idle or off-peak periods when the buses are 
not needed for regularly scheduled runs. As indicated above, such a use 
would appear to be an incidental use.
    The fourth question is answered accordingly.
    As requested, the correspondence enclosed with your letter is 
returned herewith.
Sincerely yours,

                                                   Frank H. Weitzel,

<R05>
Sec. 609.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to establish formally the requirements 
of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) on transportation for 
elderly and handicapped persons.


<R05>
Sec. 609.3  Definitions.

    As used herein:
    Elderly and handicapped persons means those individuals who, by 
reason of illness, injury, age, congenital malfunction, or other 
permanent or temporary incapacity or disability, including those who are 
nonambulatory wheelchair-bound and those with semi-ambulatory 
capabilities, are unable without special facilities or special planning 
or design to utilize mass transportation facilities and services as 
effectively as persons who are not so affected.


<R05>
Sec. 609.5  Applicability.

    This part, which applies to projects approved by the Federal Transit 
Administrator on or after May 31, 1976, applies to all planning, 
capital, and operating assistance projects receiving Federal financial 
assistance under sections 5307 or 5308 of the Federal transit laws (49 
U.S.C. Chapter 53), and nonhighway public mass transportation projects 
receiving Federal financial assistance under: (1) Subsection (a) or (c) 
of section 142 of title 23, United States Code; and (2) paragraph (4) of 
subsection (e) of section 103, title 23, United States Code. However, 
under certain circumstances evident in Secs. 609.13 through 609.21, the 
latter sections

[[Page 842]]

apply to fixed facilities and vehicles included in projects approved 
before May 31, 1976. Sections in this part on capital assistance 
applications, fixed facilities, and vehicles apply expressly to capital 
assistance projects receiving Federal financial assistance under any of 
the above statutes.
[41 FR 18239, Apr. 30, 1976, as amended at 61 FR 19562, May 2, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 609.23  Reduced fare.

    Applicants for financial assistance under section 5307 of the 
Federal transit laws (49 U.S.C. Chapter 53), must, as a condition to 
receiving such assistance, give satisfactory assurances, in such manner 
and form as may be required by the Federal Transit Administrator and in 
accordance with such terms and conditions as the Federal Transit 
Administrator may prescribe, that the rates charged elderly and 
handicapped persons during non-peak hours for transportation utilizing 
or involving the facilities and equipment of the project financed with 
assistance under this section will not exceed one-half of the rates 
generally applicable to other persons at peak hours, whether the 
operation of such facilities and equipment is by the applicant or is by 
another entity under lease or otherwise.
[41 FR 18239, Apr. 30, 1976, as amended at 61 FR 19562, May 2, 1996]

             Appendix A to Part 609--Elderly and Handicapped

    The definitions of the term elderly and handicapped as applied under 
FTA's elderly and handicapped half-fare program (49 CFR part 609) shall 
apply to this rule. This permits a broader class of handicapped persons 
to take advantage of the exception than would be permitted under the 
more restrictive definition applied to the non-discrimination provisions 
of the Department's section 504 program (49 CFR 27.5), which includes 
only handicapped persons otherwise unable to use the recipient's bus 
service for the general public.
    Accordingly, for the purposes of this part, the definition of 
elderly persons may be determined by the FTA recipient but must, at a 
minimum, include all persons 65 years of age or over.
    Similarly, the definition of handicapped persons is derived from the 
existing regulations at 49 CFR 609.3 which provide that Handicapped 
persons means those individuals who, by reason of illness, injury, age, 
congenital malfunction, or other permanent or temporary incapacity or 
disability, including those who are nonambulatory wheelchair-bound and 
those with semi-ambulatory capabilities, are unable without special 
facilities or special planning or design to utilize mass transportation 
facilities and services as effectively as persons who are not so 
affected.
    To assist in understanding how the definitions might be applied to 
administration of the charter rule, the following questions and answers 
previously published by FTA for the half-fare program in FTA C 9060.1, 
April 20, 1978, are reproduced:
    1. Question: Can the definition of elderly or handicapped be 
restricted on the basis of residency, citizenship, income, employment 
status, or the ability to operate an automobile?
    Answer: No. Section 5(m) is applicable to elderly and handicapped 
persons. It is FTA's policy that such categorical exceptions are not 
permitted under the Act.
    2. Question: Can the eligibility of temporary handicaps be 
restricted on the basis of their duration?
    Answer: Handicaps of less than 90 days duration may be excluded. 
Handicaps of more than 90 days duration must be included.
    3. Question: Can the definition of handicap be limited in any way?
    Answer: FTA has allowed applicants to exclude some conditions which 
appear to meet the functional definition of handicap provided in section 
5302(a)(5) of the Federal transit laws (49 U.S.C. Chapter 53). These 
include pregnancy, obesity, drug or alcohol addiction, and certain 
conditions which do not fall under the statutory definition (e.g., loss 
of a finger, some chronic heart or lung conditions, controlled epilepsy, 
etc.). Individuals may also be excluded whose handicap involves a 
contagious disease or poses a danger to the individual or other 
passengers. Other exceptions should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
    4. Question: Is blindness considered a handicap under Section 5(m)?
    Answer: Yes.
    5. Question: Is deafness considered a handicap under section 5(m)?
    Answer: As a rule, no, because deafness, especially on buses, is not 
considered a disability which requires special planning, facilities, or 
design. However, deafness is recognized as a handicap in the Department 
of Transportation's ADA regulation, and applicants for Section 5 
assistance are encouraged to include the deaf as eligible for off-peak 
half-fares.
    6. Question: Is mental illness considered a handicap under section 
5(m)?
    Answer: As a rule, no, because of the difficulty in establishing 
criteria or guidelines

[[Page 843]]

for defining eligibility. However, FTA encourages applicants to provide 
the broadest possible coverage in defining eligible handicaps, including 
mental illness.
    7. Question: Can operators delegate the responsibility for 
certifying individuals as eligible to other agencies?
    Answer: Yes, provided that such agencies administer the 
certification of individuals in an acceptable manner and are reasonably 
accessible to the elderly and handicapped. Many operators currently make 
extensive use of social service agencies (both public and private) to 
identify and certify eligible individuals.
    8. Question: Can operators require elderly and handicapped 
individuals to be recognized by any existing agency (e.g., require that 
handicapped persons be receiving Social Service or Veterans' 
Administration benefits)?
    Answer: Recognition by such agencies is commonly used to certify 
eligible individuals. However, such recognition should not be a 
mandatory prerequisite for eligibility. For example, many persons with 
eligible temporary handicaps may not be recognized as handicapped by 
social service agencies.
    9. Question: Can the operator require that elderly and handicapped 
persons come to a central office to register for an off-peak half-fare 
program?
    Answer: FTA strongly encourages operators to develop procedures 
which maximize the availability of off-peak half-fares to eligible 
individuals. Requiring individuals to travel to a single office which 
may be inconveniently located is not consistent with this policy, 
although it is not strictly prohibited. FTA reserves the right to review 
such local requirements on a case-by-case basis.
    10. Question: Must ID cards issued by one operator be transferable 
to another?
    Answer: No. However, FTA encourages consistency among off-peak 
procedures and the maximizing of availability to eligible individuals, 
especially among operators within a single urban area. Nevertheless, 
each operator is permitted to require its own certification of 
individuals using its service.
    11. Question: Can an operator require an elderly or handicapped 
person to submit to a procedure certifying their eligibility before they 
can receive half-fare? For example, if an operator requires eligible 
individuals to have a special ID card, can the half-fare be denied to an 
individual who can otherwise give proof of age, etc, but does not have 
an ID card?
    Answer: Yes, although FTA does not endorse this practice.

direct beneficiary of Federal financial assistance under section 9 of 
the Federal Transit Act must comply with the applicable requirements of 
the section 15 Uniform System of Accounts and Records, as set forth in 
the current edition of the ``Urban Mass Transportation Industry Uniform 
System of Accounts and Records''; the ``Reporting Manual''; Circulars; 
and other reference documentation.
    (b) Reporting system. Each applicant for, and direct beneficiary of, 
Federal financial assistance under section 9 of the Federal Transit Act 
must comply with the applicable requirements of the section 15 Reporting 
System, as set forth in the current edition of the ``Urban Mass 
Transportation Industry Uniform System of Accounts and Records''; the 
``Reporting Manual''; Circulars; and other reference documentation.

these documents will be mailed to all persons required to comply and a 
notice of any significant changes in these reference documents will be 
published in Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 630.5  Failure to report data.

    Failure to report data in accordance with this part will result in 
the reporting agency being ineligible to receive any section 9 grants 
directly or indirectly (e.g., a public agency receiving The FTA funds 
through another public agency rather than directly from the FTA). This 
ineligibility applies to all reporting agencies without regard to the 
size of the urbanized area served by the reporting agency.


<R05>
Sec. 630.6  Late and incomplete reports.

    (a) Late reports. Each reporting agency shall ensure that its report 
is received by the FTA on due dates prescribed in the annual Reporting 
Manual. A reporting agency may request an extension of 30 days after the 
due date. The FTA will treat a failure to submit the required report by 
the due date as failure to report data under Sec. 630.05.
    (b) Incomplete reports. The FTA will treat any report or submission 
which does not contain all the necessary reporting forms, data, or 
certifications for services directly operated by the reporting agency in 
substantial conformance with the definitions, procedures, and format 
requirements set out in the section 15 Uniform System of Accounts and 
Records and Reporting System as failure to report data under 
Sec. 630.05. The FTA will treat the submission of a report with 
incomplete data or missing

[[Page 847]]

forms for services provided under contract to the reporting agency by 
private or public carriers as failure to report data under Sec. 630.05 
provided that the reporting agency has exhausted all possibilities for 
obtaining this information.


<R05>
Sec. 630.7  Failure to respond to questions.

    The FTA will review each section 15 report to verify the 
reasonableness of the data submitted. If any of the data do not appear 
reasonable, the FTA will notify the reporting agency of this fact and 
request written justification to document the accuracy of the questioned 
data. Failure of a reporting agency to make a good faith written 
response to this request will be treated under Sec. 630.5 as failure to 
report data.


<R05>
Sec. 630.8  Questionable data items.

    The FTA may enter a zero or adjust any questionable data item(s) in 
a reporting agency's section 15 report used in computing the section 9 
apportionment. These adjustments may be made if any data appear 
inaccurate or have not been collected and reported in accordance with 
the FTA's definitions and/or confidence and precision levels, or if 
there is lack of adequate documentation or a reliable recordkeeping 
system.


<R05>
Sec. 630.9  Notice of FTA action.

    Before taking final action under Sec. 630.5, Sec. 630.6, Sec. 630.7 
or Sec. 630.8, the FTA will transmit a written request to the reporting 
agencies to provide the necessary information within a specified 
reasonable period of time. The FTA will advise the reporting agency of 
its final decision in this regard.


<R05>
Sec. 630.10  Waiver of reporting requirements.

    Waivers of one or more sections of the reporting requirements may be 
granted at the discretion of the Administrator on a written showing that 
the party seeking the waiver cannot furnish the required data without 
unreasonable expense and inconvenience. Each waiver will be for a 
specified period of time.


<R05>
Sec. 630.11  Data adjustments.

    Errors in the data used in making the apportionment may be 
discovered after any particular year's apportionment is completed. If 
so, the FTA shall make adjustments to correct these errors in a 
subsequent year's apportionment to the extent feasible.

   Appendix A to Part 630--Overview and Explanation of the Urban Mass 
   Transportation Industry Uniform System of Accounts and Records and 
                            Reporting System

                             A. Introduction

    Section 15 of the Federal Transit Act, as amended, provides for 
establishment of two information-gathering analytic systems: A Uniform 
System of Accounts and Records, and a Reporting System for the 
collection and dissemination of public mass transportation financial and 
operating data by uniform categories. The purpose of these two Systems 
is to provide information on which to base public transportation 
planning and public sector investment decisions. The section 15 system 
is administered by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA).
    The Uniform System of Accounts and Records consists of:
    <bullet> Various categories of accounts and records for classifying 
financial and operating data;
    <bullet> Precise definitions as to what data elements are to be 
included in these categories; and
    <bullet> Definitions of practices for systematic colloection and 
recording of such information.
    <bullet> While a specific accounting system is recommended for this 
recordkeeping, it is possible to make a translation from most existing 
accounting systems to comply with the Section 15 Reporting System, which 
consists of forms and procedures:
    <bullet> For transmitting data from transit agencies to the FTA;
    <bullet> For editing and storing the data; and
    <bullet> For the FTA to report information to various groups.
    Under the terms of section 15 of the Federal Transit Act, as 
amended, all applicants for, and beneficiaries of, Federal assistance 
under section 9 of the Act (under the formula grant programs) must 
comply with the Reporting System and the Uniform System of

[[Page 848]]

Accounts and Records in order to be eligible for Federal grants. It 
should be noted that separate and complete Section 15 reports must be 
submitted by or for each purchased transportation service provider that 
operates 100 or more revenue vehicles for the purchased service during 
the maximum service period.

                       B. Purpose of This Appendix

    This appendix presents a general introduction to the structure and 
operation of the two Systems. It is not a detailed set of instructions 
for completion of a Section 15 report or establishment of a System of 
Accounts and Records. Persons in need of more information should refer 
to the current editions of the Urban Mass Transportation Industry 
Uniform System of Accounts and Records and the Reporting Manual, 
available from: Federal Transit Administration, Audit Review and 
Analysis Division, Office of Capital and Formula Assistance, P.O. Box 
61126, Washington, DC 20039-1126.
    The FTA periodically updates these reference documents or 
supplements them to revise or clarify section 15 definitions, reporting 
forms and instructions. Section 630.4 makes clear that reporting 
agencies must use the most recent edition of reference documents and 
reporting forms to comply with the section 15 requirements. The FTA 
therefore encourages local officials to check with the FTA before 
completing a Section 15 report to avoid unnecessary efforts and delays.

               C. Special (Reduced) Reporting Requirements

    Certain information collection and recording requirements were 
tailored to accommodate the unique characteristics of certain 
transportation modes. Reduced requirements were permitted during limited 
time periods to ease transition to complete reporting for these modes. 
Reduced reporting requirements for commuter rail systems and vanpool 
services ended in the 1987 report year. In addition, the reduced 
reporting requirements for private subscription and private noncontract 
conventional bus service is eliminated for the 1992 report year.

  D. A Single Required Level of Section 15 Reporting and Recordkeeping

    The FTA has developed a single required reporting format for use by 
all transit agencies. The single required level accommodates variations 
in size, local laws, and modes of transport.
    The Uniform Systems also contain a limited amount of additional more 
detailed financial and operational data that can be submitted at the 
reporting agency's option. Because the optional subcategories of data 
can be aggregated to the required level, these subcategories define the 
more aggregated data. The definitions for data reported at the required 
level are consistent with, and summarized from, those for the more 
detailed optional data.

              E. The Uniform System of Accounts and Records

    The Uniform System of Accounts and Records (USOA) consists of a 
financial accounting and operational recordkeeping system designed for 
mass transportation managers and planners. Its uniformity permits more 
thorough and accurate comparisons and analyses of different transit 
agencies' operating costs and efficiencies than if each had a unique 
recordkeeping and accounting system. The System establishes various 
categories of accounts and records for classifying mass transportation 
operating and financial data, and includes precise definitions of 
transportation terminology to ensure that all users share a common 
understanding of how to use and interpret the collected data.

               (1) Use of the Accounts and Records System

    Beneficiaries of, and applicants for, Federal assistance are not 
required to use the Uniform System of Accounts and Records in keeping 
their own records. If an applicant or beneficiary chooses not to use the 
System, however, it must nevertheless be able to translate its accounts 
and records system to the accounts prescribed in the System. The 
accounting system that the reporting agency uses must permit preparation 
of financial and operating data that conform to the Uniform System 
directly from its records at the end of the fiscal year, and must be 
consistent with the following:
    (i) The data must have been developed using the accrual method of 
accounting. Those transit systems that use cash-basis accounting, in 
whole or in part, must make work sheet adjustments in their account 
books to record the data on the accrual basis.
    (ii) Reporting agencies must follow or be able to directly translate 
their system to the accounting treatment specified in the publication 
``Uniform System of Accounts and Records.''
    (iii) The reporting agency's accounting categories (chart of 
accounts) must be correctly related, using a clear audit trail, to the 
accounting categories prescribed in the Uniform System of Accounts and 
Records.

     (2) General Structure of Uniform System of Accounts and Records

    In the Section 15 Uniform System of Accounts and Records, operating 
expenses incurred by the transit system are classified by transit mode. 
The FTA developed expense classifications in two dimensions for 
uniformity and to enhance the usefulness of the

[[Page 849]]

data collected under section 15. The classifications are typical of 
those of most transit accounting systems. The two dimensions are:
    (i) The type of expenditure (expense object class); and
    (ii) The function or activity performed.
    Operating expenses can be identified either in function or object 
class categories, or cross-classified, allowing identification using 
both categories. The Uniform System also categorizes expenditures by 
four basic functions submitted by all reporting agencies. A limited 
number of additional details are optional. All reporting agencies are 
required to use a single set of object class categories.
    The Uniform System has a single set of revenue object classes to be 
used by all reporting agencies, and provides a limited number of 
additional details that are optional.
    The Uniform System provides a classification for sources and uses of 
capital to be submitted by all reporting agencies. These classifications 
replace capital information previously required on the balance sheet and 
capital subsidiary schedule.
    The Uniform System of Accounts and Records also includes collecting 
and recording of certain operating data elements.
    Details and definitions of the expense object classes, functions, 
revenue object classes, sources and uses of capital, and operating data 
elements are contained in the current edition of the ``Reporting 
Manual,'' which is updated annually, and the USOA reference documents.

                         F. The Reporting System

    (1) The Section 15 Reporting System consists of forms and procedures 
for transmitting data from transit agencies to the FTA. All 
beneficiaries of Federal financial assistance must submit the required 
forms and information in order to allow the FTA to: (1) Store and 
generate information on the Nation's mass transportation systems; and 
(2) calculate apportionment allocations for the section 9 formula grant 
program (for urbanized areas of 200,000 or more inhabitants). Agencies 
submitting Section 15 reports may only submit data for transit services 
which they directly operate and purchase under contract from public 
agencies and/or private carriers.
    Separate and complete Section 15 reports must be submitted by or for 
each purchased transportation service provider that operates 100 or more 
revenue vehicles for the purchased service during the maximum service 
period. The reporting requirements include the following major segments, 
which are based on information assembled through the Uniform System of 
Accounts and Records:
    1. Capital report.
    2. Revenue report.
    3. Expense report.
    4. Nonfinancial operating data reports.
    5. Miscellaneous auxiliary questionnaires and subsidiary schedules.
    6. Data declarations.
    (2) The Section 15 Reporting System includes two data declarations.
    (a) The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Certification.
    The CEO of each reporting agency is required to submit a 
certification with each annual Section 15 report. The certification must 
attest:
    <bullet> To the accuracy of all data contained in the Section 15 
report;
    <bullet> That all data submitted in the Section 15 report are in 
accord with Section 15 definitions;
    <bullet> If applicable, that the reporting agency's accounting 
system used to derive all data submitted in the Section 15 report is the 
section 15 Uniform System of Accounts and Records and that a Section 15 
report using this system was certified by an independent auditor in a 
previous report year;
    <bullet> If applicable, the fact that the reporting agency's 
internal accounting system is other than the Uniform System of Accounts 
and Records, and that its: (i) accounting system uses the accrual basis 
of accounting, (ii) accounting system is directly translated, using a 
clear audit trail, to the accounting treatment and categories specified 
by the section 15 Uniform System of Accounts and Records, and (iii) 
accounting system and direct translation to the Uniform System of 
Accounts and Records are the same as those certified by an independent 
auditor in a previous reporting year; and
    <bullet> That a 100% count of passenger mile data was conducted or 
that the sampling method used to collect passenger mile data for each 
mode/type of service meets the FTA requirements.
    (b) Auditor Statement on Section 15 Financial Data Reporting Forms 
and Section 9 Data.
    Reporting agencies must submit with their Section 15 report a 
statement signed by an independent public accountant or other 
responsible independent entity such as a state audit agency. This 
statement must express an opinion on whether the financial data 
reporting forms in the Section 15 report present fairly, in all material 
respects, the information required to be set forth therein in accordance 
with the Uniform System of Accounts and Records. The statement shall 
also indicate whether any of the reporting forms or data elements do not 
conform to the section 15 requirements, and describe the discrepancies. 
The statement must consider both required and optional data entries.
    Each agency is required to file an Auditor Statement unless it 
received a written waiver from the FTA. The criteria in either Condition 
I or Condition II for granting a financial data waiver are:

[[Page 850]]

    Condition I. The reporting agency (1) has adopted the Industry 
Uniform System of Accounts and Records (USOA) and (2) has previously 
submitted a Section 15 report that was compiled using the USOA and was 
reviewed by an independent auditor; or
    Condition II. The reporting agency (1) uses an internal accounting 
system other than the accounting system prescribed by the USOA, (2) uses 
the accrual basis of accounting, (3) directly translates the system and 
accounting categories, using a clear audit trail, to the accounting 
treatment and categories specified by the USOA, and (4) has previously 
submitted a Section 15 report that was compiled using the same internal 
accounting system and translation to the USOA and was reviewed by an 
independent auditor.
    For agencies that have received a waiver, the CEO annual 
Certification must verify that the financial data meet one of the above 
two conditions.
    Additionally, all reporting agencies that are in or serve urbanized 
areas with populations of 200,000 or more and whose report covers 100 or 
more vehicles in annual maximum service across all modes and types of 
service must have an independent auditor review all section 15 data used 
in the section 9 formula allocation. The statement should discuss, by 
mode and type of service: directional route miles, vehicle revenue 
miles, passenger miles, and operating cost, and include both directly 
operated and purchased service. The independent, certified public 
accountant shall perform the verification in accordance with the 
``Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements'' issued by the 
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The specific 
procedures to be reviewed are described in the most recent Section 15 
Reporting Manual.

<R04>
                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 633.1  Purpose.

    This part implements section 324 of the Surface Transportation and 
Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-17), which added 
section 23 to the FT Act. The part provides for a two-part program for 
major capital projects receiving assistance from the agency. First, 
subpart B discusses project management oversight, designed primarily to 
aid FTA in its role of ensuring successful implementation of federally-
funded projects. Second, subpart C discusses the project management plan 
(PMP) required of all major capital projects. The PMP is designed to 
enhance the recipient's planning and implementation efforts and to 
assist FTA's grant application analysis efforts.


<R05>
Sec. 633.3  Scope.

    This rule applies to a recipient of Federal financial assistance 
undertaking a major capital project using funds made available under:
    (a) Sections 3, 9, or 18 of the Federal Mass Transit Act of 1964, as 
amended;
    (b) 23 U.S.C. 103(e)(4); or
    (c) Section 14(b) of the National Capital Transportation Amendments 
of 1979 (93 Stat. 1320, Pub. L. 96-184).


<R05>
Sec. 633.5  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Administrator means the Administrator of the Federal Transit 
Administration or the Administrator's designee.
    Days means calendar days.
    Fixed guideway means any public transportation facility which 
utilizes and occupies a separate right-of-way or rails. This includes, 
but is not limited to, rapid rail, light rail, commuter rail, automated 
guideway transit, people movers, and exclusive facilities for

[[Page 851]]

buses and other high occupancy vehicles.
    Full funding agreement means a written agreement between FTA and a 
recipient that establishes a financial ceiling with respect to the 
Government's participation in a project; sets forth the scope of a 
project; and sets forth the mutual understanding, terms, and conditions 
relating to the construction and management of a project.
    Major capital project means a project that:
    (1) Involves the construction of a new fixed guideway or extension 
of an existing fixed guideway;
    (2) Involves the rehabilitation or modernization of an existing 
fixed guideway with a total project cost in excess of $100 million; or
    (3) The Administrator determines is a major capital project because 
the project management oversight program will benefit specifically the 
agency or the recipient. Typically, this means a project that:
    (i) Generally is expected to have a total project cost in excess of 
$100 million or more to construct;
    (ii) Is not exclusively for the routine acquisition, maintenance, or 
rehabilitation of vehicles or other rolling stock;
    (iii) Involves new technology;
    (iv) Is of a unique nature for the recipient; or
    (v) Involves a recipient whose past experience indicates to the 
agency the appropriateness of the extension of this program.
    Project management oversight means the monitoring of a major capital 
project's progress to determine whether a project is on time, within 
budget, in conformance with design criteria, constructed to approved 
plans and specifications and is efficiently and effectively implemented.
    Project management plan means a written document prepared by a 
recipient that explicitly defines all tasks necessary to implement a 
major capital project.
    Recipient means a direct recipient of Federal financial assistance 
from FTA.
    FT Act means the Federal Mass Transit Act of 1964, as amended.
    FTA means the Federal Transit Administration.


<R04>
            Subpart B--Project Management Oversight Services


<R05>
Sec. 633.11  Covered projects.

    The Administrator may contract for project management oversight 
services when the following two conditions apply:
    (a) The recipient is using funds made available under section 3, 9, 
or 18 of the Federal Mass Transit Act of 1964, as amended; 23 U.S.C. 
103(e)(4); or section 14(b) of the National Capital Transportation 
Amendments of 1979; and
    (b) The project is a ``major capital project''.


<R05>
Sec. 633.13  Initiation of PMO services.

    PMO services will be initiated as soon as it is practicable, once 
the agency determines this part applies. In most cases, this means that 
PMO will begin during the preliminary engineering phase of the project. 
However, consistent with other provisions in this part, the 
Administrator may determine that a project is a ``major capital 
project'' at any point during its implementation. Should this occur, PMO 
will begin as soon as practicable after this agency determination.


<R05>
Sec. 633.15  Access to information.

    A recipient of FTA funds for a major capital project shall provide 
the Administrator and the PMO contractor chosen under this part access 
to its records and construction sites, as reasonably may be required.


<R05>
Sec. 633.17  PMO contractor eligibility.

    (a) Any person or entity may provide project management oversight 
services in connection with a major capital project, with the following 
exceptions:
    (1) An entity may not provide PMO services for its own project; and
    (2) An entity may not provide PMO services for a project if there 
exists a conflict of interest.
    (b) In choosing private sector persons or entities to provide 
project management oversight services, FTA uses the procurement 
requirements in the government-wide procurement regulations, found at 48 
CFR CH I.

[[Page 852]]


<R05>
Sec. 633.19  Financing the PMO program.

    (a) FTA is authorized to expend up to \1/2\ of 1 percent of the 
funds made available each fiscal year under sections 3, 9, or 18 of the 
FT Act, 23 U.S.C. 103(e)(4), or section 14(b) of the National Capital 
Transportation Amendments of 1979 (93 Stat. 1320) to contract with any 
person or entity to provide a project management oversight service in 
connection with a major capital project as defined in this part.
    (b) A contract entered into between FTA and a person or entity for 
project management oversight services under this part will provide for 
the payment by FTA of 100 percent of the cost of carrying out the 
contract.


<R04>
                   Subpart C--Project Management Plans


<R05>
Sec. 633.21  Basic requirement.

    (a) If a project meets the definition of major capital project, the 
recipient shall submit a project management plan prepared in accordance 
with Sec. 633.25 of this part, as a condition of Federal financial 
assistance. As a general rule, the PMP must be submitted during the 
grant review process and is part of FTA's grant application review. This 
section applies if:
    (1) The project fails under one of the automatic major capital 
investment project categories (Sec. 633.5(1) or (2) of this part); or
    (2) FTA makes a determination that a project is a major capital 
project, consistent with the definition of major capital project in 
Sec. 633.5. This determination normally will be made during the grant 
review process. However, FTA may make such determination after grant 
approval.
    (b)(1) FTA will notify the recipient when it must submit the PMP. 
Normally, FTA will notify the recipient sometime during the grant review 
process. If FTA determines the project is major under its discretionary 
authority after the grant has been approved, FTA will inform the 
recipient of its determination as soon as possible.
    (2) Once FTA has notified the recipient that it must submit a plan, 
the recipient will have a minimum of 90 days to submit the plan.


<R05>
Sec. 633.23  FTA review of PMP.

    Within 60 days of receipt of a project management plan, the 
Administrator will notify the recipient that:
    (a) The plan is approved;
    (b) The plan is disapproved, including the reasons for the 
disapproval;
    (c) The plan will require modification, as specified, before 
approval; or
    (d) The Administrator has not yet completed review of the plan, and 
state when it will be reviewed.


<R05>
Sec. 633.25  Contents of a project management plan.

    At a minimum, a recipient's project management plan shall include--
    (a) A description of adequate recipient staff organization, complete 
with well-defined reporting relationships, statements of functional 
responsibilities, job descriptions, and job qualifications;
    (b) A budget covering the project management organization, 
appropriate consultants, property acquisition, utility relocation, 
systems demonstration staff, audits, and such miscellaneous costs as the 
recipient may be prepared to justify;
    (c) A construction schedule;
    (d) A document control procedure and recordkeeping system;
    (e) A change order procedure which includes a documented, systematic 
approach to the handling of construction change orders;
    (f) A description of organizational structures, management skills, 
and staffing levels required throughout the construction phase;
    (g) Quality control and quality assurance programs which define 
functions, procedures, and responsibilities for construction and for 
system installation and integration of system components;
    (h) Material testing policies and procedures;
    (i) Plan for internal reporting requirements including cost and 
schedule control procedures; and
    (j) Criteria and procedures to be used for testing the operational 
system or its major components;

[[Page 853]]


<R05>
Sec. 633.27  Implementation of a project management plan.

    (a) Upon approval of a project management plan by the Administrator 
the recipient shall begin implementing the plan.
    (b) If a recipient must modify an approved project management plan, 
the recipient shall submit the proposed changes to the Administrator 
along with an explanation of the need for the changes.
    (c) A recipient shall submit periodic updates of the project 
management plan to the Administrator. Such updates shall include, but 
not be limited to:
    (1) Project budget;
    (2) Project schedule;
    (3) Financing, both capital and operating;
    (4) Ridership estimates, including operating plan; and
    (5) Where applicable, the status of local efforts to enhance 
ridership when estimates are contingent, in part, upon the success of 
such efforts.
    (d) A recipient shall submit current data on a major capital 
project's budget and schedule to the Administrator on a monthly basis.


<R05>
Sec. 633.29  PMP waivers.

    A waiver will be considered upon initiation by the grantee or by the 
agency itself. The Administrator may, on a case-by-case basis, waive:
    (a) Any of the PMP elements in Sec. 633.25 of this part if the 
Administrator determines the element is not necessary for a particular 
plan; or
    (b) The requirement of having a new project management plan 
submitted for a major capital project if a recipient seeks to manage the 
major capital project under a previously-approved project management 
plan.

<R05>
Sec. 639.1  General overview of part.

    This part contains the requirements to quality for capital 
assistance when leasing facilities or equipment under section 9 of the 
FT Act. The regulation is set out in four subparts, with this subpart A 
containing general information on scope and definitions. Subpart B 
contains the principal requirements of the part, including eligibility 
requirements, the self-certification system used, and identification of 
the various forms of leases and grants that are eligible under the 
program. Subpart B also contains a section on other Federal requirements 
that may apply. Subpart C includes the actual calculations that each 
recipient should undertake before certifying that a lease is cost-
effective. Finally, subpart D contains requirements on early lease 
termination and project management in general.


<R05>
Sec. 639.3  Purpose of this part.

    This rule implements section 308 of the Surface Transportation and 
Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-17). Section 308 
amended section 9(j) of the FT Act to allow section 9 recipients to use 
capital funds to finance the leasing of facilities and equipment on 
condition that the leasing arrangements are most cost effective than 
purchase or construction.

[[Page 854]]

This part prescribes the policies and procedures governing the 
determination whether a lease is cost effective and to what extent it is 
eligible for capital assistance under section 9 of the FT Act.


<R05>
Sec. 639.5  Scope of this part.

    This part applies to all requests for capital assistance under 
section 9 of the FT Act where the proposed method of obtaining a capital 
asset is by lease rather than purchase or construction.


<R05>
Sec. 639.7  Definitions.

    In this part:
    Applicant is included in the term ``recipient''.
    Capital asset means facilities or equipment with a useful life of at 
least one year, which are eligible for capital assistance.
    Capital assistance means Federal financial assistance for capital 
projects under section 9 of the FT Act.
    Capital lease means any transaction whereby the recipient acquires 
the right to use a capital asset without obtaining full ownership 
regardless of the tax status of the transaction.
    Equipment means non-expendable personal property.
    Facilities means real property, including land, improvements and 
fixtures.

                         Subpart B--Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 639.11  Lease qualification requirements.

    (a) A lease may qualify for capital assistance if it meets the 
following criteria:
    (1) The capital asset to be acquired by lease is otherwise eligible 
for capital assistance;
    (2) There is or will be no existing Federal interest in the capital 
asset as of the date the lease will take effect unless as determined 
pursuant to Sec. 639.13(b); and
    (3) Lease of the capital asset is more cost-effective than purchase 
or construction of the asset, as determined under subpart C of this 
part.
    (b) Once a lease has been qualified for capital assistance, it need 
not be re-qualified absent an affirmative act or omission by the 
recipient that vitiates the cost-effectiveness determination.


<R05>
Sec. 639.13  Eligible types of leases.

    (a) General. Any leasing arrangement, the terms of which provide for 
the recipient's use of a capital asset, potentially is eligible as a 
capital project under section 9 of the FT Act, regardless of the 
classification of the leasing arrangement for tax purposes.
    (b) Special circumstances. A recipient may request FTA to determine 
the eligibility of a certain financial arrangement if the recipient 
believes it might not meet the requirements of this part.
    (c) Lump sum lease. A recipient that wishes to enter into a lease 
which requires the draw down of a single lump sum payment at the 
inception of the lease (or payments in advance of the incurrence of 
costs) rather than periodic payments during the life of the lease must 
notify FTA prior to execution of the lease concerning how it will ensure 
satisfactory continuing control of the asset for the duration of the 
lease. FTA has the right to disapprove any arrangements where it has not 
been demonstrated that the recipient will have control over the asset. 
FTA may require the recipient to submit its cost-effectiveness 
comparison for review.
    (d) Pre-existing lease. A lease entered into before grant approval, 
or before November 14, 1991 may be eligible for

[[Page 855]]

capital assistance for costs incurred after approval of such a lease by 
FTA under this part, if
    (1) The lease is otherwise eligible under this part;
    (2) The recipient can demonstrate that the lease, when entered into, 
was more cost effective than purchase or construction; and
    (3) The procurement of the asset by lease was in accordance with 
Federal requirements that applied at the time the procurement tool 
place.


<R05>
Sec. 639.15  Eligible forms of grant.

    A recipient may choose to receive capital assistance for a capital 
lease approved under this part--
    (a) In a single grant under which lease payments may be drawn down 
periodically for the life of the lease; or
    (b) In increments that are obligated by FTA periodically (usually in 
annual section 9 grants). In this case, a recipient--
    (1) Must certify to FTA that it has the financial capacity to meet 
its future obligations under the lease in the event Federal funds are 
not available for capital assistance in subsequent years; and
    (2) May incur costs under its lease before FTA's obligation of 
future increments of funding for such a lease. These costs are 
reimbursable in future grants, so long as the terms of the lease do not 
substantially change.


<R05>
Sec. 639.17  Eligible lease costs.

    (a) All costs directly attributable to making a capital asset 
available to the lessee are eligible for capital assistance, including, 
but not limited to--
    (1) Finance charges, including interest;
    (2) Ancillary costs such as delivery and installation charges; and
    (3) Maintenance costs.
    (b) Any asset leased under this part must be eligible for capital 
assistance under a traditional purchase or construction grant.
[61 FR 25090, May 17, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 639.19  Other Federal requirements.

    (a) A recipient of capital assistance for a capital lease is subject 
to the same statutory and administrative requirements as a recipient who 
purchases or constructs a capital asset.
    (b) A lessor of a capital lease is subject to the same statutory and 
administrative requirements as a direct seller of the same capital asset 
would be when the lessor--
    (1) Purchases or constructs a capital asset in contemplation of 
leasing it to a recipient; or
    (2) Modifies an existing capital asset in contemplation of leasing 
it to a recipient.


<R04>
                      Subpart C--Cost-Effectiveness


<R05>
Sec. 639.21  Determination of cost-effectiveness.

    (a) To qualify a lease for capital assistance, a recipient must--
    (1) Make a written comparison of the cost of leasing the asset with 
the cost of purchasing or constructing it; and
    (2) Certify to FTA before entering into the lease or before 
receiving a capital grant for the asset, whichever is later, that 
obtaining the asset by lease is more cost-effective than purchase or 
construction of such asset.
    (b) For purposes of this part, obtaining the asset by lease is more 
cost-effective than purchase or construction when the lease cost 
calculated under Sec. 639.25 of this part is less than the purchase cost 
calculated under Sec. 639.23 of this part.
    (c) If a recipient is unable to perform the prescribed cost-
effectiveness comparison as described in this subpart, it may ask FTA to 
approve an alternate form of cost-effectiveness evaluation.


<R05>
Sec. 639.23  Calculation of purchase or construction cost.

    (a) For purposes of this subpart, the purchase or construction cost 
of a capital asset is--
    (1) The estimated cost to purchase or construct the asset; plus
    (2) Ancillary costs such as delivery and installation; plus
    (3) The net present value of the estimated future cost to provide 
any other service or benefit requested by the applicant in its proposal 
to obtain the capital asset.
    (b) The estimated cost to purchase or construct must be--
    (1) Reasonable;

[[Page 856]]

    (2) Based on realistic current market conditions; and
    (3) Based on the expected useful life of the asset in mass 
transportation service, as indicated in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) For purposes of this part, the expected useful life of a revenue 
vehicle is the useful life which is established by FTA for recipients of 
Federal assistance under FTA's Circulars for section 9 recipients. For 
assets other than revenue vehicles, the applicant is responsible for 
establishing a reasonable expected useful life. If the recipient does 
not intend to use the capital asset it is proposing to obtain by lease 
in mass transportation service for its entire expected useful life, when 
calculating the purchase cost, the recipient must calculate the fair 
market value of the asset as of the date the lease will terminate 
pursuant to Guidelines found in section 108(b) of part II Standard Terms 
and Conditions for valuation of property withdrawn from transit use 
before the end of its useful life and subtract that amount from the 
purchase price. The resulting amount is the purchase price for purposes 
of this rule.


<R05>
Sec. 639.25  Calculation of lease cost.

    (a) For purposes of this part, the lease cost of a capital asset 
is--
    (1) The cost to lease the asset for the same use and same time 
period specified in the recipient's proposal to obtain the asset by 
purchase or construction; plus
    (2) Ancillary costs such as delivery and installation; plus
    (3) The net present value of the estimated future cost to provide 
any other service or benefit requested by the applicant in its proposal 
to obtain the capital asset.
    (b) The estimated lease costs must be reasonable, based on realistic 
market conditions applicable to the recipient and must be expressed in 
present value terms.


<R05>
Sec. 639.27  Minimum criteria.

    In making the comparison between leasing and purchasing or 
constructing an asset, recipients should ascribe a realistic dollar 
value to any non-financial factors that are considered by using 
performance-based specifications in the comparison. In addition to 
factors unique to each recipient, the following factors are to be used 
where possible and appropriate:
    (a) Operation costs;
    (b) Reliability of service;
    (c) Maintenance costs;
    (d) Difference in warranties;
    (e) Passenger comfort;
    (f) Insurance costs;
    (g) Costs/savings related to timing of acquisition of asset.
    (h) Value of asset at expiration of the lease.


<R04>
                       Subpart D--Lease Management


<R05>
Sec. 639.31  Early lease termination or modification.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if a 
capital lease under this part is terminated or its terms substantially 
modified before the end of the period used in the cost-effectiveness 
evaluation, or if the recipient by an affirmative act or omission 
vitiates the cost-effectiveness determination of the lease, future lease 
costs will no longer qualify as eligible capital expenses. In addition, 
the recipient must reimburse the project--
    (1) Any Federal funds paid for the portion of the lease term 
eliminated by early termination; and
    (2) The Federal share of the excess, if any, of the present value of 
lease costs, which exceeds the purchase costs as calculated under 
subpart C of this part for the period of the lease up to the point of 
termination.
    (b) Penalties resulting from early termination of a capital lease 
under this part are not eligible for Federal financial assistance.
    (c) Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply if a lessor 
defaults on or otherwise does not meet its obligations under the capital 
lease and the recipient takes appropriate action to ensure that the 
procurement continues to be cost-effective. FTA shall be notified of any 
such event.


<R05>
Sec. 639.33  Management of leased assets.

    Each recipient must maintain an inventory of capital assets acquired 
by standard FTA project management guidelines.

    (a) As soon as practicable after receiving notice from the medical 
review officer (MRO) that an employee has a verified positive drug test 
result, or if an employee refuses to submit to a drug test, the employer 
shall require that a covered employee cease performing a safety-
sensitive function.
    (b) Before allowing the covered employee to resume performing a

                    Subpart C--Types of Drug Testing


<R05>
Sec. 653.41  Pre-employment testing.

    (a) An employer may not hire an applicant to perform a safety-
sensitive function unless the applicant takes a drug test with a 
verified negative result administered under this part.
    (b) An employer may not transfer an employee from a nonsafety-

    (a) An employer shall conduct a drug test when the employer has 
reasonable suspicion to believe that the covered employee has used a 
prohibited drug.
    (b) An employer's determination that reasonable suspicion exists

concerning the appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors of the 
covered employee. The required observations must be made by a supervisor 
who is trained in detecting the signs and symptoms of drug use.
[59 FR 7589, Feb. 15, 1994, as amended at 60 FR 12297, Mar. 6, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 653.45  Post-accident testing.

    (a)(1) Fatal accidents. As soon as practicable following an accident 
involving the loss of human life, an employer shall test each surviving 
covered employee operating the mass transit vehicle at the time of the 
accident. The employer shall also test any other covered employee whose 
performance could have contributed to the accident, as determined by the 
employer using the best information available at the time of the 
decision.
    (2) Nonfatal accidents. (i) As soon as practicable following an 
accident not involving the loss of human life, in which the mass transit 
vehicle involved is a bus, electric bus, van, or automobile, the 
employer shall test each covered employee operating the mass transit 
vehicle at the time of the accident unless the employer determines, 
using the best information available at the time of the decision, that 
the covered emplyee's performance can be completely discounted as a 
contributing factor to the accident. The employer shall also test any 
other covered employee whose performance could have contributed to the 
accident, as determined by the employer using the best information 
available at the time of the decision.
    (ii) As soon as practicable following an accident not involving the 
loss of human life, in which the mass transit vehicle involved is a rail 
car, trolley car, trolley bus, or vessel, the employer

[[Page 863]]

shall test each covered employee operating the mass transit vehicle at 
the time of the accident unless the employer determines, using the best 
information available at the time of the decision, that the covered 
employee's performance can be completely discounted as a contributing 
factor to the accident. The decision not to administer a test under this 
paragraph shall be based on the employer's determination, using the best 
available information at the time of the determination, that the 
employee's performance could not have contributed to the accident. The 
employer shall also test any other covered employee whose performance 
could have contributed to the accident, as determined by the employer 
using the best information available at the time of the decision.
    (b) An employer shall ensure that a covered employee required to be 
tested under this section is tested as soon as practicable and within 32 
hours of the accident. A covered employee who is subject to post-
accident testing who fails to remain readily available for such testing, 
including notifying the employer or the employer representative of his 
or her location if he or she leaves the scene of the accident prior to 
submission to such test, may be deemed by the employer to have refused 
to submit to testing.
    (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the delay 
of necessary medical attention for the injured following an accident or 
to prohibit a covered employee from leaving the scene of an accident for 
the period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident 
or to obtain necessary emergency medical care.

<R05>
Sec. 653.47  Random testing.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this 
section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing 
shall be 50 percent of covered employees.
    (b) The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum 
annual percentage rate for random drug testing is based on the reported 
positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for this 
determination is drawn from the drug MIS reports required by this part. 
In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator considers 
the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional 
information or reports from employers, and may make appropriate 
modifications in calculating the industry positive rate. Each year, the 
Administrator will publish in the Federal Register the minimum annual 
percentage rate for random drug testing of covered employees. The new 
minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing will be 
applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following 
publication.
    (c) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing 
is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of 
all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data 
received under the reporting requirements of Sec. 653.73 for two 
consecutive calendar years indicate that the reported positive rate is 
less than 1.0 percent. However, after the initial two years of random 
testing by large transit operators and the initial first year of testing 
by small transit operators, the Administrator may lower the rate the 
following calendar year, if the combined positive testing rate is less 
than 1.0 percent, and if it would be in the interest of safety.
    (d) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing 
is 25 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of 
Sec. 653.73 for any calendar year indicate that the reported positive 
rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will 
increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing to 
50 percent of all covered employees.
    (e) The selection of employees for random drug testing shall be made 
by a scientifically valid method, such as a random number table or a 
computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees' 
Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other 
comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each 
covered employee shall

[[Page 864]]

have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made.
    (f) The employer shall randomly select a sufficient number of 
covered employees for testing during each calendar year to equal an 
annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random 
drug testing determined by the Administrator. If the employer conducts 
random drug testing through a consortium, the number of employees to be 
tested may be calculated for each individual employer or may be based on 
the total number of covered employees covered by the consortium who are 
subject to random drug testing at the same minimum annual percentage 
rate under this part or any DOT drug testing rule.
    (g) Each employer shall ensure that random drug tests conducted 
under this part are unannounced and that the dates for administering 
random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.
    (h) If a given covered employee is subject to random drug testing 
under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency for the same 
employer, the employee shall be subject to random drug testing at the 
percentage rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency 
regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's function.
    (i) If an employer is required to conduct random drug testing under 
the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the employer may--
    (1) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool 
containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same 
required rate; or
    (2) Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest 
percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to 
which the employer is subject.

Sec. 653.49  Return to duty testing.

    (a) Return to duty. An employer shall ensure that, before returning 
to duty to perform a safety-sensitive function, each covered employee 
who has refused to submit to a drug test or has a verified positive drug 
test result--
    (1) Has been evaluated by a substance abuse professional to 
determine whether the covered employee has properly followed the 
recommendations for action by the substance abuse professional, 
including participation in any rehabilitation program;
    (2) Has taken a return to duty drug test with a verified negative 
result. If a test is canceled, the employer shall require the employee 
to take another return to duty drug test.
    (3) A substance abuse professional may recommend that the employee 
be subject to a return to duty alcohol test with a result indicating an 
alcohol concentration of less than 0.02, to be conducted in accordance 
with 49 CFR part 40.
    (b) Marine employers. Marine employers subject to U.S. Coast Guard 
chemical testing regulations shall ensure that each covered employee who 
has a verified positive drug test result administered under this part is 
evaluated by a Medical Review Officer.


<R05>
Sec. 653.51  Follow-up testing.

    Each employer shall ensure that each covered employee who returns to 
duty after a required evaluation made under Sec. 653.37 is subject to 
unannounced follow-up drug testing as provided for in Sec. 653.63(d). 
The employer may require the employee to take one or more follow-up 
alcohol tests, with a result indicating an alcohol concentration of less 
than 0.04, as directed by the SAP, to be performed in accordance with 49 
CFR part 40.

abuse professional then recommends a course of action to the employee.
    (c) The substance abuse professional shall determine whether a 
covered employee who has refused to submit to a drug test or has a 
verified positive drug test result has properly followed the SAP's 
recommendations.
    (d) The substance abuse professional shall determine the frequency 
and duration of follow-up testing for a covered employee. Such employee 
shall be required to take a minimum of six follow-up drug tests with 
verified negative results during the first 12 months after returning to 
duty. After that period of time, the substance abuse professional may 
recommend to the employer the frequency and duration of follow-up drug 
testing, provided that the follow-up testing period ends 60 months after 
the employee returns to duty. In addition, follow-up testing may include 
testing for alcohol, as directed by the substance abuse professional, to 
be performed in accordance with 49 CFR part 40.

                         Subpart B--Prohibitions


<R05>
Sec. 654.21  Alcohol concentration.

    Each employer shall prohibit a covered employee from reporting for 
duty or remaining on duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive 
functions while having an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater. No 
employer having actual knowledge that a covered employee has an alcohol 
concentration of 0.04 or greater shall permit the employee to perform or 
continue to perform safety-sensitive functions.


<R05>
Sec. 654.23  On-duty use.

    Each employer shall prohibit a covered employee from using alcohol 
while performing safety-sensitive functions. No employer having actual 
knowledge that a covered employee is using alcohol while performing 
safety-sensitive functions shall permit the employee to perform or 
continue to perform safety-sensitive functions.


<R05>
Sec. 654.25  Pre-duty use.

    (a) General. Each employer shall prohibit a covered employee from 
using alcohol within 4 hours prior to performing safety-sensitive 
functions. No employer having actual knowledge that a covered employee

function shall permit the employee to perform or continue to perform 
safety-sensitive functions.
    (b) On-call employees. An employer shall prohibit the consumption of 
alcohol for the specified on-call hours of each covered employee who is 
on-call. The procedure shall include:
    (1) The opportunity for the covered employee to acknowledge the use 
of alcohol at the time he or she is called to report to duty and the 
inability to perform his or her safety-sensitive function.
    (2) The requirement that the covered employee take an alcohol test, 
if the covered employee has acknowledged the use of alcohol, but claims 
ability to perform his or her safety-sensitive function.


<R05>
Sec. 654.27  Use following an accident.

    Each employer shall prohibit any covered employee required to take a 
post-accident alcohol test under Sec. 654.33 from alcohol use for eight

[[Page 888]]

employee who refuses to submit to such a test to perform or continue to 
perform safety-sensitive functions.


<R04>
                        Subpart C--Tests Required


<R05>
Sec. 654.31  Pre-employment testing.

    (a) Prior to the first time a covered employee performs safety-
sensitive functions for an employer, the employer shall ensure that the 
employee undergoes testing for alcohol. No employer shall allow a 
covered employee to perform safety-sensitive functions, unless the 
employee has been administered an alcohol test with a result indicating 
an alcohol concentration less than 0.04. If a pre-employment test result 
under this section indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater 
but less than 0.04, the provisions of Sec. 654.65 shall apply.
    (b) An employer may elect not to administer an alcohol test required 
by paragraph (a) of this section, if:
    (1) The employee has undergone an alcohol test required by this part 
or the alcohol misuse rule of another DOT agency under part 40 of this 
title within the previous six months, with a result indicating an 
alcohol concentration less than 0.04; and
    (2) The employer ensures that no prior employer of the covered 
employee of whom the employer has knowledge has records of a violation 
of this subpart or the alcohol misuse rule of another DOT agency within 
the previous six months.

    Effective Date Note: At 60 FR 24766, May 10, 1995, Sec. 654.31 was 
suspended indefinitely, effective May 10, 1995.


<R05>
Sec. 654.33  Post-accident testing.

    (a)(1) Fatal accidents. As soon as practicable following an accident 
involving the loss of human life, an employer shall test each surviving 
covered employee operating the mass transit vehicle at the time of the 
accident. The employer shall also test any other covered employee whose 
performance could have contributed to the accident, as determined by the 
employer using the best information available at the time of the 
decision.
    (2) Nonfatal accidents. (i) As soon as practicable following an 
accident not involving the loss of human life, in which the mass transit 
vehicle involved is a bus, electric bus, van, or automobile, the 
employer shall test each covered employee operating the mass transit 
vehicle at the time of the accident unless the employer determines, 
using the best information available at the time of the decision, that 
the covered employee's performance can be completely discounted as a 
contributing factor to the accicent. The employer shall also test any 
other covered employee whose performance could have contributed to the 
accident, as determined by the employer using the best information 
available at the time of the decision.
    (ii) As soon as practicable following an accident not involving the 
loss of human life, in which the mass transit vehicle involved is a rail 
car, trolley car, trolley bus, or vessel, the employer shall test each 
covered employee operating the mass transit vehicle at the time of the 
accident unless the employer determines, using the best information 
available at the time of the decision, that the covered employee's 
performance can be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the 
accident. The decision not to administer a test under this paragraph 
shall be based on the employer's determination, using the best available 
information at the time of the determination, that the employee's 
performance could not have contributed to the accident. The employer 
shall also test any other covered employee whose performance could have 
contributed to the accident, as determined by the employer using the 
best information available at the time of the decision.
    (b)(1) If a test required by this section is not administered within 
two hours following the accident, the employer shall prepare and 
maintain on file a record stating the reasons the test was not promptly 
administered. If a test required by this paragraph is not administered 
within eight hours following the accident, the employer shall cease 
attempts to administer an alcohol test and shall maintain the same 
record. Records shall be submitted to the FTA upon request of the 
Administrator.
    (2) For the years stated in this paragraph, the employer shall 
submit to

[[Page 889]]

the FTA each record of a test required by this section that is not 
completed within 8 hours. The employer's records of tests that could not 
be completed within 8 hours shall be submitted to the FTA by March 15, 
1996; March 15, 1997; and March 15, 1998; for calendar years 1995, 1996, 
and 1997, respectively. Employers shall append these records to their 
MIS submissions. Each record shall include the following information:
    (i) Type of test (reasonable suspicion/post-accident);
    (ii) Triggering event (including date, time, and location);
    (iii) Employee category (do not include employee name or other 
identifying information);
    (iv) Reason(s) test could not be completed within 8 hours; and
    (v) If blood alcohol testing could have been completed within eight 
hours, the name, address, and telephone number of the testing site where 
blood testing could have occurred.
    (c) A covered employee who is subject to post-accident testing who 
fails to remain readily available for such testing, including notifying 
the employer or employer representative of his or her location if he or 
she leaves the scene of the accident prior to submission to such test, 
may be deemed by the employer to have refused to submit to testing. 
Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the delay of 
necessary medical attention for injured people following an accident or 
to prohibit a covered employee from leaving the scene of an accident for 
the period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident 
or to obtain necessary emergency medical care.
[59 FR 7549, Feb. 15, 1994, as amended at 59 FR 62240, Dec. 2, 1994; 60 
FR 12300, Mar. 6, 1995; 60 FR 39620, Aug. 2, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 654.35  Random testing.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this 
section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing 
shall be 25 percent of covered employees.
    (b) The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum 
annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is based on the 
reported violation rate for the entire industry. All information used 
for this determination is drawn from the alcohol MIS reports required by 
Sec. 654.53. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the 
Administrator considers the quality and completeness of the reported 
data, may obtain additional information or reports from employers, and 
may make appropriate modifications in calculating the industry violation 
rate. Each year, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register 
the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing of covered 
employees. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year 
following publication.
    (c)(1) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 25 percent or more, the Administrator may lower this rate to 
10 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that 
the data received under the reporting requirements of Sec. 654.53 for 
two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is less 
than 0.5 percent. However, after the initial two years of testing by 
large transit operators and the initial first year of testing by small 
transit operators, the Administrator may lower the rate the following 
calendar year, if the combined violation rate is less than 0.5 percent 
and is in the interests of safety.
    (2) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 
percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that 
the data received under the reporting requirements of Sec. 654.53 for 
two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is less 
than 1.0 percent but equal to or greater than 0.5 percent.
    (d)(1) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 10 percent, and the data received under the reporting 
requirements of Sec. 654.53 for that calendar year indicate that the 
violation rate is equal to or greater than 0.5 percent, but less than 
1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual 
percentage rate for random alcohol testing to 25 percent of all covered 
employees.

[[Page 890]]

    (2) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 25 percent or less, and the data received under the reporting 
requirements of Sec. 654.53 for that calendar year indicate that the 
violation rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the 
Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for 
random alcohol testing to 50 percent of all covered employees.
    (e) The selection of employees for random alcohol testing shall be 
made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random number table or 
a computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees' 
Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other 
comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each 
covered employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time 
selections are made.
    (f) The employer shall randomly select a sufficient number of 
covered employees for testing during each calendar year to equal an 
annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random 
alcohol testing determined by the Administrator. If the employer 
conducts random alcohol testing through a consortium, the number of 
employees to be tested may be calculated for each individual employer or 
may be based on the total number of covered employees covered by the 
consortium who are subject to random alcohol testing at the same minimum 
annual percentage rate under this part or any DOT alcohol testing rule.
    (g) Each employer shall ensure that random alcohol tests conducted 
under this part are unannounced and that the dates for administering 
random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.
    (h) Each employer shall require that each covered employee who is 
notified of selection for random alcohol testing proceeds to the test 
site immediately; provided, however, that if the employee is performing 
a safety-sensitive function at the time of the notification, the 
employer shall instead ensure that the employee ceases to perform the 
safety-sensitive function and proceeds to the testing site as soon as 
possible.
    (i) A covered employee shall only be randomly tested while the 
employee is performing safety-sensitive functions; just before the 
employee is to perform safety-sensitive functions; or just after the 
employee has ceased performing such functions.
    (j) If a given covered employee is subject to random alcohol testing 
under the alcohol testing rules of more than one DOT agency for the same 
employer, the covered employee shall be subject to random alcohol 
testing at the minimum annual percentage rate established for the 
calendar year by the DOT agency regulating more than 50 percent of the 
covered employee's function.
    (k) If an employer is required to conduct random alcohol testing 
under the alcohol testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the 
employer may--
    (1) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool 
containing the DOT-covered employees who are subject to testing at the 
same required minimum annual percentage rate; or
    (2) Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest 
minimum annual percentage rate established for the calendar year by any 
DOT agency to which the employer is subject.

<R05>
Sec. 654.37  Reasonable suspicion testing.

    (a) An employer shall require a covered employee to submit to an 
alcohol test when the employer has reasonable suspicion to believe that 
the employee has violated the prohibitions in this part.
    (b) The employer's determination that reasonable suspicion exists to 
require the covered employee to undergo an alcohol test shall be based 
on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the 
appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the employee. The required 
observations shall be made by a supervisor who is trained in detecting 
the symptoms of alcohol misuse. The supervisor who makes the 
determination that reasonable suspicion exists shall not conduct the 
breath alcohol test on that employee.

[[Page 891]]

    (c) Alcohol testing is authorized by this section only if the 
observations required by paragraph (b) of this section are made during, 
just preceding, or just after the period of the work day that the 
covered employee is required to be in compliance with this part. An 
employer may direct a covered employee to undergo reasonable suspicion 
testing for alcohol only while the employee is performing safety-
sensitive functions; just before the employee is to perform safety-
sensitive functions; or just after the employee has ceased performing 
such functions.
    (d)(1) If a test required by this section is not administered within 
two hours following the determination under paragraph (b) of this 
section, the employer shall prepare and maintain on file a record 
stating the reasons the test was not promptly administered. If a test 
required by this section is not administered within eight hours 
following the determination under paragraph (b) of this section, the 
employer shall cease attempts to administer an alcohol test and shall 
state in the record the reasons for not administering the test.
    (2) For the years stated in this paragraph, the employer shall 
submit to the FTA each record of a test required by this section that is 
not completed within 8 hours. The employer's records of tests that could 
not be completed within 8 hours shall be submitted to the FTA by March 
15, 1996; March 15, 1997; and March 15, 1998; for calendar years 1995, 
1996, and 1997, respectively. Employers shall append these records to 
their MIS submissions. Each record shall include the following 
information:
    (i) Type of test (reasonable suspicion/post-accident);
    (ii) Triggering event (including date, time, and location);
    (iii) Employee category (do not include employee name or other 
identifying information);
    (iv) Reason(s) test could not be completed within 8 hours; and
    (v) If blood alcohol testing could have been completed within eight 
hours, the name, address, and telephone number of the testing site where 
blood testing could have occurred.

Sec. 661.7  Waivers.

    (a) Section 165(b) of the Act provides that the general requirements 
of section 165(a) shall not apply in four specific instances. This 
section sets out the conditions for the three statutory waivers based on 
public interest, non-availability, and price-differential. Section 
661.11 of this part sets out the conditions for the fourth statutory

[[Page 917]]

waiver governing the procurement of rolling stock and associated 
equipment.
    (b) Under the provision of section 165(b)(1) of the Act, the 
Administrator may waive the general requirements of section 165(a) if 
the Administrator finds that their application would be inconsistent 
with the public interest. In determining whether the conditions exist to 
grant this public interest waiver, the Administrator will consider all 
appropriate factors on a case-by-case basis, unless a general exception 
is specifically set out in this part.
    (c) Under the provision of section 165(b)(2) of the Act, the 
Administrator may waive the general requirements of section 165(a) if 
the Administrator finds that the materials for which a waiver is 
requested are not produced in the United States in sufficient and 
reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality.
    (1) It will be presumed that the conditions exist to grant this non-
availability waiver if no responsive and responsible bid is received 
offering an item produced in the United States.
    (2) In the case of a sole source procurement, the Administrator will 
grant this non-availability waiver only if the grantee provides 
sufficient information which indicates that the item to be procured is 
only available from a single source or that the item to be procured is 
not produced in sufficient and reasonably available quantities of a 
satisfactory quality in the United States.
    (d) Under the provision of section 165(b)(4) of the Act, the 
Administrator may waive the general requirements of section 165(a) if 
the Administrator finds that the inclusion of a domestic item or 
domestic material will increase the cost of the contract between the 
grantee and its supplier of that item or material by more than 25 
percent. The Administrator will grant this price-differential waiver if 
the amount of the lowest responsive and responsible bid offering the 
item or material that is not produced in the United States multiplied by 
1.25 is less than the amount of the lowest responsive and responsible 
bid offering the item or material produced in the United States.
    (e) The four statutory waivers of section 165(b) of the Act as set 
out in this part shall be treated as being separate and distinct from 
each other.
    (f) The waivers described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section 
may be granted for a component or subcomponent in the case of the 
procurement of the items governed by section 165(b)(3) of the Act 
(requirements for rolling stock). If a waiver is granted for a component 
or a subcomponent, that component or subcomponent will be considered to 
be of domestic origin for the purposes of Sec. 661.11 of this part.
    (g) The waivers described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section 
may be granted for a specific item or material that is used in the 
production of a manufactured product that is governed by the 
requirements of Sec. 661.5(d) of this part. If such a waiver is granted 
to such a specific item or material, that item or material will be 
treated as being of domestic origin.
    (h) The provisions of this section shall not apply to products 
produced in a foreign country if the Secretary, in consultation with the 
United States Trade Representative, determines that:
    (1) That foreign country is party to an agreement with the United 
States pursuant to which the head of an agency of the United States has 
waived the requirements of this section; and
    (2) That foreign country has violated the terms of the agreement by 
discriminating against products covered by this section that are 
produced in the United States and are covered by the agreement.

                Appendix A to Sec. 661.7--General Waivers

    (a) All waivers published in 48 CFR 25.108 which establish excepted 
articles, materials, and supplies for the Buy American Act of 1933 (41 
U.S.C. 10a-d), as the waivers may be amended from time to time, apply to 
this part under the provisions of Sec. 661.7 (b) and (c).
    (b) Under the provisions of Sec. 661.7(b) of this part, 15 passenger 
vans produced by Chrysler Corporation are exempt from the requirement 
that final assembly of the vans take place in the United States (49 FR 
13944, April 9, 1984).
    (c) Under the provisions of Sec. 661.7(b) of this part, 15 Passenger 
Wagons produced by Chrysler Corporation are exempt from the requirement 
that final assembly of the wagons take place in the United States

procured by grantees (50 FR 18760, May 2, 1985 and 51 FR 36126, October 
8, 1986).
    (e) Under the provisions of Sec. 661.7(b) of this part, a general 
public interest waiver from the Buy America requirements for ``small 
purchases'' (as defined in the ``common grant rule,'' at 49 CFR 
18.36(d)) made by FTA grantees with capital, planning, or operating 
assistance.
[56 FR 932, Jan. 9, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 37928, July 24, 1995, 61 
FR 6302, Feb. 16, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 661.9  Application for waivers.

    (a) This section sets out the application procedures for obtaining 
all waivers, except those general exceptions set forth in this part for 
which individual applications are unnecessary and those covered by 
section 165(b)(3) of the Act. The procedures for obtaining an exception 
covered by section 165(b)(3) are set forth in Sec. 661.11 of this part.
    (b) A bidder who seeks to establish grounds for an exception must 
seek the exception, in a timely manner, through the grantee.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, only a 
grantee may request a waiver. The request must be in writing, include 
facts and justification to support the waiver, and be submitted to the 
Administrator through the appropriate Regional Office.
    (d) FTA will consider a request for a waiver from a potential bidder 
or supplier only if the waiver is being sought under Sec. 661.7 (f) or 
(g) of this part.
    (e) The Administrator will issue a written determination setting 
forth the reasons for granting or denying the exception request. Each 
request for an exception, and FTA's action on the request, are available 
for public inspection under the provisions of 49 CFR part 601, subpart 
C.


<R05>
Sec. 661.11  Rolling stock procurements.

    (a) The provisions of Sec. 661.5 do not apply to the procurement of 
buses and other rolling stock (including train control, communication, 
and traction power equipment), if the cost of components produced in the 
United States is more than 60 percent of the cost of all components and 
final assembly takes place in the United States.
    (b) The domestic content requirements in paragraph (a) of this 
section also apply to the domestic content requirements for components 
set forth in paragraphs (i), (j), and (l) of this section.
    (c) A component is any article, material, or supply, whether 
manufactured or unmanufactured, that is directly incorporated into an 
end product at the final assembly location.
    (d) A component may be manufactured at the final assembly location 
if the manufacturing process to produce the component is an activity 
separate and distinct from the final assembly of the end product.
    (e) A component is considered to be manufactured if there are 
sufficient activities taking place to advance the value or improve the 
condition of the subcomponents of that component; that is, if the 
subcomponents have been substantially transformed or merged into a new 
and functionally different article.
    (f) Except as provided in paragraph (k) of this section, a 
subcomponent is any article, material, or supply, whether manufactured 
or unmanufactured, that is one step removed from a component (as defined 
in paragraph (c) of this section) in the manufacturing process and that 
is incorporated directly into a component.
    (g) For a component to be of domestic origin, more that 60 percent 
of the subcomponents of that component, by cost, must be of domestic 
origin, and the manufacture of the component must take place in the 
United States. If, under the terms of this part, a component is 
determined to be of domestic origin, its entire cost may be used in 
calculating the cost of domestic content of an end product.
    (h) A subcomponent is of domestic origin if it is manufactured in 
the United States.
    (i) If a subcomponent manufactured in the United States is exported 
for inclusion in a component that is manufactured outside the United 
States and it receives tariff exemptions under the procedures set forth 
in 19 CFR 10.11 through 10.24, the subcomponent retains its domestic 
identity and can be included in the calculation of the domestic content 
of an end product even

[[Page 919]]

if such a subcomponent represents less than 60 percent of the cost of a 
particular component.
    (j) If a subcomponent manufactured in the United States is exported 
for inclusion in a component manufactured outside the United States and 
it does not receive tariff exemption under the procedures set forth in 
19 CFR 10.11 through 10.24, the subcomponent loses its domestic identity 
and cannot be included in the calculation of the domestic content of an 
end product.
    (k) Raw materials produced in the United States and then exported 
for incorporation into a component are not considered to be a 
subcomponent for the purpose of calculating domestic content. The value 
of such raw materials is to be included in the cost of the foreign 
component.
    (l) If a component is manufactured in the United States, but 
contains less than 60 percent domestic subcomponents, by cost, the cost 
of the domestic subcomponents and the cost of manufacturing the 
component may be included in the calculation of the domestic content of 
the end product.
    (m) For purposes of this section, except as provided in paragraph 
(o) of this section:
    (1) The cost of a component or a subcomponent is the price that a 
bidder or offeror must pay to a subcontractor or supplier for that 
component or subcomponent. Transportation costs to the final assembly 
location must be included in calculating the cost of foreign components 
and subcomponents.
    (2) If a component or subcomponent is manufactured by the bidder or 
offeror, the cost of the component is the cost of labor and materials 
incorporated into the component or subcomponent, an allowance for 
profit, and the administrative and overhead costs attributable to that 
component or subcomponent under normal accounting principles.
    (n) The cost of a component of foreign origin is set using the 
foreign exchange rate at the time the bidder or offeror executes the 
appropriate Buy America certificate.
    (o) The cost of a subcomponent that retains its domestic identity 
consistent with paragraph (j) of this section shall be the cost of the 
subcomponent when last purchased, f.o.b. United States port of 
exportation or point of border crossing as set out in the invoice and 
entry papers or, if no purchase was made, the value of the subcomponent 
at the time of its shipment for exportation, f.o.b. United States port 
of exportation or point of border crossing as set out in the invoice and 
entry papers.
    (p) In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5323(j), labor costs involved in 
final assembly shall not be included in calculating component costs.
    (q) The actual cost, not the bid price, of a component is to be 
considered in calculating domestic content.
    (r) Final assembly is the creation of the end product from 
individual elements brought together for that purpose through 
application of manufacturing processes. If a system is being procured as 
the end product by the grantee, the installation of the system qualifies 
as final assembly.
    (s) An end product means any item subject to 49 U.S.C. 5323(j) that 
is to be acquired by a grantee, as specified in the overall project 
contract.
    (t) Train control equipment includes, but is not limited to, the 
following equipment:

(1) Mimic board in central control
(2) Dispatcher's console
(3) Local control panels
(4) Station (way side) block control relay cabinets
(5) Terminal dispatcher machines

<R05>
Sec. 661.13  Grantee responsibility.

    (a) The grantee shall adhere to the Buy America clause set forth in 
its grant contract with FTA.
    (b) The grantee shall include in its bid specification for 
procurement within the scope of these regulations an appropriate notice 
of the Buy America provision. Such specifications shall require, as a 
condition of responsiveness, that the bidder or offeror submit with the 
bid a completed Buy America certificate in accordance with Sec. 661.6 or 
Sec. 661.12 of this part, as appropriate.
    (c) Whether or not a bidder or offeror certifies that it will comply 
with the applicable requirement, such bidder or offerer is bound by its 
original certification and is not permitted to change its certification 
after bid opening. A bidder or offeror that certifies that it will 
comply with the applicable Buy America requirements is not eligible for 
a waiver of those requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 661.15  Investigation procedures.

    (a) It is presumed that a bidder who has submitted the required Buy 
America certificate is complying with the Buy America provision. A false 
certification is a criminal act in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001.
    (b) Any party may petition FTA to investigate the compliance of a 
successful bidder with the bidder's certification. That party (``the 
petitioner'') must include in the petition a statement of the grounds of 
the petition and any supporting documentation. If FTA determines that 
the information presented in the petition indicates that the presumption 
in paragraph (a) of this section has been overcome, FTA will initiate an 
investigation.
    (c) In appropriate circumstances, FTA may determine on its own to 
initiate an investigation without receiving a petition from a third 
party.
    (d) When FTA determines under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section 
to conduct an investigation, it requests that the grantee require the 
successful bidder to document its compliance with its Buy America 
certificate. The successful bidder has the burden of proof to establish 
that it is in compliance. Documentation of compliance is based on the 
specific circumstances of each investigation, and FTA will specify the 
documentation required in each case.
    (e) The grantee shall reply to the request under paragraph (d) of 
this section within 15 working days of the request. The investigated 
party may correspond directly with FTA during the course of 
investigation, if it informs the grantee that it intends to do so, and 
if the grantee agrees to such action in writing. The grantee must inform 
FTA, in writing, that the investigated party will respond directly to 
FTA. An

[[Page 922]]

investigated party may provide confidential or proprietary information 
(see paragraph (l) of this section) directly to FTA while providing 
other information required to be submitted as part of the investigation 
through the grantee.
    (f) Any additional information requested or required by FTA must be 
submitted within 5 working days after the receipt of such request unless 
specifically exempted by FTA.
    (g) The grantee's reply (or that of the bidder) will be transmitted 
to the petitioner. The petitioner may submit comments on the reply to 
FTA within 10 working days after receipt of the reply. The grantee and 
the low bidder will be furnished with a copy of the petitioner's 
comments, and their comments must be received by FTA within 5 working 
days after receipt of the petitioner's comments.
    (h) The failure of a party to comply with the time limits stated in 
this section may result in resolution of the investigation without 
consideration of untimely filed comments.
    (i) During the course of an investigation, with appropriate 
notification to affected parties, FTA may conduct site visits of 
manufacturing facilities and final assembly locations as it considers 
appropriate.
    (j) FTA will, upon request, make available to any interested party 
information bearing on the substance of the investigation which has been 
submitted by the petitioner, interested parties or grantees, except to 
the extent that withholding of information is permitted or required by 
law or regulation.
    (k) If a party submitting information considers that the information 
submitted contains proprietary material which should be withheld, a 
statement advising FTA of this fact may be included, and the alleged 
proprietary information must be identified wherever it appears. Any 
comments on the information provided shall be submitted within a maximum 
of ten days.
    (l) For purposes of paragraph (j) of this section, confidential or 
proprietary material is any material or data whose disclosure could 
reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm to the 
party claiming that the material is confidential or proprietary.
    (m) When a petition for investigation has been filed before award, 
the grantee will not make an award before the resolution of the 
investigation, unless the grantee determines that:
    (1) The items to be procured are urgently required;
    (2) Delivery of performance will be unduly delayed by failure to 
make the award promptly; or
    (3) Failure to make prompt award will otherwise cause undue harm to 
the grantee or the Federal Government.
    (n) In the event that the grantee determines that the award is to be 
made during the pendency of an investigation, the grantee will notify 
FTA before to making such award. FTA reserves the right not to 
participate in the funding of any contract awarded during the pendency 
of an investigation.
    (o) Initial decisions by FTA will be in written form. 
Reconsideration of an initial decision of FTA may be requested by any 
party involved in an investigation. FTA will only reconsider a decision 
only if the party requesting reconsideration submits new matters of fact 
or points of law that were not known or available to the party during 
the investigation. A request for reconsideration of a decision of FTA 
shall be filed not later than ten (10) working days after the initial 
written decision. A request for reconsideration will be subject to the 
procedures in this section consistent with the need for prompt 
resolution of the matter.


<R05>
Sec. 661.17  Failure to comply with certification.

    If a successful bidder fails to demonstrate that it is in compliance 
with its certification, it will be required to take the necessary steps 
in order to achieve compliance. If a bidder takes these necessary steps, 
it will not be allowed to change its original bid price. If a bidder 
does not take the necessary steps, it will not be awarded the contract 
if the contract has not yet been awarded, and it is in breach of 
contract if a contract has been awarded.

[[Page 923]]


<R05>
Sec. 661.18  Intentional violations.

    A person shall be ineligible to receive any contract or subcontract 
made with funds authorized under the Intermodal Surface Transportation 
Efficiency Act of 1991 pursuant to part 29 of this title if it has been 
determined by a court or Federal agency that the person intentionally--
    (a) Affixed a label bearing a ``Made in America'' inscription, or an 
inscription with the same meaning, to a product not made in the United 
States, but sold in or shipped to the United States and used in projects 
to which this section applies, or
    (b) Otherwise represented that any such product was produced in the 
United States.

bidder may lead to the initiation of debarment or suspension proceedings 
under part 29 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 661.20  Rights of third parties.

    The sole right of any third party under the Buy America provision is 
to petition FTA under the provisions of Sec. 661.15 of this part. No 
third party has any additional right, at law or equity, for any remedy 
including, but not limited to, injunctions, damages, or cancellation of 
the Federal grant or contracts of the grantee.


<R05>
Sec. 661.21  State Buy America provisions.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any State 
may impose more stringent Buy America or buy national requirements than 
contained in section 165 of the Act and the regulations in this part.
    (b) FTA will not participate in contracts governed by the following:
    (1) State Buy America or Buy National preference provisions which 
are not as strict as the Federal requirements.
    (2) State and local Buy National or Buy America preference 
provisions which are not explicitly set out under State law. For 
example, administrative interpretations of non-specific State 
legislation will not control.
    (3) State and local Buy Local preference provisions.

    (3) Be substantially fabricated and assembled by techniques and 
tooling that will be used in production of subsequent buses of that 
model.
    (b) If the new bus model had not been previously tested at the bus 
testing facility, then the new bus model shall undergo the full tests 
requirements for maintainability, reliability, safety, performance, 
structural integrity, fuel economy, and noise;
    (c) If the new bus model had not been previously tested at the bus 
testing facility and is being produced on a mass produced chassis that 
has been previously tested on another bus model at the bus testing 
facility, then the new bus model may undergo partial testing 
requirements;
    (d) If the new bus model had been previously tested at the bus 
testing facility, then the new bus model may undergo partial testing 
requirements.
    (e) The following vehicle types shall be tested:
    (1) Minimum service life of 12 years or 500,000 miles--typified by 
heavy duty large buses, approximately 35-40 foot, as well as articulated 
buses.
    (2) Minimum service life of ten years or 350,000 miles--typified by 
heavy duty small buses, approximately 30 foot.
    (3) Minimum service life of seven years or 200,000 miles--typified 
by medium duty mid-size buses, approximately 25-35 foot.

    Appendix A to Part 665--Tests To Be Performed at the Bus Testing 
                                Facility

    The seven tests to be performed on each vehicle are required by 
STURAA and are based in part on tests described in the FTA report 
``First Article Transit Bus Test Plan'', which is mentioned in the 
legislative history of section 317. When appropriate, SAE test 
procedures and other procedures accepted by the transit industry will be 
used. The seven tests are described in general terms in the following 
paragraphs.

                           1. Maintainability

    The maintainability test includes bus servicing, preventive 
maintenance, inspection, and repair. It also will include the removal 
and reinstallation of the engine and drive train components that would 
be expected to require replacement during the bus' normal life cycle. 
Much of the maintainability data will be obtained during the bus 
durability test at the proving ground. Up to twenty-five percent of the 
bus life will be simulated and there will be servicing, preventive 
maintenance, and repair actions. These actions will be done by test 
facility staff, although manufacturers will be allowed to maintain a 
representative on site during the testing. Test facility staff may 
require a manufacturer to provide vehicle servicing or repair, under the 
supervision of the facility staff. Since the operator will not become 
familiar with the detailed design of all new bus models that are tested, 
tests to determine the time and skill required to remove and reinstall 
an engine, a transmission, or other major propulsion system components 
may require advice from the bus manufacturer. All routine and corrective 
maintenance will be carried out by the test operator in accordance with 
the manufacturer's specifications.
    The maintainability test report will include the frequency, 
personnel hours, and replacement parts or supplies required for each 
action during the test. The accessibility of selected components and 
other observations that could be important to a bus user will be 
included in the report.

                             2. Reliability

    The question of reliability will be addressed by recording all bus 
breakdowns during testing. It is recognized that with one test bus it is 
not feasible to conduct statistical reliability tests. It is anticipated 
that bus operation on the durability course should reveal the problems 
that would otherwise not be detected until much later during scheduled 
transit service. The bus failures, repair time, and the actions required 
to get the bus back into operation will be recorded in the report.

[[Page 931]]

                                3. Safety

    The safety test will consist of a handling and stability test. The 
handling and stability test is an obstacle avoidance or double-lane 
change test that will be performed at the proving ground. The double-
lane change course will be different for each type of bus and the speed 
could be different for each type of bus. Coach speed will be held 
constant throughout a given test run. Individual test runs will be made 
at increasing speeds up to 45 mph or until the coach can no longer be 
operated safely over the course, whichever speed is lower. Both left-
and-right-hand lane changes will be tested.

                             4. Performance

    The performance test will be performed on the proving ground and 
will measure acceleration and gradeability with the test vehicle 
operated at seated load weight. Top speed also will be measured if it 
can be done safely on the track. The test will be performed using a 
fifth wheel or equivalent and associated instrumentation. The bus will 
be accelerated at full throttle from standstill to maximum safe speed on 
the track. The report will include a table of time required to 
accelerate to each 10 mph increment of speed and when possible, the top 
speed. The gradeability capabilities will be calculated both from the 
test data and a test from a dead stop on a minimum of a 15 percent 
grade.

                         5. Structural Integrity

    Two different structural integrity tests will be performed. 
Structural strength and distortion tests will be performed at the 
testing facility in Altoona and structural durability tests will be 
performed at the proving ground.

               a. Structural Strength and Distortion Tests

    (1) The structural strength and distortion tests will be conducted 
and will be different for each type of bus. For example, a shakedown of 
the bus structure will be conducted by loading and unloading the bus no 
more than three times with a distributed load equal to 2.5 times gross 
load. The bus then will be loaded with a distributed load to gross 
vehicle weight. (Gross vehicle weight is a curb weight plus gross load.) 
Increase in floor deflection will be measured as the bus weight is 
increased from curb weight to gross vehicle weight. Then the bus will be 
loaded with a distributed load equal to 2.5 times gross load. The bus 
then will be unloaded and inspected for any permanent deformation on the 
floor or coach structure.
    (2) The bus will be loaded to gross vehicle weight, with one wheel 
on top of a 6-inch-high curb and then in a 6-inch-deep pot hole. This 
test will be repeated for all four wheels. The test will verify: (a) 
Normal operation of the steering mechanism and (b) Operability of all 
passenger doors, passenger escape mechanisms, windows, and service 
doors. In addition, a water leak test will be conducted.
    (3) Using a load-equalizing towing sling, a static tension load 
equal to 1.2 times the bus curb weight will be applied to the bus towing 
fixtures (front and rear). The load will be removed and the two eyes and 
adjoining structure will be inspected for damages or permanent 
deformations.
    (4) The bus at curb weight will be towed with a heavy wrecker truck 
for several miles after which it will be inspected for structural damage 
or permanent deformation.
    (5) With the bus at curb weight probable damages due to tire 
deflating and jacking will be tested.
    (6) With the bus at curb weight possible damages or deformation 
associated with lifting the bus on a two post hoist system or supporting 
it on jack stands will be assessed.

                        b. Structural Durability

    The structural durability test also will be different for each type 
of bus, but all tests will be performed on the durability course at the 
proving ground, simulating up to twenty-five percent of the vehicle's 
normal service life. During the test there will be inspections of the 
bus structure and the mileage and identification of possible structural 
anomalies.

                             6. Fuel Economy

    This test will be run to determine the fuel economy in miles per 
gallon or equivalent of the new bus models. The test will be run at 
seated load weight on a duty cycle that simulates transit service for 
the type of vehicle being tested. The fuel measurement devices under 
consideration include volumetric, gravimetric, flow and pressure.
    This fuel economy test bears no relation to the calculations done by 
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine fuel economy 
levels for the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Program. However, the test 
will provide data which can be used by recipients in their purchase 
decisions.

                                7. Noise

    There will be two noise tests: a. Interior noise and vibration; and 
b. Exterior noise. It is recognized that different levels of noise are 
expected and acceptable with different types of vehicles and different 
test procedures might be required.

<R05>


Sec.
700.1  Purpose.
700.2  Organization and functioning of Amtrak.
700.3  Availability of documents, assistance, and information.

    Authority:  5 U.S.C. 552(a) (1), (2).

    Source:  49 FR 24378, June 13, 1984, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 700.1  Purpose.

    This part describes the organization and functioning of Amtrak and 
the availability to the public of documents and information concerning 
its policies, procedures and activities.


<R05>
Sec. 700.2  Organization and functioning of Amtrak.

    The creation of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation 
(``Amtrak'') was authorized by the Rail Passenger Service Act, as 
amended, 84 Stat. 1327, 45 U.S.C. 541 et seq. (``the Act''). The Act 
requires that Amtrak be operated and managed as a for-profit 
corporation, that it be incorporated under the District of Columbia 
Business Corporation Act, and subject to the provisions of that statute 
to the extent not inconsistent with the Act, and that it provide a 
balanced transportation system by developing, operating, and improving 
intercity rail passenger service. The Act also states that Amtrak will 
not be an agency or establishment of the United States Government. 
Amtrak thus is a corporation created by Congress to compete for the 
transportation business of the intercity traveller, to the end that the 
travelling public will have a choice of travel modes. The address of its 
headquarters is 400 North Capitol Street, NW., Washington, DC 20001. 
Telephone: (202) 383-3000.
    (a) Board of Directors. Amtrak's major policies are established by 
its board of directors. The nine members of the board are selected as 
follows: The Secretary of Transportation serves as an ex-officio member 
and Amtrak's President, ex-officio, is Chairman of the Board; three 
members are appointed by the President of the United States and 
confirmed by the Senate (representing labor, State Governors, and 
business); two represent commuter authorities and are selected by the 
President from lists drawn up by those authorities; and two are selected 
by the Corporation's preferred stockholder, the Department of 
Transportation.
    (b) Officers and central management. Amtrak is managed by a 
President and a Management Committee consisting of four Executive Vice 
Presidents. Reporting to the Executive Vice Presidents are eleven vice 
presidents representing sales, transportation marketing, planning and 
development, computer services, labor relations, finance and treasurer, 
personnel, passenger and operating services, government affairs, 
operations and maintenance, engineering, and the General Counsel. Areas 
handled as special matters with the authority of vice presidents, such 
as corporate communications, safety, real estate, procurement, materials 
management, police and security, contract administration, and internal 
audit are supervised by assistant vice presidents and directors.
    (c) Regional and field structure. The need for decentralization of 
functions in the areas of passenger services and transportation 
operations has led to the creation of Amtrak's regional and field 
structure. Field offices are located in major cities such as Baltimore, 
Philadelphia, New York, Albany, Boston, Chicago, Seattle and Los 
Angeles. Pursuant to overall policies established at headquarters in 
Washington, DC, these offices handle matters like the assignment and 
scheduling of employees who work on board moving trains; purchase, 
stowage and preparation of food for dining service; maintenance and 
rehabilitation of rolling stock; and daily operating arrangements such 
as the make-up of trains or the cleaning and repairing of cars on 
trains.
    (d) Route system. Amtrak's basic route system has been established 
pursuant to statutory guidelines, and in some cases by specific 
statutory directive. Out of a route system covering about 23,000 route-
miles, Amtrak owns a right-of-way of about 2,600 track miles in the 
Northeast Corridor (Washington-New York-Boston; New Haven-

[[Page 935]]


Springfield; and Philadelphia-Harrisburg) and small segments of track 
near Albany, New York, and Kalamazoo, Michigan. In the Northeast 
Corridor Amtrak trains are run by operating crews consisting of Amtrak 
employees. On other routes, Amtrak operates trains on the tracks of 
about twenty different privately owned railroads and compensates the 
railroad for the use of their facilities and for the services of their 
employees, including engineers, conductors, and maintenance personnel. 
Those private railroads are responsible for the conditions of the 
roadbed and for coordinating the flow of traffic over their lines.
    (e) Operations. Amtrak provides about 250 trains daily, serving 
about 500 stations in over forty states. Amtrak owns most of its cars 
and locomotives, some of its stations, and most of its repair 
facilities. Its capital improvements and almost half of its operating 
losses are supported principally through Federal financing, with some 
State, regional and local financial support for some trains and 
stations. Congress requires Amtrak to earn revenues equivalent to at 
least fifty percent of its operating costs, and it currently does so.
    (f) Revenue production. The sale of tickets for transportation and 
accommodations, Amtrak's principal source of revenue, is accomplished 
through Amtrak ticket agents at stations, travel agencies, and five 
central reservation offices which service a nationwide telephone 
network. National Timetables contain basic information about routes, 
stations, and services.


<R05>
Sec. 700.3  Availability of documents, assistance, and information.

    (a) A member of the public having need for assistance or information 
concerning any of the matters described in Sec. 700.2 should address his 
or her concerns in a letter or other written communication directed to 
the appropriate vice president or to the Director of Corporate 
Communications. Amtrak will bring such communications to the attention 
of the appropriate official if they are misdirected in the first 
instance. Formal requests for ``records'' under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3) of 
the Freedom of Information Act are to be made in accordance with the 
provisions of 49 CFR 701.4.
    (b) The National Train Timetables described in Sec. 700.2(f) are 
widely distributed in the continental United States and are available in 
major cities in Europe, Canada and Mexico. When they are updated 
(usually in April and October each year) each printing involves about 
1,000,000 copies. They are ordinarily available at staffed Amtrak 
stations and copies are usually kept on hand in the offices of about 
9800 travel agents who are authorized to sell Amtrak tickets. A person 
unable to obtain a copy locally should request one from the Director of 
Corporate Communications at the Washington, DC headquarters. The 
timetable depicts the major Amtrak train routes on a map of the United 
States, and most of the remainder of the booklet shows the schedules for 
specific trains. Several pages are used to offer travel information 
dealing with the availability of assistance to handicapped travellers, 
red cap service, purchase of tickets on board, use of credit cards and 
personal checks, handling of baggage, refunds for unused tickets and 
similar matters.
    (c) Also available to members of the public at most staffed Amtrak 
stations, and usually maintained in the offices of travel agencies 
authorized to sell Amtrak tickets, is a copy of the Reservations and 
Ticketing Manual (RTM) which constitutes a compendium of information 
governing Amtrak employees in furnishing transportation to the 
travelling public. It contains substantial segments dedicated to the 
following topics: Amtrak's computer system and its communication codes; 
interline service agreements; passenger and baggage services; customer 
relations functions; reservations policy and procedures; acceptance of 
checks and credit cards; refunds; missed connection policies; ticketing; 
accommodations; employee pass travel; location maps for Amtrak stations; 
and intermodal state maps.
    (d) A full statement of Amtrak's tariffs containing the fares for 
point-to-point travel, regional plan travel and all relevant travel 
conditions, such as excursions, discounts, family plans, accommodations, 
etc., is contained in the privately published Official Railway

[[Page 936]]

Guide, which is available by subscription from its publisher at 424 West 
33rd Street, New York, New York 10001. A copy of the guide can usually 
be found at each staffed Amtrak station, and at the offices of travel 
agents authorized to sell Amtrak tickets. Tariff changes which occur 
between issues of the Guide are published and widely distributed by 
Amtrak pending their publication in the next issue of the Guide.
    (e) Each of the documents described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of 
this section is available to the public for inspection during regular 
business hours at the office of Amtrak's Freedom of Information Office 
at its headquarters at 400 North Capitol Street, NW., Washington, DC 
20001, and at the office of the Division Manager, Human Resources, in 
New Haven, Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. 
Each document has its own index. Since each index is useful only in 
connection with the document to which it pertains, and since requests 
for indices are uncommon, Amtrak has determined that publication of its 
indices as described in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) would be unnecessary and 
impracticable.

and amended at 52 FR 15321, Apr. 28, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 701.3  Policy.

    (a) The National Railroad Passenger Corporation will make records 
within the Corporation available to the public to the greatest 
practicable extent in keeping with the spirit of the law. Therefore, all 
records of the Corporation--except those that the Corporation 
specifically determines should not be disclosed either in the public 
interest, for the protection of private rights, or for the efficient 
conduct of public or corporate business, but only to the extent 
withholding is permitted by law are declared to be available for public 
inspection and copying as provided in these procedures. A record will 
not be withheld from the public solely because its release might suggest 
administrative error or embarrass an officer or employee of the 
Corporation. Each

[[Page 937]]

officer and employee of the Corporation dealing with record requests is 
directed to cooperate to the end of making records available to the 
public promptly, consistent with this policy.
    (b) A requested record of the Corporation may be withheld from 
disclosure if it comes within one or more of the exemptions in 5 U.S.C. 
552(b) or is otherwise exempted by law.
    (c) In the event one or more of the exemptions applies to a record, 
any reasonably segregable portion of the record will be made available 
to the requesting person after deletion of the exempt portions.
    (d) These procedures apply only to records in existence at the time 
of a request. The Corporation has no obligation to create a record 
solely for the purpose of making it available under the FOIA.

and amended at 52 FR 15321, Apr. 28, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 701.4  Availability of records on request.

    (a) Each person desiring access to a record or to have a copy of a 
record pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act shall comply with the 
following provisions:
    (1) The request for the record shall be in writing.
    (2) The request shall indicate that it is being made under the 
Freedom of Information Act.
    (3) The envelope in which the request is sent shall be prominently 
marked with the symbol ``FOIA''.
    (4) The request shall be addressed to the Freedom of Information 
Officer, National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 400 North Capitol 
Street, NW., Washington, DC 20001.
    (b) If the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are not 
met, the ten (10) day time limit described in Sec. 701.5 will not begin 
to run until the request has been identified by an employee of the 
Corporation as a request under the Freedom of Information Act and has 
been received by the Corporate Communications Department.
    (c) Each request should describe the particular record or records 
desired. To the extent practicable, the request should specify such 
features as the subject matter of the record, the date when it was made, 
the place where it was made and the person or office that made it. 
Generally, a request will be acceptable if it identifies a record with 
sufficient particularity to enable an employee of the Corporation to 
locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort. If the description 
is insufficient to permit location of a record, the Freedom of 
Information Officer will notify the requester and indicate the 
additional kinds of data which will facilitate the search.
    (d) The submission of a FOIA request constitutes an agreement by the 
requester to pay the fees specified in Sec. 701.7 unless the requester 
is entitled to a fee waiver or specifies in the request a different 
amount to which the Corporation agrees in writing.
    (e) Searches will be made for requested records in order of receipt. 
Each so-called ``continuing request'' will be treated as a one-time 
request.
[47 FR 17822, Apr. 26, 1982. Redesignated at 49 FR 24378, June 13, 1984 
and amended at 52 FR 15321, Apr. 28, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 701.5  Time limits.

    (a) An initial determination whether to release records requested 
under this part shall be made within ten (10) days (excepting Saturdays, 
Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the request is received, 
except that this time limit may be extended by up to ten (10) working 
days in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The person making 
the request will be given prompt notice of any extension of time. If a 
determination is made to release a requested record, the record shall be 
made promptly available. If the determination is to decline to disclose 
the record, the person making the request shall, at the same time he is 
notified of such determination, be notified of:
    (1) The reason for the determination; including citation of the 
relevant exemption relied on for denial;
    (2) The right of the requester to appeal the determination; and
    (3) The name and title or position of each person responsible for 
denial of the request.
    (b) A determination with respect to an appeal made pursuant to 
Sec. 701.6 shall

[[Page 938]]

be made within twenty (20) days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal 
public holidays) after receipt of such appeal, except that this time 
limit may be extended by up to ten (10) working days in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section. The person making the request will be 
notified promptly if the time is extended.
    (c) In unusual circumstances the time limits prescribed in this 
section may be extended by written notice to the person making a request 
setting forth the reasons for such extension and the date on which a 
determination is expected to be dispatched. Such notice shall not 
specify a date that would result in a cumulative extension of more than 
ten (10) working days. As used in this subsection, ``unusual 
circumstances'' means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary for 
the proper processing of the particular request--
    (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
office processing the request;
    (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in 
a single request; or
    (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another entity having a substantial interest in 
the determination of the request or among two or more components of an 
entity having substantial subject matter interest therein.


<R05>
Sec. 701.6  Appeals from denials of records or setting of fees.

    Each denial decision will set forth the reasons therefor and state 
the appeal from that decision that is available to the requester. A 
decision denying access to a document or setting fees may be appealed to 
the President of the Corporation by filing with his office a written 
notice of appeal, within thirty (30) days after the date of the denial, 
specifying the relevant facts and the basis for appeal. If the President 
denies the appeal, the denial shall set forth the reasons therefor and 
notify the requester of the provision for judicial review contained in 5 
U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B).


<R05>
Sec. 701.7  Fees.

    (a) Categories of requesters. There are four categories of FOIA 
requesters: commercial use requesters; representatives of news media; 
educational and noncommercial scientific institutions; and all other 
requesters. The time limits for processing requests shall begin upon 
receipt of a proper request by the Freedom of Information Office which 
reasonably describes the records sought and which identifies the 
specific category of the requester. The Freedom of Information Reform 
Act of 1986 prescribes specific levels of fees for each of these 
categories.
    (1) Commercial use requester. When records are requested for 
commercial use, the fee policy of NRPC is to levy full allowable direct 
costs for search, review for release, and duplication of records sought. 
Commercial users are not entitled to two hours of free search time nor 
100 free pages of reproduction of documents nor waiver or reduction of 
fees based on an assertion that disclosure would be in the public 
interest. Commercial use is defined as use that furthers the commercial, 
trade or profit interests of the requester or person on whose behalf the 
request is made. In determining whether a requester falls within the 
commercial use category, NRPC shall first look to the use to which a 
requester will put the documents requested. Where a requester does not 
explain the use or where explanation is insufficient, NRPC may draw 
reasonable inferences from the requester's identity and charge fees 
accordingly.
    (2) Representatives of the news media. When records are requested by 
representatives of the news media, the fee policy of NRPC is to levy 
reproduction charges only, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. 
The term ``representatives of the news media'' refers to any person 
actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to 
publish or broadcast news to the public. The term ``news'' means 
information that is about current events or that would be of current 
interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include 
television or radio stations

[[Page 939]]

broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but 
only in those instances where they can qualify as disseminators of 
``news'') who make their products available for purchase or subscription 
by the general public. These examples are not intended to be all-
inclusive. Moreover, as traditional methods of news delivery evolve 
(e.g., electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications 
services), such alternative media would be included in this category. 
``Freelance'' journalists may be regarded as working for a news 
organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting 
publication through an organization, even though not actually employed 
by that entity. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, 
requesters must meet the criteria specified in this section, and the 
request must not be made for commercial use as this term is defined 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (3) Educational and noncommercial scientific institution requesters. 
When records are requested by an educational or noncommercial scientific 
institution whose purpose is scholarly or scientific research, the fee 
policy of NRPC is to levy reproduction charges only, excluding charges 
for the first 100 pages. Educational institution referes to a preschool, 
a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of 
graduate higher eduation, an institution of undergraduate higher 
education, an institution of professional education and an institution 
of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of 
scholarly research. Noncommercial scientific institution refers to an 
institution that is not operated on a commercial basis as defined under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section and which is operated solely for the 
purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not 
intended to promote any particular product or industry. To be eligible 
for inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the request is 
being made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the 
records are not sought for commercial use or to further an individual 
goal, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly or scientific research.
    (4) All other requesters. For other requesters who do not come under 
the purview of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, the fee 
policy of NRPC is to levy full reasonable direct cost of search for and 
duplication of records sought, except that the first 100 pages of 
reproduction and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished 
without charge.
    (b) Aggregating requests. A requester may not file multiple requests 
at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents, in 
order to avoid payment of fees. When NRPC believes that a requester or, 
on rare occasions, a group of requesters acting in concert, is 
attempting to break a request down into a series or requests for the 
purpose of evading the assessment of fees, NRPC may aggregate any such 
requests and charge accordingly. Before aggregating requests from more 
than one requester, NRPC must have a concrete basis on which to conclude 
that the requesters are acting in concert and are acting specifically to 
avoid payment of fees. In no case may NRPC aggregate multiple requests 
on unrelated subjects from one requester.
    (c) Waiver or reduction of fees. (1) NRPC may waive all fees or levy 
a reduced fee when disclosure of the information is deemed to be in the 
public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to 
public understanding of the operations or activities of NRPC and is not 
primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
    (2) In determining whether disclosure is in the public interest, the 
following factors may be considered:
    (i) The relation of the records to the operations or activities of 
the NRPC;
    (ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed;
    (iii) Any contribution to an understanding of the subject by the 
general public likely to result from disclosure;
    (iv) The significance of that contribution to the public 
understanding of the subject;
    (v) The nature of the requester's personal interest, if any, in the 
information requested; and
    (vi) Whether the disclosure would be primarily in the requester's 
commercial interest.

[[Page 940]]

    (3) In all cases, the burden shall be on the requester to present 
evidence or information in support of a request for a waiver of fees.
    (d) Advance payment. (1) When NRPC estimates or determines that 
allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to 
exceed $250, NRPC may require a requester to make an advance payment of 
the entire fee before continuing to process the request.
    (2) When a requester has previously failed to pay a fee in a timely 
fashion (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the billing), NRPC may 
require the requester to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable 
interest as provided in paragraph (h) and make an advance payment of the 
full amount of the estimated fee before the agency begins to process a 
new request or a pending request from that requester.
    (3) When NRPC acts under paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, 
the administrative time limits prescribed in subsection (a)(6) of the 
FOIA (i.e., 10 working days from the receipt of initial requests and 20 
working days from receipt of appeals from initial denial plus 
permissible extensions of these time limits) will begin only after NRPC 
has received fee payments under paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this 
section.
    (e) Fee schedule. (1) Manual searches for records. NRPC will charge 
$27 per hour for the salary and fringe benefits of personnel conducting 
the search and review. NRPC may assess charges for time spent searching, 
even if it fails to locate the records or if records located are 
determined to be exempt from disclosure.
    (2) Computer searches for records. For each request, NRPC will 
charge the actual direct cost of providing this service. This will 
include the cost of operating the central processing unit (CPU) for that 
portion of operating time that is directly attributable to search for 
records responsive to the request and operator/programmer salary 
apportionable to the search. NRPC may assess charges for time spent 
searching, even if it fails to locate the records or if records located 
are determined to be exempt from disclosure.
    (3) Duplication costs. (i) For copies of documents reproduced on a 
standard office copying machine in sizes up to 8\1/2\ x 14 inches, the 
charges will be $.25 per page.
    (ii) The fee for reproducing copies of records over 8\1/2\ x 14 
inches or whose physical characteristics do not permit reproduction by 
routine electrostatic copying shall be the direct cost of reproducing 
the records through NRPC or commercial sources.
    (iii) For copies prepared by computer such as tapes or printouts, 
NRPC shall charge the actual cost, including operator time, of 
production of the tape or printout.
    (4) Other forms of duplication. For other methods of reproduction or 
duplication, NRPC shall charge the actual direct costs of producing the 
document(s).
    (f) Restrictions in accessing fees. (1) In accordance with section 
(4)(A)(iv) of the Freedom of Information Act, as amended, with the 
exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, NRPC 
shall provide the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours 
of search time without charge.
    (2) NRPC shall not charge fees to any requester, including 
commercial-use requesters, if the cost of collecting a fee would be 
equal to or greater than the fee itself.
    (3) With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a 
commercial use, NRPC shall not charge fees for computer search until the 
cost of the search equals the equivalent dollar amount of two hours of 
the salary of the operator performing the search.
    (g) Payment procedures. (1) A request will not be deemed to have 
been received by the Freedom of Information Office until the requester 
has agreed to pay the anticipated fees and has made an advance deposit 
if one is required.
    (2) Remittances shall be in the form of either a personal check or 
bank draft drawn on a bank in the United States, or a money order.
    (3) Remittances shall be made payable to National Railroad Passenger 
Corporation and mailed to the Freedom of Information Office.
    (h) Late charges. Interest may be charged those requesters who fail 
to

[[Page 941]]

pay fees charged. NRPC may begin assessing interest charges on the 
amount billed starting on the 31st day following the day on which the 
billing was sent. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in section 
3717 of Title 31 U.S.C. and will accrue from the date of the billing.
    (i) Other procedures. NRPC shall use the most efficient and least 
costly methods to comply with requests for documents made under the 
FOIA. NRPC may choose to contract with outside services to locate, 
reproduce and disseminate the records in response to FOIA requests when 
deemed the most efficient and least costly method. When documents 
responsive to a request are maintained for distribution by government 
agencies operating statutory-based fee schedule programs, such as, but 
not limited to, the Government Printing Office or the National Technical 
Information Service, NRPC will inform requesters of the steps necessary 
to obtain records from those sources.

<R05>
Sec. 701.8  Notification procedures for confidential commercial and financial information.

    (a) Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following 
definitions apply:
    (1) Confidential commerical or financial information means records 
provided to NRPC by a submitter that arguably contain material exempt 
from release under Exemption 4 of FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), because 
disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive 
harm.
    (2) Submitter means any person or entity who provides confidential 
or financial commercial information to NRPC. The term submitter 
includes, but is not limited to, corporations, state governments, and 
foreign governments.
    (3) Requester means any person or entity who submits a valid request 
for information under the Freedom of Information Act. The term includes, 
but is not limited to, corporations, state governments, and foreign 
governments.
    (b) Notice requirements. (1) For confidential commercial or 
financial information submitted prior to January 1, 1988, NRPC shall, if 
it determines that it may be required to disclose the requested 
information, notify the submitter in writing prior to the release of 
responsive records whenever:
    (i) The records are less than 10 years old and the information has 
been designated by the submitter as confidential commercial or financial 
information; or
    (ii) NRPC has reason to believe that disclosure of the information 
could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.
    (2) For confidential financial or commercial information submitted 
on or after January 1, 1988, the submitter may designate, at the time 
the information is submitted to NRPC or a reasonable time thereafter, 
any information the disclosure of which the submitter claims could 
reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm. NRPC 
shall, if it determines that it may be required to disclose the 
requested information, notify the submitter in writing prior to its 
release whenever:
    (i) The records are designated pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of 
this section; or
    (ii) NRPC has reason to believe that disclosure of the formation 
could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.
    (c) Opportunity to object to disclosure. After notification is given 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, the submitter 
shall have ten days from the receipt of notification in which to object 
to the disclosure of any specified portion of the information and to 
state all grounds upon which disclosure is opposed.
    (d) Notice of intent to disclose. In all instances when NRPC 
determines to disclose the requested records, the Corporation shall 
provide the submitter with a written notice to include the following:
    (1) A statement briefly explaining why the submitter's objections 
were not sustained;
    (2) A description of the business information to be disclosed or a 
copy of the material proposed for release; and
    (3) A specific disclosure date.
    The notice shall be provided to the submitter ten working days prior 
to

[[Page 942]]

the specified disclosure date. The requester shall also be advised of 
NRPC's final determination to disclose the requested information at the 
same time as notification is provided to the submitter.
    (e) Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a FOIA requester brings suit 
seeking to compel disclosure of confidential commercial or financial 
information, NRPC shall promptly notify the submitter.
    (f) Exceptions to notice requirements. The notice requirements of 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section need not be followed if:
    (1) NRPC determines that the information should not be disclosed;
    (2) The information has been published or has been officially made 
available to the public;
    (3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 
FOIA);
    (4) The information requested is not designated by the submitter as 
exempt from disclosure in accordance with these regulations, unless 
Amtrak has substantial reason to believe that disclosure of the 
information would result in competitive harm; or
    (5) The designation made by the submitter appears obviously 
frivolous, except that NRPC will provide the submitter with written 
notice of any final administrative disclosure determination pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (g) Notification of requester. Whenever NRPC notifies a submitter 
that it may be required to disclose information pursuant to paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, NRPC shall also notify the requester 
that notice and an opportunity to comment are being provided to the 
submitter.

quasijudicial proceedings, conducted pursuant to the provisions of the 
Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., denials by the 
Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administrator of applications for 
airman certificates and orders of the Administrator modifying, amending, 
suspending, or revoking certificates or imposing civil penalties. The 
Board also reviews on appeal the decisions of the Commandant, U.S. Coast 
Guard, on appeals from orders of administrative law judges suspending, 
revoking, or denying seamen licenses, certificates, or documents.
    (c) The Board, as provided in Part 801 of this chapter, issues 
reports and orders pursuant to its duties to determine the cause or 
probable cause or causes of transportation accidents and to report the 
facts, conditions and circumstances relating to such accidents; issues 
opinions and/or orders after reviewing on appeal the imposition of a

[60 FR 61490, Nov. 30, 1995]

  Appendix to Part 800--Request to the Secretary of the Department of 
        Transportation to Investigate Certain Aircraft Accidents

    (a) Acting pursuant to the authority vested in it by Title VII of 
the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. 1441) and section 304(a)(1) 
of the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974, the National Transportation 
Safety Board (Board) hereby requests the Secretary of the Department of 
Transportation (Secretary) to exercise his authority subject to the 
terms, conditions, and limitations of Title VII and section 304(a)(1) of 
the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974, and as set forth below to 
investigate the facts, conditions, and circumstances surrounding certain 
fixed-wing and rotorcraft aircraft accidents and to submit a report to 
the Board from which the Board may make a determination of the probable 
cause.
    (b) The authority to be exercised hereunder shall include the 
investigation of all civil aircraft accidents involving rotorcraft, 
serial application, amateur-built aircraft, restricted category 
aircraft, and all fixed-wing aircraft which have a certificated maximum 
gross takeoff weight of 12,500 pounds or less except:
    (1) Accidents in which fatal injuries have occurred to an occupant 
of such aircraft, but shall include accidents involving fatalities 
incurred as a result of aerial application operations, amateur-built 
aircraft operations, or restricted category aircraft operations.
    (2) Accidents involving aircraft operated in accordance with the 
provisions of Part 135 of the Federal Air Regulations entitled ``Air 
Taxi Operators and Commercial Operators of Small Aircraft.''
    (3) Accidents involving aircraft operated by an air carrier 
authorized by certificate of public convenience and necessity to engage 
in air transportation.
    (4) Accidents involving midair collisions.
    (c) Provided, That the Board may, through the chiefs of its field 
offices, or their designees who receive the initial notifications, 
advise the Secretary, through his appropriate designee, that the Board 
will assume

[[Page 949]]

the full responsibility for the investigation of an accident included in 
this request in the same manner as an accident not so included; and 
Provided further, That the Board, through the chiefs of its field 
offices, or their designees who receive initial notifications may 
request the Secretary, through his appropriate designee, to investigate 
an accident not included in this request, which would normally be 
investigated by the Board under section (b) (1) through (4) above, and 
in the same manner as an accident so included.
    (d) Provided, That this authority shall not be construed to 
authorize the Secretary to hold public hearings or to determine the 
probable cause of the accident; and Provided further, That the Secretary 
will report to the Board in a form acceptable to the Board the facts, 
conditions, and circumstances surrounding each accident from which the 
Board may determine the probable cause.
    (e) And provided further, That this request includes authority to 
conduct autopsies and such other tests of the remains of deceased 
persons aboard the aircraft at the time of the accident, who die as a 
result of the accident, necessary to the investigations requested 
hereunder and such authority may be delegated and redelegated to any 
official or employee of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). For 
the purpose of this provision, designated aviation examiners are not 
deemed to be officials or employees of the FAA.
    (f) Invoking the provisions of section 701(f) of the Federal 
Aviation Act of 1958, and section 304(a)(1) of the Independent Safety 
Board Act of 1974, is necessary inasmuch as sufficient funds have not 
been made available to the Board to provide adequate facilities and 
personnel to investigate all accidents involving civil aircraft. This 
request, therefore, is considered to be temporary in nature and may be 
modified or terminated by written notice to the Secretary.

<R05>
Sec. 801.50  General.

    This subpart implements section 552 (b) of title 5, United States 
Code. Section 552 (a) and (b) exempt certain records from public 
inspection. The Board will, however, release a record authorized to be 
withheld under section 552(b) unless it determines that the release of 
that record would be inconsistent with the purpose of the exemption 
concerned. Examples of records given in Secs. 801.51 through 801.58 
included within a particular statutory exemption are not necessarily 
illustrative of all types of records covered by the exemption.


<R05>
Sec. 801.51  National defense and foreign policy secrets.

    National defense and foreign policy secrets established by Executive 
Order, and properly classified, are exempt from public disclosure. 
Requests to the Board for such records will be transferred to the source 
agency as appropriate. (Executive Orders 11652, March 8, 1972; 10865, 
February 20, 1960; and 10104, February 1, 1950.)

    (a) Records relating solely to internal personnel rules and

of employees, and management plans, records, or proposals relating to 
labor-management relations.
    (b) The purpose of this section is to protect any records relating 
to internal personnel rules and practices dealing with the relations 
between Board management and employees.


<R05>
Sec. 801.53  Records exempt by statute from disclosure.

    This exemption applies to records specifically exempted from 
disclosure by statute (other than 5 U.S.C. 552b): Provided, That such 
statute (a) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in 
such manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (b) establishes 
particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of 
matters to be withheld.

(5 U.S.C. 552b)
[42 FR 13284, Mar. 10, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 801.54  Interagency and intra-agency exchanges.

    (a) Any record prepared by a Board employee for internal Government 
use is within the statutory exemption to the extent that it contains--
    (1) Opinions made in the course of developing official action by the 
Board but not actually made a part of that official action, or
    (2) Information concerning any pending Board proceeding, or similar 
matter, including any claim or other dispute to be resolved before a 
court of law, administrative board, hearing officer, or contracting 
officer.
    (b) The purpose of this section is to protect the full and frank 
exchange of ideas, views, and opinions necessary for the effective 
functioning of the Government. These resources must be fully and readily 
available to those officials upon whom the responsibility rests to take 
official Board action. Its purpose is also to protect against the 
premature disclosure of material that is in the developmental stage, if 
premature disclosure would be detrimental to the authorized and 
appropriate purposes for which the material is being used, or if, 
because of its tentative nature, the material is likely to be revised or 
modified before it is officially presented to the public.
    (c) Examples of materials covered by this section include staff 
papers containing advice, opinions, or suggestions preliminary to a 
decision or action; advance information on such things as proposed plans 
to procure, lease, or otherwise hire and dispose of materials, real 
estate, or facilities; documents exchanged preparatory to anticipated 
legal proceedings; material intended for public release at a specified 
future time, if premature disclosure would be detrimental to orderly 
processes of the Board; records of inspections, investigations, and 
surveys pertaining to internal management of the Board; and matters that 
would not be routinely disclosed in litigation but

[[Page 955]]

which are likely to be the subject of litigation.


<R05>
Sec. 801.55  Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

    Any personal, medical, or similar file is within the statutory 
exemption if its disclosure would harm the individual concerned or would 
be a clearly unwarranted invasion of his personal privacy. This also 
applies to financial statements furnished by Board Members and employees 
and to commercial or financial information customarily subjected to an 
attorney-client or similar privilege.


<R05>
Sec. 801.56  Records compiled for law enforcement purposes.

    This exemption from public disclosure applies to records compiled 
for law enforcement, but only to the extent that disclosure would 
interfere with enforcement, would be an unwarranted invasion of privacy, 
would disclose the identity of a confidential source, would disclose 
investigative procedures and practices, or would endanger the life or 
security of law enforcement personnel.


<R05>
Sec. 801.57  Records for regulation of financial institutions.

    Records compiled for agencies regulating or supervising financial 
institutions are exempt from public disclosure.


<R05>

    The NTSB may not disclose any record to any person or other agency, 
except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written 
consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains, provided the 
record under the control of the NTSB is maintained in a system of

individually identifiable; or
    (f) Pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 802.6  Types of requests and specification of records.

    (a) Types of requests. An individual may make the following request 
respecting records about himself maintained by NTSB in any system of 
records subject to the Act:
    (1) Whether information concerning himself is contained in any 
system of records.
    (2) Access to a record concerning himself. Such request may include 
a request to review the record and/or obtain a copy of all or any 
portion thereof.
    (3) Correction or amendment of a record concerning himself.
    (4) Accounting of disclosure to any other person or Government 
agency of any record concerning himself contained in any system of 
records controlled by NTSB, except: (i) Disclosures made pursuant to the 
FOIA; (ii) disclosures made within the NTSB; (iii) disclosures made to 
another Government agency or instrumentality for an authorized law 
enforcement activity pursuant to subsection (b)(7) of the Act; and (iv) 
disclosures expressly exempted by NTSB from the requirements of 
subsection (c)(3) of the Act, pursuant to subsection (k) thereof.
    (b) Specification of records. All requests for access to records 
must reasonably describe the system of records and the individual's 
record within the system of records in sufficient detail to permit 
identification of the requested record. Specific information regarding 
the system name, the individual's full name, and other information 
helpful in identifying the record or records shall be included. Requests 
for correction or

[[Page 959]]

amendment of records shall, in addition, specify the particular record 
involved, state the nature of the correction or amendment sought, and 
furnish justification for the correction or amendment.
    (c) Inadequate identification of record. Requests which do not 
contain information sufficient to identify the record requested will be 
returned promptly to the requester, with a notice indicating what 
information is lacking. Individuals making requests in person will be 
informed of any deficiency in the specification of the records at the 
time the request is made. Individuals making requests in writing will be 
notified of any such deficiency when their request is acknowledged.


<R05>
Sec. 802.7  Requests: How, where, and when presented; verification of identity of individuals making requests; accompanying persons; and procedures for 
          acknowledgment of requests.

    (a) Requests--general. Requests may be made in person or in writing. 
Assistance regarding requests or other matters relating to the Act may 
be obtained by writing to the Director, Bureau of Administration, 
National Transportation Safety Board, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., 
Washington, DC 20594. The Director, Bureau of Administration, or his 
designee, on request, will aid an individual in preparing an amendment 
to the record or to an appeal following denial of a request to amend the 
record, pursuant to subsection (f)(4) of the Act.
    (b) Written requests. Written requests shall be made to the 
Director, Bureau of Administration at the address given above, and shall 
clearly state on the envelope and on the request itself, ``Privacy Act 
Request,'' ``Privacy Act Statement of Disagreement,'' ``Privacy Act 
Disclosure Accounting Request,'' ``Appeal from Privacy Act Adverse 
Determination,'' or ``Privacy Act Correction Request,'' as the case may 
be. Actual receipt by the Director, Bureau of Administration, or his 
designee, shall constitute receipt.
    (c) Requests made in person. Requests may be made in person during 
official working hours of the NTSB at the office where the record is 
located, as listed in the ``Notice of Systems of Records'' for the 
system in which the record is contained.
    (d) Verification of identity of requester. (1) For written requests, 
the requester's identity must be verified before the release of any 
record, unless exempted under the FOIA. This may be accomplished by 
adequate proof of identity in the form of a driver's license or other 
acceptable item of the same type.
    (2) For requests in person, the requester's identity may be 
established by a single document bearing a photograph (such as a 
passport or identification badge) or by two items of identification 
containing name, address, and signature (such as a driver's license or 
credit card).
    (3) Where a request is made for reproduced records which are to be 
delivered by mail, the request must include a notarized statement 
verifying the requester's identity.
    (e) Inability to provide requisite documentation of identity. A 
requester who cannot provide the necessary documentation of identity may 
provide a notarized statement, swearing or affirming his identity and 
the fact that he is aware of the penalties for false statement imposed 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001, and subsection (i)(3) of the Act. Where 
requested, the Director, Bureau of Administration, or his designee, will 
assist the requester in formulating the necessary document.
    (f) Accompanying persons. A requester may wish to have a person of 
his choice accompany him to review the requested record. Prior to the 
release of the record, the NTSB will require the requester to furnish 
the Director, Bureau of Administration or his designee, with a written 
statement authorizing disclosure of the record in the accompanying 
person's presence.
    (g) Acknowledgment of requests. Written requests to verify the 
existence of, to obtain access to, or to correct or amend records about 
the requester maintained by NTSB in any system of records subject to the 
Act, shall be acknowledged in writing by the Director, Bureau of 
Administration, or his designee, within 3 working days after the date of 
actual receipt of the request by

[[Page 960]]

the Director, Bureau of Administration, or his designee. The 
acknowledgment shall advise the requester of the need for any additional 
information to process the request. Wherever practicable, the 
acknowledgment shall notify the individual whether his request has been 
granted or denied. When a request is made in person, every effort will 
be made to determine immediately whether the request will be granted. If 
such decision cannot be made, the request will be processed in the same 
manner as a written request. Records will be made available for 
immediate inspection whenever possible.

retrievable by the requester's name or other identifying particulars.
    (c) The System Manager shall advise the requester within 10 working 
days after actual receipt of the request by the Director, Bureau of

[[Page 961]]

or amended in whole or in part, he will forthwith make such finding in 
writing, after consulting with the General Counsel, or his designee. The 
requester shall be notified of the refusal to correct or amend the

requester does not receive an answer within such time, the delay shall 
constitute a denial of the request and shall permit the requester 
immediately to appeal to the Board, or to a district court.


<R04>
           Subpart E--Review of Initial Adverse Determination


<R05>
Sec. 802.14  Review procedure and judicial review.

    (c)(1) Review of denial of access. If the appeal upholds the denial 
of access to records, the Board shall: Notify the requester in writing, 
explaining the Board's determination; state that the denial is a final 
agency action and that judicial review is available in a district court 
of the United States in the district where the requester resides or has 
his principal place of business, or where the agency records are 
located, or in the District of Columbia; and request a filing with the 
Board of a concise statement enumerating the reasons for the requester's 
disagreement with the denial, pursuant to subsection (g) of the Act.
    (2) Review of denial of correction or amendment. If the appeal

requester in writing of the reversal. The notice shall include a brief 
statement outlining those portions of the individual's record which were 
not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete, and corrections of the 
record which were made, and shall provide the individual with a courtesy 
copy of the corrected record.
    (e) Copies of all appeals and written determinations will be 
furnished by the System Manager to the Board.
    (f) In unusual circumstances, time limits may be extended by not 
more than 10 working days by written notice to the individual making the 
request. The notice shall include the reasons for the extension and the 
date on which a determination is expected to be forthcoming. ``Unusual 
circumstances'' as used in this section shall include circumstances 
where a search and collection of the requested records from field 
offices or other establishments are required, cases where a voluminous 
amount of data is involved, and cases where consultations are required 
with other agencies or with others having a substantial interest in the

[[Page 962]]

and shall be clearly marked, both on the statement and on the envelope, 
``Privacy Act Statement of Disagreement.''
    (2) The Director, Bureau of Administration, or his designee, shall 
be responsible for ensuring that:
    (i) The Statement of Disagreement is included in the system of 
records in which the disputed item of information is maintained; and

disputed, the existence of the Statement of Disagreement, and its 
location within the relevant system of records.
    (3) The Director, Bureau of Administration, or his designee, may, if 
he deems it appropriate, prepare a concise Statement of Explanation 
indicating why the requested amendments or corrections were not made. 
Such Statement of Explanation shall be included in the system of records 
in the same manner as the Statement of Disagreement. Courtesy copies of 
the NTSB Statement of Explanation and the notation of dispute, as marked 
on the original record, shall be furnished to the individual who 
requested correction or amendment of the record.
    (h) Notices of correction and/or amendment, or dispute. After a 
record has been corrected or a Statement of Disagreement has been filed, 
the Director, Bureau of Administration, or his designee, shall within 30 
working days thereof, advise all previous recipients of the affected 
record as to the correction or the filing of the Statement of 
Disagreement. The identity of such recipients shall be determined 
pursuant to an accounting of disclosures required by the Act or any 
other accounting previously made. Any disclosure of disputed information 
occurring after a Statement of Disagreement has been filed shall clearly 
identify the specific information disputed and shall be accompanied by a 
copy of the Statement of Disagreement and a copy of any NTSB Statement 
of Explanation.
    (i) Disclosure to others of records concerning individuals. Neither 
the Board nor other NTSB personnel shall disclose any record which is 
contained in a system of records maintained by NTSB, by any means of 
communication, including oral communication, to any person, or to 
another Government agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or 
with the prior written consent, of the individual to whom the record 
pertains, unless disclosure of the record is:
    (1) To the Board and NTSB personnel who have a need for the record 
in the performance of their duties;
    (2) Required under the FOIA;
    (3) For a routine use published in the Federal Register;

written assurance that the record will be used solely as a statistical 
research or reporting record and that the record is transferred in a 
form that is not identifiable with respect to individuals;\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The advance written statement of assurance shall state the 
purpose for which the record is requested and certify that it will be 
used only for statistical purposes. Prior to release under this 
paragraph, the record shall be stripped of all personally identifiable 
information and reviewed to ensure that the identity of any individual 
cannot reasonably be determined by combining two or more statistical 
records.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (6) To the National Archives of the United States as a record which 
has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued 
preservation by the U.S. Government, or to the Administrator of the 
General Services Administration, or his designee, for evaluation to 
determine whether the record has such value;
    (7) To another agency or to an instrumentality of any governmental 
jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a 
civil or criminal law enforcement activity if the activity is authorized 
by law, and if the head of the agency or instrumentality has made a 
written request to NTSB specifying the particular portion of the record 
desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is 
sought;\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ A record may be disclosed to a law enforcement agency at the 
initiative of NTSB if criminal conduct is suspected, provided that such 
disclosure has been established as a routine use by publication in the 
Federal Register, and the instance of misconduct is directly related to 
the purpose for which the record is maintained.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 963]]

    (8) To any person upon a showing of compelling circumstances 
affecting the health or safety of any individual;

<R05>
Sec. 804.5  Grounds on which meetings may be closed or information may be withheld.

requires otherwise, a meeting may be closed and information pertinent to 
such meeting otherwise required by Secs. 804.6, 804.7, and 804.8 to be 
disclosed to the public may be withheld if the Board properly determines 
that such meeting or portion thereof or the disclosure of such 
information is likely to:
    (a) Disclose matters that are (1) specifically authorized under 
criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the 
interests of national defense or foreign policy, and (2) are in fact 
properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order;
    (b) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
the NTSB;
    (c) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by 
statute (other than 5 U.S.C. 552): Provided, That such statute (1) 
requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner 
as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (2) establishes particular 
criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be 
withheld;
    (d) Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information 
obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;
    (e) Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring 
any person;
    (f) Disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would 
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
    (g) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement 
purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such 
records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or 
information would:
    (1) Interfere with enforcement proceedings;
    (2) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial 
adjudication;
    (3) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
    (4) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case 
of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the 
course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful 
national security intelligence investigation, confidential information 
furnished only by the confidential source;
    (5) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures; or
    (6) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement 
personnel;
    (h) Disclose information contained in or related to examination, 
operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the 
use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of 
financial institutions;
    (i) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be 
likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed action of 
the NTSB: Provided, That the NTSB has not already disclosed to the 
public the content or nature of its proposed action or is not required 
by law to make such disclosure on its own initiative prior to taking 
final action on such proposal; or
    (j) Specifically concern the Board's issuance of a subpoena, or the 
NTSB's participation in a civil action or proceeding, an action in a 
foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, or the

formal agency adjudication pursuant to the procedures in 5 U.S.C. 554 or 
otherwise involving a determination on the record after opportunity for 
a hearing.

its action closing the meeting and a list of all persons expected to 
attend and their affiliation.
    (d) Before every closed meeting, the General Counsel of the NTSB 
shall publicly certify that, in his or her opinion, the meeting may be 
closed to the public and shall state each relevant exemptive provision. 
A copy of such certification, together with a statement of the presiding

business requires that such meeting be scheduled in less than seven 
days; and

section be made at the earliest practicable time.
    (c) Immediately following each public announcement required by this 
section, or by Sec. 804.8, the NTSB shall submit a notice of public 
announcement for publication in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 804.8  Changes following public announcement.

public announcement only if the NTSB publicly announces such change at 
the earliest practicable time. Members need not approve such change.
    (b) The subject matter of a meeting or the determination of the 
Board to open or to close a meeting, or a portion thereof, to the public 
may be changed following public announcement only if:
    (1) A majority of all Members determines by recorded vote that NTSB 
business so requires and that no earlier announcement of the change was 
possible; and
    (2) The NTSB publicly announces such change and the vote of each 
Member thereon at the earliest practicable time.


<R05>
Sec. 804.9  Transcripts, recordings, or minutes of closed meetings.

contain matters which may be withheld under the exemptive provisions of 
Sec. 804.5. Copies of the nonexempt portions of the transcript or 
minutes, or transcription of such recordings disclosing the identity of 
each speaker, shall be furnished to any person at the actual cost of 
transcription or duplication. the NTSB shall maintain a complete 
verbatim copy of the transcript, a complete copy of the minutes, or a 
complete electronic recording of each meeting, or a portion thereof,

either no per diem and other travel expenses will be paid or an 
appropriate reduction will be made in the per diem or other travel 
expenses payable, depending upon the extent of the donation. No Member 
or employee may be reimbursed, or payment made on his behalf, for 
excessive personal living expenses, gifts, entertainment, or other 
personal benefits.
    (g) Members and employees are not precluded from receiving bona fide 
reimbursement, unless prohibited by law, for expenses of nonofficial 
travel and such other necessary subsistence as is compatible with this 
part for private personal interests for which no Government payment or 
reimbursement is authorized.

Sec. 805.735-6  Misuse of information by Members and employees.

    For the purpose of furthering private interest, Members and 
employees shall not, except as provided in Sec. 805.735-7(c), directly 
or indirectly, use, or allow the use of, official information obtained 
through or in connection with his employment within the Board which has 
not been made available to the general public.

[[Page 971]]


<R05>
Sec. 805.735-7  Outside activities of Members and employees.

    (a) A Member or employee shall not engage in outside employment or 
other outside activity not compatible with the full and proper discharge 
of his duties and responsibilities as an officer or employee of the 
Board. Before an employee can engage in outside employment or activity 
for profit, he shall obtain the approval of the Board's Managing 
Director by requesting written authorization from the Managing Director 
prior to engaging in such activity. Board Members desiring to engage in 
outside employment or activity for profit may request prior written 
authorization from the Chairman. Should such authorization be granted, 
the Member or employee has a continuing responsibility to confine 
himself to the scope of the authorization. If the circumstances change 
so as to involve a possible incompatible activity, the Member or 
employee must seek further authorization in order to continue in his 
outside employment or activity for profit. Authorization granted in 
specific cases may be deemed subsequently to involve an incompatible 
activity, and in such cases the Member or employee concerned shall be 
notified in writing of the cancellation of the authorization with 
instructions to modify or terminate the outside activity at the earliest 
practicable time.
    (b) Incompatible activities by Members or employees include, but are 
not limited to:
    (1) Acceptance of a fee, compensation, gift, payment of expense, or 
any other thing of monetary value in circumstances in which acceptance 
may result in, or create the appearance of, a conflict of interest; or
    (2) Outside employment or activity which tends to impair his mental 
or physical capacity to perform in an acceptable manner his duties and 
responsibilities within the Board.
    (c) Employees are encouraged to engage in teaching, lecturing, and 
writing that is not prohibited by law, the Executive order, 5 CFR part 
735, or the regulations in this part. However, an employee shall not, 
either for or without compensation, engage in teaching, lecturing, or 
writing, including teaching, lecturing, or writing for the purpose of 
the special preparation of a person or class of persons for an 
examination of the Civil Service Commission or Board of Examiners for 
the Foreign Service, that is dependent on information obtained as a 
result of his employment by the Board, except when that information has 
been made available to the general public or will be made available on 
request, or when the Chairman gives written authorization for the use of 
nonpublic information on the basis that the use is in the public 
interest.
    (d) Board Members, as Presidential appointees covered by section 
401(a) of the Executive order, are specifically precluded by 5 CFR 
735.203(c) from receiving compensation or anything of monetary value for 
any consultation, lecture, discussion, writing, or appearance, the 
subject matter of which is devoted substantially to the 
responsibilities, programs, or operations of their agency, or which 
draws substantially on official data or ideas which have not become part 
of the body of public information.
    (e) If an activity covered by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section 
is to be undertaken as official duty, expenses will be borne by the 
Board, and the Member or employee may not accept compensation or allow 
his expenses to be paid for by the person or group under whose auspices 
the activity is being performed. If it is determined that the activity 
is to be undertaken in a private capacity, the Member or employee may 
not use duty hours or Government facilities, but he may accept 
compensation, and he may use his official title if he makes it clear 
that he does not represent the Board.
    (f) Members and employees shall not receive any salary or anything 
of monetary value from a private source as compensation for his services 
to the Board (18 U.S.C. 209).
    (g) This section does not preclude a Member or employee from:
    (1) Participating in the activities of national or State political 
parties not prohibited by law;
    (2) Participating in the affairs of or acceptance of an award for a 
meritorious public contribution or achievement

[[Page 972]]

given by a charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, 
nonprofit educational or recreational, public service, or civic 
organization.

Sec. 805.735-8  Employment of family members in transportation and related enterprises.

    (a) No individual will be employed or retained in employment by the 
Board if a member of his immediate family (blood relations who are 
residents of the employee's household) is employed by a carrier, a 
person or firm representing a carrier, or a transportation trade 
association.
    (b) Members and employees may request a waiver, modification, or 
postponement of the implementation of this prohibition from the Chairman 
and Managing Director, respectively, on the grounds of undue hardship to 
himself or the family member involved. The request must contain an 
agreement to forego any privilege to which the Board Member or employee 
would be entitled as a relative of the family member.

Sec. 805.735-10  Member and employee indebtedness.

    Members and employees shall pay each just financial obligation in a 
proper and timely manner, especially one imposed by law, such as 
Federal, State, or local taxes. For the purpose of this section, a 
``just financial obligation'' means one acknowledged by the employee or 
one reduced to judgment by a court, and ``in a proper and timely 
manner'' means in a manner which the Board determines does not, under 
the circumstances, reflect adversely on the Board as his employer.


<R05>
Sec. 805.735-11  Gambling, betting, and lotteries.

    Members and employees shall not participate, while on Board-owned or 
leased property or while on duty for the Board, in any gambling 
activity, including the operation of a gambling device, conducting a 
lottery or pool, a game for money or property, or in selling or 
purchasing a numbers slip or ticket. However, this section does not 
preclude activities regarding solicitations conducted by an employee 
recreation and welfare organization among its members, for

these activities having been approved under section 3 of Executive Order 
10927, dated March 18, 1961.

Sec. 805.735-14  Specific regulations for special Government employees.

    (a) Use of Board affiliation. A special Government employee of the 
Board shall not use his Government employment for a purpose that is, or 
gives the appearance of being, motivated by the desire for private gain 
for himself or another person, particularly one with whom he has family, 
business, or financial ties.
    (b) Use of inside information. (1) A special Government employee 
shall not use inside information obtained as a result of his employment 
by the Board for private gain for himself or another person, either by 
direct action on his part or by counsel, recommendation, or

[[Page 973]]

suggestion to another person, particularly one with whom he has family, 
business, or financial ties. For this purpose of this section, ``inside 
information'' means information obtained under Government authority 
which has not become part of the body of public information.
    (2) Special Government employees may teach, lecture, or write in a 
manner not inconsistent with Sec. 805.735-7(c) for employees.
    (c) Receipt of gifts, entertainment, and favors. (1) A special 
Government employee, while employed by the Board or in connection with 
his employment, shall not receive or solicit from a person having

particularly one with whom he has family, business, or financial ties.

will apply with equivalent force and effect to special Government 
employees with regard to the prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this 
section.

requirements by occupying a position covered under paragraph (a) of this 
section, if he occupies the position after that effective date.
    (b) An employee required to submit a statement of employment and

<R05>
Sec. 805.735-17  Supplementary statements.

    Changes in, or additions to, the information contained in an 
employee's statement of employment and financial interests shall be 
reported in supplementary statements, in the format prescribed by the 
Managing Director, as of June 30th of each year. If there are not 
changes or additions, a negative report is not required. Notwithstanding 
the filing of the annual report required by this section, each employee 
shall at all times avoid acquiring a financial interest that could 
result, or taking an action that would result, in a violation of the 
conflict-of-interest provisions, 18 U.S.C. 208, or the provisions of 
this part.
[40 FR 30239, July 17, 1975, as amended at 41 FR 39758, Sept. 16, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 805.735-18  Interests of employees' relatives.

    The interest of a spouse, minor child, or other members of an 
employee's immediate household is considered to be an interest of the 
employee. For the purpose of this section, ``member of an employee's

employee's household.

[[Page 974]]


<R05>
Sec. 805.735-19  Information not known by employees.

    If any information required to be included on a statement of 
employment and financial interests or supplementary statement, including 
holdings placed in trust, is not known to the employee but is known to 
another person, the employee shall require that other person to submit 
information in his behalf.


<R05>
Sec. 805.735-20  Information not required of employees.

    An employee is not required to submit on a statement of employment 
and financial interests or supplementary statement, any information 
relating to the employee's connection with, or interest in, a 
professional society or a charitable, religious, social, fraternal, 
recreational, public service, civic, or political organization, or a 
similar organization not conducted as a business enterprise. For the 
purpose of this section, educational and other institutions doing 
research and development or related work, involving grants of money from 
or contracts with the Government, are deemed ``business enterprises'' 
and are required to be included in an employee's statement of employment 
and financial interests.


<R05>
Sec. 805.735-21  Confidentiality of statements.

    Subject to the provisions of Sec. 805.735-24 concerning review of 
employee statements, each statement of employment and financial 
interests, and each supplementary statement, shall be held in 
confidence. The Personnel Officer is personally responsible for the 
retention of employee statements in confidence and may not disclose 
information from a statement or allow access to a statement, except to 
carry out the purpose of this part, or as the Civil Service Commission 
or the Chairman may determine for good cause shown.


<R05>
Sec. 805.735-22  Effect of statements on other requirements.

    The statements of employment and financial interests and 
supplementary statements required of employees are in addition to, and 
not in substitution for, or in derogation of, any similar requirement 
imposed by law, order, or regulation. The submission of a statement or 
supplementary statement by an employee does not permit him or any other 
person to participate in a matter in which his or the other person's 
participation is prohibited by law, order, or regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 805.735-23  Submission of statements by special Government employees.

    (a) A special Government employee shall submit a statement of 
employment and financial interests which reports:
    (1) All other employment; and
    (2) The financial interests of the special Government employee which 
the Chairman determines are relevant in the light of the duties he is to 
perform.
    (b) A special Government employee who is a consultant or expert 
shall submit a statement of employment and financial interests to the 
Personnel Officer, in the format prescribed by the Managing Director, at 
the time of his employment, and shall keep his statement current 
throughout his period of employment by submission of supplementary 
statements.
    (c) The Chairman may waive the requirement in paragraph (a) of this 
section for the submission of a statement of employment and financial 
interests in the case of a special Government employee who is not a 
consultant or an expert when it has been determined that the duties of 
the position held by the special Government employee are of a nature, 
and at such a level of responsibility, that the submission of the 
statement by the incumbent is not necessary to protect the integrity of 
the Board. For the purpose of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, 
the following are examples of special Government employees who are not 
consultants and experts;
    (1) A physician, dentist, or allied medical specialist whose 
services are procured to provide care and service to patients; or
    (2) A veterinarian whose services are procured to provide care and 
service to animals.

<R05>
Sec. 805.735-24  Review of financial statements.

    (a) The Personnel Officer shall review each statement of employment 
and financial interests submitted under the regulations in this part 
(other than his own, which is reviewed by the Managing Director) to 
determine whether conflicts of interest or apparent conflicts of 
interest exist. If the review, or other information from other sources, 
indicates a conflict between the interests of an employee or special 
Government employee and the performance of his services for the Board, 
the Personnel Officer shall forward the statement, together with a 
position description of the employee involved, to the General Counsel of 
the Board.
    (b) The employee or special Government employee whose statement has 
been referred under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section will 
receive, from the General Counsel, advice and guidance regarding the 
matters questioned by the Personnel Officer. He will be afforded an 
opportunity to explain the conflict or appearance of conflict. It is 
expected that most problems will be settled at this informal stage. 
However, if an agreement cannot be reached after consultation, the 
matter shall be reported by the General Counsel, after consulting with 
the Managing Director, to the Chairman for resolution.
    (c) The Chairman may provide the employee or special Government 
employee concerned with an additional opportunity to explain the 
conflict or appearance of conflict. If the matter cannot be resolved, 
the Chairman may invoke the disciplinary provisions of Sec. 805.735-27, 
or may decide that remedial steps shall be taken with regard to such 
employee or special Government employee. When the questions of conflict 
of interest are resolved at one of the stages of review, the reviewing 
official shall sign and date a copy of the employee's statement to 
evidence his clearance, and this statement shall thereafter be kept as 
provided in Sec. 805.735-21.

the Board at the time of his entrance on duty; and

Members, employees, and special Government employees of the Board,

regulations and instructions, and Board regulations as may currently 
appertain to their standards of ethical and other conduct.
    (c) The General Counsel of the Board is designated to provide 
counseling and assistance to interpret the regulations in this part and 
matters relating to ethical conduct, particularly matters subject to the 
provisions of the conflict-of-interest laws and other matters covered by 
the Executive order. These counseling services are available to all 
Members, employees, and special Government employees at the General 
Counsel's office, by appointment for consultation or by written 
communication.

submission of a statement of employment and financial interests, may 
request review through the Board's grievance procedure.


<R05>
Sec. 805.735-27  Disciplinary or remedial action.

    (a) A violation of the regulations in this part by an employee or 
special Government employee may be cause

[[Page 976]]

for disciplinary action in addition to any penalty prescribed by Federal 
statute or regulation, except for active duty officers or enlisted 
members of the Armed Forces detailed to the Board in which cases 
disciplinary actions may be effected against such military personnel by 
the parent military service. Disciplinary action may take the form of a 
warning, suspension, demotion, or removal, depending upon the gravity of 
the offense.
    (b) Any employee or special Government employee who is charged with 
a violation of the regulations in this part shall be provided an 
opportunity to explain the violation, or appearance of violation, to the 
charging authority. The charging authority shall be the Managing 
Director of the Board.
    (c) When, after consideration of the explanation, the charging 
authority decides that disciplinary action is not required, he may take 
appropriate remedial action. Remedial action may include, but is not 
limited to:
    (1) Changes in assigned duties;
    (2) Divestment by the employee or special Government employee of any 
financial interest that conflicts, or appears to conflict, with the 
performance of his official duties; or
    (3) Disqualification for a particular assignment.
    (d) Remedial or disciplinary action shall be effected in accordance 
with any applicable laws, Executive orders, and regulations.

Sec.
806.1  General policy.
806.2  Applicability.
806.3  Definitions.
806.4  Mandatory review for declassification.

    Authority:  Sec. 304, Independent Safety Board Act of 1974, 88 Stat. 
2168 (49 U.S.C. 1903). E.O. 12065, 43 FR 28949, July 3, 1978.

    Source:  45 FR 20104, Mar. 27, 1980, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 806.1  General policy.

    (a) The interests of the United States and its citizens are best 
served by making information regarding the affairs of Government readily 
available to the public. This concept of an informed citizenry is 
reflected in the Freedom of Information Act and in the current public 
information policies of the executive branch.
    (b) Within the Federal Government there is some official information 
and material which, because it bears directly on the effectiveness of 
our national defense and the conduct of our foreign relations, must be 
subject to some constraints for the security of our Nation and the 
safety of our people and our allies. To protect against actions hostile 
to the United States, of both an overt and covert nature, it is 
essential that such official information and material be given only 
limited dissemination.


<R05>
Sec. 806.2  Applicability.

    This rule supplements Executive Order 12065 within the Board with 
regard to national security information. It establishes general policies 
and certain procedures for the classification and declassification of 
information which is generated, processed, and/or stored by the Board. 
In this connection, the Board does not have any original classification 
authority but infrequently does receive classified information from 
other agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 806.3  Definitions.

    (a) Classified information. Information or material, herein 
collectively termed information, that is owned by, produced for or by, 
or under the control of, the United States Government and that has been 
determined pursuant to Executive Order 12065, or prior orders, to 
require protection against unauthorized disclosure and that is so

Sec. 807.140  Employment.

    No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, be 
subjected to discrimination in employment under any program or activity 
conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and procedures

established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or 
activities.


<R05>
Secs. 807.141--807.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 807.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 807.150, no qualified 
handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 807.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does 
not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; or
    (2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 807.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.
    (b) Methods. The agency may comply with the requirements of this 
section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of 
services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, 
home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, 
alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, 
use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in 
making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The agency is nor required to make structural 
changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in 
achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making 
alterations to existing buildings, shall meet

[[Page 982]]

accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by June 6, 1986, except that 
where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by April 7, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by October 7, 1986, a transition plan setting 
forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall 
provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped 
persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped 
persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.

<R05>
Sec. 807.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the 
Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 
CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.

Sec. 807.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
handicapped person.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In

[[Page 983]]

those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed 
action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result 
in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden 
of proving that compliance with Sec. 807.160 would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would 
result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any 
other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens 
but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, 
handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.

for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed 
within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The agency may 
extend this time period for good cause.
    (e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have 
jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make 
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate government 
entity.
    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), or section 502 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 792), is not readily

on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section 
may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.

    (a) Who must be served. (1) Copies of all documents filed with the 
Board must be served on all parties to the proceeding by the person

    I hereby certify that I have this day served the foregoing 
document(s) on the following parties' counsel or designated 
representatives [or on the party, if without counsel or representative] 
at the address indicated by [specify the method of service: first class 
mail, personal service, etc.] [indicate names and addresses here]

    Dated at ________________, this ______ day of ______, 19______.

(Signature)______________
For (on behalf of)______________''

    (2) Service shall be made on the person designated in accordance 
with Sec. 821.7(f) to receive service. If no such person has been 
designated, service shall be made on the party.
    (b) Method of service. Except as set forth in paragraph (c) and (d) 
of this section and as required by Sec. 821.57(b), the method of service 
is the same as that set forth in Sec. 821.7(a) for filing of documents. 
The Board will serve orders, notices of hearing, and written initial 
decisions on attorneys or representatives designated under Sec. 821.7(f) 
or, if no attorney or representative, on the party itself, and will do 
so by certified mail, except that service on the Administrator will be 
by first-class mail.
    (c) Where service shall be made. Except for personal service, 
addresses for service of documents shall be those in the official record 
or, if none in the case of the Federal Aviation Administration, the 
Office of the Chief Counsel, Washington, DC 20591. In the case of an 
agent designated by an air carrier under section 1005(b) of the Act, 
service of any sort may be accomplished only at the agent's office or 
usual place of residence.
    (d) Presumption of service. There shall be a presumption of lawful 
service:
    (1) When acknowledgement of receipt is by a person who customarily 
or in the ordinary course of business receives mail at the residence or

under Sec. 821.7(f); or
    (2) When a properly addressed envelope, sent to the most current 
address in the official record by regular, registered, or certified 
mail, has been returned as undelivered, unclaimed, or refused.
    (e) Date of service. The date of service shall be determined in the 
same manner as the filing date is determined under Sec. 821.7(a).
[59 FR 59047, Nov. 15, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 821.9  Intervention and amicus appearance.

    (a) Intervention. Any person may move for leave to intervene in a 
proceeding and may become a party thereto, if it is found that such 
person may be bound by any order to be entered in the proceeding, or 
that such person has a property, financial, or other legitimate interest 
that will not be adequately represented by existing parties, and that 
such intervention will not unduly broaden the issues or delay the 
proceedings. Except for good cause shown, no motion for leave to 
intervene will be entertained if filed less

[[Page 988]]

than 10 days prior to hearing. The extent to which an intervenor may 
participate in the proceedings is within the law judge's discretion, and 
depends on the above criteria.
    (b) Amicus curiae briefs. A brief of amicus curiae in matters on 
appeal from initial decisions may be filed if accompanied by written 
consent of all the parties, or if, in the opinion of the Board's General 
Counsel, the brief will not unduly broaden the matters at issue or 
unduly prejudice any party to the litigation. A brief may be 
conditionally filed with motion for leave. The motion shall identify the 
interest of the movant and shall state the reasons why a brief of amicus 
curiae is desirable. Such brief and motion shall be filed within the 
time allowed the party whose position as to affirmance or reversal the 
brief would support, unless cause for late filing is shown, in which 
event the General Counsel may provide an opportunity for response as a 
condition of acceptance.
[59 FR 59047, Nov. 15, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 821.10  Computation of time.

    In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this part, 
by notice or order of the Board or a law judge, or by any applicable 
statute, the date of the act, event, or default after which the 
designated period of time begins to run is not to be included in the 
computation. The last day of the period so computed is to be included 
unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday for the Board, in 
which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is 
neither a Saturday, Sunday, nor a legal holiday. Saturdays, Sundays, and 
legal holidays for the Board shall be computed in the calculation of 
time in all emergency cases under subpart I of this part and shall be 
counted in the computation of time in all nonemergency cases where the 
period of time involves 7 days or more.
[56 FR 56172, Nov. 1, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 821.11  Extension of time.

    (a) Upon written request filed with the Board and served on all 
parties, or by oral request with any extension granted confirmed in 
writing and served on all parties, and for good cause shown, the chief 
judge, the law judge, or the Board may grant an extension of time to 
file any document except a petition for reconsideration.
    (b) The Board's General Counsel is authorized to grant unopposed 
extensions on timely oral request without a showing of good cause in 
cases appealed to the Board from a decision of a law judge. Written 
confirmation of such a grant must promptly be sent by the requesting 
party to the Board and served on other parties.
    (c) Extensions of time to file petitions for reconsideration will be 
granted only in extraordinary circumstances.

<R05>
Sec. 821.12  Amendment and withdrawal of pleadings.

    (a) Amendment. At any time more than 15 days prior to the hearing, a 
party may amend his pleadings by filing the amended pleading with the 
Board and serving copies on the other parties. After that time, 
amendment shall be allowed only at the discretion of the law judge. In 
the case of amendment to an answerable pleading, the law judge shall 
allow the adverse party a reasonable time to object or answer. 
Amendments to complaints shall be consistent with the requirements of 49 
U.S.C. 44709(c) and 44710(c).
    (b) Withdrawal. Except in the case of withdrawal of an appeal to the 
Board, withdrawal of a petition for review, withdrawal of a complaint, 
or withdrawal of an appeal from an initial decision, a party may 
withdraw pleadings only on approval of a law judge or the Board.
[59 FR 59047, Nov. 15, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 821.13  Waivers.

    Waivers of any rights provided by statute or regulation shall either 
be in writing, or by stipulation made at a hearing and entered into the 
record, and shall set forth their precise terms and conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 821.14  Motions.

    (a) General. An application to the Board or to a law judge for an 
order or ruling not otherwise provided for in this part shall be by 
motion. Prior to

[[Page 989]]

the assignment of a law judge, all motions shall be addressed to the 
chief law judge. Thereafter, and prior to the expiration of the period 
within which an appeal from the law judge's initial decision may be 
filed, or the certification of the record to the Board, all motions 
shall be addressed to the law judge. At all other times, motions shall 
be addressed to the Board, Office of General Counsel. All motions not 
specifically provided for in any other section of this part shall be 
made at an appropriate time, depending on the nature thereof and the 
relief requested.
    (b) Form and contents. Unless made during a hearing, motions shall 
be made in writing, shall state with particularity the grounds for the 
relief sought, and the relief sought, and shall be accompanied by 
affidavits or other evidence relied upon. Motions introduced during 
hearings may be made orally on the record, unless the law judge directs 
otherwise.
    (c) Answers to motions. Except when a motion is made during a 
hearing, any party may file an answer in support of or in opposition to 
a motion, accompanied by such affidavits or other evidence as he desires 
to rely upon, provided that the answer is filed with 15 days after the 
motion has been served upon him, or such other period as the Board or a 
law judge may fix. Where a motion is made during a hearing, the answer 
and the ruling thereon may be made at the hearing, or orally or in 
writing within such time as the law judge may fix.
    (d) Oral argument; briefs. No oral argument will be heard on motions 
unless the Board or the law judge directs otherwise. Written memoranda 
or briefs may be filed with motions or answers to motions, stating the 
points and authorities relied upon in support of the positions taken.
    (e) Disposition of motions. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of 
this section for rulings on motions made at a hearing, the law judge 
shall pass upon all motions properly addressed to him, unless he finds 
that a prompt decision by the Board is essential to the proper conduct 
of the proceeding, in which case he may refer such motion to the Board 
for decision.
    (f) Effect of pendency of motions. Except as provided in 
Secs. 821.17(a) and 821.18, the filing or pendency of a motion shall not 
automatically alter or extend the time fixed in this part (or any 
extension granted thereunder) to take action by the parties.
[40 FR 30243, July 17, 1975, as amended at 54 FR 12203, Mar. 24, 1989; 
59 FR 59047, Nov. 15, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 821.15  Motion to disqualify a Board Member.

    A motion requesting a Board Member to disqualify himself shall be 
filed with the Board, supported by an affidavit setting forth grounds 
for disqualification. In nonemergency proceedings, where an appeal from 
an initial decision is filed, such motion shall be filed on or before 
the date on which the reply brief is due, pursuant to Sec. 821.48(d). In 
emergency proceedings, where a notice of appeal has been filed, such 
motion shall be filed on or before the date the reply brief is due, 
pursuant to Sec. 821.57(b). Failure to file a timely motion shall be 
deemed a waiver of any claim of disqualification. Application for leave 
to file an untimely motion may be made, accompanied by an affidavit 
setting forth in detail why the facts relied upon as grounds for 
disqualification were not known and could not have been discovered with 
reasonable diligence within the prescribed time.


<R05>
Sec. 821.16  Appeals from law judge's interlocutory rulings and motions.

    Rulings of law judges on motions may not be appealed to the Board 
prior to its consideration of the entire proceeding, except in 
extraordinary circumstances and with the consent of the law judge who 
made the ruling. An appeal shall be disallowed unless the law judge 
finds, either on the record or in writing, that to allow such an appeal 
is necessary to prevent substantial detriment to the public interest or 
undue prejudice to any party. If an appeal is allowed, any party may 
file a brief with the Board within such time as the law judge directs. 
No oral argument will be heard unless the Board directs otherwise. The 
rulings of the law judge on motion may be reviewed by the Board in 
connection with its appellate

[[Page 990]]

action in the proceeding, irrespective of the filing of an appeal from 
the motion or any action taken thereon.


<R05>
Sec. 821.17  Motion to dismiss and for judgment on the pleadings.

    (a) General. A motion to dismiss may be filed within the time 
limitation for filing an answer, except as otherwise provided in 
paragraph (d) of this section. If the motion is not granted in its 
entirety, the answer shall be filed within 10 days of service of the law 
judge's order on the motion.
    (b) Judgment on the pleadings. A party may file a motion for 
judgment on the pleadings where no answer has been filed or where there 
are no issues to be resolved.
    (c) Appeal of dismissal orders and grants of motions for judgment on 
the pleadings. When a law judge grants a motion for judgment on the 
pleadings or a motion to dismiss in lieu of an answer and terminates the 
proceeding without a hearing, an appeal of such order to the Board may 
be filed pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 821.47. When a law judge 
grants a motion to dismiss in part, Sec. 821.16 is applicable.
    (d) Motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. A motion to dismiss 
on the ground that the Board lacks jurisdiction may be made at any time.
[49 FR 28249, July 11, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 821.18  Motion for more definite statement.

    (a) A party, in lieu of an answer, may file a motion requesting that 
the allegations in the complaint or the petition be made more definite 
and certain. The motion shall point out the defects complained of and 
the details desired. If the motion is granted and the law judge's order 
is not complied with within 15 days after notice, the law judge shall 
strike the allegation or allegations in any complaint or petition to 
which the motion is directed. If the motion is denied, the moving party 
shall file an answer within 10 days after the denial.
    (b) A party may file a motion to clarify an answer in the event that 
it fails to respond clearly either to the complaint or to the petition 
for review. Such a motion may be granted at the discretion of the law 
judge.
[49 FR 28249, July 11, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 821.19  Depositions and other discovery.

    (a) Initiation of discovery. After a petition for review or a 
complaint is filed, any party may take the testimony of any person, 
including a party, by deposition, upon oral examination or written 
questions, without seeking prior Board approval. Reasonable notice shall 
be given in writing to the other parties of record stating the name of 
the witness and the time and place of the taking of the deposition. A 
copy of any notice of deposition shall be served on the Office of 
Administrative Law Judges. In other respects, the taking of any 
deposition shall be in compliance with the provisions of section 1004 of 
the Act.
    (b) Exchange of information by parties. At any time before hearing, 
at the instance of either party, the parties or their representatives 
may exchange information, such as witness lists, exhibit lists, 
curricula vitae and bibliographies of expert witnesses, and other data. 
In the event of a dispute, either the assigned law judge or another law 
judge delegated this responsibility (if a law judge has not yet been 
assigned) may issue an order directing compliance with any ruling made 
with respect to discovery. Any party may also use written 
interrogatories, requests to admit, or other discovery tools. Copies of 
discovery requests and responses shall be served on the law judge 
assigned to the proceeding.
    (c) Use of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Those portions of 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that pertain to depositions and 
discovery may be used as a general guide for discovery practice in 
proceedings before the Board where appropriate. The Federal Rules and 
the case law that construes them shall be considered by the Board and 
its law judges as instructive rather than controlling.
    (d) Failure to provide or preserve evidence. The failure of any 
party to comply with an order of an administrative law judge compelling 
discovery or to cooperate in a timely request for the preservation of 
evidence may result in

[[Page 991]]

a negative inference against that party with respect to the matter 
sought and not provided or preserved, a preclusion order, or dismissal.
[49 FR 28250, July 11, 1984, as amended at 59 FR 59047, Nov. 15, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 821.20  Subpoenas, witness fees, and appearances of Board Members, officers, or employees.

    (a) Subpoenas. Subpoenas requiring the attendance of witnesses or 
the production of documentary or tangible evidence for the purpose of 
taking depositions or at a hearing may be issued by the chief law judge 
prior to the assignment of a law judge, or by the law judge to whom the 
case is assigned, upon application by any party. The application shall 
show the general relevance and reasonable scope of the evidence sought. 
Any person upon whom a subpoena is served may, within 7 days after 
service but in any event prior to the return date thereof, file with the 
chief law judge or the law judge, as the case may be, a motion to quash 
or modify the subpoena, and such filing shall stay the subpoena pending 
final action by the chief law judge or the law judge on the motion.
    (b) Witness fees. Witnesses shall be entitled to the same fees and 
mileage as are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United States. The 
fees shall be paid by the party at whose instance the witness is 
subpoenaed or appears. The Board may decline to process a proceeding 
further should a party fail to compensate a witness pursuant to this 
paragraph.
    (c) Board Members, officers, or employees. In order to encourage a 
free flow of information to the Board's accident investigators, the 
Board disfavors the use of its personnel in enforcement proceedings. 
Therefore, the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section are not 
applicable to Board Members, officers, or employees, or the production 
of documents in their custody. Applications for the attendance of such 
persons or the production of such documents at hearing shall be 
addressed to the chief law judge or the assigned law judge, as the case 
may be, in writing, and shall set forth the need of the moving party for 
such testimony, and a showing that such testimony is not now, or was not 
otherwise, reasonably available from other sources. The law judge shall 
not permit such testimony or documentary evidence to include any opinion 
testimony, or any account of statements of a respondent, made during the 
Board's investigation of any accident.
[40 FR 30243, July 17, 1975, as amended at 59 FR 59048, Nov. 15, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 821.21  Official notice.

    Where the law judge or the Board intends to take official notice of 
a material fact not appearing in the evidence in the record, notice

                               of the Act


<R05>
Sec. 821.24  Initiation of proceedings.

    (a) Petition for review. Where the Administrator has denied an 
application for the issuance or renewal of an airman certificate, the 
applicant may file with the Board a petition for review of the 
Administrator's action within 60 days from the time the Administrator's 
action was served on petitioner. The petition shall contain a short 
statement of the facts on which petitioner's case depends and a 
statement of the requested action, and may be in letter form.
    (b) Filing petition with the Board. The petition for review shall be 
filed with the Board and the date of filing shall be determined in the 
same manner as prescribed by Sec. 821.7(a) for other documents.
    (c) Answer to petition. The Administrator shall file an answer to 
the petition for review within 20 days of service upon him by the 
petitioner of the petition for review. Failure to deny the truth of any 
allegation or allegations of the petition may be deemed an admission of 
the truth of the allegation or allegations not answered.
    (d) Stay of proceeding pending request for special issuance 
(restricted certificate). The Board lacks authority to review special 
issuances, or to direct that they

[[Page 992]]

be issued. Where a request for special issuance (restricted certificate) 
has been filed with the Administrator pursuant to the Federal Aviation 
Regulations, the Board will hold a petition for review in abeyance 
pending final action by the Administrator or for 180 days from the date 
of the Administrator's initial certificate denial, whichever occurs 
first.
    (e) New evidence. If petitioner has undergone medical testing or 
evaluation in addition to that already submitted or known to the 
Administrator, and wishes to introduce the results into the record, the 
new medical evidence must be served on the Administrator at least 30 
days before the hearing. Absent good cause, failure timely to serve any 
new evidence will result in its exclusion from the record. The 
Administrator may amend his answer within 10 days from the date the new 
evidence is served to respond to such new evidence.

<R05>
Sec. 821.26  Motion to dismiss petition for review for lack of standing.

    Upon motion by the Administrator within the time limitation for 
filing an answer, a petition for review shall be dismissed for lack of 
standing in either of the following instances:
    (a) If the petitioner's certificate at the time of the denial or 
renewal thereof was under an order of suspension; or
    (b) If the petitioner's certificate had been revoked within one year 
of the date of the denial or renewal thereof, unless the order revoking 
such certificate provided otherwise.

proof of service on the Administrator.
    (b) Contents. Each appeal shall contain a concise but complete 
statement of the facts relied on and the relief sought. It shall 
identify the Administrator's order and any certificate affected and 
shall recite the Administrator's action from which the appeal is sought. 
It shall also contain proof of service on the Administrator.
    (c) Effect of timely appeal with the Board. Timely filing with the 
Board of an appeal from an order of the Administrator shall postpone the 
effective date of the order until final disposition of the appeal by the 
law judge or the Board, except in emergency proceedings.

<R05>
Sec. 821.31  Complaint procedure.

    (a) Filing, time of filing, and service on respondent. The order of 
the Administrator from which an appeal has been taken shall serve as the 
complaint. The complaint shall be filed by the Administrator with the 
Board within 10 days after the service date of the notice of appeal.
    (b) Contents of complaint. If the Administrator claims that 
respondent lacks qualification as an airman, the order filed as the 
complaint, or an accompanying statement shall recite on which of the 
facts pleaded this contention is based.
    (c) Answer to complaint. The respondent shall file an answer to the 
complaint within 20 days of service of the complaint upon him by the 
Administrator. Failure to deny the truth of any allegation or 
allegations in the complaint may be deemed an admission of the truth of 
the allegation or allegations not answered. Respondent's answer shall 
also include any affirmative defense that respondent intends to raise at 
the hearing. A respondent may amend his answer to include any 
affirmative defense in accordance with the requirements of 
Sec. 821.12(a). In the

[[Page 993]]

discretion of the law judge, any affirmative defense not so pleaded may 
be deemed waived.

    In proceedings under section 609 of the Act, the burden of proof 
shall be upon the Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 821.33  Motion to dismiss stale complaint.

    Where the complaint states allegations of offenses which occurred 
more than 6 months prior to the Administrator's advising respondent as 
to reasons for proposed action under section 609 of the Act, respondent 
may move to dismiss such allegations pursuant to the following 
provisions:
    (a) In those cases where a complaint does not allege lack of 
qualification of the certificate holder:
    (1) The Administrator shall be required to show by answer filed 
within 15 days of service of the motion that good cause existed for the 
delay, or that the imposition of a sanction is warranted in the public 
interest, notwithstanding the delay or the reasons therefor.
    (2) If the Administrator does not establish good cause for the delay 
or for imposition of a sanction notwithstanding the delay, the law judge 
shall dismiss the stale allegations and proceed to adjudicate only the 
remaining portion, if any, of the complaint.
    (3) If the law judge wishes some clarification as to the 
Administrator's factual assertions of good cause, he shall obtain this 
from the Administrator in writing, with due service made upon the 
respondent, and proceed to an informal determination of the good cause 
issue without a hearing. A hearing to develop facts as to good cause 
shall be held only where the respondent raises an issue of fact in 
respect of the Administrator's good cause issue allegations.
    (b) In those cases where the complaint alleges lack of qualification 
of the certificate holder:
    (1) The law judge shall first determine whether an issue of lack of 
qualification would be presented if any or all of the allegations, stale 
and timely, are assumed to be true. If not, the law judge shall proceed 
as in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) If the law judge deems that an issue of lack of qualification 
would be presented by any or all of the allegations, if true, he shall 
proceed to a hearing on the lack of qualification issue only, and he 
shall so inform the parties. The respondent shall be put on notice that 
he is to defend against lack of qualification and not merely against a 
proposed remedial sanction.

<R05>
Sec. 821.35  Assignment, duties, and powers.

    (a) Assignment of law judge and duration of assignment. The chief 
law judge shall assign a law judge to preside over the proceeding. Until 
such assignment, motions, requests, and documents shall be addressed to 
the Docket Section, Office of Administrative Law Judges, for handling by 
the chief law judge, who may handle these matters personally or who may 
delegate all or any of them to other law judges for decision. After 
assignment, all motions, requests, and documents shall be addressed to 
that law judge. The authority of the assigned law judge shall terminate 
upon certification of the record to the Board, or upon expiration of the 
period within which appeals from initial decisions may be filed, or upon 
the law judge's withdrawal from the proceeding.
    (b) Powers of law judges. Law judges shall have the following 
powers:
    (1) To give notice of and to hold prehearing conferences and 
hearings and to consolidate proceedings which involve a common question 
of law or fact;
    (2) To administer oaths and affirmations;
    (3) To examine witnesses;
    (4) To issue subpoenas and to take or cause depositions to be taken;
    (5) To receive evidence and rule upon objections and offers of 
proof;
    (6) To rule upon motions in assigned cases;

[[Page 994]]

    (7) To regulate the conduct of the hearing;
    (8) To hold conferences, before or during the hearing for the 
settlement or simplification of issues;
    (9) To dispose of procedural requests or similar matters; and
    (10) To make initial decisions, and, if so directed by the Board, to 
certify records with or without recommended decisions.
    (c) Disqualification of a law judge. A law judge shall withdraw from 
the proceedings if at any time he deems himself disqualified. If, prior 
to the initial decision, there is filed an affidavit of personal bias or 
disqualifications, with substantiating facts, and the law judge does not 
withdraw, the Board will determine the matter as a part of the record 
and decision in the proceeding, if an appeal from the law judge's 
initial decision is filed. The Board will not otherwise consider any 
claim of bias or disqualification as to the law judge's assignment to 
conduct the hearing. The Board, in its discretion, may order a hearing 
on a charge of bias or disqualification.

Sec. 821.37  Notice of hearing.

    (a) Notice. The chief law judge (or his law judge delegate) or the 
law judge to whom the case is assigned shall set a reasonable date, time 
and place for the hearing. The notice of the hearing shall be served at 
least 30 days in advance thereof, and shall include notice of the nature 
of the hearing. The law judge may set the hearing fewer than 30 days 
after the notice of hearing is served if the parties agree to an earlier 
hearing date. In setting the hearing date, due regard shall be given to 
any need for discovery. In setting the place of the hearing, due regard 
shall be given to the convenience of the parties and to conservation of 
Board funds. The location of the witnesses and the suitability of a site 
served by a scheduled air carrier are added factors to be considered in 
setting the hearing location, as is Board policy that foreign-held 
hearings are appropriate only in the most extraordinary circumstances.
    (b) Hearings in several sessions. Where appropriate, the law judge 
may determine that a hearing will be held in one or more sessions at the 
same or different places.

true disclosure of the facts. Hearsay evidence (including hearsay within 
hearsay where there are acceptable circumstantial indicia of 
trustworthiness) is admissible.
    (b) All material and relevant evidence should be admitted, but a law 
judge may exclude unduly repetitious evidence pursuant to Sec. 556(d) of 
the Administrative Procedure Act. Any evidence that is offered and 
excluded may be described (via an ``offer of proof''), and that 
description should be made a part of the record.

not render an initial decision but shall only recommend to the Board a 
decision as provided in 5 U.S.C. 557 (Administrative Procedure).


<R04>

decision orally at the close of the hearing, or he may render such 
decision in writing at a later date, except as provided in 
Sec. 821.56(b).
    (b) Contents. The initial decision shall include a statement of 
findings and conclusions, and the grounds therefor, upon all material 
issues of fact, credibility of witnesses, law, or discretion presented 
on the record, the appropriate order, and the reasons therefor.
    (c) Furnishing copy of oral decision and issuance date. If the 
initial decision is rendered orally, a copy thereof, excerpted from the 
transcript of the record, shall be furnished the parties by the Office 
of Administrative Law Judges. Irrespective of the date of mailing of 
such copy, the issuance date of the decision shall be the actual date of 
the rendering of the oral decision.

Sec. 821.43  Effect of law judge's initial decision and filing of an appeal therefrom.

    If an appeal from the initial decision is not timely filed with the 
Board by a party, the initial decision shall become final but shall not 
be precedent binding on the Board. The filing of a timely appeal shall 
stay the initial decision.

<R04>
                Subpart H--Appeals from Initial Decisions


<R05>
Sec. 821.47  Notice of appeal.

    (a) A party may appeal from a law judge's order or from the initial 
decision by filing with the Board and serving on the other parties 
(pursuant to Sec. 821.8) a notice of appeal within 10 days after an oral 
initial decision has been rendered or a written decision or a final or 
appealable (see Sec. 821.16) order has been served. At any time before 
the date for filing an appeal from an initial decision or order has 
passed, the law judge or the Board may, for good cause shown, extend the 
time within which to file an appeal, and the law judge may also reopen 
the case for good cause on notice to the parties.
    (b) A law judge may not reconsider his initial decision once the 
time for appealing to the Board from the initial decision has expired or 
once an appeal with the Board has been filed. However, a timely request 
for reconsideration by the law judge of his decision, filed before an 
appeal to the Board has been taken, will stay the deadline for appealing 
to the Board until 10 days after the date the law judge serves his 
decision on the request. For the purpose of this section, a request for 
reconsideration submitted on the same date as a notice of appeal will be 
deemed to have been filed first.
[59 FR 59049, Nov. 15, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 821.48  Briefs and oral argument.

    (a) Appeal briefs. Each appeal must be perfected within 50 days 
after an oral initial decision has been rendered, or 30 days after 
service of a written initial decision, by filing with the Board and 
serving on the other party a brief in support of the appeal. Appeals may 
be dismissed by the Board on its own initiative or on motion of the 
other party, in cases where a party who has filed a notice of appeal 
fails to perfect his appeal by filing a timely brief.
    (b) Contents of appeal brief. Each appeal brief shall set forth in 
detail the objections to the initial decision, and shall state whether 
such objections are related to alleged errors in the law judge's 
findings of fact and conclusions or alleged errors in his order. It 
shall

[[Page 996]]

also state the reasons for such objections and the relief requested.
    (c) Waiver of objections on appeal. Any error contained in the 
initial decision which is not objected to may be deemed to have been 
waived. Where any objection is based upon evidence of record, such 
objection need not be considered by the Board unless specific record 
citations to the pertinent evidence are furnished in the appeal brief.
    (d) Reply brief. A brief in reply to the appeal brief may be filed 
by the other party within 30 days after the appeal brief has been served 
upon him. A copy of the reply brief shall be served upon the party who 
has appealed from the initial decision. Where the reply brief relies 
upon evidence of record, specific record citations to the pertinent 
evidence shall be furnished in the reply brief.
    (e) Other briefs. Subsequent to brief filing, parties may file 
citations to supplemental authorities. This procedure may be used only 
for identifying new, relevant decisions, not to correct omissions in 
briefing or to respond to a reply. No argument may be included in such 
filings. Parties shall submit, with any decision, a reference to the 
page of the brief to which the decision pertains. Any response shall be 
filed within 10 days and shall be similarly limited. With this 
exception, no further briefs may be filed, except with specific 
permission of the Board and on a showing of good cause.
    (f) Oral argument. Oral argument before the Board will normally not 
be held in proceedings under this part. However, when need therefor 
appears, the Board may permit oral argument, either on its own 
initiative or on motion of a party.

<R05>
Sec. 821.49  Issues on appeal.

    (a) On appeal, the Board will consider only the following issues:
    (1) Are the findings of fact each supported by a preponderance of 
reliable, probative, and substantial evidence?
    (2) Are conclusions made in accordance with law, precedent, and 
policy?
    (3) Are the questions on appeal substantial?
    (4) Have any prejudicial errors occurred?
    (b) If the Board determines that the law judge erred in any respect 
or that his order in his initial decision should be changed, the Board 
may make any necessary findings and may issue an order in lieu of the 
law judge's order or may remand the case for such purposes as the Board 
may deem necessary. The Board on its own initiative may raise any issue, 
the resolution of which it deems important to a proper disposition of 
the proceedings. If necessary or appropriate, a reasonable opportunity 
shall be afforded the parties to comment.

reargument, reconsideration, or modification of a Board order on appeal 
from an initial decision. Any such petitions shall be served on all 
other parties to the proceeding within 30 days after service of the 
Board's order on appeal from the initial decision. Initial decisions 
that have become final because they were not appealed may not be the 
subject of petitions under this section.
    (b) Timing and service. The petition shall be filed with the Board 
and served on the parties within 30 days after service of the Board's 
order on appeal from the initial decision.
    (c) Contents. The petition shall state briefly and specifically the 
matters of record alleged to have been erroneously decided, the ground 
or grounds relied upon, and the relief sought. If the petition is based, 
in whole or in part, on allegations as to the consequences that would 
result from the order of the Board, the basis of such allegations shall 
be set forth. If the petition is based, in whole or in part, upon new 
matter, it shall set forth such new matter and shall contain affidavits 
of prospective witnesses, authenticated documents, or both, or an 
explanation why such substantiation is unavailable, and shall explain 
why such new matter could not have been discovered by the exercise of 
due diligence prior to the date of the hearing.

[[Page 997]]

    (d) Grounds for dismissal. Repetitious petitions will not be 
entertained by the Board and will be summarily dismissed.
    (e) Reply to petition. Within 15 days after the service of the 
petition upon an adverse party, he may reply thereto by filing a copy of 
the reply with the Board, with proof of service upon the petitioner.
    (f) Stay of effective date of order. The filing of a petition under 
this section shall operate to stay the effective date of the Board 
order, unless otherwise ordered by the Board.

2 days after the initial decision has been orally rendered, either party

Board, all briefs in emergency cases shall be served via overnight 
delivery or facsimile confirmed by first class mail. Within 5 days after 
the filing of the notice of appeal, the appellant shall file a brief 
with the Board and serve a copy on the other parties. Within 7 days 
after service of the appeal brief, a reply brief may be filed, with 
copies served (as provided above) on other parties. The briefs shall 
comply with the requirements of Sec. 821.48 (b) through (g). Appeals may 
be dismissed by the Board on its own initiative or on motion of a party, 
notably in cases where a party fails to perfect the notice of appeal by 
filing a timely brief. When a request for oral argument is granted, the 
Board will give notice of such argument.
    (c) Issues on appeal. The provisions of Sec. 821.49 shall apply to 
issues on appeal. However, the Board may upon its own initiative raise 
any issue, the resolution of which it deems important to a proper 
disposition of the proceeding. If necessary or appropriate, the parties 
shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to comment.
    (d) Petitions for reconsideration, rehearing, reargument, or 
modification of order. The only petitions for reconsideration, 
rehearing, reargument, or modification of an order which the Board will 
entertain are petitions based on the ground that new matter has been 
discovered. Such petitions must set forth the following:
    (1) The new matter;
    (2) Affidavits of prospective witnesses, authenticated documents, or 
both, or an explanation of why such substantiation is unavailable; and
    (3) A statement that such new matter could not have been discovered 
by the exercise of due diligence prior to the date the case was 
submitted to the Board.

Sec. 821.60  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart:
    Board decisional employee means a Board Member, administrative law 
judge, or other employee who is or who may reasonably be expected to be 
involved in the decisional process of the proceeding;
    Ex parte communication means an oral or written communication not on 
the public record with respect to which reasonable prior notice to all 
parties is not given, but it shall not include requests for status 
reports on any matter or proceeding covered by this part.


<R05>
Sec. 821.61  Prohibited ex parte communications.

    (a) The prohibitions of this section shall apply from the time a 
proceeding is noticed for hearing unless the person responsible for the 
communication has knowledge that it will be noticed, in which case the 
prohibitions shall apply at the time of the acquisition of such 
knowledge.
    (b) Except to the extent required for the disposition of ex parte 
matters as authorized by law:
    (1) No interested person outside the Board shall make or knowingly 
cause to be made to any Board employee an ex parte communication 
relevant to the merits of the proceeding;
    (2) No Board employee shall make or knowingly cause to be made to 
any interested person outside the Board an ex parte communication 
relevant to the merits of the proceeding.

Ex parte communications regarding solely matters of board procedure or 
practice are not prohibited by this section.


<R05>
Sec. 821.62  Procedures for handling ex parte communication.

    A Board employee who receives or who makes or knowingly causes to be 
made a communication prohibited by Sec. 821.61 shall place on the public 
record of the proceeding:
    (a) All such written communications;
    (b) Memoranda stating the substance of all such oral communications; 
and
    (c) All written responses, and memoranda stating the substance of 
all oral responses, to the materials described in paragraphs (a) and (b)

<R05>
Sec. 821.63  Requirement to show cause and imposition of sanction.

    (a) Upon receipt of a communication knowingly made or knowingly 
caused to be made by a party in violation of Sec. 821.61, the Board, 
administrative law judge, or other employee presiding at the hearing 
may, to the extent consistent with the interests of justice and the 
policy of the underlying statutes, require the party to show cause why 
his or her claim or interest in the proceeding should not be dismissed, 
denied, disregarded, or otherwise adversely affected on account of such 
violation.
    (b) The Board may, to the extent consistent with the interests of 
justice and the policy of the underlying statutes it administers, 
consider a violation of this subpart sufficient grounds for a decision 
adverse to a party who has knowingly committed or knowingly caused a 
violation to occur. Alternatively, the Board may impose sanction, 
including suspension of the privilege of practice before the Board, on 
the party's attorney or representative, where an infraction has been 
committed by that attorney or representative and penalizing the party 
represented is not in the interest of justice.

               Subpart K--Judicial Review of Board Orders


<R05>
Sec. 821.64  Judicial review.

    (a) General. Judicial review of a final order of the Board may be 
sought as provided in section 1006 of the Act (49 U.S.C. 46110) and 
section 304(d) of the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 (49 U.S.C. 
1153) by filing a petition for review with the appropriate United States 
court of appeals within 60 days of the date of entry (service date) of 
the Board's order. Under the Federal Aviation Act, as amended, any party 
may appeal the Board's decision. The Board itself does not typically 
participate in the judicial review of its action. In matters appealed by 
the FAA, respondents should anticipate the need to make their own 
defense.
    (b) Stay pending judicial review. No petition for stay pending 
judicial review

[[Page 1000]]

will be entertained if it is received by the Board after the effective 
date of the Board's order. If a stay action is to be timely, any 
petition must be filed sufficiently in advance of the effective date of 
the Board's order to allow for the possibility of a reply and to allow 
for Board review.

<R04>
                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 826.1  Purpose of these rules.

    The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (the Act), provides 
for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible 
individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative 
proceedings (adversary adjudications) before the National Transportation 
Safety Board (Board). An eligible party may receive an award when it 
prevails over the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), unless the 
Government agency's position in the proceeding was substantially 
justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in 
this part describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings 
that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the 
procedures and standards that this Board will use to make them. As used 
hereinafter, the term ``agency'' applies to the FAA.


<R05>
Sec. 826.2  When the Act applies.

    The Act applies to any adversary adjudication identified in 
Sec. 826.3 as covered under the Act.
[59 FR 30531, June 14, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 826.3  Proceedings covered.

    (a) The Act applies to certain adversary adjudications conducted by 
the Board. These are adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the 
position of the FAA is presented by an attorney or

[[Page 1003]]

other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the 
proceedings. Proceedings to grant or renew certificates or documents, 
hereafter referred to as ``licenses,'' are excluded, but proceedings to 
modify, suspend, or revoke licenses or to impose a civil penalty on a 
flight engineer, mechanic, pilot, or repairman (or person acting in that 
capacity) are covered if they are otherwise ``adversary adjudications.'' 
For the Board, the type of proceeding covered includes (but may not be 
limited to) aviation enforcement cases appealed to the Board under 
sections 501, 609, 611 and 901 of the Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C. 
44101 et seq., 44720-44711, 44715, 46301).
    (b) The Board may also designate a proceeding not listed in 
paragraph (a) as an adversary adjudication for purposes of the Act by so 
stating in an order initiating the proceeding or designating the matter 
for hearing. The Board's failure to designate a proceeding as an 
adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of an application 
by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the Act; whether 
the procedure is covered will then be an issue for resolution in 
proceedings on the application.
    (c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and 
matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include 
only fees and expenses related to covered issues.
[46 FR 48209, Oct. 1, 1981, as amended at 59 FR 59054, Nov. 15, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 826.4  Eligibility of applicants.

    (a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses 
under the Act, the applicant must be a party to the adversary 
adjudication for which it seeks an award. The term ``party'' is defined 
in 5 U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant must show that it meets all conditions 
of eligibility set out in this subpart and in subpart B.
    (b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:
    (1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;
    (2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth 
of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business 
interests, and not more than 500 employees;
    (3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in 
section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) 
with not more than 500 employees;
    (4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the 
Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 
employees; and
    (5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, or public or 
private organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million and 
not more than 500 employees.
    (c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of 
employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the 
proceeding was initiated.
    (d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be 
considered an ``individual'' rather than a ``sole owner of an 
unincorporated business'' if the issues on which the applicant prevails 
are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business 
interests.
    (e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly 
perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the 
applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included 
on a proportional basis.
    (f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all 
of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any 
individual, corporation, or other entity that directly or indirectly 
controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of 
the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant 
directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares 
or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this 
part, unless the administrative law judge determines that such treatment 
would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the 
actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the 
administrative law judge may determine that financial relationships of 
the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute 
special circumstances that would make an award unjust.
    (g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on 
behalf of one

[[Page 1004]]

or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible is not itself 
eligible for an award.
[46 FR 48209, Oct. 1, 1981, as amended at 54 FR 10332, Mar. 13, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 826.5  Standards for awards.

    (a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and 
expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding, or in a significant 
and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position 
of the agency over which the applicant has prevailed was substantially 
justified. The burden of proof that an award should not be made to an 
eligible prevailing applicant is on the agency counsel, who may avoid an 
award by showing that the agency's position was reasonable in law and 
fact.
    (b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly 
or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if special circumstances 
make the award sought unjust.


<R05>
Sec. 826.6  Allowable fees and expenses.

    (a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons 
engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents, and expert 
witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at 
a reduced rate to the applicant.
    (b)(1) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these 
rules may exceed $75 indexed as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN94.001


The CPI to be used is the annual average CPI, All Urban Consumers, U.S. 
City Average, All Items, except where a local, All Item index is 
available. Where a local index is available, but results in a manifest 
inequity vis-a-vis the U.S. City Average, the U.S. City Average may be 
used. The numerator of that equation is the yearly average for the 
year(s) the services were provided, with each year calculated 
separately. If an annual average CPI for a particular year is not yet 
available, the prior year's annual average CPI shall be used. This 
formula increases the $75 statutory cap by indexing it to reflect cost 
of living increases, as authorized in 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(A)(ii). 
Application of these increased rate caps requires affirmative findings 
under Sec. 821.6(c) of this chapter. For ease of application, available 
U.S. City figures are reproduced as follows:

    (2) No award to compensate an expert witness may exceed the highest 
rate at which the agency pays expert witnesses. However, an award may 
also include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or witness 
as a separate item, if the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily 
charges clients separately for such expenses.
    (c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an 
attorney, agent, or expert witness, the administrative law judge shall 
consider the following:
    (1) If the attorney, agent, or witness is in private practice, his 
or her customary fee for similar services, or if an employee of the 
applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;
    (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in 
which the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily performs services;
    (3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;
    (4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or 
complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and
    (5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services 
provided.
    (d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, 
test, project, or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be 
awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed

<R05>
Sec. 826.7  Rulemaking on maximum rates for attorney fees.

    (a) In addition to increases based on cost of living (see 
Sec. 826.6), attorney fees in some or all of the proceedings covered by 
this part may also be increased beyond the statutory cap of $75 if 
warranted by special factors (such as limited availability of attorneys 
qualified to handle certain types of proceedings). The Board will 
conduct any rulemaking proceedings for this purpose under the informal 
rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act.
    (b) Any person may file with the Board a petition for rulemaking to 
increase the maximum rate for attorney fees by demonstrating that a 
special factor(s) justifies a higher fee. The petition shall identify 
the rate the petitioner believes the Board should establish and the 
proceeding(s) or types of proceedings in which the rate should be used. 
It should also explain fully the reasons why the higher rate is 
warranted. The Board will respond to the petition within 60 days after 
it is filed, by initiating a rulemaking proceeding, denying the 
petition, or taking other appropriate action.

<R04>
             Subpart B--Information Required From Applicants


<R05>
Sec. 826.21  Contents of application.

    (a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the Act 
shall identify the applicant and the proceeding for which an award is 
sought. The application shall show that the applicant has prevailed and 
identify the position of the agency in the proceeding that the applicant 
alleges was not substantially justified. Unless the applicant is an 
individual, the application shall also state the number of employees of 
the applicant and describe briefly the type and purpose of its 
organization or business.
    (b) The application shall also include a statement that the 
applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or 
$7 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). 
However, an applicant may omit this statement if:
    (1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service 
that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of 
the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)), or in the case of a 
tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the 
Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that 
describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under 
such section; or
    (2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in 
section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)).
    (c) The application shall state the amount of fees and expenses for 
which an award is sought.
    (d) The application may also include any other matters that the 
applicant wishes this agency to consider in determining whether and in 
what amount an award should be made.
    (e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an 
authorized officer or attorney for the applicant. It shall also contain 
or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty 
of perjury that the information provided in the application is true and 
correct.
[46 FR 48209, Oct. 1, 1981, as amended at 59 FR 30532, June 14, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 826.22  Net worth exhibit.

    (a) Each applicant except a qualified tax-exempt organization or 
cooperative association must provide with its application a detailed 
exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as 
defined in Sec. 826.4(f) of this part) when the proceeding was 
initiated. The exhibit may be in any form

[[Page 1006]]

convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the 
applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient 
to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this 
part. The administrative law judge may require an applicant to file 
additional information to determine the eligibility for an award.
    (b) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public 
record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public 
disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes 
there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit 
that portion of the exhibit directly to the administrative law judge in 
a sealed envelope labeled ``Confidential Financial Information,'' 
accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public 
disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be 
withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the 
specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of 
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (1) through (9), why public disclosure 
of the information would adversely affect the applicant, and why 
disclosure is not required in the public interest. The material in 
question shall be served on counsel representing the agency against 
which the applicant seeks an award, but need not be served on any other 
party to the proceeding. If the administrative law judge finds that the 
information should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed 
in the public record of the proceeding. Otherwise, any request to 
inspect or copy the exhibit shall be disposed of in accordance with the 
Board's established procedures under the Freedom of Information Act as 
inplemented by Part 801 of the Board's rules.


<R05>
Sec. 826.23  Documentation of fees and expenses.

    The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the 
fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, 
engineering report, test, project or similar matter, for which an award 
is sought. A separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each 
professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the 
application, showing the hours spend in connection with the proceeding 
by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, 
the rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which 
reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount 
paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for 
the services provided. The administrative law judge may require the 
applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any 
expenses claimed.


<R05>
Sec. 826.24  When an application may be filed.

    (a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed 
in the proceeding, but in no case no later than the 30 days after the 
Board's final disposition of the proceeding. This 30-day deadline is 
statutory and the Board has no authority to extend it.
    (b) If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision to 
which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the award 
of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the underlying 
controversy.
    (c) For purposes of this rule, final disposition means the later of 
(1) the date on which an unappealed initial decision by an 
administrative law judge becomes administratively final; (2) issuance of 
an order disposing of any petitions for reconsideration of the Board's 
final order in the proceeding; (3) if no petition for reconsideration is 
filed, the last date on which such a petition could have been filed; or 
(4) issuance of a final order or any other final resolution of a 
proceeding, such as a settlement or voluntary dismissal, which is not 
subject to a petition for reconsideration.

the Act,

[[Page 1007]]

unless they are superseded by or are inconsistent with a provision of 
this part.
[59 FR 30532, June 14, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 826.32  Answer to application.

    (a) Within 30 days after service of an application, counsel 
representing the agency against which an award is sought may file an 
answer to the application. Unless agency counsel requests an extension 
of time for filing or files a statement of intent to negotiate under 
paragraph (b) of this section, failure to file an answer within the 30-
day period may be treated as a consent to the award requested.
    (b) If agency counsel and the applicant believe that the issues in 
the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of 
their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement 
shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, 
and further extensions may be granted by the administrative law judge 
upon request by agency counsel and the applicant.
    (c) The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award 
requested and identify the facts relied on in support of agency 
counsel's position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not 
already in the record of the proceeding, agency counsel shall include 
with the answer either supporting affidavits or a request for further 
proceedings under Sec. 826.36.


<R05>
Sec. 826.33  Reply.

    Within 15 days after service of an answer, the applicant may file a 
reply. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not already in the 
record of the proceeding, the applicant shall include with the reply 
either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under 
Sec. 826.36.


<R05>
Sec. 826.34  Comments by other parties.

    Any party to a proceeding other than the applicant and agency 
counsel may file comments on an application within 30 days after it is 
served or on an answer within 15 days after it is served. A commenting 
party may not participate further in proceedings on the application 
unless the administrative law judge determines that the public interest 
requires such participation in order to permit full exploration of 
matters raised in the comments.


<R05>
Sec. 826.35  Settlement.

    The applicant and agency counsel may agree on a proposed settlement 
of the award before final action on the application, either in 
connection with a settlement of the underlying proceeding, or after the 
underlying proceeding has been concluded. If a prevailing party and 
agency counsel agree on a proposed settlement of an award before an 
application has been filed, the application shall be filed with the 
proposed settlement.


<R05>
Sec. 826.36  Further proceedings.

    (a) Ordinarily the determination of an award will be made on the 
basis of the written record; however, on request of either the applicant 
or agency counsel, or on his or her own initiative, the administrative 
law judge assigned to the matter may order further proceedings, such as 
an informal conference, oral argument, additional written submissions, 
or an evidentiary hearing. Such further proceedings shall be held only 
when necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from 
the application and shall be conducted as promptly as possible.
    (b) A request that the administrative law judge order further 
proceedings under this section shall specifically identify the 
information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why the 
additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.


<R05>
Sec. 826.37  Decision.

    The administrative law judge shall issue an initial decision on the 
application within 60 days after completion of proceedings on the 
application. The decision shall include written findings and conclusions 
on the applicant's eligibility and status as a prevailing party and an 
explanation of the reasons for any difference between the amount 
requested and the amount awarded. The decision shall also include, if at 
issue, findings on whether the agency's position was substantially 
justified, whether the applicant unduly protracted the proceedings, or 
whether

[[Page 1008]]

special circumstances make an award unjust.


<R05>
Sec. 826.38  Board review.

    Either the applicant or agency counsel may seek review of the 
initial decision on the fee application, or the Board may decide to 
review the decision on its own initiative, in accordance with subpart H 
of part 821 for FAA safety enforcement matters appealed under section 
609 of the Federal Aviation Act. If neither the applicant nor agency 
counsel seeks review and the Board does not take review on its own 
initiative, the initial decision on the application shall become a final 
decision of the Board 30 days after it is issued. Whether to review a 
decision is a matter within the discretion of the Board. If review is 
taken, the Board will issue a final decision on the application or 
remand the application to the administrative law judge who issued the 
initial fee award determination for further proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 826.39  Judicial review.

    Judicial review of final Board decisions on awards may be sought as 
provided in 5 U.S.C. 504(c)(2).


<R05>

    An applicant seeking payment of an award shall submit to the 
disbursing official of the FAA a copy of the Board's final decision

to: The Office of Accounting and Audit, AAA-1, Federal Aviation 
Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591. The 
agency will pay the amount awarded to the applicant within 60 days, 
unless judicial review of the award or of the underlying decision of the 
adversary adjudication has been sought by the applicant or any other 
party to the proceeding.

    This part contains rules pertaining to:
    (a) Initial notification and later reporting of aircraft incidents 
and accidents and certain other occurrences in the operation of 
aircraft, wherever they occur, when they involve civil aircraft of the 
United States; when they involve certain public aircraft, as specified 
in this part, wherever they occur; and when they involve foreign civil

[60 FR 40112, Aug. 7, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 830.2  Definitions.

    As used in this part the following words or phrases are defined as 
follows:
    Aircraft accident means an occurrence associated with the operation 
of an aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards the 
aircraft with the intention of flight and all such persons have 
disembarked, and in which any person suffers death or serious injury, or 
in which the aircraft receives substantial damage.
    Civil aircraft means any aircraft other than a public aircraft.
    Fatal injury means any injury which results in death within 30 days 
of the accident.
    Incident means an occurrence other than an accident, associated with 
the operation of an aircraft, which affects or could affect the safety 
of operations.
    Operator means any person who causes or authorizes the operation of 
an aircraft, such as the owner, lessee, or bailee of an aircraft.
    Public aircraft means an aircraft used only for the United States 
Government, or an aircraft owned and operated (except for commercial 
purposes) or exclusively leased for at least 90 continuous days by a 
government other than the United States Government, including a State, 
the District of Columbia, a territory or possession of the United 
States, or a political subdivision of that government. ``Public 
aircraft'' does not include a government-owned aircraft transporting 
property for commercial purposes and does not include a government-owned 
aircraft transporting passengers other than: transporting (for other 
than commercial purposes) crewmembers or other persons aboard the 
aircraft whose presence is required to perform, or is associated with 
the performance of, a governmental function such as firefighting, search 
and rescue, law enforcement, aeronautical research, or biological or 
geological resource management; or transporting (for other than 
commercial purposes) persons aboard the aircraft if the aircraft is 
operated by the Armed Forces or an intelligence agency of the United 
States. Notwithstanding any limitation relating to use of the aircraft 
for commercial purposes, an aircraft shall be considered to be a public 
aircraft without regard to whether it is operated by a unit of 
government on behalf of another unit of government pursuant to a cost 
reimbursement agreement, if the unit of government on whose behalf the 
operation is conducted certifies to the Administrator of the Federal 
Aviation Administration that the operation was necessary to respond to a 
significant and imminent threat to life or property (including natural 
resources) and that no service by a private operator was reasonably 
available to meet the threat.
    Serious injury means any injury which: (1) Requires hospitalization 
for more than 48 hours, commencing within 7 days from the date of the 
injury was received; (2) results in a fracture of any bone (except 
simple fractures of fingers, toes, or nose); (3) causes severe 
hemorrhages, nerve, muscle, or tendon damage; (4) involves any internal 
organ; or (5) involves second- or third-degree burns, or any burns 
affecting more than 5 percent of the body surface.
    Substantial damage means damage or failure which adversely affects 
the structural strength, performance, or flight characteristics of the 
aircraft, and which would normally require major repair or replacement 
of the affected component. Engine failure or damage limited to an engine 
if only one engine fails or is damaged, bent fairings or cowling, dented 
skin, small punctured holes in the skin or fabric, ground damage to 
rotor or propeller blades, and damage to landing gear, wheels, tires, 
flaps, engine accessories, brakes, or wingtips are not considered 
``substantial damage'' for the purpose of this part.

when the accident/

[[Page 1012]]

incident is not in the territory of another country (i.e., in 
international waters).
    (2) Certain aviation investigations may be conducted by the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA), pursuant to a ``Request to the Secretary 
of the Department of Transportation to Investigate Certain Aircraft 
Accidents,'' effective February 10, 1977 (the text of the request is 
contained in the appendix to part 800 of this chapter), but the Board 
determines the probable cause of such accidents or incidents.\1\ Under 
no circumstances are aviation investigations where the portion of the 
investigation is so delegated to the FAA by the Board considered to be 
joint investigations in the sense of sharing responsibility. These 
investigations remain NTSB investigations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The authority of a representative of the FAA during such 
investigations is the same as that of a Board investigator under this 
part.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) The Board is the agency charged with fulfilling the obligations 
of the United States under Annex 13 to the Chicago Convention on 
International Civil Aviation (Eighth Edition, July 1994), and does so 
consistent with State Department requirements and in coordination with 
that department. Annex 13 contains specific requirements for the 
notification, investigation, and reporting of certain incidents and 
accidents involving international civil aviation. In the case of an 
accident or incident in a foreign state involving civil aircraft of U.S. 
registry or manufacture, where the foreign state is a signatory to Annex 
13 to the Chicago Convention of the International Civil Aviation 
Organization, the state of occurrence is responsible for the 
investigation. If the accident or incident occurs in a foreign state not 
bound by the provisions of Annex 13 to the Chicago Convention, or if the 
accident or incident involves a public aircraft (Annex 13 applies only 
to civil aircraft), the conduct of the investigation shall be in 
consonance with any agreement entered into between the United States and 
the foreign state.
    (b) Surface. The Board is responsible for the investigation of: 
railroad accidents in which there is a fatality, substantial property 
damage, or which involve a passenger train (see part 840 of this 
chapter); major marine casualties and marine accidents involving a 
public and non-public vessel or involving Coast Guard functions (see 
part 850 of this chapter \2\); highway accidents, including railroad 
grade-crossing accidents, the investigation of which is selected in 
cooperation with the States; and pipeline accidents in which there is a 
fatality, significant injury to the environment, or substantial property 
damage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Part 850 also governs the conduct of certain investigations in 
which the Board and the Coast Guard participate jointly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Other Accidents/Incidents. The Board is also responsible for the 
investigation of an accident/incident that occurs in connection with the 
transportation of people or property which, in the judgment of the 
Board, is catastrophic, involves problems of a recurring character, or 
would otherwise carry out the policy of the Independent Safety Board Act 
of 1974. This authority includes, but is not limited to, marine and 
boating accidents and incidents not covered by part 850 of this chapter, 
and accidents/incidents selected by the Board involving transportation 
and/or release of hazardous materials.

Sec. 831.3  Authority of Directors.

    The Director, Office of Aviation Safety, or the Director, Office of 
Surface Transportation Safety, subject to the provisions of Sec. 831.2 
and part 800 of this chapter, may order an investigation into any 
accident or incident.
[62 FR 3806, Jan. 27, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 831.4  Nature of Investigation.

    Accident and incident investigations are conducted by the Board to 
determine the facts, conditions, and circumstances relating to an 
accident or incident and the probable cause(s) thereof. These results 
are then used to ascertain measures that would best tend to prevent 
similar accidents or incidents in the future. The investigation includes 
the field investigation (on-

[[Page 1013]]

scene at the accident, testing, teardown, etc.), report preparation, 
and, where ordered, a public hearing. The investigation results in Board 
conclusions issued in the form of a report or ``brief'' of the incident 
or accident. Accident/incident investigations are fact-finding 
proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties. They are not 
subject to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 
504 et seq.), and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the 
rights or liabilities of any person.
[62 FR 3806, Jan. 27, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 831.5  Priority of Board Investigations.

    Any investigation of an accident or incident conducted by the Safety 
Board directly or pursuant to the appendix to part 800 of this chapter 
(except major marine investigations conducted under 49 U.S.C. 
1131(a)(1)(E)) has priority over all other investigations of such 
accident or incident conducted by other Federal agencies. The Safety 
Board shall provide for the appropriate participation by other Federal 
agencies in any such investigation, except that such agencies may not 
participate in the Safety Board's determination of the probable cause of 
the accident or incident. Nothing in this section impairs the authority 
of other Federal agencies to conduct investigations of an accident or 
incident under applicable provisions of law or to obtain information 
directly from parties involved in, and witnesses to, the transportation 
accident or incident, provided they do so without interfering with the 
Safety Board's investigation. The Safety Board and other Federal 
agencies shall assure that appropriate information obtained or developed 
in the course of their investigations is exchanged in a timely manner.
[62 FR 3807, Jan. 27, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 831.6  Request to withhold information.

    (a) Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. 1905), Exemption 4 of the Freedom 
of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) (FOIA), and The Independent Safety 
Board Act of 1974, as amended.
    (1) General. The Trade Secrets Act provides criminal penalties for 
unauthorized government disclosure of trade secrets and other specified 
confidential commercial information. The Freedom of Information Act 
authorizes withholding of such information; however, the Independent 
Safety Board Act, at 49 U.S.C. 1114(b), provides that the Board may, 
under certain circumstances, disclose information related to trade 
secrets.
    (2) Procedures. Information submitted to the Board that the 
submitter believes qualifies as a trade secret or confidential 
commercial information subject either to the Trade Secrets Act or FOIA 
Exemption 4 shall be so identified by the submitter on each and every 
page of such document. The Board shall give the submitter of any 
information so identified, or information the Board has substantial 
reason to believe qualifies as a trade secret or confidential commercial 
information subject either to the Trade Secrets Act or FOIA Exemption 4, 
the opportunity to comment on any contemplated disclosure, pursuant to 
49 U.S.C. 1114(b). In all instances where the Board determines to 
disclose pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 1114(b) and/or 5 U.S.C. 552, at least 10 
days' notice will be provided the submitter. Notice may not be provided 
the submitter when disclosure is required by a law other than FOIA if 
the information is not identified by the submitter as qualifying for 
withholding, as is required by this paragraph, unless the Board has 
substantial reason to believe that disclosure would result in 
competitive harm.
    (3) Voluntarily-provided Safety Information. It is the policy of the 
Safety Board that commercial, safety-related information provided to it 
voluntarily and not in the context of particular accident/incident 
investigations will not be disclosed. Reference to such information for 
the purposes of safety recommendations will be undertaken with 
consideration for the confidential nature of the underlying database(s).
    (b) Other. Any person may make written objection to the public 
disclosure of any other information contained in any report or document 
filed, or otherwise obtained by the Board, stating the grounds for such 
objection.

[[Page 1014]]

The Board, on its own initiative or if such objection is made, may order 
such information withheld from public disclosure when, in its judgment, 
the information may be withheld under the provisions of an exemption to 
the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552, see part 801 of this 
chapter), and its release is found not to be in the public interest.
[62 FR 3807, Jan. 27, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 831.7  Right to representation.

    Any person interviewed by an authorized representative of the Board 
during the investigation, regardless of the form of the interview 
(sworn, unsworn, transcribed, not transcribed, etc.), has the right to 
be accompanied, represented, or advised by an attorney or non-attorney 
representative.
[62 FR 3807, Jan. 27, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 831.8  Investigator-in-charge.

    The designated investigator-in-charge (IIC) organizes, conducts, 
controls, and manages the field phase of the investigation, regardless 
of whether a Board Member is also on-scene at the accident or incident 
site. (The role of the Board member at the scene of an accident 
investigation is as the official spokesperson for the Safety Board.) The 
IIC has the responsibility and authority to supervise and coordinate all 
resources and activities of all personnel, both Board and non-Board, 
involved in the on-site investigation. The IIC continues to have 
considerable organizational and management responsibilities throughout 
later phases of the investigation, up to and including Board 
consideration and adoption of a report or brief of probable cause(s).
[62 FR 3807, Jan. 27, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 831.9  Authority of Board representatives.

    (a) General. Any employee of the Board, upon presenting appropriate 
credentials, is authorized to enter any property where an accident/
incident subject to the Board's jurisdiction has occurred, or wreckage 
from any such accident/incident is located, and do all things considered 
necessary for proper investigation. Further, upon demand of an 
authorized representative of the Board and presentation of credentials, 
any Government agency, or person having possession or control of any 
transportation vehicle or component thereof, any facility, equipment, 
process or controls relevant to the investigation, or any pertinent 
records or memoranda, including all files, hospital records, and 
correspondence then or thereafter existing, and kept or required to be 
kept, shall forthwith permit inspection, photographing, or copying 
thereof by such authorized representative for the purpose of 
investigating an accident or incident, or preparing a study, or related 
to any special investigation pertaining to safety or the prevention of 
accidents. The Safety Board may issue a subpoena, enforceable in Federal 
district court, to obtain testimony or other evidence. Authorized 
representatives of the Board may question any person having knowledge 
relevant to an accident/incident, study, or special investigation. 
Authorized representatives of the Board also have exclusive authority, 
on behalf of the Board, to decide the way in which any testing will be 
conducted, including decisions on the person that will conduct the test, 
the type of test that will be conducted, and any individual who will 
witness the test.
    (b) Aviation. Any employee of the Board, upon presenting appropriate 
credentials, is authorized to examine and test to the extent necessary 
any civil or public aircraft (as specified in Sec. 830.5), aircraft 
engine, propeller, appliance, or property aboard such aircraft involved 
in an accident in air commerce.
    (c) Surface. (1) Any employee of the Board, upon presenting 
appropriate credentials, is authorized to test or examine any vehicle, 
vessel, rolling stock, track, pipeline component, or any part of any 
such item when such examination or testing is determined to be required 
for purposes of such investigation.
    (2) Any examination or testing shall be conducted in such a manner 
so as not to interfere with or obstruct unnecessarily the transportation 
services provided by the owner or operator of such vehicle, vessel, 
rolling stock, track, or pipeline component, and shall

[[Page 1015]]

be conducted in such a manner so as to preserve, to the maximum extent 
feasible, any evidence relating to the transportation accident, 
consistent with the needs of the investigation and with the cooperation 
of such owner or operator.
[53 FR 15847, May 4, 1988, as amended at 60 FR 40113, Aug. 7, 1995; 62 
FR 3807, Jan. 27, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 831.10  Autopsies.

    The Board is authorized to obtain, with or without reimbursement, a 
copy of the report of autopsy performed by State or local officials on 
any person who dies as a result of having been involved in a 
transportation accident within the jurisdiction of the Board. The 
investigator-in-charge, on behalf of the Board, may order an autopsy or 
seek other tests of such persons as may be necessary to the 
investigation, provided that to the extent consistent with the needs of 
the accident investigation, provisions of local law protecting religious 
beliefs with respect to autopsies shall be observed.


<R05>
Sec. 831.11  Parties to the investigation.

    (a) All Investigations, regardless of mode. (1) The investigator-in-
charge designates parties to participate in the investigation. Parties 
shall be limited to those persons, government agencies, companies, and 
associations whose employees, functions, activities, or products were 
involved in the accident or incident and who can provide suitable 
qualified technical personnel actively to assist in the investigation. 
Other than the FAA in aviation cases, no other entity is afforded the 
right to participate in Board investigations.
    (2) Participants in the investigation (i.e., party representatives, 
party coordinators, and/or the larger party organization) shall be 
responsive to the direction of Board representatives and may lose party 
status if they do not comply with their assigned duties, actively 
proscriptions or instructions, or if they conduct themselves in a manner 
prejudicial to the investigation.
    (3) No party to the investigation shall be represented in any aspect 
of the NTSB investigation by any person who also represents claimants or 
insurers. No party representative may occupy a legal position (see 
Sec. 845.13 of this chapter). Failure to comply with these provisions 
may result in sanctions, including loss of status as a party.
    (4) Title 49, United States Code Sec. 1132 provides for the 
appropriate participation of the FAA in Board investigations, and 
Sec. 1131(a)(2) provides for such participation by other departments, 
agencies, or instrumentalities. The FAA and those other entities that 
meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be 
parties to the investigation with the same rights and privileges and 
subject to the same limitations as other parties, provided however that 
representatives of the FAA need not sign the ``Statement of Party 
Representatives to NTSB Investigation'' (see paragraph (b) of this 
section).
    (b) Aviation investigations. In addition to compliance with the 
provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, and to assist in ensuring 
complete understanding of the requirements and limitations of party 
status, all party representatives in aviation investigations shall sign 
``Statement of Party Representatives to NTSB Investigation'' immediately 
upon attaining party representative status. Failure timely to sign that 
statement may result in sanctions, including loss of status as a party.
[62 FR 3808, Jan. 27, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 831.12  Access to and release of wreckage, records, mail, and cargo.

    (a) Only the Board's accident investigation personnel, and persons 
authorized by the investigator-in-charge to participate in any 
particular investigation, examination or testing shall be permitted 
access to wreckage, records, mail, or cargo in the Board's custody.
    (b) Wreckage, records, mail, and cargo in the Board's custody shall 
be released by an authorized representative of the Board when it is 
determined that the Board has no further need of such wreckage, mail, 
cargo, or records. When such material is released, Form 6120.15, 
``Release of Wreckage,'' will be completed, acknowledging receipt.

[[Page 1016]]


<R05>
Sec. 831.13  Flow and dissemination of accident or incident information.

    (a) Release of information during the field investigation, 
particularly at the accident scene, shall be limited to factual 
developments, and shall be made only through the Board Member present at 
the accident scene, the representative of the Board's Office of Public 
Affairs, or the investigator-in-charge.
    (b) All information concerning the accident or incident obtained by 
any person or organization participating in the investigation shall be 
passed to the IIC through appropriate channels before being provided to 
any individual outside the investigation. Parties to the investigation 
may relay to their respective organizations information necessary for 
purposes of prevention or remedial action. However, no information 
concerning the accident or incident may be released to any person not a 
party representative to the investigation (including non-party 
representative employees of the party organization) before initial 
release by the Safety Board without prior consultation and approval of 
the IIC.
[53 FR 15847, May 4, 1988, as amended at 62 FR 3808, Jan. 27, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 831.14  Proposed findings.

    (a) General. Any person, government agency, company, or association 
whose employees, functions, activities, or products were involved in an 
accident or incident under investigation may submit to the Board written 
proposed findings to be drawn from the evidence produced during the 
course of the investigation, a proposed probable cause, and/or proposed 
safety recommendations designed to prevent future accidents.
    (b) Timing of submissions. To be considered, these submissions must 
be received before the matter is calendared for consideration at a Board 
meeting. All written submissions are expected to have been presented to 
staff in advance of the formal scheduling of the meeting. This procedure 
ensures orderly and thorough consideration of all views.
    (c) Exception. This limitation does not apply to safety enforcement 
cases handled by the Board pursuant to part 821 of this chapter. 
Separate ex parte rules, at part 821, subpart J, apply to those 
proceedings.

    Source:  55 FR 41541, Oct. 12, 1990, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 835.1  Purpose.

    This part prescribes the policies and procedures regarding the 
testimony of employees of the National Transportation Safety Board 
(Board) in suits or actions for damages and criminal proceedings arising 
out of transportation accidents. The purpose of this part is to ensure 
that the time of Board employees is used only for official purposes, to 
avoid embroiling the Board in controversial issues that are not related 
to its duties, to avoid spending public funds for non-Board purposes, to 
preserve the impartiality of the Board, and to prohibit the discovery of 
opinion testimony.


<R05>
Sec. 835.2  Definitions.

    Accident for purposes of this part includes ``incident.''
    Board's accident report means the report containing the Board's 
determinations, including the probable cause of an accident, issued 
either as a narrative report or in a computer format (briefs of 
accidents). Pursuant to section 701(e) of the Federal Aviation Act of 
1958, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1441(e)) (FA Act) and section 304(c) of the 
Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 (49 U.S.C. 1903(c)) (Safety Act), 
no part of these reports may be admitted as evidence or used in any suit 
or action for

[[Page 1017]]

damages growing out of any matter mentioned in such reports.
    Factual accident report means an investigator's report of his 
investigation of the accident.


<R05>
Sec. 835.3  Scope of permissible testimony.

    (a) Section 701(e) of the FA Act and section 304(c) of the Safety 
Act preclude the use or admission into evidence of Board accident 
reports in any suit or action for damages arising from accidents. These 
sections reflect Congress' ``strong * * * desire to keep the Board free 
of the entanglement of such suits.'' Rep. No. 93-1192, 93d Cong., 2d 
Sess., 44 (1974), and serve to ensure that the Board does not exert an 
undue influence on litigation. The purposes of these sections would be 
defeated if expert opinion testimony of Board employees, which may be 
reflected in the views of the Board expressed in its reports, were 
admitted in evidence or used in litigation arising out of an accident. 
The Board relies heavily upon its investigators' opinions in its 
deliberations. Furthermore, the use of Board employees as experts to 
give opinion testimony would impose a significant administrative burden 
on the Board's investigative staff. Litigants must obtain their expert 
witnesses from other sources.
    (b) For the reasons stated in paragraph (a) of this section and 
Sec. 835.1, Board employees may only testify as to the factual 
information they obtained during the course of an investigation, 
including factual evaluations embodied in their factual accident 
reports. However, they shall decline to testify regarding matters beyond 
the scope of their investigation, and they shall not give any expert or 
opinion testimony.


<R05>
Sec. 835.4  Use of reports.

    (a) A Board employee may use a copy of his factual accident report 
as a testimonial aid, and may refer to that report during his testimony 
or use it to refresh his memory.
    (b) Consistent with section 701(e) of the FA Act and section 304(c) 
of the Safety Act, a Board employee may not use the Board's accident 
report for any purpose during his testimony.


<R05>
Sec. 835.5  Manner in which testimony is given.

    (a) Testimony of Board employees may be made available for use in 
actions or suits for damages arising out of accidents through 
depositions or written interrogatories. Board employees are not 
permitted to appear and testify in court in such actions.
    (b) Normally, depositions will be taken and interrogatories answered 
at the Board's office to which the employee is assigned, and at a time 
arranged with the employee reasonably fixed to avoid substantial 
interference with the performance of his duties.
    (c) Board employees are authorized to testify only once in 
connection with any investigation they have made of an accident. 
Consequently, when more than one lawsuit arises as a result of an 
accident, it shall be the duty of counsel seeking the employee's 
deposition to ascertain the identity of all parties to the multiple 
lawsuits and their counsel, and to advise them of the fact that a 
deposition has been granted, so that all interested parties may be 
afforded the opportunity to participate therein.
    (d) Upon completion of the deposition of a Board employee, a copy of 
the transcript of the testimony will be furnished, at the expense of the 
party requesting the desposition, to the Board's Counsel for the Board 
files.


<R05>
Sec. 835.6  Request for testimony.

    (a) A request for testimony of a Board employee relating to an 
accident by deposition or interrogatories shall be addressed to the 
General Counsel, who may approve or deny the request. Such request shall 
set forth the title of the case, the court, the type of accident 
(aviation, railroad, etc.), the date and place of the accident, the 
reasons for desiring the testimony, and a showing that the information 
desired is not reasonably available from other sources.
    (b) The General Counsel shall attach to his approval such reasonable 
conditions as he may deem appropriate in order that the testimony will 
be limited to the matters delineated in Sec. 835.3, will not interfere 
with the performance of the duties of the employees as set

[[Page 1018]]

forth in Sec. 835.5, and will otherwise conform to the policies of this 
part.
    (c) A subpoena shall not be served upon a Board employee in 
connection with the taking of his deposition.


<R05>
Sec. 835.7  Testimony of former Board employees.

    It is not necessary to request Board approval for testimony of a 
former Board employee. However, the scope of testimony of former Board 
employees is limited to the matters delineated in Sec. 835.3, and use of 
reports as prescribed by Sec. 835.4.


<R05>
Sec. 835.8  Procedure in the event of a subpoena.

    (a) If a Board employee has received a subpoena to appear and 
testify, a request for his deposition shall not be approved until the 
subpoena has been withdrawn.
    (b) Upon receipt of a subpoena, the employee shall immediately 
notify the General Counsel and provide the data identifying the 
accident; the title of the case, the name of the judge, if available, 
and the title and address of the court; the type of accident (aviation, 
railroad, etc.); the date on which the employee is directed to appear; 
the name, address, and telephone number, if available, of the attorney 
representing the party who caused the issuance of the subpoena; the 
scope of the testimony, if known; and a statement as to whether a prior 
deposition on the same accident has been given.
    (c) The General Counsel shall determine the course of action to be 
taken and will so advise the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 835.9  Testimony in State or local investigations.

    Board employees may testify at a coroner's inquest, grand jury, or 
criminal proceeding conducted by a State of local government. Testimony 
shall be limited to the matters delineated in Sec. 835.3.

<R05>
Sec. 837.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This part sets forth procedures to be followed when requesting 
material for use in legal proceedings (including administrative 
proceedings) in which the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB or 
Board) is not a party, and procedures to be followed by the employee 
upon receipt of a subpoena, order, or other demand (collectively 
referred to here as a demand) by a court or other competent authority or 
by a private litigant. ``Material,'' as used in this part, means any 
type of physical or documentary evidence, including but not limited to 
paper documents, electronic media, videotapes, audiotapes, etc.
    (b) The purposes of this part are to:
    (1) Conserve the time of employees for conducting official business;
    (2) Minimize the possibility of involving the NTSB in controversial 
issues not related to its mission;
    (3) Maintain the impartiality of the Board among private litigants;
    (4) Avoid spending the time and money of the United States for 
private purposes; and
    (5) To protect confidential, sensitive information, and the 
deliberative processes of the Board.


<R05>
Sec. 837.2  Applicability.

    This part applies to requests to produce material concerning 
information acquired in the course of performing official duties or 
because of the employee's official status. Specifically, this part 
applies to requests for: material contained in NTSB files; and any 
information or material acquired by an employee of the NTSB in the 
performance of official duties or as a result of the employee's status. 
Two sets of procedures are here established, dependent on the type of 
material sought. Rules governing requests for employee testimony, as 
opposed to material production, can be found at 49 CFR part 835.

[[Page 1019]]

Document production shall not accompany employee testimony, absent 
compliance with this part and General Counsel approval.


<R05>
Sec. 837.3  Published reports, material contained in the public accident investigation dockets, and accident database data.

    (a) Demands for material contained in the NTSB's official public 
docket files of its accident investigations, or its computerized 
accident database(s) shall be submitted, in writing, to the Public 
Inquiries Branch. Demands for specific published reports and studies 
should be submitted to the National Technical Information Service. The 
Board does not maintain stock of these items. Demands for information 
collected in particular accident investigations and made a part of the 
public docket should be submitted to the Public Inquiries Branch or, 
directly, to our contractor. For information regarding the types of 
documents routinely issued by the Board, see 49 CFR part 801.
    (b) No subpoena shall be issued to obtain materials subject to this 
paragraph, and any subpoena issued shall be required to be withdrawn 
prior to release of the requested information. Payment of reproduction 
fees may be required in advance.

Board. Where oral presentation is allowed, the Board will specify the 
issues to be addressed and all parties to the investigation or hearing 
will be given notice and the opportunity to participate.
