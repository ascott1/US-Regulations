                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2005), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page viii]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

Sec. 303.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to provide guidelines and procedures for 
implementing the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's (FMCSA) 
Title VI program under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 
related civil rights laws and regulations. For FMCSA-only programs or 
activities, Federal financial assistance recipients or grantees will 
continue to apply and use the Departmental Title VI provisions at 49 CFR 
part 21. For joint and multi-agency programs/projects, FMCSA Federal 
assistance recipients or grantees must use the Title VI requirements at 
49 CFR part 21, unless agreement is reached by the Federal funding 
agencies for the recipients to use the Title VI procedures of another 
agency.


<R05>
Sec. 303.3  Application of this part.

    The provisions of this part are applicable to all elements of the 
FMCSA and to any program or activity for which Federal financial 
assistance is authorized under a law administered by the FMCSA. This 
part provides Title VI guidelines for State Departments of 
Transportation and local State agencies, including their sub-recipients, 
to implement Title VI. It also applies to money paid, property 
transferred, or other Federal financial assistance extended under any 
program of the FMCSA after the date of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 325.1  Scope of the rules in this part.

    (a) The rules in this part prescribe procedures for inspection, 
surveillance, and measurement of motor vehicles and motor vehicle 
equipment operated by motor carriers to determine whether those vehicles 
and that equipment conform to the Interstate Motor Carrier Noise 
Emission Standards of the Environmental Protection Agency, 40 CFR part 
202.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the rules 
in this part apply to motor carriers engaged in interstate commerce. The 
rules apply at any time or under any condition of highway grade, load, 
acceleration or deceleration.
    (c) The rules in this part do not apply to--
    (1) A motor vehicle that has a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) of 
10,000 pounds (4,536 kg.) or less;
    (2) A combination of motor vehicles that has a Gross Combination 
Weight Rating (GCWR) of 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg.) or less;
    (3) The sound generated by a warning device, such as a horn or 
siren, installed in a motor vehicle, unless such device is intentionally 
sounded in order to preclude an otherwise valid noise emission 
measurement;
    (4) An emergency motor vehicle, such as a fire engine, an ambulance, 
a police van, or a rescue van, when it is responding to an emergency 
call;
    (5) A snow plow in operation; or
    (6) The sound generated by auxiliary equipment which is normally 
operated only when the motor vehicle on which it is installed is stopped 
or is operating at a speed of 5 miles per hour (8 kph) or less, unless 
such device is intentionally operated at speeds greater than 5 mph (8 
kph) in order to preclude an otherwise valid noise measurement. Examples 
of that type of auxiliary equipment include, but are not limited to, 
cranes, asphalt, spreaders, ditch diggers, liquid or slurry pumps, 
auxiliary air compressors, welders, and trash compactors.


<R05>
Sec. 325.3  Effective date.

    The rules in this part are effective on October 15, 1975.


<R05>
Sec. 325.5  Definitions.

    (a) Statutory definitions. All terms defined in the Noise Control 
Act of 1972 (Pub. L. 92-574, 86 Stat. 1234) are used as they are defined 
in that Act.
    (b) Definitions in standards. All terms defined in Sec. 202.10 of 
the Interstate Motor Carrier Noise Emission Standards, 40 CFR 202.10, 
are used as they are defined in that section.
    (c) Additional definitions. (1) Hard test site means any test site 
having the ground surface covered with concrete, asphalt, packed dirt, 
gravel, or similar reflective material for more than \1/2\ the distance 
between the microphone target point and the microphone location point.
    (2) Soft test site means any test site having the ground surface 
covered with grass, other ground cover, or similar absorptive material 
for \1/2\ or more of the distance between the microphone target point 
and the microphone location point.
    (3) Ground cover means any of various low, dense-growing plants, 
such as ivy, myrtle, low weeds, or brush.
    (4) Traffic railing means any longitudinal highway traffic barrier 
system installed along the side or median of a highway. For the purpose 
of this part, a traffic railing must have at least 35 percent of its 
vertical height, from the ground surface to the top of the railing, open 
to free space in order to qualify as an acceptable object within a noise 
measurement test site. Further, for the purposes of this part, posts or 
other discrete supports shall be ignored when ascertaining open free 
space.
    (5) Relatively flat when used to describe a noise measurement site 
means a site which does not contain significant concave curvatures or 
slope reversals that may result in the focusing of

having a lower edge more than 15 feet (4.6 m) higher than the surface of 
the traveled lane of the highway.
    (2) Any uniformly smooth sloping surface slanting away from the 
highway (such as a rise in grade alongside the highway) with a slope 
that is less than 45 degrees above the horizontal.
    (3) Any surface slanting away from the highway that is 45 degrees or 
more and not more than 90 degrees above the horizontal, if all points on 
the surface are more than 15 feet (4.6 m) above the surface of the 
traveled lane of the highway.
    (d) The surface of the ground within the measurement area must be 
relatively flat (see Sec. 325.5(c)(5)). The site shall be a ``soft'' 
test site. However, if the site is determined to be ``hard,'' the 
correction factor specified in Sec. 325.75(a) of this part shall be 
applied to the measurement.
    (e) The traveled lane of the highway within the test site must be 
dry, paved with relatively smooth concrete or asphalt, and substantially 
free of--
    (1) Holes or other defects which would cause a motor vehicle to emit 
irregular tire, body, or chassis impact noise; and
    (2) Loose material, such as gravel or sand.

Sec. 325.35  Ambient conditions; highway operations.

    (a)(1) Sound. The ambient A-weighted sound level at the microphone 
location point shall be measured, in the absence of motor vehicle noise 
emanating from within the clear zone, with fast meter response using a 
sound level measurement system that conforms to the rules of Sec. 
325.23.
    (2) The measured ambient level must be 10 dB(A) or more below that 
level specified in Sec. 325.7, Table 1, which corresponds to the 
maximum permissible sound level reading which is applicable at the test 
site at the time of testing.
    (b) Wind. The wind velocity at the test shall be measured at the 
beginning of each series of noise measurements and at intervals of 5-15 
minutes thereafter until it has been established that the wind velocity 
is essentially constant. Once this fact has been established, wind 
velocity measurements may be made at intervals of once every hour. Noise 
measurements may only be made if the measured wind velocity is 12 mph 
(19.3 kph) or less. Gust wind measurements of up to 20 mph (33.2 kph)

reading observed on the sound level measurement system as the vehicle 
passes through the measurement area, corrected, when appropriate, in 
accordance with the rules in subpart F of this part. (Table 1 in Sec. 
325.7 lists the range of maximum permissible sound level readings for 
various test conditions.) The sound level of the vehicle being measured 
must be observed to rise at least 6 dB(A) before the maximum sound level 
occurs and to fall at least 6 dB(A) after the maximum sound level occurs 
in order to be considered a valid sound level reading.

        Subpart E_Measurement of Noise Emissions; Stationary Test


<R05>
Sec. 325.51  Scope of the rules in this subpart.

    (a) The rules in this subpart specify conditions and procedures for 
measuring the sound level generated by a vehicle when the vehicle's 
engine is rapidly accelerated from idle to governed speed at wide open 
throttle with the vehicle stationary, its transmission in neutral, and 
its clutch engaged, for the purpose of ascertaining whether the motor 
vehicle conforms to the Standard for Operation Under Stationary Test, 40 
CFR 202.21.
    (b) The rules in this subpart apply only to a motor vehicle that is 
equipped with an engine speed governor.
    (c) Tests conducted in accordance with the rules of this subpart may 
be made on either side of the vehicle.


<R05>
Sec. 325.53  Site characteristics; stationary test.

    (a)(1) The motor vehicle to be tested shall be parked on the test 
site. A microphone target point shall be established on the ground 
surface of the site on the centerline of the lane in which the motor 
vehicle is parked at a point that is within 3 feet (.9 m) of the 
longitudinal position of the vehicle's exhaust system outlet(s). A 
microphone location point shall be established on the ground surface not 
less than 31 feet (9.5 m) and not more than 83 feet (25.3 m) from the 
microphone target point. Within the test site is a triangular 
measurement area. A plan view diagram of a standard test site, having an 
open site within a 50-foot (15.2 m) radius of both the microphone target 
point and the microphone location point, is shown in Figure 2.

    (2) Measurements may be made at a test site having smaller or 
greater dimensions in accordance with the rules in subpart F of this 
part.
    (b) The test site must be an open site, essentially free of large 
sound-reflecting objects. However, the following objects may be within 
the test site, including the triangular measurement area:
    (1) Small cylindrical objects such as fire hydrants or telephone or 
utility poles.
    (2) Rural mailboxes.
    (3) Traffic railings of any type of construction except solid 
concrete barriers (see Sec. 325.5(c)(4)).
    (4) One or more curbs having a height of 1 foot (.3 m) or less.
    (c) The following objects may be within the test site if they are 
outside of the triangular measurement area of the site:
    (1) Any vertical surface, regardless of size (such as a billboard), 
having a lower edge more than 15 feet (4.6 m) above the ground.
    (2) Any uniformly smooth surface slanting away from the vehicle with 
a slope that is less than 45 degrees above the horizontal.
    (3) Any surface slanting away from the vehicle that is 45 degrees or 
more and not more than 90 degrees above the horizontal, if all points on 
the surface are more than 15 feet (4.6 m) above the surface of the 
ground in the test site.
    (d) The surface of the ground within the measurement area must be 
relatively flat. (See Sec. 325.5(c)(5)). The site shall be a ``hard'' 
site. However, if the site is determined to be ``soft,'' the correction 
factor specified in Sec. 325.75(b) of this part shall be applied to the 
measurement.

<R05>
Sec. 325.55  Ambient conditions; stationary test.

    (a)(1) Sound. The ambient A-weighted sound level at the microphone 
location point shall be measured, in the absence of motor vehicle noise 
emanating from within the clear zone, with fast meter response using a 
sound level measurement system that conforms to the rules of Sec. 
325.23.
    (2) The measured ambient level must be 10 dB(A) or more below that 
level specified in Sec. 325.7, Table 1, which corresponds to the 
maximum permissible sound level reading which is applicable at the test 
site at the time of testing.
    (b) Wind. The wind velocity at the test site shall be measured at 
the beginning of each series of noise measurements and at intervals of 
5-15 minutes thereafter until it has been established that the wind 
velocity is essentially constant. Once this fact has been established, 
wind velocity measurements may be made at intervals of once every hour. 
Noise measurements may only be made if the measured wind velocity is 12 
mph (19.3 kph) or less. Gust wind measurements of up to 20 mph (33.2 
kph) are allowed.
    (c) Precipitation. Measurements are prohibited under any conditions 
of precipitation, however, measurements may be made with snow on the 
ground. The ground within the measurement area must be free of standing 
water.

<R05>
Sec. 325.57  Location and operation of sound level measurement systems; 
stationary test.

    (a) The microphone of a sound level measurement system that conforms 
to the rules in Sec. 325.23 shall be located at a height of not less 
than 2 feet (.6 m) nor more than 6 feet (1.8 m) above the plane of the 
roadway surface and not less than 3\1/2\ feet (1.1 m) above the surface 
on which the microphone stands. The preferred microphone height on flat 
terrain is 4 feet (1.2 m).

[[Page 15]]

    (b) When the sound level measurement system is hand-held or 
otherwise monitored by a person located near its microphone, the holder 
must orient himself/herself relative to the highway in a manner 
consistent with the recommendation of the manufacturer of the sound 
level measurement system. In no case shall the holder or observer be 
closer than 2 feet (.6 m) from the system's microphone, nor shall he/she 
locate himself/herself between the microphone and the vehicle being 
measured.
    (c) The microphone of the sound level measurement system shall be 
oriented toward the vehicle at an angle that is consistent with the 
recommendation of the system's manufacturer. If the manufacturer of the 
system does not recommend an angle of orientation for its microphone, 
the microphone shall be oriented at an angle of not less than 70 degrees 
and not more than perpendicular to the horizontal plane of the test site 
at the microphone target point.
    (d) The sound level measurement system shall be set to the A-
weighting network and ``fast'' meter response mode.

<R05>
Sec. 325.59  Measurement procedure; stationary test.

    In accordance with the rules in this subpart, a measurement shall be 
made of the sound level generated by a stationary motor vehicle as 
follows:
    (a) Park the motor vehicle on the test site as specified in Sec. 
325.53 of this subpart. If the motor vehicle is a combination 
(articulated) vehicle, park the combination so that the longitudinal 
centerlines of the towing vehicle and the towed vehicle or vehicles are 
in substantial alinement.
    (b) Turn off all auxiliary equipment which is installed on the motor 
vehicle and which is designed to operate under normal conditions only 
when the vehicle is operating at a speed of 5 mph (8 kph) or less. 
Examples of such equipment include cranes, asphalt spreaders, liquid or 
slurry pumps, auxiliary air compressors, welders, and trash compactors.
    (c) If the motor vehicle's engine radiator fan drive is equipped 
with a clutch or similar device that automatically either reduces the 
rotational speed of the fan or completely disengages the fan from its 
power source in response to reduced engine cooling loads, park the 
vehicle before testing with its engine running at high idle or any other 
speed the operator may choose, for sufficient time but not more than 10 
minutes, to permit the engine radiator fan to automatically disengage 
when the vehicle's noise emissions are measured under stationary test.
    (d) With the motor vehicle's transmission in neutral and its clutch 
engaged, rapidly accelerate the vehicle's engine from idle to its 
maximum governed speed with wide open throttle. Return the engine's 
speed to idle.
    (e) Observe the maximum reading on the sound level measurement 
system during the time the procedures specified in paragraph (d) of this 
section are followed. Record that reading, if the reading has not been 
influenced by extraneous noise sources such as motor vehicles operating 
on adjacent roadways.
    (f) Repeat the procedures specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of 
this section until the first two maximum sound level readings that are 
within 2 dB(A) of each other are recorded. Numerically average those two 
maximum sound level readings. When appropriate, correct the average 
figure in accordance with the rules in subpart F of this part.
    (g) The average figure, corrected as appropriate, contained in 
accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, is the sound level 
generated by the motor vehicle for the purpose of determining whether it 
conforms to the Standard for Operation Under Stationary Test, 40 CFR 
202.21. (Table 1 in Sec. 325.7 lists the range of maximum permissible 
sound level readings for various test conditions.)

                      Subpart F_Correction Factors


<R05>
Sec. 325.71  Scope of the rules in this subpart.

    (a) The rules in this subpart specify correction factors which are 
added to, or subtracted from, the reading of the sound level generated 
by a motor vehicle, as displayed on a sound level measurement system, 
during the measurement of the motor vehicle's sound level emissions at a 
test site which is not a standard site.
    (b) The purpose of adding or subtracting a correction factor is to 
equate the sound level reading actually generated by the motor vehicle 
to the sound level reading it would have generated if the measurement 
had been made at a standard test site.

Sec. 325.75  Ground surface correction factors. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Table 1, in Sec. 325.7 is a tabulation of the maximum allowable 
sound level readings taking into account both the distance correction 
factors contained in Sec. 325.73 and the ground surface correction 
factors contained in Sec. 325.75.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) Highway operations. When measurements are made in accordance 
with the rules in subpart D of this part upon a test site which is 
``hard,'' a correction factor of 2 dB(A) shall be subtracted from the 
maximum observed sound level reading generated by the motor vehicle to 
determine whether the motor vehicle conforms to the Standards for 
Highway Operations, 40 CFR 202.20.
    (b) Stationary Test. When measurements are made in accordance with 
the rules in subpart E of this part upon a test site which is ``soft,'' 
a correction factor of 2 dB(A) shall be added to the numerical average 
of the recorded maximum observed sound level readings generated by the 
motor vehicle to determine whether the motor vehicle conforms to the 
Standard for Operation Under Stationary Test, 40 CFR 202.21.


<R05>
Sec. 325.77  Computation of open site requirements--nonstandard sites.

    (a) If the distance between the microphone location point and the 
microphone target point is other than 50 feet (15.2 m), the test site 
must be an open site within a radius from both points which is equal to 
the distance between the microphone location point and the microphone 
target point.

[[Page 17]]

    (b) Plan view diagrams of nonstandard test sites are shown in 
Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 illustrates a test site which is larger than a 
standard test site and is based upon a 60-foot (18.3 m) distance between 
the microphone location point and the microphone target point. (See 
Sec. 325.79(b)(1) for an example of the application of the correction 
factor to a sound level reading obtained at such a site.) Figure 4 
illustrates a test site which is smaller than a standard test site and 
is based upon a 35-foot (10.7 m) distance between the microphone 
location point and the microphone target point. (See Sec. 325.79(b)(2) 
for an example of the application of the correction factor to a sound 
level reading obtained at such a site.)

<R05>
Sec. 325.79  Application of correction factors.

    (a) If two correction factors apply to a measurement they are 
applied cumulatively.
    (b) The following examples illustrate the application of correction 
factors to sound level measurement readings:
    (1) Example 1--Highway operations. Assume that a motor vehicle 
generates a maximum observed sound level reading of 86 dB(A) during a 
measurement in accordance with the rules in subpart D of this part. 
Assume also that the distance between the microphone location point and 
the microphone target point is 60 feet (18.3 m) and that the measurement 
area of the test site is acoustically ``hard.'' The corrected sound 
level generated by the motor vehicle would be 85 dB(A), calculated as 
follows:

 86 dB(A) Uncorrected reading
+1 dB(A) Distance correction factor
-2 dB(A) Ground surface correction factor
----------
 85 dB(A) Corrected reading

    (2) Example 2--Stationary test. Assume that a motor vehicle 
generates maximum sound level readings which average 88 dB(A) during a 
measurement in accordance with the rules in subpart E of this part. 
Assume also that the distance between the microphone location point and 
the microphone target point is 35 feet (10.7 m), and that the 
measurement area of the test site is acoustically ``soft.'' The 
corrected sound level generated by the motor vehicle would be 87 dB(A), 
calculated as follows:

 88 dB(A) Uncorrected average of readings
-3 dB(A) Distance correction factor
+2 dB(A) Ground surface correction factor
----------

 87 dB(A) Corrected reading

                   Subpart G_Exhaust Systems and Tires


<R05>
Sec. 325.91  Exhaust systems.

    A motor vehicle does not conform to the visual exhaust system 
inspection requirements, 40 CFR 202.22, of the Interstate Motor Carrier 
Noise Emission Standards, if inspection of the exhaust system of the 
motor vehicle discloses that the system--

[[Page 18]]

    (a) Has a defect which adversely affects sound reduction, such as 
exhaust gas leaks or alteration or deterioration of muffler elements, 
(small traces of soot on flexible exhaust pipe sections shall not 
constitute a violation of this subpart);
    (b) Is not equipped with either a muffler or other noise dissipative 
device, such as a turbocharger (supercharger driven by exhaust gases); 
or
    (c) Is equipped with a cut-out, by-pass, or similar device, unless 
such device is designed as an exhaust gas driven cargo unloading system.


<R05>
Sec. 325.93  Tires.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a motor 
vehicle does not conform to the visual tire inspection requirements, 40 
CFR 202.23, of the Interstate Motor Carrier Noise Emissions Standards, 
if inspection of any tire on which the vehicle is operating discloses 
that the tire has a tread pattern composed primarily of cavities in the 
tread (excluding sipes and local chunking) which are not vented by 
grooves to the tire shoulder or circumferentially to each other around 
the tire.
    (b) Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to a motor vehicle 
operated on a tire having a tread pattern of the type specified in that 
paragraph, if the motor carrier who operates the motor vehicle 
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator or his/her 
designee that either--
    (1) The tire did not have that type of tread pattern when it was 
originally manufactured or newly remanufactured; or
    (2) The motor vehicle generates a maximum sound level reading of 90 
dB(A) or less when measured at a standard test site for highway 
operations at a distance of 15.3 meters (50 feet) and under the 
following conditions:
    (i) The measurement must be made at a time and place and under 
conditions specified by the Administrator or his/her designee.
    (ii) The motor vehicle must be operated on the same tires that were 
installed on it when the inspection specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section occurred.
    (iii) The motor vehicle must be operated on a highway having a 
posted speed limit of more than 56.3 kph (35 mph).
    (iv) The sound level measurement must be made while the motor 
vehicle is operating at the posted speed limit.

<R05>
Sec. 350.101  What is the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program 
(MCSAP)?

    The MCSAP is a Federal grant program that provides financial 
assistance to States to reduce the number and severity of accidents and 
hazardous materials incidents involving commercial motor vehicles (CMV). 
The goal of the MCSAP is to reduce CMV-involved accidents, fatalities, 
and injuries through

[[Page 20]]

consistent, uniform, and effective CMV safety programs. Investing grant 
monies in appropriate safety programs will increase the likelihood that 
safety defects, driver deficiencies, and unsafe motor carrier practices 
will be detected and corrected before they become contributing factors 
to accidents. The MCSAP also sets forth the conditions for participation 
by States and local jurisdictions and promotes the adoption and uniform 
enforcement of safety rules, regulations, and standards compatible with 
the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) and Federal 
Hazardous Material Regulations (HMRs) for both interstate and intrastate 
motor carriers and drivers.


<R05>
Sec. 350.103  What is the purpose of this part?

    The purpose of this part is to ensure the Federal Motor Carrier 
Safety Administration (FMCSA), States, and other political jurisdictions 
work in partnership to establish programs to improve motor carrier, CMV, 
and driver safety to support a safe and efficient transportation system.


<R05>
Sec. 350.105  What definitions are used in this part?

    10-year average accident rate means for each State, the aggregate 
number of large truck-involved fatal crashes (as reported in the 
Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS)) for a 10-year period divided 
by the aggregate vehicle miles traveled (VMT) (as defined by the Federal 
Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) ) for the same 10-year 
period.
    Accident rate means for each State, the total number of fatal 
crashes involving large trucks (as measured by the FARS for each State) 
divided by the total VMT as defined by the FMCSA for each State for all

<R05>
Sec. 350.327  How may States qualify for Incentive Funds?

    (a) A State may qualify for Incentive Funds if it can demonstrate 
that its CMV safety program has shown improvement in any or all of the 
following five categories:
    (1) Reduction of large truck-involved fatal accidents.
    (2) Reduction of large truck-involved fatal accident rate or 
maintenance of a large truck-involved fatal accident rate that is among 
the lowest 10 percent of such rates of MCSAP recipients.
    (3) Upload of CMV accident reports in accordance with current FMCSA 
policy guidelines.
    (4) Verification of CDLs during all roadside inspections.
    (5) Upload of CMV inspection data in accordance with current FMCSA 
policy guidelines.
    (b) Incentive Funds will be distributed based upon the five 
following safety and program performance factors:
    (1) Five shares will be awarded to States that reduce the number of 
large truck-involved fatal accidents for the most recent calendar year 
for which data are available when compared to the 10-year average number 
of large truck-involved fatal accidents ending with the preceding year. 
The 10-year average will be computed from the number of large truck-
involved fatal crashes, as reported by the FARS, administered by the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
    (2) Four shares will be awarded to States that reduce the fatal-
accident rate for the most recent calendar year for which data are 
available when compared to each State's average fatal accident rate for 
the preceding 10-year period. States with the lowest 10 percent of 
accident rates in the most recent calendar year for which data are 
available will be awarded three shares if the rate for the State is the 
same as its average accident rate for the preceding 10-year period.
    (3) Two shares will be awarded to States that upload CMV accident 
data within FMCSA policy guidelines.
    (4) Two shares will be awarded to States that certify their MCSAP 
inspection agencies have departmental policies that stipulate CDLs are 
verified, as part of the inspection process, through Commercial Driver's 
License Information System (CDLIS), National Law Enforcement Tracking 
System (NLETS), or the State licensing authority.

[[Page 29]]

    (5) Two shares will be awarded to States that upload CMV inspection 
reports within current FMCSA policy guidelines.
    (c) The total of all States' shares awarded will be divided into the 
dollar amount of Incentive Funds available, thereby establishing the 
value of one share. Each State's incentive allocation will then be 
determined by multiplying the State's percentage participation in the 
formula allocation of Basic Program Funds, by the number of shares it 
received that year, multiplied by the dollar value of one share.
    (d) States may use Incentive Funds for any eligible CMV safety 
purpose.
    (e) Incentive Funds are subject to the same State matching 
requirements as Basic Program Funds.
    (f) A State must annually certify compliance with the applicable 
incentive criteria to receive Incentive Funds. A State must submit the 
required certification as part of its CVSP or as a separate document.


<R05>
Sec. 350.329  How may a State or a local agency qualify for High Priority 
or Border Activity Funds?

    (a) States must meet the requirements of Sec. 350.201, as 
applicable.
    (b) Local agencies must meet the following nine conditions:
    (1) Prepare a proposal in accordance with Sec. 350.213, as 
applicable.
    (2) Coordinate the proposal with the State lead MCSAP agency to 
ensure the proposal is consistent with State and national CMV safety 
program priorities.

resources, and trained and qualified personnel necessary to perform the 
functions specified in the proposal.
    (4) Designate a person who will be responsible for implementation, 
reporting, and administering the approved proposal and will be the 
primary contact for the project.
    (5) Agree to fund up to 20 percent of the proposed request.
    (6) Agree to prepare and submit all reports required in connection 
with the proposal or other conditions of the grant.
    (7) Agree to use the forms and reporting criteria required by the 
State lead MCSAP agency and/or the FMCSA to record work activities to be 
performed under the proposal.
    (8) Certify that the local agency will impose sanctions for 
violations of CMV and driver laws and regulations that are consistent 
with those of the State.
    (9) Certify participation in national data bases appropriate to the 
project.


<R05>
Sec. 350.331  How does a State ensure its laws and regulations are 
compatible with the FMCSRs and HMRs?

    (a) A State must review any new law or regulation affecting CMV 
safety as soon as possible, but in any event immediately after enactment 
or issuance, for compatibility with the FMCSRs and HMRs.
    (b) If the review determines that the new law or regulation is 
incompatible with the FMCSRs and/or HMRs, the State must immediately 
notify the Motor Carrier State Director.
    (c) A State must conduct an annual review of its laws and 
regulations for compatibility and report the results of that review in 
the annual CVSP in accordance with Sec. 350.213(l) along with a 
certification of compliance, no later than August 1 of each year. The 
report must include the following two items:
    (1) A copy of the State law, regulation, or policy relating to CMV 
safety that was adopted since the State's last report.
    (2) A certification, executed by the State's Governor, Attorney 
General, or other State official specifically designated by the 
Governor, stating that the annual review was performed and that State 
CMV safety laws remain compatible with the FMCSRs and HMRs. If State CMV 
laws are no longer compatible, the certifying official shall explain.
    (d) As soon as practical after the effective date of any newly 
enacted regulation or amendment to the FMCSRs or HMRs, but no later than 
three years after that date, the State must amend its laws or 
regulations to make them compatible with the FMCSRs and/or HMRs, as 
amended.

[[Page 30]]


<R05>
Sec. 350.333  What are the guidelines for the compatibility review?

    (a) The State law or regulation must apply to all segments of the 
motor carrier industry (i.e., for-hire and private motor carriers of 
property and passengers).
    (b) Laws and regulations reviewed for the CDL compliance report are 
excluded from the compatibility review.
    (c) Definitions of words or terms must be consistent with those in 
the FMCSRs and HMRs.
    (d) A State must identify any law or regulation that is not the same 
as the corresponding Federal regulation and evaluate it in accordance

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 350.335  What are the consequences if my State has laws or 
regulations incompatible with the Federal regulations?

    (a) A State that currently has compatible CMV safety laws and 
regulations pertaining to interstate commerce (i.e., rules identical to 
the FMCSRs and HMRs) and intrastate commerce (i.e., rules identical to 
or within the tolerance guidelines for the FMCSRs and identical to the 
HMRs) but enacts a law or regulation which results in an incompatible 
rule will not be eligible for Basic Program Funds nor Incentive Funds.
    (b) A State that fails to adopt any new regulation or amendment to 
the FMCSRs or HMRs within three years of its effective date will be 
deemed to have incompatible regulations and will not be eligible for 
Basic Program nor Incentive Funds.
    (c) Those States with incompatible laws or regulations pertaining to 
intrastate commerce and receiving 50 percent of their basic formula 
allocation on April 20, 2000 will continue at that level of funding 
until those incompatibilities are removed, provided no further 
incompatibilities are created.
    (d) Upon a finding by the FMCSA, based upon its own initiative or 
upon a petition of any person, including any State, that your State law, 
regulation or enforcement practice pertaining to CMV safety, in either 
interstate or intrastate commerce, is incompatible with the FMCSRs or 
HMRs, the FMCSA may initiate a proceeding under Sec. 350.215 for 
withdrawal of eligibility for all Basic Program and Incentive Funds.
    (e) Any decision regarding the compatibility of your State law or 
regulation with the HMRs that requires an interpretation will be 
referred to the Research and Special Programs Administration of the DOT 
for such interpretation before proceeding under Sec. 350.215.


<R05>
Sec. 350.337  How may State laws and regulations governing motor 
carriers, CMV drivers, and CMVs in interstate commerce differ 
from the FMCSRs and still be considered compatible?

    States are not required to adopt 49 CFR parts 398 and 399, subparts 
A through E and H of part 107, and Sec. Sec. 171.15 and 171.16, as 
applicable to either interstate or intrastate commerce.

[[Page 31]]


<R05>
Sec. 350.339  What are tolerance guidelines?

    Tolerance guidelines set forth the limited deviations from the 
FMCSRs allowed in your State's laws and regulations. These variances 
apply only to motor carriers, CMV drivers and CMVs engaged in intrastate 
commerce and not subject to Federal jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 350.341  What specific variances from the FMCSRs are allowed for 
State laws and regulations governing motor carriers, CMV drivers, and 
CMVs engaged in intrastate commerce and not subject to Federal 
jurisdiction?

    (a) A State may exempt a CMV from all or part of its laws or 
regulations applicable to intrastate commerce, provided that neither the 
GVW, GVWR, GCW, nor GCWR of the vehicle equals or exceeds 11,801 kg 
(26,001 lbs.). However, a State may not exempt a CMV from such laws or 
regulations if the vehicle:
    (1) Transports hazardous materials requiring a placard.
    (2) Is designed or used to transport 16 or more people, including 
the driver.
    (b) State laws and regulations applicable to intrastate commerce may 
not grant exemptions based upon the type of transportation being 
performed (e.g., for-hire, private, etc.).
    (c) A State may retain those exemptions from its motor carrier 
safety laws and regulations that were in effect before April, 1988, are 
still in effect, and apply to specific industries operating in 
intrastate commerce.
    (d) State laws and regulations applicable to intrastate commerce 
must not include exemptions based upon the distance a motor carrier or 
driver operates from the work reporting location. This prohibition does 
not apply to those exemptions already contained in the FMCSRs nor to the 
extension of the mileage radius exemption contained in 49 CFR 395.1(e) 
from 100 to 150 miles.
    (e) Hours of service--State hours-of-service limitations applied to 
intrastate transportation may vary to the extent of allowing the 
following:
    (1) A 12-hour driving limit, provided driving a CMV after having 
been on duty more than 16 hours is prohibited.
    (2) Driving prohibitions for drivers who have been on duty 70 hours 
in 7 consecutive days or 80 hours in 8 consecutive days.
    (f) Age of CMV driver--All CMV drivers must be at least 18 years of 
age.
    (g) Grandfather clauses--States may provide grandfather clauses in 
their rules and regulations if such exemptions are uniform or in 
substantial harmony with the FMCSRs and provide an orderly transition to 
full regulatory adoption at a later date.
    (h) Driver qualifications:
    (1) Intrastate drivers who do not meet the physical qualification 
standards in 49 CFR 391.41 may continue to be qualified to operate a CMV 
in intrastate commerce if the following three conditions are met:
    (i) The driver was qualified under existing State law or regulation 
at the time the State adopted physical qualification standards 
compatible with the Federal standards in 49 CFR 391.41.
    (ii) The otherwise non-qualifying medical or physical condition has 
not substantially worsened.
    (iii) No other non-qualifying medical or physical condition has 
developed.
    (2) The State may adopt or continue programs granting variances to 
intrastate drivers with medical or physical conditions that would 
otherwise be non-qualifying under the State's equivalent of 49 CFR 
391.41 if the variances are based upon sound medical judgment combined 
with appropriate performance standards ensuring no adverse affect on 
safety.


<R05>
Sec. 350.343  How may a State obtain a new exemption for State laws and 
regulations for a specific industry involved in intrastate commerce?

    The FMCSA strongly discourages exemptions for specific industries, 
but will consider such requests if the State submits documentation 
containing information supporting evaluation of the following 10 
factors:
    (a) Type and scope of the industry exemption requested, including 
percentage of industry affected, number of vehicles, mileage traveled, 
number of companies involved.
    (b) Type and scope of the requirement to which the exemption would 
apply.

[[Page 32]]

    (c) Safety performance of that specific industry (e.g., accident 
frequency, rates and comparative figures).
    (d) Inspection information (e.g., number of violations per 
inspection, driver and vehicle out-of-service information).
    (e) Other CMV safety regulations enforced by other State agencies 
not participating in the MCSAP.
    (f) Commodity transported (e.g., livestock, grain).
    (g) Similar variations granted and the circumstances under which 
they were granted.
    (h) Justification for the exemption.
    (i) Identifiable effects on safety.
    (j) State's economic environment and its ability to compete in 
foreign and domestic markets.


<R05>
Sec. 350.345  How does a State apply for additional variances from the 
FMCSRs?

    Any State may apply to the Administrator for a variance from the 
FMCSRs for intrastate commerce. The variance will be granted only if the 
State satisfactorily demonstrates that the State law, regulation or 
enforcement practice:
    (a) Achieves substantially the same purpose as the similar Federal 
regulation.
    (b) Does not apply to interstate commerce.
    (c) Is not likely to have an adverse impact on safety.

                         Subpart B_Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 355.21  Regulatory review.

    (a) General. Each State shall annually analyze its laws and 
regulations, including those of its political subdivisions, which 
pertain to commercial motor vehicle safety to determine whether its laws 
and regulations are compatible with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Regulations. Guidelines for the regulatory review are provided in the 
appendix to this part.
    (b) Responsibility. The State agency designated as lead agency for 
the administration of grants made pursuant to part 350 of this 
subchapter is responsible for reviewing and analyzing State laws and 
regulations for compliance with this part. In the absence of an 
officially designated Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) 
lead agency or in its discretion, the State shall designate another 
agency responsible to review and determine compliance with these 
regulations.
    (c)  State review. (1) The State shall determine which of its laws 
and regulations pertaining to commercial motor vehicle safety are the 
same as the Federal Motor Carrier Safety or Federal Hazardous Materials 
Regulations. With respect to any State law or regulation which is not 
the same as the FMCSRs (FHMRs must be identical), the State shall 
identify such law or regulation and determine whether:
    (i) It has the same effect as a corresponding section of the Federal 
Motor Carrier Safety Regulations;
    (ii) It applies to interstate commerce;
    (iii) It is more stringent than the FMCSRs in that it is more 
restrictive or places a greater burden on any entity subject to its 
provisions.
    (2) If the inconsistent State law or regulation applies to 
interstate commerce and is more stringent than the FMCSRs, the State 
shall determine:
    (i) The safety benefits associated with such State law or 
regulation; and
    (ii) The effect of the enforcement of such State law or regulation 
on interstate commerce.
    (3) If the inconsistent State law or regulation does not apply to 
interstate commerce or is less stringent than the FMCSRs, the guidelines 
for participation in the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program in 
Sec. Sec. 350.341, 350.343, and 350.345 of this subchapter shall apply.

[57 FR 40962, Sept. 8, 1992, as amended at 65 FR 15109, Mar. 21, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 355.23  Submission of results.

    Each State shall submit the results of its regulatory review 
annually with its certification of compliance under Sec. 350.209 of 
this subchapter. It shall submit the results of the regulatory review 
with the certification no later than August 1 of each year with the 
Commercial Vehicle Safety Plan (CVSP). The State shall include copies of 
pertinent laws and regulations.

[65 FR 15109, Mar. 21, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 355.25  Adopting and enforcing compatible laws and regulations.

    (a) General. No State shall have in effect or enforce any State law 
or regulation pertaining to commercial motor vehicle safety in 
interstate commerce which the Administrator finds to be incompatible 
with the provisions of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations.
    (b) New state requirements. No State shall implement any changes to 
a law or regulation which makes that or any other law or regulation 
incompatible with a provision of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Regulations.
    (c) Enforcement. To enforce compliance with this section, the 
Administrator will initiate a rulemaking proceeding under part 389 of 
this subchapter to declare the incompatible State law or regulation 
pertaining to commercial motor vehicle safety unenforceable in 
interstate commerce.
    (d) Waiver of determination. Any person (including any State) may 
petition for a waiver of a determination made

[[Page 34]]

under paragraph (c) of this section. Such petition will also be 
considered in a rulemaking proceeding under part 389. Waivers shall be 
granted only upon a satisfactory showing that continued enforcement of 
the incompatible State law or regulation is not contrary to the public 
interest and is consistent with the safe operation of commercial motor 
vehicles.
    (e) Consolidation of proceedings. The Administrator may consolidate 
any action to enforce this section with other proceedings required under 
this section if the Administrator determines that such consolidation 
will not adversely affect any party to any such proceeding.

      Appendix A to Part 355--Guidelines for the Regulatory Review

    Each State shall review its laws and regulations to achieve 
compatibility with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations 
(FMCSRs). Each State shall consider all related requirements on 
enforcement of the State's motor carrier safety regulations. The 
documentation shall be simple and brief.

                                  Scope

    The State review required by Sec. 355.21 may be limited to those 
laws and regulations previously determined to be incompatible in the 
report of the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Regulatory Review Panel 
issued in August 1990, or by subsequent determination by the 
Administrator under this part, and any State laws or regulations enacted 
or issued after August 1990.

                              Applicability

    The requirements must apply to all segments of the motor carrier 
industry common, contract, and private carriers of property and for-hire 
carriers of passengers.

                               Definitions

    Definitions of terms must be consistent with those in the FMCSRs.

                          Driver Qualifications

    Require a driver to be properly licensed to drive a commercial motor 
vehicle; require a driver to be in good physical health, at least 21 
years of age, able to operate a vehicle safely, and maintain a good 
driving record; prohibit drug and alcohol abuse; require a motor carrier 
to maintain a driver qualification file for each driver; and require a 
motor carrier to ensure that a driver is medically qualified.

    Note: The requirements for testing apply only to drivers of 
commercial motor vehicles as defined in 49 CFR part 383.

                        Driving of Motor Vehicles

    Prohibit possession, use, or driving under the influence of alcohol 
or other controlled substances (while on duty); and establish 0.04 
percent as the level of alcohol in the blood at which a driver is 
considered under the influence of alcohol.

           Parts and Accessories Necessary for Safe Operation

    Require operational lights and reflectors; require systematically 
arranged and installed wiring; and require brakes working at the 
required performance level, and other key components included in 49 CFR 
part 393.

                       Hours of Service of Drivers

    Prohibit a motor carrier from allowing or requiring any driver to 
drive: More than 10 hours following 8 consecutive hours off duty; after 
being on duty 15 hours, after being on duty more than 60 hours in any 7 
consecutive days; or after being on duty more than 70 hours in any 8 
consecutive days.
    Require a driver to prepare a record-of-duty status for each 24-hour 
period. The driver and motor carrier must retain the records.

                       Inspection and Maintenance

    Prohibit a commercial motor vehicle from being operated when it is 
likely to cause an accident or a breakdown; require the driver to 
conduct a walk-around inspection of the vehicle before driving it to 
ensure that it can be safely operated; require the driver to prepare a 
driver vehicle inspection report; and require commercial motor vehicles 
to be inspected at least annually.

                           Hazardous Materials

    Require a motor carrier or a person operating a commercial motor 
vehicle transporting hazardous materials to follow the safety and 
hazardous materials requirements.

                          State Determinations

    1. Each State must determine whether its requirements affecting 
interstate motor carriers are ``less stringent'' than the Federal 
requirements. ``Less stringent'' requirements represent either gaps in 
the State requirements in relation to the Federal requirements as 
summarized under item number one in this appendix or State requirements 
which are less restrictive than the Federal requirements.
    a. An example of a gap is when a State does not have the authority 
to regulate the safety of for-hire carriers of passengers or

[[Page 35]]

has the authority but chooses to exempt the carrier.
    b. An example of a less restrictive State requirement is when a 
State allows a person under 21 years of age to operate a commercial 
motor vehicle in interstate commerce.
    2. Each State must determine whether its requirements affecting 
interstate motor carriers are ``more stringent'' than the Federal 
requirements: ``More stringent'' requirements are more restrictive or 
inclusive in relation to the Federal requirements as summarized under 
item number one in this appendix. For example, a requirement that a 
driver must have 2 days off after working 5 consecutive days. The State 
would demonstrate that its more stringent requirements:
    a. Have a ``safety benefit;'' for example, result in fewer accidents 
or reduce the risk of accidents;
    b. do not create ``an undue burden on interstate commerce,'' e.g., 
do not delay, interfere with, or increase that cost or the 
administrative burden for a motor carrier transporting property or 
passengers in interstate commerce; and
    c. Are otherwise compatible with Federal safety requirements.
    3. A State must adopt and enforce in a consistent manner the 
requirements referenced in the above guidelines in order for the FMCSA 
to accept the State's determination that it has compatible safety 
requirements affecting interstate motor carrier operations. Generally, 
the States would have up to 3 years from the effective date of the new 
Federal requirement to adopt and enforce compatible requirements. The 
FMCSA would specify the deadline when promulgating future Federal safety 
requirements. The requirements are considered of equal importance.

in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (2) Billing account procedure. A written request must be submitted 
to the Office of Enforcement and Compliance, Insurance Compliance 
Division (MC-PSDECI) to establish an insurance service fee account.
    (i) Each account will have a specific billing date within each month 
and a billing cycle. The billing date is the date that the bill is 
prepared and printed. The billing cycle is the period between the 
billing date in one month and the billing date in the next month. A bill 
for each account which has activity or an unpaid balance during the 
billing cycle will be sent on the billing date each month. Payment will

    (3) Fees will be payable to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration by a check payable in United States currency drawn upon 
funds deposited in a United States or foreign bank or other financial 
institution, money order payable in United States' currency, or credit 
card (VISA or MASTERCARD).
    (b) Any filing that is not accompanied by the appropriate filing fee 
is deficient except for filings that satisfy the deferred payment 
procedures in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Fees not refundable. Fees will be assessed for every filing in 
the type of proceeding listed in the schedule of fees contained in 
paragraph (f) of this section, subject to the exceptions contained in 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. After the application, petition, 
or other document has been accepted for filing by the Federal Motor 
Carrier Safety Administration, the filing fee will not be refunded, 
regardless of whether the application, petition, or other document is 
granted or approved, denied, rejected before docketing, dismissed, or 
withdrawn.
    (d) Related or consolidated proceedings. (1) Separate fees need not 
be paid for related applications filed by the same applicant which would 
be the subject of one proceeding. (This does not mean requests for 
multiple types of operating authority filed on forms in the OP-1 series 
under the regulations at 49 CFR part 365. A separate filing fee is 
required for each type of authority sought in each transportation mode, 
e.g., common, contract, and broker authority for motor property 
carriers.)
    (2) Separate fees will be assessed for the filing of temporary 
operating authority applications as provided in paragraph (f)(6) of this 
section, regardless of whether such applications are related to an 
application for corresponding permanent operating authority.
    (3) The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration may reject 
concurrently filed applications, petitions, or other documents asserted 
to be related and refund the filing fee if, in its judgment, they 
embrace two or more severable matters which should be the subject of 
separate proceedings.
    (e) Waiver or reduction of filing fees. It is the general policy of 
the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration not to waive or reduce 
filing fees except as described as follows:
    (1) Filing fees are waived for an application or other proceeding 
which is filed by a Federal government agency, or a State or local 
government entity. For purposes of this section the phrases ``Federal 
government agency'' or ``government entity'' do not include a quasi-
governmental corporation or government subsidized transportation 
company.
    (2) In extraordinary situations the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration will accept requests for waivers or fee reductions in 
accordance with the following procedure:
    (i) When to request. At the time that a filing is submitted to the 
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration the applicant may request a 
waiver or reduction of the fee prescribed in this part. Such request 
should be addressed to the Director, Office of Data Analysis and 
Information Systems.
    (ii) Basis. The applicant must show the waiver or reduction of the 
fee is in the best interest of the public, or that payment of the fee 
would impose an undue hardship upon the requestor.
    (iii) Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration action. The 
Director, Office of Data Analysis and Information Systems, will notify 
the applicant of the decision to grant or deny the request for waiver or 
reduction.
    (f) Schedule of filing fees.

Sec. 360.5  Updating user fees.

    (a) Update. Each fee established in this part may be updated in 
accordance with this section as deemed necessary by the FMCSA.
    (b) Publication and effective dates. Updated fees shall be published 
in the Federal Register and shall become effective 30 days after 
publication.
    (c) Payment of fees. Any person submitting a filing for which a fee 
is established shall pay the fee in effect at the time of the filing.
    (d) Method of updating fees. Each fee shall be updated by updating 
the cost components comprising the fee. Cost components shall be updated 
as follows:
    (1) Direct labor costs shall be updated by multiplying base level 
direct labor costs by percentage changes in average

[[Page 40]]

wages and salaries of FMCSA employees. Base level direct labor costs are 
direct labor costs determined by the cost study in Regulations Governing 
Fees For Service, 1 I.C.C. 2d 60 (1984), or subsequent cost studies. The 
base period for measuring changes shall be April 1984 or the year of the 
last cost study.
    (2) Operations overhead shall be developed each year on the basis of 
current relationships existing on a weighted basis, for indirect labor 
applicable to the first supervisory work centers directly associated 
with user fee activity. Actual updating of operations overhead will be 
accomplished by applying the current percentage factor to updated direct 
labor, including current governmental overhead costs.
    (3)(i) Office general and administrative costs shall be developed 
each year on the basis of current levels costs, i.e., dividing actual 
office general and administrative costs for the current fiscal year by 
total office costs for the office directly associated with user fee 
activity. Actual updating of office general and administrative costs 
will be accomplished by applying the current percentage factor to 
updated direct labor, including current governmental overhead and 
current operations overhead costs.
    (ii) FMCSA general and administrative costs shall be developed each 
year on the basis of current level costs; i.e., dividing actual FMCSA 
general and administrative costs for the current fiscal year by total 
agency expenses for the current fiscal year. Actual updating of FMCSA 
general and administrative costs will be accomplished by applying the 
current percentage factor to updated direct labor, including current 
governmental overhead, operations overhead and office general and 
administrative costs.
    (4) Publication costs shall be adjusted on the basis of known 
changes in the costs applicable to publication of material in the 
Federal Register or FMCSA Register.
    (This rounding procedures excludes copying, printing and search 
fees.)
    (e) Rounding of updated fees. Updated fees shall be rounded in the 
following manner:
    (1) Fees between $1 and $30 will be rounded to the nearest $1;
    (2) Fees between $30 and $100 will be rounded to the nearest $10;
    (3) Fees between $100 and $999 will be rounded to the nearest $50; 
and
    (4) Fees above $1,000 will be rounded to the nearest $100.

processing requests for permanent authority, applications for TA will be 
entertained only in exceptional circumstances (i.e., natural disasters 
or national emergencies) when evidence of immediate service need can be 
specifically documented in a narrative supplement appended to Form OP-1 
for motor property carriers, Form OP-1MX for Mexican property carriers

the sale of property brokers' licenses under 49 U.S.C. 10321.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The execution of a chattel mortgage, deed of trust, or other 
similar document does not constitute a transfer or require the FMCSA's

    (1) Certificates and permits issued to motor carriers;
    (2) Permits issued to freight forwarders;
    (3) Licenses issued to property brokers; and
    (4) Certificates of Registration issued to motor carriers. The term 
also includes authority held by virtue of the gateway elimination 
regulations published in the Federal Register as letter-notices.
    (c) Certificate of registration. The evidence of a motor carrier's 
right to engage in interstate or foreign commerce within a single State 
is established by a corresponding State certificate.
    (d) Person. An individual, partnership, corporation, company, 
association, or other form of business, or a trustee, receiver, 
assignee, or personal representative of any of these.
    (e) Record holder. The person shown on the records of the FMCSA as

    (f) Control. A relationship between persons that includes actual 
control, legal control, and the power to exercise control, through or by 
common directors, officers, stockholders, a voting trust, a holding or 
investment company, or any other means.
    (g) Category 1 transfers. Transactions in which the person to whom 
the operating rights would be transferred is not an FMCSA carrier and is 
not affiliated with any FMCSA carrier.
    (h) Category 2 transfers. Transactions in which the person to whom 
the operating rights would be transferred is an FMCSA carrier and/or is 
affiliated with an FMCSA carrier.

has issued a decision on their application before transferring the 
operating rights. If the transferee wants the transferor's operating 
authority to be reissued in its name, it should furnish the FMCSA with a 
statement executed by both transferor and transferee indicating that the 
transaction has been consummated. Authority will not be reissued until 
after the FMCSA has approved the transaction.
    (b) Information required. (1) In category 1 and category 2 
transfers, applicants must furnish the following information:
    (i) Full name, address, and signatures of the transferee and 
transferor.
    (ii) A copy of the transferor's operating authority involved in the 
transfer proceeding.
    (iii) A short summary of the essential terms of the transaction.
    (iv) If relevant, the status of proceedings for the transfer of 
State certificate(s) corresponding to the Certificates of Registration 
being transferred.
    (v) A statement as to whether the transfer will or will not 
significantly affect the quality of the human environment.

insurance coverage under 49 U.S.C. 13906 for the service it intends to 
provide.
    (viii) Information to demonstrate that the proposed transaction is 
consistent with the national transportation policy and satisfies the 
criteria for approval set forth at Sec. 365.409 of this part. (Such 
information may be appended to the application form and, if provided, 
would be embraced by the oath and verification contained on that form.)
    (ix) If motor carrier operating rights are being transferred, 
certification by the transferee that it is not domiciled in Mexico nor 
owned or controlled by persons of that country.
    (2) Category 2 applicants must also submit the following additional 
information:
    (i) Name(s) of the carrier(s), if any, with which the transferee is 
affiliated.
    (ii) Aggregate revenues of the transferor, transferee, and their 
carrier affiliates from interstate transportation sources for a 1-year 
period ending not earlier than 6 months before the date of the agreement 
of the parties concerning the transaction. If revenues exceed $2 
million, the transfer may be subject to 49 U.S.C. 14303 rather than 
these rules.

Sec. 365.409  FMCSA action and criteria for approval.

    A transfer will be approved under this section if:
    (a) The transaction is not subject to 49 U.S.C. 14303; and
    (b) The transaction is consistent with the public interest; however,
    (c) If the transferor or transferee has an ``Unsatisfactory'' safety 
fitness rating from DOT, the transfer may be denied. If an application 
is denied, the FMCSA will set forth the basis for its action in a 
decision or letter notice. If parties with ``Unsatisfactory'' safety 
fitness ratings consummate a transaction pursuant to the 10-day rule at 
Sec. 365.405 of this part prior to the notification of FMCSA action, 
they do so at their own risk and subject to any conditions we may impose 
subsequently. Transactions that have been consummated but later are 
denied by the FMCSA are null and void and must be rescinded. Similarly, 
if applications contain false or misleading information, they are void 
ab initio.

<R05>
Sec. 365.509  Requirement to notify FMCSA of change in applicant 
information.

    (a) A motor carrier subject to this subpart must notify the FMCSA of 
any changes or corrections to the information in parts I, IA or II 
submitted on the Form OP-1(MX) or the Form BOC-3--Designation of 
Agents--Motor Carriers, Brokers and Freight Forwarders during the 
application process or after having been granted provisional operating 
authority. The carrier must notify the FMCSA in writing within 45 days 
of the change or correction.
    (b) If a carrier fails to comply with paragraph (a) of this section, 
the FMCSA may suspend or revoke its operating authority until it meets 
those requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 365.511  Requirement for CVSA inspection of vehicles during first 
three consecutive years of permanent operating authority.

    A Mexico-domiciled motor carrier granted permanent operating 
authority must have its vehicles inspected by Commercial Vehicle Safety 
Alliance (CVSA)-certified inspectors every three months and display a 
current inspection decal attesting to the successful completion of such 
an inspection for at least three consecutive years after receiving 
permanent operating authority from the FMCSA.

 Appendix A to Subpart E of Part 365--Explanation of Pre-Authorization 
  Safety Audit Evaluation Criteria for Mexico-Domiciled Motor Carriers

                               I. General

    (a) Section 350 of the Fiscal Year 2002 DOT Appropriations Act (Pub. 
L. 107-87) directed the FMCSA to perform a safety audit of each Mexico-
domiciled motor carrier before the FMCSA grants the carrier provisional 
operating authority to operate beyond United States municipalities and 
commercial zones on the United States-Mexico international border.
    (b) The FMCSA will decide whether it will conduct the safety audit 
at the Mexico-domiciled motor carrier's principal place of business in 
Mexico or at a location specified by the FMCSA in the United States, in 
accordance with the statutory requirements that 50 percent of all safety 
audits must be conducted onsite and on-site inspections cover at least 
50 percent of estimated truck traffic in any year. All records and 
documents must be made available for examination within 48 hours after a 
request is made. Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays are excluded 
from the computation of the 48-hour period.
    (c) The safety audit will include:
    (1) Verification of available performance data and safety management 
programs;
    (2) Verification of a controlled substances and alcohol testing 
program consistent with part 40 of this title;
    (3) Verification of the carrier's system of compliance with hours-
of-service rules in part 395 of this subchapter, including recordkeeping 
and retention;
    (4) Verification of proof of financial responsibility;
    (5) Review of available data concerning the carrier's safety 
history, and other information necessary to determine the carrier's 
preparedness to comply with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Regulations, parts 382 through 399 of this subchapter, and the Federal 
Hazardous Material Regulations, parts 171 through 180 of this title;
    (6) Inspection of available commercial motor vehicles to be used 
under provisional operating authority, if any of these vehicles have not 
received a decal required by Sec. 385.103(d) of this subchapter;
    (7) Evaluation of the carrier's safety inspection, maintenance, and 
repair facilities or management systems, including verification of 
records of periodic vehicle inspections;
    (8) Verification of drivers' qualifications, including confirmation 
of the validity of the Licencia de Federal de Conductor of each driver 
the carrier intends to assign to operate under its provisional operating 
authority; and
    (9) An interview of carrier officials to review safety management 
controls and evaluate any written safety oversight policies and 
practices.
    (d) To successfully complete the safety audit, a Mexico-domiciled 
motor carrier must demonstrate to the FMCSA that it has the required 
elements in paragraphs (c)(2), (3), (4), (7), and (8) above and other 
basic safety management controls in place which function adequately to 
ensure minimum acceptable compliance with the applicable safety 
requirements. The FMCSA developed a ``safety audit evaluation 
criteria,'' which uses data from the safety audit and roadside 
inspections to determine that each applicant for provisional operating 
authority has basic safety management controls in place.
    (e) The safety audit evaluation process developed by the FMCSA is 
used to:
    (1) Evaluate basic safety management controls and determine if each 
Mexico-domiciled carrier and each driver is able to operate

[[Page 50]]

safely in the United States beyond municipalities and commercial zones 
on the United States-Mexico international border; and
    (2) Identify motor carriers and drivers who are having safety 
problems and need improvement in their compliance with the FMCSRs and 
the HMRs, before FMCSA grants the carriers provisional operating 
authority to operate beyond United States municipalities and commercial 
zones on the United States-Mexico international border.

     II. Source of the Data for the Safety Audit Evaluation Criteria

    (a) The FMCSA's evaluation criteria are built upon the operational 
tool known as the safety audit. The FMCSA developed this tool to assist 
auditors and investigators in assessing the adequacy of a Mexico-
domiciled carrier's basic safety management controls.
    (b) The safety audit is a review of a Mexico-domiciled motor 
carrier's operation and is used to:
    (1) Determine if a carrier has the basic safety management controls 
required by 49 U.S.C. 31144;
    (2) Meet the requirements of Section 350 of the DOT Appropriations 
Act; and
    (3) In the event that a carrier is found not to be in compliance 
with applicable FMCSRs and HMRs, the safety audit can be used to educate 
the carrier on how to comply with U.S. safety rules.
    (c) Documents such as those contained in driver qualification files, 
records of duty status, vehicle maintenance records, and other records 
are reviewed for compliance with the FMCSRs and HMRs. Violations are 
cited on the safety audit. Performance-based information, when 
available, is utilized to evaluate the carrier's compliance with the 
vehicle regulations. Recordable accident information is also collected.

  III. Overall Determination of the Carrier's Basic Safety Management 
                                Controls

    (a) The carrier will not be granted provisional operating authority 
if the FMCSA fails to:
    (1) Verify a controlled substances and alcohol testing program 
consistent with part 40 of this title;
    (2) Verify a system of compliance with hours-of-service rules of 
this subchapter, including recordkeeping and retention;
    (3) Verify proof of financial responsibility;
    (4) Verify records of periodic vehicle inspections; and
    (5) Verify drivers' qualifications of each driver the carrier 
intends to assign to operate under such authority, as required by parts 
383 and 391 of this subchapter, including confirming the validity of 
each driver's Licencia de Federal de Conductor.
    (b) If the FMCSA confirms each item under II (a)(1) through (5) 
above, the carrier will be granted provisional operating authority, 
except if FMCSA finds the carrier has inadequate basic safety management 
controls in at least three separate factors described in part III below. 
If FMCSA makes such a determination, the carrier's application for 
provisional operating authority will be denied.

                 IV. Evaluation of Regulatory Compliance

    (a) During the safety audit, the FMCSA gathers information by 
reviewing a motor carrier's compliance with ``acute'' and ``critical'' 
regulations of the FMCSRs and HMRs.
    (b) Acute regulations are those where noncompliance is so severe as 
to require immediate corrective actions by a motor carrier regardless of 
the overall basic safety management controls of the motor carrier.
    (c) Critical regulations are those where noncompliance relates to 
management and/or operational controls. These are indicative of 
breakdowns in a carrier's management controls.
    (d) The list of the acute and critical regulations, which are used 
in determining if a carrier has basic safety management controls in 
place, is included in Appendix B, VII. List of Acute and Critical 
Regulations to part 385 of this subchapter.
    (e) Noncompliance with acute and critical regulations are indicators 
of inadequate safety management controls and usually higher than average 
accident rates.
    (f) Parts of the FMCSRs and the HMRs having similar characteristics 
are combined together into six regulatory areas called ``factors.'' The 
regulatory factors, evaluated on the adequacy of the carrier's safety 
management controls, are:
    (1) Factor 1--General: Parts 387 and 390;
    (2) Factor 2--Driver: Parts 382, 383 and 391;
    (3) Factor 3--Operational: Parts 392 and 395;
    (4) Factor 4--Vehicle: Part 393, 396 and inspection data for the 
last 12 months;
    (5) Factor 5--Hazardous Materials: Parts 171, 177, 180 and 397; and
    (6) Factor 6--Accident: Recordable Accident Rate per Million Miles.
    (g) For each instance of noncompliance with an acute regulation, 1.5 
points will be assessed.
    (h) For each instance of noncompliance with a critical regulation, 1 
point will be assessed.
    (i) Vehicle Factor. (1) When at least three vehicle inspections are 
recorded in the Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS) 
during the twelve months before the safety audit or performed at the 
time of the review, the Vehicle Factor (part 396) will be evaluated on 
the basis of the Out-of-Service (OOS) rates and noncompliance with acute 
and critical regulations. The results of

[[Page 51]]

the review of the OOS rate will affect the Vehicle Factor as follows:
    (i) If the motor carrier has had at least three roadside inspections 
in the twelve months before the safety audit, and the vehicle OOS rate 
is 34 percent or higher, one point will be assessed against the carrier. 
That point will be added to any other points assessed for discovered 
noncompliance with acute and critical regulations of part 396 to 
determine the carrier's level of safety management control for that 
factor.
    (ii) If the motor carrier's vehicle OOS rate is less than 34 
percent, or if there are less than three inspections, the determination 
of the carrier's level of safety management controls will only be based 
on discovered noncompliance with the acute and critical regulations of 
part 396.
    (2) Over two million inspections occur on the roadside each year in 
the United States. This vehicle inspection information is retained in 
the MCMIS and is integral to evaluating motor carriers' ability to 
successfully maintain their vehicles, thus preventing them from being 
placed OOS during roadside inspections. Each safety audit will continue 
to have the requirements of part 396, Inspection, Repair, and 
Maintenance, reviewed as indicated by the above explanation.
    (j) Accident Factor. (1) In addition to the five regulatory factors, 
a sixth factor is included in the process to address the accident 
history of the motor carrier. This factor is the recordable accident 
rate, which the carrier has experienced during the past 12 months. 
Recordable accident, as defined in 49 CFR 390.5, means an accident 
involving a commercial motor vehicle operating on a public road in 
interstate or intrastate commerce which results in a fatality; a bodily 
injury to a person who, as a result of the injury, immediately receives 
medical treatment away from the scene of the accident; or one or more 
motor vehicles incurring disabling damage as a result of the accident 
requiring the motor vehicle to be transported away from the scene by a 
tow truck or other motor vehicle.
    (2) Experience has shown that urban carriers, those motor carriers 
operating entirely within a radius of less than 100 air miles (normally 
urban areas), have a higher exposure to accident situations because of 
their environment and normally have higher accident rates.
    (3) The recordable accident rate will be used in determining the 
carrier's basic safety management controls in Factor 6, Accident. It 
will be used only when a carrier incurs two or more recordable accidents 
within the 12 months before the safety audit. An urban carrier (a 
carrier operating entirely within a radius of 100 air miles) with a 
recordable rate per million miles greater than 1.7 will be deemed to 
have inadequate basic safety management controls for the accident 
factor. All other carriers with a recordable accident rate per million 
miles greater than 1.5 will be deemed to have inadequate basic safety 
management controls for the accident factor. The rates are the result of 
roughly doubling the United States national average accident rate in 
Fiscal Years 1994, 1995, and 1996.
    (4) The FMCSA will continue to consider preventability when a new 
entrant contests the evaluation of the accident factor by presenting 
compelling evidence that the recordable rate is not a fair means of 
evaluating its accident factor. Preventability will be determined 
according to the following standard: ``If a driver, who exercises normal 
judgment and foresight, could have foreseen the possibility of the 
accident that in fact occurred, and avoided it by taking steps within 
his/her control which would not have risked causing another kind of 
mishap, the accident was preventable.''
    (k) Factor Ratings
    (1) The following table shows the five regulatory factors, parts of 
the FMCSRs and HMRs associated with each factor, and the accident 
factor. Each carrier's level of basic safety management controls with 
each factor is determined as follows:
    (i) Factor 1--General: Parts 390 and 387;
    (ii) Factor 2--Driver: Parts 382, 383, and 391;
    (iii) Factor 3--Operational: Parts 392 and 395;
    (iv) Factor 4--Vehicle: Parts 393, 396 and the Out of Service Rate;
    (v) Factor 5--Hazardous Materials: Part 171, 177, 180 and 397; and
    (vi) Factor 6--Accident: Recordable Accident Rate per Million Miles;
    (2) For paragraphs III (k)(1)(i) through (v) (Factors 1 through 5), 
if the combined violations of acute and or critical regulations for each 
factor is equal to three or more points, the carrier is determined not 
to have basic safety management controls for that individual factor.
    (3) For paragraphs III (k)(1)(vi), if the recordable accident rate 
is greater than 1.7 recordable accidents per million miles for an urban 
carrier (1.5 for all other carriers), the carrier is determined to have 
inadequate basic safety management controls.
    (l) Notwithstanding FMCSA verification of the items listed in part 
II (a)(1) through (5) above, if the safety audit determines the carrier 
has inadequate basic safety management controls in at least three 
separate factors described in part III, the carrier's application for 
provisional operating authority will be denied. For example, FMCSA 
evaluates a carrier finding:
    (1) One instance of noncompliance with a critical regulation in part 
387 scoring one point for Factor 1;
    (2) Two instances of noncompliance with acute regulations in part 
382 scoring three points for Factor 2;

[[Page 52]]

    (3) Three instances of noncompliance with critical regulations in 
part 396 scoring three points for Factor 4; and
    (4) Three instances of noncompliance with acute regulations in parts 
171 and 397 scoring four and one-half (4.5) points for Factor 5.
    Under this example, the carrier will not receive provisional 
operating authority because it scored three or more points for Factors 
2, 4, and 5 and FMCSA determined the carrier had inadequate basic safety 
management controls in at least three separate factors.

<R05>
Sec. 367.2  Participation by States.

    (a) A State is eligible to participate as a registration State and 
to receive fee revenue only if, as of January 1, 1991, it charged or 
collected a fee for a vehicle identification stamp or a number pursuant 
to the provisions of the predecessor to this part.
    (b) An eligible State that intends either to commence or to cease 
participating in the registration program must publish notice of its 
intention by the 1st day of July of the year preceding the registration 
year in which it will commence or cease participating.


<R05>
Sec. 367.3  Selection of registration State.

    (a) Each motor carrier required to register and pay filing fees must 
select a single participating State as its registration State. The 
carrier must select the State in which it maintains its principal place 
of business, if such State is a participating State. A carrier that 
maintains its principal place of business outside of a participating 
State must select the State in which it will operate the largest number 
of motor vehicles during the next registration year. In the event a 
carrier will operate the same largest number of vehicles in more than 
one State, it must select one of those States.
    (b) A carrier may not change its registration State unless it 
changes its principal place of business or its registration State ceases 
participating in the program, in which case the carrier must select a 
registration State for the next registration year under the standards of 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) A carrier must give notice of its selection to the State 
commission of its selected registration State, and, the State commission 
of its prior registration State, within 30 days after it has made its 
selection. If a carrier changes its principal place of business during 
the annual registration period specified in Sec. 367.4(b)(2), the 
carrier may continue to use its prior registration State, if any, for 
the next registration year.
    (d) A carrier must give notice of its selection to its insurer or 
insurers as soon as practicable after it has made its selection.

<R05>
Sec. 367.4  Requirements for registration.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section with 
regard to a carrier operating under temporary authority, only a motor 
carrier holding a certificate or permit issued by the Secretary under 49 
U.S.C. 13902 shall be required to register under these standards.

[[Page 54]]

    (b) A motor carrier operating in interstate or foreign commerce in 
one or more participating States under a certificate or permit issued by 
the Secretary shall be required to register annually with a single 
registration State, and such registration shall be deemed to satisfy the 
registration requirements of all participating States.
    (1) The registration year will be the calendar year.
    (2) A carrier must file its annual registration application between 
the 1st day of August and the 30th day of November of the year preceding 
the registration year. A carrier that intends to commence operating 
during the current registration year may register at any time, but it 
must do so before it commences operating.
    (3) The registration application must be in the form appended to 
this part and must contain the information and be accompanied by the 
fees specified in paragraph (c) of this section. There will be no 
prorating of fees to account for partial year operations.
    (4) A carrier that has changed its registration State since its last 
filing must identify the registration State with which it previously 
filed.
    (c) A motor carrier must file, or cause to be filed, the following 
with its registration State:
    (1) Copies of its certificates and/or permits. A carrier must 
supplement its filing by submitting copies of any new operating 
authorities as they are issued. Once a carrier has submitted copies of 
its authorities, it may thereafter satisfy the filing requirement by 
certifying that the copies are on file. A carrier may, with the 
permission of its registration State, submit a summary of its operating 
authorities in lieu of copies. A carrier granted emergency temporary 
authority or temporary authority having a duration of 120 days or less 
is not required to file evidence of such authority, but it must 
otherwise comply with the requirements of this section;
    (2) A copy of its proof of public liability security submitted to 
and accepted by the Secretary under 49 CFR part 387, subpart C or a copy 
of an order of the Secretary approving a public liability self-insurance 
application or other public liability security or agreement under the 
provisions of that part. A carrier must supplement its filings as 
necessary to ensure that current information is on file. Once a carrier 
has submitted, or caused to be submitted, a copy of its proof or order 
of the Secretary, it may thereafter satisfy the filing requirement by 
certifying that it has done so and that its security, self-insurance, or 
agreement remains in effect;
    (3) A copy of its designation of an agent or agents for service of 
process submitted to and accepted by the Secretary under 49 CFR part 
366. A carrier must supplement its filings as necessary to ensure that 
current information is on file. Once a carrier has submitted a copy of 
its designation, it may thereafter satisfy the filing requirement by 
certifying that its designation is on file; and
    (4) A fee for the filing of proof of insurance. In support of such 
fee, the carrier must submit the following information:
    (i) The number of motor vehicles it intends to operate in each 
participating State during the next registration year;
    (ii) The per vehicle fee each pertinent participating State charges, 
which fee must equal the fee, not to exceed $10, that such State 
collected or charged as of November 15, 1991;
    (iii) The total fee due each participating State; and
    (iv) The total of all fees specified in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of 
this section.
    (d) Consistent with its obligations under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, a carrier must cause to be timely filed with its registration 
State copies of any notices of cancellation or of any replacement 
certificates of insurance, surety bonds, or other security filed with 
the Secretary under 49 CFR part 387, subpart C.
    (e) A carrier must make such supplemental filings at any time during 
the registration year as may be necessary to specify additional vehicles 
and/or States of operation and to pay additional fees.
    (f) A motor carrier must submit to its insurer or insurers a copy of 
the supporting information, including any supplemental information, 
filed with

[[Page 55]]

its registration State under paragraphs (c)(4) and (e) of this section.
    (g) The charging or collection of any fee that is not in accordance 
with the fee system established above is deemed a burden on interstate 
commerce. This includes fees for the registration or filing of evidence 
of insurance whether assessed directly upon the carrier or indirectly 
upon the insurance provider or other party who seeks reimbursement from 
the carrier.
    (h) To the extent any State registration requirement imposes 
obligations in excess of those specified in this part, the requirement 
is an unreasonable burden on transportation within the Secretary's 
jurisdiction under 49 U.S.C. 13501.

<R05>
Sec. 367.5  Registration receipts.

    (a) On compliance by a motor carrier with the annual or supplemental 
registration requirements of Sec. 367.4, the registration State must 
issue the carrier a receipt reflecting that the carrier has filed the 
required proof of insurance and paid fees in accordance with the 
requirements of that section. The registration State also must issue a 
number of official copies of the receipt equal to the number of motor 
vehicles for which fees have been paid.
    (1) The receipt and official copies must contain only information 
identifying the carrier and specifying the States for which fees were 
paid. Supplemental receipts and official copies need contain only 
information relating to their underlying supplemental registrations.
    (b) Receipts and official copies issued pursuant to a filing made 
during the annual registration period specified in Sec. 367.4(b)(2) 
must be issued within 30 days of filing of a fully acceptable 
registration application. All other receipts and official copies must be 
issued by the 30th day following the date of filing of a fully 
acceptable supplemental registration application. All receipts and 
official copies shall expire at midnight on the 31st day of December of 
the registration year for which they were issued.
    (c) A carrier is permitted to operate its motor vehicles only in 
those participating States with respect to which it has paid appropriate 
fees, as indicated on the receipts and official copies. It may not 
operate more motor vehicles in a participating State than the number for 
which it has paid fees.
    (d) A motor carrier may not copy or alter a receipt or an official 
copy of a receipt.
    (e) A motor carrier must maintain in each of its motor vehicles an 
official copy of its receipt indicating that it has filed the required 
proof of insurance and paid appropriate fees for each State in which it 
operates.
    (f) A motor carrier may transfer its official copies of its receipts 
from vehicles taken out of service to their replacement vehicles.
    (g) The driver of a motor vehicle must present an official copy of a 
receipt for inspection by any authorized government personnel on 
reasonable demand.
    (h) No registration State shall require decals, stamps, cab cards, 
or any other means of registering or identifying specific vehicles 
operated by a motor carrier.

<R05>
Sec. 367.6  Registration State accounting.

    (a) A participating State must, on or before the last day of each 
month, allocate and remit to each other participating State the 
appropriate portion of the fee revenue registrants submitted during the 
preceding month. Each remittance must be accompanied by a supporting 
statement identifying registrants and specifying the number of motor 
vehicles for which each registrant submitted fees. A participating State 
must submit a report of ``no activity'' to any other participating State 
for which it collected no fees during any month.
    (b) A participating State must maintain records of fee revenue 
received from and remitted to each other participating State. Such 
records must specify the fees received from and remitted to each 
participating State

[[Page 56]]

with respect to each motor carrier registrant. A participating State 
must retain such records for a minimum of 3 years.
    (c) A participating State must keep records pertaining to each of 
the motor carriers for which it acts as a registration State. The 
records must, at a minimum, include copies of annual and supplemental 
registration applications containing the information required by Sec. 
367.4(c). A registration State must retain all such records for a 
minimum of 3 years.

    Editorial Note: Nomenclature changes to part 370 appear at 66 FR 
49870, Oct. 1, 2001.


<R05>
Sec. 370.1  Applicability of regulations.

    The regulations set forth in this part shall govern the processing 
of claims for loss, damage, injury, or delay to property transported or 
accepted for transportation, in interstate or foreign commerce, by each 
motor carrier, water carrier, and freight forwarder (hereinafter called 
carrier), subject to 49 U.S.C. subtitle IV, part B.


<R05>
Sec. 370.3  Filing of claims.

    (a) Compliance with regulations. A claim for loss or damage to 
baggage or for loss, damage, injury, or delay to cargo, shall not be 
voluntarily paid by a carrier unless filed, as provided in paragraph (b) 
of this section, with the receiving or delivering carrier, or carrier 
issuing the bill of lading, receipt, ticket, or baggage check, or 
carrier on whose line the alleged loss, damage, injury, or delay 
occurred, within the specified time limits applicable thereto and as 
otherwise may be required by law, the terms of the bill of lading or 
other contract of carriage, and all tariff provisions applicable 
thereto.
    (b) Minimum filing requirements. A written or electronic 
communication (when agreed to by the carrier and shipper or receiver 
involved) from a claimant, filed with a proper carrier within the time 
limits specified in the bill of lading or contract of carriage or 
transportation and:
    (1) Containing facts sufficient to identify the baggage or shipment 
(or shipments) of property,
    (2) Asserting liability for alleged loss, damage, injury, or delay, 
and
    (3) Making claim for the payment of a specified or determinable 
amount of money, shall be considered as sufficient compliance with the 
provisions for filing claims embraced in the bill of lading or other 
contract of carriage; Provided, however, That where claims are 
electronically handled, procedures are established to ensure reasonable 
carrier access to supporting documents.
    (c) Documents not constituting claims. Bad order reports, appraisal 
reports of damage, notations of shortage or damage, or both, on freight 
bills, delivery

[[Page 60]]

receipts, or other documents, or inspection reports issued by carriers 
or their inspection agencies, whether the extent of loss or damage is 
indicated in dollars and cents or otherwise, shall, standing alone, not 
be considered by carriers as sufficient to comply with the minimum claim 
filing requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Claims filed for uncertain amounts. Whenever a claim is 
presented against a proper carrier for an uncertain amount, such as 
``$100 more or less,'' the carrier against whom such claim is filed 
shall determine the condition of the baggage or shipment involved at the 
time of delivery by it, if it was delivered, and shall ascertain as 
nearly as possible the extent, if any, of the loss or damage for which 
it may be responsible. It shall not, however, voluntarily pay a claim 
under such circumstances unless and until a formal claim in writing for 
a specified or determinable amount of money shall have been filed in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) Other claims. If investigation of a claim develops that one or 
more other carriers has been presented with a similar claim on the same 
shipment, the carrier investigating such claim shall communicate with 
each such other carrier and, prior to any agreement entered into between 
or among them as to the proper disposition of such claim or claims, 
shall notify all claimants of the receipt of conflicting or overlapping 
claims and shall require further substantiation, on the part of each 
claimant of his/her title to the property involved or his/her right with 
respect to such claim.


<R05>
Sec. 370.5  Acknowledgment of claims.

    (a) Each carrier shall, upon receipt in writing or by electronic 
transmission of a proper claim in the manner and form described in the 
regulations in the past, acknowledge the receipt of such claim in 
writing or electronically to the claimant within 30 days after the date 
of its receipt by the carrier unless the carrier shall have paid or 
declined such claim in writing or electronically within 30 days of the 
receipt thereof. The carrier shall indicate in its acknowledgment to the 
claimant what, if any, additional documentary evidence or other 
pertinent information may be required by it further to process the claim 
as its preliminary examination of the claim, as filed, may have 
revealed.
    (b) The carrier shall at the time each claim is received create a 
separate file and assign thereto a successive claim file number and note 
that number on all documents filed in support of the claim and all 
records and correspondence with respect to the claim, including the 
acknowledgment of receipt. At the time such claim is received the 
carrier shall cause the date of receipt to be recorded on the face of 
the claim document, and the date of receipt shall also appear in the 
carrier's acknowledgment of receipt to the claimant. The carrier shall 
also cause the claim file number to be noted on the shipping order, if 
in its possession, and the delivery receipt, if any, covering such 
shipment, unless the carrier has established an orderly and consistent 
internal procedure for assuring:
    (1) That all information contained in shipping orders, delivery 
receipts, tally sheets, and all other pertinent records made with 
respect to the transportation of the shipment on which claim is made, is 
available for examination upon receipt of a claim;
    (2) That all such records and documents (or true and complete 
reproductions thereof) are in fact examined in the course of the 
investigation of the claim (and an appropriate record is made that such 
examination has in fact taken place); and
    (3) That such procedures prevent the duplicate or otherwise unlawful 
payment of claims.


<R05>
Sec. 370.7  Investigation of claims.

    (a) Prompt investigation required. Each claim filed against a 
carrier in the manner prescribed in this part shall be promptly and 
thoroughly investigated if investigation has not already been made prior 
to receipt of the claim.
    (b) Supporting documents. When a necessary part of an investigation, 
each claim shall be supported by the original bill of lading, evidence 
of the freight charges, if any, and either the original invoice, a 
photographic copy of the original invoice, or an exact

[[Page 61]]

copy thereof or any extract made therefrom, certified by the claimant to 
be true and correct with respect to the property and value involved in 
the claim; or certification of prices or values, with trade or other 
discounts, allowance, or deductions, of any nature whatsoever and the 
terms thereof, or depreciation reflected thereon; Provided, however, 
That where property involved in a claim has not been invoiced to the 
consignee shown on the bill of lading or where an invoice does not show 
price or value, or where the property involved has been sold, or where 
the property has been transferred at bookkeeping values only, the 
carrier shall, before voluntarily paying a claim, require the claimant 
to establish the destination value in the quantity, shipped, 
transported, or involved; Provided, further, That when supporting 
documents are determined to be a necessary part of an investigation, the 
supporting documents are retained by the carriers for possible FMCSA 
inspection.
    (c) Verification of loss. When an asserted claim for loss of an 
entire package or an entire shipment cannot be otherwise authenticated 
upon investigation, the carrier shall obtain from the consignee of the 
shipment involved a certified statement in writing that the property for 
which the claim is filed has not been received from any other source.


<R05>
Sec. 370.9  Disposition of claims.

    (a) Each carrier subject to 49 U.S.C. subtitle IV, part B which 
receives a written or electronically transmitted claim for loss or 
damage to baggage or for loss, damage, injury, or delay to property 
transported shall pay, decline, or make a firm compromise settlement 
offer in writing or electronically to the claimant within 120 days after 
receipt of the claim by the carrier; Provided, however, That, if the 
claim cannot be processed and disposed of within 120 days after the 
receipt thereof, the carrier shall at that time and at the expiration of 
each succeeding 60-day period while the claim remains pending, advise 
the claimant in writing or electronically of the status of the claim and 
the reason for the delay in making final disposition thereof and it 
shall retain a copy of such advice to the claimant in its claim file 
thereon.
    (b) When settling a claim for loss or damage, a common carrier by 
motor vehicle of household goods as defined in Sec. 375.1(b)(1) of this 
chapter shall use the replacement costs of the lost or damaged item as a 
base to apply a depreciation factor to arrive at the current actual 
value of the lost or damaged item: Provided, That where an item cannot 
be replaced or no suitable replacement is obtainable, the proper measure 
of damages shall be the original costs, augmented by a factor derived 
from a consumer price index, and adjusted downward by a factor 
depreciation over average useful life.


<R05>
Sec. 370.11  Processing of salvage.

    (a) Whenever baggage or material, goods, or other property 
transported by a carrier subject to the provisions in this part is 
damaged or alleged to be damaged and is, as a consequence thereof, not 
delivered or is rejected or refused upon tender thereof to the owner, 
consignee, or person entitled to receive such property, the carrier, 
after giving due notice, whenever practicable to do so, to the owner and 
other parties that may have an interest therein, and unless advised to 
the contrary after giving such notice, shall undertake to sell or 
dispose of such property directly or by the employment of a competent 
salvage agent. The carrier shall only dispose of the property in a 
manner that will fairly and equally protect the best interests of all 
persons having an interest therein. The carrier shall make an itemized 
record sufficient to identify the property involved so as to be able to 
correlate it to the shipment or transportation involved, and claim, if 
any, filed thereon. The carrier also shall assign to each lot of such 
property a successive lot number and note that lot number on its record 
of shipment and claim, if any claim is filed thereon.
    (b) Whenever disposition of salvage material or goods shall be made 
directly to an agent or employee of a carrier or through a salvage agent 
or company in which the carrier or one or more of its directors, 
officers, or managers has any interest, financial or otherwise, that 
carrier's salvage

[[Page 62]]

records shall fully reflect the particulars of each such transaction or 
relationship, or both, as the case may be.
    (c) Upon receipt of a claim on a shipment on which salvage has been 
processed in the manner prescribed in this section, the carrier shall 
record in its claim file thereon the lot number assigned, the amount of 
money recovered, if any, from the disposition of such property, and the 
date of transmittal of such money to the person or persons lawfully 
entitled to receive the same.

    This part applies, to the extent provided therein, to all brokers of 
transportation by motor vehicle as defined in Sec. 371.2.

<R05>
Sec. 371.2  Definitions.

    (a) Broker means a person who, for compensation, arranges, or offers 
to arrange, the transportation of property by an authorized motor 
carrier. Motor carriers, or persons who are employees or bona fide 
agents of carriers, are not brokers within the meaning of this section 
when they arrange or offer to arrange the transportation of shipments 
which they are authorized to transport and which they have accepted and 
legally bound themselves to transport.
    (b) Bona fide agents are persons who are part of the normal 
organization of a motor carrier and perform duties under the carrier's 
directions pursuant to a preexisting agreement which provides for a 
continuing relationship, precluding the exercise of discretion on the 
part of the agent in allocating traffic between the carrier and others.
    (c) Brokerage or brokerage service is the arranging of 
transportation or the physical movement of a motor vehicle or of 
property. It can be performed on behalf of a motor carrier, consignor, 
or consignee.
    (d) Non-brokerage service is all other service performed by a broker 
on behalf of a motor carrier, consignor, or consignee.


<R05>
Sec. 371.3  Records to be kept by brokers.

    (a) A broker shall keep a record of each transaction. For purposes 
of this section, brokers may keep master lists of consignors and the 
address and registration number of the carrier, rather than repeating 
this information for each transaction. The record shall show:
    (1) The name and address of the consignor;
    (2) The name, address, and registration number of the originating 
motor carrier;
    (3) The bill of lading or freight bill number;
    (4) The amount of compensation received by the broker for the 
brokerage service performed and the name of the payer;
    (5) A description of any non-brokerage service performed in 
connection with each shipment or other activity, the amount of 
compensation received for the service, and the name of the payer; and
    (6) The amount of any freight charges collected by the broker and 
the date of payment to the carrier.
    (b) Brokers shall keep the records required by this section for a 
period of three years.
    (c) Each party to a brokered transaction has the right to review the 
record of the transaction required to be kept by these rules.

<R05>
Sec. 371.7  Misrepresentation.

    (a) A broker shall not perform or offer to perform any brokerage 
service (including advertising), in any name other than that in which 
its registration is issued.

[[Page 63]]

    (b) A broker shall not, directly or indirectly, represent its 
operations to be that of a carrier. Any advertising shall show the 
broker status of the operation.

<R05>
Sec. 371.9  Rebating and compensation.

    (a) A broker shall not charge or receive compensation from a motor 
carrier for brokerage service where:
    (1) The broker owns or has a material beneficial interest in the 
shipment or
    (2) The broker is able to exercise control over the shipment because 
the broker owns the shipper, the shipper owns the broker, or there is 
common ownership of the two.
    (b) A broker shall not give or offer to give anything of value to 
any shipper, consignor or consignee (or their officers or employees) 
except inexpensive advertising items given for promotional purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 371.10  Duties and obligations of brokers.

    Where the broker acts on behalf of a person bound by law or the 
FMCSA regulation as to the transmittal of bills or payments, the broker 
must also abide by the law or regulations which apply to that person.

[45 FR 68943, Oct. 17, 1980, as amended at 62 FR 15421, Apr. 1, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 371.13  Accounting.

    Each broker who engages in any other business shall maintain 
accounts so that the revenues and expenses relating to the brokerage 
portion of its business are segregated from its other activities. 
Expenses that are common shall be allocated on an equitable basis; 
however, the broker must be prepared to explain the basis for the 
allocation.

<R05>
Sec. 372.107  Definitions.

    As used in the regulations in this part, the following terms shall 
have the meaning shown:
    (a) Cooperative association. The term ``cooperative association'' 
means an association which conforms to the following definition in the 
Agricultural Marketing Act, approved June 15, 1929, as amended (12 
U.S.C. 1141j):

    As used in this Act, the term cooperative association means any 
association in which farmers act together in processing, preparing for 
market, handling, and/or marketing the farm products of persons so 
engaged, and also means any association in which farmers act together in 
purchasing, testing, grading, processing, distributing, and/or 
furnishing farm supplies and/or farm business services. Provided, 
however, That such associations are operated for the mutual benefit of 
the members thereof as such producers or purchasers and conform to one 
or both of the following requirements:
    First. That no member of the association is allowed more than one 
vote because of the amount of stock or membership capital he may own 
therein; and
    Second. That the association does not pay dividends on stock or 
membership capital in excess of 8 per centum per annum.
    And in any case to the following:
    Third. That the association shall not deal in farm products, farm 
supplies and farm business services with or for nonmembers in an amount 
greater in value than the total amount of such business transacted by it 
with or for members. All business transacted by any cooperative 
association for or on behalf of the United States or any agency or 
instrumentality thereof shall be disregarded in determining the volume 
of member and nonmember business transacted by such association.


Associations which do not conform to such definition are not eligible to 
operate under the partial exemption of 49 U.S.C. 13506(a)(5).
    (b) Federation of cooperative associations. The term ``federation of 
cooperative associations'' means a federation composed of either two or 
more cooperative associations, or one or more farmers, which federation 
possesses no greater powers or purposes than a cooperative association 
as defined in paragraph (a) of this section. Federations of cooperative 
associations which do not conform to such definition are not eligible to 
operate under the partial exemption of 49 U.S.C. 13506(a)(5).
    (c) Member. The term ``member'' means any farmer or cooperative 
association which has consented to be, has been accepted as, and is a 
member in good standing in accordance with the constitution, bylaws, or 
rules of the cooperative association or federation of cooperative 
associations.

[[Page 65]]

    (d) Farmer. The term ``farmer'' means any individual, partnership, 
corporation, or other business entity to the extent engaged in farming 
operations either as a producer of agricultural commodities or as a farm 
owner.
    (e) Interstate transportation. The term ``interstate 
transportation'' means transportation by motor vehicle in interstate or 
foreign commerce subject to the FMCSA's jurisdiction as set forth in 49 
U.S.C. 13501.
    (f) Member transportation. The term ``member transportation'' means 
transportation performed by a cooperative association or federation of 
cooperative associations for itself or for its members, but does not 
include transportation performed in furtherance of the nonfarm business 
of such members.
    (g) Nonmember transportation. The term ``nonmember transportation'' 
means transportation performed by a cooperative association or 
federation of cooperative associations other than member transportation 
as defined in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (h) Fiscal year. The term ``fiscal year'' means the annual 
accounting period adopted by the cooperative association or federation 
of cooperative associations for Federal income tax reporting purposes.

FR 13353, Mar. 30, 1982; 47 FR 15142, Apr. 8, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 372.109  Computation of tonnage allowable in nonfarm-non-member 
transportation.

    Interstate transportation performed by a cooperative association or 
federation of cooperative associations for nonmembers who are not 
farmers, cooperative associations, or federations of associations or the 
United States Government for compensation, (except transportation 
otherwise exempt under subtitle IV, part B, chapter 135 of title 49 of 
the United States Code) shall be limited to that which is incidental to 
its primary transportation operation and necessary for its effective 
performance. It shall in no event exceed 25 percent of its total 
interstate transportation services in any fiscal year, measured in terms 
of tonnage. A cooperative association or federation of cooperative 
associations may transport its own property, its members' property, 
property of other farmers and the property of other cooperatives or 
federations in accordance with existing law, except where the provisions 
of Sec. 372.111 may be applicable to the limit on member/nonmember 
transportation.
    (a) The phrase ``incidental to its primary transportation operation 
and necessary for its effective performance'' means that the interstate 
transportation of the cooperative association or federation of 
cooperation association for nonmembers as described above is performed 
with the same trucks or tractors employed in a prior or subsequent trip 
in the primary transportation operation of the cooperative association 
or federation, that it is not economically feasible to operate the 
trucks or tractors empty on return trips (outbound trips in cases where 
the primary transportation operation is inbound to the association or 
federation), and that the additional income obtained from such 
transportation is necessary to make the primary transportation operation 
financially practicable. Transportation for nonmembers as described 
above performed by a cooperative or federation through the use of trucks 
or tractors trip-leased for one-way movements with the cooperative 
association or federation acting as leasee, is not incidental and 
necessary;
    (b) The base tonnage to which the 25-percent limitation is applied 
is all tonnage of all kinds transported by the cooperative association 
or federation of cooperative associations in interstate or foreign 
commerce, whether for itself, its members or nonmembers, for or on 
behalf of the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof, 
and that performed within the exemption provided by 49 U.S.C.

that the zone within which motor transportation is incidental to 
transportation by aircraft, except as it may be individually determined 
as provided in section (c) herein, shall not exceed in size the area 
encompassed by a 25-mile radius of the boundary of the airport at which

    (b) Substituted motor-for-air transportation due to emergency 
conditions. Transportation of passengers by motor vehicle is

air carrier.
    (c) Individual determination of exempt zones. Upon its own motion or 
upon petition filed by any interested person, the Secretary may in an

within the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, should be 
individually determined with respect to any particular airport or city 
served by an airport, and whether there should be established therefor 
appropriate boundaries differing in extent from this defined in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

                     Subpart A_General Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 375.101  Who must follow these regulations?

    You, a for-hire motor carrier engaged in the interstate 
transportation of household goods, must follow these regulations when 
offering your services to individual shippers. You are subject to this 
part only when you transport household goods for individual shippers by 
motor vehicle in interstate commerce as defined in Sec. 390.5 of this 
subchapter.

[69 FR 10575, Mar. 5, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 375.103  What are the definitions of terms used in this part?

    Terms used in this part are defined as follows. You may find other 
terms used in these regulations defined in 49 U.S.C. 13102. The 
definitions contained in this statute control. If terms are used in this 
part and the terms are neither defined here nor in 49 U.S.C. 13102, the 
terms will have the ordinary practical meaning of such terms.
    Advertisement means any communication to the public in connection 
with an offer or sale of any interstate household goods transportation 
service. This includes written or electronic database listings of your 
name, address, and telephone number in an on-line database. This 
excludes listings of your name, address, and telephone number in a 
telephone directory or similar publication. However, Yellow Pages 
advertising is included in the definition.
    Cashier's check means a check that has all four of the following 
characteristics:
    (1) Drawn on a bank as defined in 12 CFR 229.2.
    (2) Signed by an officer or employee of the bank on behalf of the 
bank as drawer.
    (3) A direct obligation of the bank.
    (4) Provided to a customer of the bank or acquired from the bank for 
remittance purposes.
    Certified scale means any scale inspected and certified by an 
authorized scale inspection and licensing authority, and designed for 
weighing motor vehicles, including trailers or semi-trailers not 
attached to a tractor, or designed as a platform or warehouse type 
scale.
    Commercial shipper means any person who is named as the consignor or 
consignee in a bill of lading contract who is not the owner of the goods 
being transported but who assumes the responsibility for payment of the 
transportation and other tariff charges for the account of the 
beneficial owner of the goods. The beneficial owner of the goods is 
normally an employee of the consignor and/or consignee. A freight 
forwarder tendering a shipment to a carrier in furtherance of freight 
forwarder operations is also a commercial shipper. The Federal 
government is a government bill of lading shipper, not a commercial 
shipper.
    Force majeure means a defense protecting the parties in the event 
that a part of the contract cannot be performed due to causes which are 
outside the control of the parties and could not be avoided by exercise 
of due care.
    Government bill of lading shipper means any person whose property is 
transported under the terms and conditions of a government bill of 
lading

[[Page 87]]

issued by any department or agency of the Federal government to the 
carrier responsible for the transportation of the shipment.
    Household goods, as used in connection with transportation, means 
the personal effects or property used, or to be used, in a dwelling, 
when part of the equipment or supplies of the dwelling. Transportation 
of the household goods must be arranged and paid for by the individual 
shipper or by another individual on behalf of the shipper. Household 
goods includes property moving from a factory or store if purchased with 
the intent to use in a dwelling and transported at the request of the 
householder, who also pays the transportation charges.
    Individual shipper means any person who is the consignor or 
consignee of a household goods shipment identified as such in the bill 
of lading contract. The individual shipper owns the goods being 
transported and pays the transportation charges.
    May means an option. You may do something, but it is not a 
requirement.
    Must means a legal obligation. You must do something.
    Order for service means a document authorizing you to transport an 
individual shipper's household goods.
    Reasonable dispatch means the performance of transportation on the 
dates, or during the period, agreed upon by you and the individual 
shipper and shown on the Order For Service/Bill of Lading. For example, 
if you deliberately withhold any shipment from delivery after an 
individual shipper offers to pay the binding estimate or 110 percent of 
a non-binding estimate, you have not transported the goods with 
reasonable dispatch. The term ``reasonable dispatch'' excludes 
transportation provided under your tariff provisions requiring 
guaranteed service dates. You will have the defenses of force majeure, 
i.e., superior or irresistible force, as construed by the courts.
    Should means a recommendation. We recommend you do something, but it 
is not a requirement.
    Surface Transportation Board means an agency within the Department 
of Transportation. The Surface Transportation Board regulates household 
goods carrier tariffs among other responsibilities.
    Tariff means an issuance (in whole or in part) containing rates, 
rules, regulations, classifications or other provisions related to a 
motor carrier's transportation services. The Surface Transportation 
Board requires a tariff contain specific items under Sec. 1312.3(a) of 
this title. These specific items include an accurate description of the 
services offered to the public and the specific applicable rates (or the 
basis for calculating the specific applicable rates) and service terms. 
A tariff must be arranged in a way that allows for the determination of 
the exact rate(s) and service terms applicable to any given shipment.
    We, us, and our means the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration (FMCSA).
    You and your means a motor carrier engaged in the interstate 
transportation of household goods and its household goods agents.


<R05>
Sec. 375.105  What are the information collection requirements of 
this part?

    (a) The information collection requirements of this part have been 
reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) and have been 
assigned OMB control number 2126-0025.
    (b) The information collection requirements are found in the 
following sections: Section 375.205, Section 375.207, Section 375.209,

           Subpart B_Before Offering Services to My Customers

                        Liability Considerations


<R05>
Sec. 375.201  What is my normal liability for loss and damage when I 
accept goods from an individual shipper?

    (a) In general, you are legally liable for loss or damage if it 
happens during performance of any transportation of household goods and 
all related services identified on your lawful bill of lading.
    (b) You are liable for loss of, or damage to, any household goods to 
the extent provided in the current Surface Transportation Board's 
released rates order. Contact the Surface Transportation Board for a 
current copy of the Released Rates of Motor Carrier Shipments of 
Household Goods. The rate may be increased annually by the carrier based 
on the Department of Commerce's Cost of Living Adjustment.
    (c) As required by Sec. 375.303(g), you may have additional 
liability if you sell liability insurance and you fail to issue a copy 
of the insurance policy or other appropriate evidence of insurance.
    (d) You must, in a clear and concise manner, disclose to the 
individual shipper the limits of your liability.


<R05>
Sec. 375.203  What actions of an individual shipper may limit or reduce 
my normal liability?

    (a) If an individual shipper includes perishable, dangerous, or 
hazardous articles in the shipment without your knowledge, you need not 
assume liability for those articles or for the loss or damage caused by 
their inclusion in the shipment. If the shipper requests that you accept 
such articles for transportation, you may elect to limit your liability 
for any loss or damage by appropriately published tariff provisions.
    (b) If an individual shipper agrees to ship household goods released 
at a value greater than 60 cents per pound ($1.32 per kilogram) per 
article, your liability for loss and damage may be limited to $100 per 
pound ($220 per kilogram) per article if the individual shipper fails to 
notify you in writing of articles valued at more than $100 per pound 
($220 per kilogram).
    (c) If an individual shipper notifies you in writing that an article 
valued at greater than $100 per pound ($220 per kilogram) will be 
included in the shipment, the shipper will be entitled to full recovery 
up to the declared value of the article or articles, not to exceed the 
declared value of the entire shipment.

                        General Responsibilities


<R05>
Sec. 375.205  May I have agents?

    (a) You may have agents provided you comply with paragraphs (b) and 
(c) of this section. A household goods agent is defined as either one of 
the following two types of agents:
    (1) A prime agent provides a transportation service for you or on 
your behalf, including the selling of, or arranging for, a 
transportation service. You permit or require the agent to provide 
services under the terms of an agreement or arrangement with you. A 
prime agent does not provide services on an emergency or temporary 
basis. A prime agent does not include a household goods broker or 
freight forwarder.
    (2) An emergency or temporary agent provides origin or destination 
services on your behalf, excluding the selling of, or arranging for, a 
transportation service. You permit or require the agent to provide such 
services under the terms of an agreement or arrangement with you. The 
agent performs such services only on an emergency or temporary basis.
    (b) If you have agents, you must have written agreements between you 
and your prime agents. You and your retained prime agent must sign the 
agreements.
    (c) Copies of all your prime agent agreements must be in your files 
for a period of at least 24 months following the date of termination of 
each agreement.

straightforward, and honest advertisements.
    (b) You must include, and you must require each of your agents to 
include, in all advertisements for all services

[[Page 89]]

(including any accessorial services incidental to or part of interstate 
household goods transportation), the following two elements:
    (1) Your name or trade name, as it appears on our document assigning 
you a U.S. DOT number, or the name or trade name of the motor carrier 
under whose operating authority the advertised service will originate.
    (2) Your U.S. DOT number, assigned by us authorizing you to operate 
as a for-hire motor carrier transporting household goods.
    (c) Your FMCSA-assigned U.S. DOT number must be displayed only in 
the following form in every advertisement: U.S. DOT No. (assigned 
number).


<R05>

    (a) You must establish and maintain a procedure for responding to 
complaints and inquiries from your individual shippers.
    (b) Your procedure must include all four of the following items:
    (1) A communications system allowing individual shippers to

    (2) A telephone number.
    (3) A clear and concise statement about who must pay for complaint 
and inquiry telephone calls.
    (4) A written or electronic record system for recording all 
inquiries and complaints received from an individual shipper by any 
means of communication.
    (c) You must produce a clear and concise written description of your 
procedure for distribution to individual shippers.


<R05>
Sec. 375.211  Must I have an arbitration program?

    (a) You must have an arbitration program to resolve property loss 
and damage disputes for individual shippers. You must establish and 
maintain an arbitration program with the following 11 minimum elements:
    (1) You must design your arbitration program to prevent you from 
having any special advantage in any case where the claimant resides or 
does business at a place distant from your principal or other place of 
business.
    (2) Before execution of the order for service, you must provide 
notice to the individual shipper of the availability of neutral 
arbitration, including all three of the following items:
    (i) A summary of the arbitration procedure.
    (ii) Any applicable costs.
    (iii) A disclosure of the legal effects of election to use 
arbitration.
    (3) Upon the individual shipper's request, you must provide 
information and forms you consider necessary for initiating an action to 
resolve a dispute under arbitration.
    (4) You must require each person you authorize to arbitrate to be 
independent of the parties to the dispute and capable of resolving such 
disputes, and you must ensure the arbitrator is authorized and able to 
obtain from you or the individual shipper any material or relevant 
information to carry out a fair and expeditious decisionmaking process.
    (5) You must not charge the individual shipper more than one-half of 
the total cost for instituting the arbitration proceeding against you. 
In the arbitrator's decision, the arbitrator may determine which party 
must pay the cost or a portion of the cost of the arbitration 
proceeding, including the cost of instituting the proceeding.
    (6) You must refrain from requiring the individual shipper to agree 
to use arbitration before a dispute arises.
    (7) Arbitration must be binding for claims of $5,000 or less, if the 
individual shipper requests arbitration.
    (8) Arbitration must be binding for claims of more than $5,000, if 
the individual shipper requests arbitration and the carrier agrees to 
it.
    (9) If all parties agree, the arbitrator may provide for an oral 
presentation of a dispute by a party or representative of a party.
    (10) The arbitrator must render a decision within 60 days of receipt 
of written notification of the dispute, and a decision by an arbitrator 
may include any remedies appropriate under the circumstances.
    (11) The arbitrator may extend the 60-day period for a reasonable 
period if you or the individual shipper fail to

[[Page 90]]

provide, in a timely manner, any information the arbitrator reasonably 
requires to resolve the dispute.
    (b) You must produce and distribute a concise, easy-to-read, 
accurate summary of your arbitration program, including the items in 
this section.

[68 FR 35091, June 11, 2003, as amended at 69 FR 10575, Mar. 5, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 375.213  What information must I provide to a prospective individual 
shipper?

    (a) Before you execute an order for service for a shipment of 
household goods, you must furnish to your prospective individual 
shipper, all five of the following documents:
    (1) The contents of appendix A of this part, ``Your Rights and 
Responsibilities When You Move.''
    (2) A concise, easy-to-read, accurate estimate of your charges.
    (3) A notice of the availability of the applicable sections of your 
tariff for the estimate of charges, including an explanation that 
individual shippers may examine these tariff sections or have copies 
sent to them upon request.
    (4) A concise, easy-to-read, accurate summary of the your 
arbitration program.
    (5) A concise, easy to read, accurate summary of your customer 
complaint and inquiry handling procedures. Included in this description 
must be both of the following two items:
    (i) The main telephone number the individual shipper may use to 
communicate with you.
    (ii) A clear and concise statement concerning who must pay for 
telephone calls.
    (b) To comply with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you must 
produce and distribute a document with the text and general order of 
appendix A to this part as it appears. The following three items also 
apply:
    (1) If we, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, choose 
to modify the text or general order of appendix A, we will provide the 
public appropriate notice in the Federal Register and an opportunity for 
comment as required by part 389 of this chapter before making you change 
anything.
    (2) If you publish the document, you may choose the dimensions of 
the publication as long as the type font size is at least 10 point or 
greater and the size of the booklet is at least as large as 36 square 
inches (232 square centimeters).
    (3) If you publish the document, you may choose the color and design 
of the front and back covers of the publication. The following words 
must appear prominently on the front cover in at least 12 point or 
greater bold or full-faced type: ``Your Rights And Responsibilities When 
You Move. Furnished By Your Mover, As Required By Federal Law.'' You may 
substitute your name or trade name in place of ``Your Mover'' if you 
wish (for example, Furnished by XYZ Van Lines, As Required By Federal 
Law).
    (c) Paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section do not apply to 
exact copies of appendix A published in the Federal Register or the Code 
of Federal Regulations.

                    Collecting Transportation Charges


<R05>
Sec. 375.215  How must I collect charges?

    You must issue an honest, truthful freight or expense bill in 
accordance with subpart A of part 373 of this chapter. All rates and 
charges for the transportation and related services must be in 
accordance with your appropriately published tariff provisions in 
effect, including the method of payment.


<R05>
Sec. 375.217  How must I collect charges upon delivery?

    (a) You must specify the form of payment when you prepare the 
estimate. You and your agents must honor the form of payment at 
delivery, except when a shipper agrees to a change in writing.
    (b) You must specify the same form of payment provided in paragraph 
(a) of this section when you prepare the order for service and the bill 
of lading.
    (c) Charge or credit card payments:
    (1) If you agree to accept payment by charge or credit card, you 
must arrange with the individual shipper for the delivery only at a time 
when you can obtain authorization for the shipper's credit card 
transaction.
    (2) Paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply to you when you 
have equipped your motor vehicle(s) to process card transactions.

[[Page 91]]

    (d) You may maintain a tariff setting forth nondiscriminatory rules 
governing collect-on-delivery service and the collection of collect-on-
delivery funds.
    (e) If an individual shipper pays you at least 110 percent of the 
approximate costs of a non-binding estimate on a collect-on-delivery 
shipment, you must relinquish possession of the shipment at the time of 
delivery.

[68 FR 35091, June 11, 2003, as amended at 69 FR 10575, Mar. 5, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 375.219  May I extend credit to shippers?

    You may extend credit to shippers, but, if you do, it must be in 
accordance with Sec. 375.807.


<R05>
Sec. 375.221  May I use a charge or credit card plan for payments?

    (a) You may provide in your tariff for the acceptance of charge or 
credit cards for the payment of freight charges. Accepting charge or 
credit card payments is different than extending credit to shippers in 
Sec. Sec. 375.219 and 375.807. Once you provide an estimate you are 
bound by the provisions in your tariff regarding payment as of the 
estimate date, until completion of any transaction that results from 
that estimate, unless otherwise agreed with a shipper under Sec. 
375.217(a).
    (b) You may accept charge or credit cards whenever shipments are 
transported under agreements and tariffs requiring payment by cash, 
certified check, money order, or a cashier's check.
    (c) If you allow an individual shipper to pay for a freight or 
expense bill by charge or credit card, you are deeming such payment to 
be the same as payment by cash, certified check, money order, or a 
cashier's check.
    (d) The charge or credit card plans you participate in must be 
identified in your tariff rules as items permitting the acceptance of 
the charge or credit cards.
    (e) If an individual shipper causes a charge or credit card issuer 
to reverse a charge transaction, you may consider the individual 
shipper's action tantamount to forcing you to provide an involuntary 
extension of your credit. In such instances, the rules in Sec. 375.807 
apply.


<R04>
                   Subpart C_Service Options Provided


<R05>
Sec. 375.301  What service options may I provide?

    (a) You may design your household goods service to provide 
individual shippers with a wide range of specialized service and pricing 
features. Many carriers provide at least the following five service 
options:
    (1) Space reservation.
    (2) Expedited service.
    (3) Exclusive use of a vehicle.
    (4) Guaranteed service on or between agreed dates.
    (5) Liability insurance.
    (b) If you sell liability insurance, you must follow the 
requirements in Sec. 375.303.


<R05>
Sec. 375.303  If I sell liability insurance coverage, what must I do?

    (a) You, your employee, or an agent may sell, offer to sell, or 
procure liability insurance coverage for loss or damage to shipments of 
any individual shipper only when the individual shipper releases the 
shipment for transportation at a value not exceeding 60 cents per pound 
($1.32 per kilogram) per article.
    (b) You may offer, sell, or procure any type of insurance policy on 
behalf of the individual shipper covering loss or damage in excess of 
the specified carrier liability.
    (c) If you sell, offer to sell, or procure liability insurance 
coverage for loss or damage to shipments:
    (1) You must issue to the individual shipper a policy or other 
appropriate evidence of the insurance that the individual shipper 
purchased.
    (2) You must provide a copy of the policy or other appropriate 
evidence to the individual shipper at the time you sell or procure the 
insurance.
    (3) You must issue policies written in plain English.
    (4) You must clearly specify the nature and extent of coverage under 
the policy.

[[Page 92]]

    (5) Your failure to issue a policy, or other appropriate evidence of 
insurance purchased, to an individual shipper will subject you to full 
liability for any claims to recover loss or damage attributed to you.
    (6) You must provide in your tariff for the provision of selling, 
offering to sell, or procuring liability insurance coverage. The tariff 
must also provide for the base transportation charge, including your 
assumption of full liability for the value of the shipment. This would 
be in the event you fail to issue a policy or other appropriate evidence 
of insurance to the individual shipper at the time of purchase.

Sec. 375.401  Must I estimate charges?

    (a) Before you execute an order for service for a shipment of 
household goods for an individual shipper, you must estimate the total 
charges in writing. The written estimate must be one of the following 
two types:
    (1) A binding estimate, an agreement made in advance with your 
individual shipper. It guarantees the total cost of the move based upon 
the quantities and services shown on your estimate.
    (2) A non-binding estimate, what you believe the total cost will be 
for the move, based upon the estimated weight or volume of the shipment 
and the accessorial services requested. A non-binding estimate is not 
binding on you. You will base the final charges upon the actual weight 
of the individual shipper's shipment and the tariff provisions in 
effect.
    (b) You must specify the form of payment you and your agent will 
honor at delivery. Payment forms may include, but are not limited to, 
cash, a certified check, a money order, a cashier s check, a specific 
charge card such as American Express<SUP>TM</SUP>, a specific credit 
card such as Visa<SUP>TM</SUP>, or your credit as allowed by Sec. 
375.807.
    (c) For non-binding estimates, you must provide your reasonably 
accurate estimate of the approximate costs the individual shipper should 
expect to pay for the transportation and services of such shipments. If 
you provide an inaccurately low estimate, you may be limiting the amount 
you will collect at the time of delivery as provided in Sec. 375.407.
    (d) If you provide a shipper with an estimate based on volume that 
will later be converted to a weight-based rate, you must provide the 
shipper an explanation in writing of the formula used to calculate the 
conversion to weight. You must specify the final charges will be based 
on actual weight and services subject to the 110 percent rule at 
delivery.
    (e) You must determine charges for any accessorial services such as 
elevators, long carries, etc., before preparing the order for service 
and the bill of lading for binding or non-binding estimates. If you fail 
to ask the shipper about such charges and fail to determine such charges 
before preparing the order for service and the bill of lading, you must 
deliver the goods and bill the shipper after 30 days for the additional 
charges.
    (f) You and the individual shipper must sign the estimate of 
charges. You must provide a dated copy of the estimate of charges to the 
individual shipper at the time you sign the estimate.
    (g) Before loading a household goods shipment, and upon mutual 
agreement of both you and the individual shipper, you may amend an 
estimate of charges. You may not amend the estimate after loading the 
shipment.


<R05>
Sec. 375.403  How must I provide a binding estimate?

    (a) You may provide a guaranteed binding estimate of the total 
shipment charges to the individual shipper, so long as it is provided 
for in your tariff. The individual shipper must pay the amount for the 
services included in your estimate. You must comply with the following 
nine requirements:
    (1) You must provide a binding estimate in writing to the individual 
shipper or other person responsible for payment of the freight charges.
    (2) You must retain a copy of each binding estimate as an attachment 
to be made an integral part of the bill of lading contract.

[[Page 93]]

    (3) You must clearly indicate upon each binding estimate's face the 
estimate is binding upon you and the individual shipper. Each binding 
estimate must also clearly indicate on its face the charges shown are 
the charges being assessed for only those services specifically 
identified in the estimate.
    (4) You must clearly describe binding estimate shipments and all 
services you are providing.
    (5) If it appears an individual shipper has tendered additional 
household goods or requires additional services not identified in the 
binding estimate, you are not required to honor the estimate. If an 
agreement cannot be reached as to the price or service requirements for 
the additional goods or services, you are not required to service the 
shipment. However, if you do service the shipment, before loading the 
shipment, you must do one of the following three things:
    (i) Reaffirm your binding estimate.
    (ii) Negotiate a revised written binding estimate listing the 
additional household goods or services.
    (iii) Agree with the individual shipper, in writing, that both of 
you will consider the original binding estimate as a non-binding 
estimate subject to Sec. 375.405.
    (6) Once you load a shipment, failure to execute a new binding 
estimate or a non-binding estimate signifies you have reaffirmed the 
original binding estimate. You may not collect more than the amount of 
the original binding estimate.
    (7) If you believe additional services are necessary to properly 
service a shipment after the household goods are in transit, you must 
inform the individual shipper what the additional services are before 
performing those services. You must allow the shipper at least one hour 
to determine whether he or she wants the additional services performed. 
If the individual shipper agrees to pay for the additional services, you 
must execute a written attachment to be made an integral part of the 
bill of lading contract and have the individual shipper sign the written 
attachment. This may be done through fax transmissions; e-mail; 
overnight courier; or certified mail, return receipt requested. You must 
bill the individual shipper for the additional services after 30 days 
from delivery. If the individual shipper does not agree to pay the 
additional services, the carrier should perform only those additional 
services as are required to complete the delivery, and bill the 
individual shipper for the additional services after 30 days from 
delivery.
    (8) If the individual shipper requests additional services after the 
household goods are in transit, you must inform the individual shipper 
of the additional charges that will be billed. You must require full 
payment at destination of the original binding estimate only. You must 
bill for the payment of the balance of any remaining charges for 
additional services no sooner than 30 days after the date of delivery. 
For example, if your binding estimate to an individual shipper estimated 
total charges at delivery as $1,000, but your actual charges at 
destination are $1,500, you must deliver the shipment upon payment of 
$1,000. You must then issue freight or expense bills no sooner than 30 
days after the date of delivery for the remaining $500.
    (9) Failure to relinquish possession of a shipment upon an 
individual shipper's offer to pay the binding estimate amount 
constitutes a failure to transport a shipment with ``reasonable 
dispatch'' and subjects you to cargo delay claims pursuant to part 370 
of this chapter.
    (b) If you do not provide a binding estimate to an individual 
shipper, you must provide a non-binding estimate to the individual 
shipper in accordance with Sec. 375.405.
    (c) You must retain a copy of the binding estimate for each move you 
perform for at least one year from the date you made the estimate and 
keep it as an attachment to be made an integral part of the bill of 
lading contract.

<R05>
Sec. 375.405  How must I provide a non-binding estimate?

    (a) If you do not provide a binding estimate to an individual 
shipper in accordance with Sec. 375.403, you must provide a non-binding 
written estimate to the individual shipper.

[[Page 94]]

    (b) If you provide a non-binding estimate to an individual shipper, 
you must provide your reasonably accurate estimate of the approximate 
costs the individual shipper should expect to pay for the transportation 
and services of the shipment. You must comply with the following ten 
requirements:
    (1) You must provide reasonably accurate non-binding estimates based 
upon the estimated weight or volume of the shipment and services 
required. If you provide a shipper with an estimate based on volume that 
will later be converted to a weight-based rate, you must provide the 
shipper an explanation in writing of the formula used to calculate the 
conversion to weight.
    (2) You must explain to the individual shipper final charges 
calculated for shipments moved on non-binding estimates will be those 
appearing in your tariffs applicable to the transportation. You must 
explain to the individual shipper these final charges may exceed the 
approximate costs appearing in your estimate.
    (3) You must furnish non-binding estimates without charge and in 
writing to the individual shipper or other person responsible for 
payment of the freight charges.
    (4) You must retain a copy of each non-binding estimate as an 
attachment to be made an integral part of the bill of lading contract.
    (5) You must clearly indicate on the face of a non-binding estimate, 
the estimate is not binding upon you and the charges shown are the 
approximate charges to be assessed for the services identified in the 
estimate. The estimate must clearly state that the shipper may not be 
required to pay more than 110 percent of the non-binding estimate at the 
time of delivery.
    (6) You must clearly describe on the face of a non-binding estimate 
the entire shipment and all services you are providing.
    (7) If it appears an individual shipper has tendered additional 
household goods or requires additional services not identified in the 
non-binding estimate, you are not required to honor the estimate. If an 
agreement cannot be reached as to the price or service requirements for 
the additional goods or services, you are not required to service the 
shipment. However, if you do service the shipment, before loading the 
shipment, you must do one of the following two things:
    (i) Reaffirm your non-binding estimate.
    (ii) Negotiate a revised written non-binding estimate listing the 
additional household goods or services.
    (8) Once you load a shipment, failure to execute a new non-binding 
estimate signifies you have reaffirmed the original non-binding 
estimate. You may not collect more than 110 percent of the amount of the 
original non-binding estimate at destination.
    (9) If you believe additional services are necessary to properly 
service a shipment after the household goods are in transit, you must 
inform the individual shipper what the additional services are before 
performing those services. You must allow the shipper at least one hour 
to determine whether he or she wants the additional services performed. 
If the individual shipper agrees to pay for the additional services, you 
must execute a written attachment to be made an integral part of the 
bill of lading contract and have the individual shipper sign the written 
attachment. This may be done through fax transmissions; e-mail; 
overnight courier; or certified mail, return receipt requested. You must 
bill the individual shipper for the additional services after 30 days 
from delivery. If the individual shipper does not agree to pay the 
additional services, the carrier should perform only those additional 
services as are required to complete the delivery, and bill the 
individual shipper for the additional services after 30 days from 
delivery.
    (10) If the individual shipper requests additional services after 
the household goods are in-transit, you must inform the individual 
shipper additional charges will be billed. You may require full payment 
at destination of no more than 110 percent of the original non-binding 
estimate. You must bill for the payment of the balance of any remaining 
charges after 30 days after delivery. For example, if your non-binding 
estimate to an individual shipper estimated total charges at delivery as 
$1,000, but your actual charges at destination are $1,500, you must 
deliver

[[Page 95]]

the shipment upon payment of $1,100 (110 percent of the estimated 
charges) and forego demanding immediate payment of the balance. You then 
must issue a freight or expense bill for the remaining $400 after the 
30-day period expires.
    (c) If you furnish a non-binding estimate, you must enter the 
estimated charges upon the order for service and upon the bill of 
lading.
    (d) You must retain a copy of the non-binding estimate for each move 
you perform for at least one year from the date you made the estimate 
and keep it as an attachment to be made an integral part of the bill of 
lading contract.

<R05>
Sec. 375.407  Under what circumstances must I relinquish possession 
of a collect-on-delivery shipment transported under a non-binding estimate?

    (a) If an individual shipper pays you at least 110 percent of the 
approximate costs of a non-binding estimate on a collect-on-delivery 
shipment, you must relinquish possession of the shipment at the time of 
delivery. You must accept the form of payment agreed to at the time of 
estimate, unless the shipper agrees in writing to a change in the form 
of payment.
    (b) Failure to relinquish possession of a shipment upon an 
individual shipper's offer to pay 110 percent of the estimated charges 
constitutes a failure to transport the shipment with ``reasonable 
dispatch'' and subjects you to cargo delay claims pursuant to part 370 
of this chapter.
    (c) You must defer billing for the payment of the balance of any 
remaining charges for a period of 30 days following the date of 
delivery. After this 30-day period, you may demand payment of the 
balance of any remaining charges, as explained in Sec. 375.405.


<R05>
Sec. 375.409  May household goods brokers provide estimates?

    A household goods broker must not provide an individual shipper with 
an estimate of charges for the transportation of household goods unless 
there is a written agreement between the broker and you, the carrier, 
adopting the broker's estimate as your own estimate. If you make such an 
agreement with a broker, you must ensure compliance with all 
requirements of this part pertaining to estimates, including the 
requirement that you must relinquish possession of the shipment if the 
shipper pays you 110 percent of a non-binding estimate at the time of 
delivery.

<R05>
Sec. 375.505  Must I write up a bill of lading?

    (a) You must issue a bill of lading. The bill of lading must contain

                          Weighing the Shipment


<R05>
Sec. 375.507  Must I determine the weight of a shipment?

    (a) When you transport household goods on a non-binding estimate 
dependent upon the shipment weight, you must determine the weight of 
each shipment transported before the assessment of any charges.
    (b) You must weigh the shipment upon a certified scale.
    (c) You must provide a written explanation of volume to weight 
conversions, when you provide an estimate by volume and convert the 
volume to weight.


<R05>
Sec. 375.509  How must I determine the weight of a shipment?

    (a) You must weigh the shipment by using one of the following two 
methods:
    (1) First method--origin weigh. You determine the difference between 
the tare weight of the vehicle before loading at the origin of the 
shipment and the gross weight of the same vehicle after loading the 
shipment.
    (2) Second method--back weigh. You determine the difference between 
the gross weight of the vehicle with the shipment loaded and the tare 
weight of the same vehicle after you unload the shipment.
    (b) The following three conditions must exist for both the tare and 
gross weighings:
    (1) The vehicle must have installed or loaded all pads, dollies, 
hand trucks, ramps, and other equipment required in the transportation 
of the shipment.
    (2) The driver and other persons must be off the vehicle at the time 
of either weighing.
    (3) The fuel tanks on the vehicle must be full at the time of each 
weighing, or, in the alternative, when you use the first method--origin 
weigh, in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, where the tare weighing is 
the first weighing performed, you must refrain from adding fuel between 
the two weighings.
    (c) You may detach the trailer of a tractor-trailer vehicle 
combination from the tractor and have the trailer weighed separately at 
each weighing provided the length of the scale platform is adequate to 
accommodate and support the entire trailer at one time.
    (d) You must use the net weight of shipments transported in 
containers. You must calculate the difference between the tare weight of 
the container (including all pads, blocking and bracing used in the 
transportation of the

[[Page 99]]

shipment) and the gross weight of the container with the shipment loaded 
in the container.


<R05>
Sec. 375.511  May I use an alternative method for shipments weighing 
3,000 pounds or less?

    For shipments weighing 3,000 pounds or less (1,362 kilograms or 
less), you may weigh the shipment upon a platform or warehouse certified 
scale before loading for transportation or after unloading.


<R05>
Sec. 375.513  Must I give the individual shipper an opportunity to 
observe the weighing?

    You must give the individual shipper or any other person responsible 
for the payment of the freight charges the right to observe all 
weighings of the shipment. You must advise the individual shipper, or 
any other person entitled to observe the weighings, where and when each 
weighing will occur. You must give the person who will observe the 
weighings a reasonable opportunity to be present to observe the 
weighings.


<R05>
Sec. 375.515  May an individual shipper waive his/her right to observe 
each weighing?

    (a) If an individual shipper elects not to observe a weighing, the 
shipper is presumed to have waived that right.
    (b) If an individual shipper elects not to observe a reweighing, the 
shipper must waive that right in writing. The individual shipper may 
send the waiver notification via fax transmission; e-mail; overnight 
courier; or certified mail, return receipt requested.
    (c) Waiver of the right to observe a weighing or re-weighing does 
not affect any other rights of the individual shipper under this part or 
otherwise.

[68 FR 35091, June 11, 2003, as amended at 69 FR 10576, Mar. 5, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 375.517  May an individual shipper demand re-weighing?

    After you inform the individual shipper of the billing weight and 
total charges and before actually beginning to unload a shipment weighed 
at origin (first method under Sec. 375.509(a)(1)), the individual 
shipper may demand a re-weigh. You must base your freight bill charges 
upon the re-weigh weight.


<R05>

weight ticket for each weighing. The weigh master must sign each weight 
ticket. Each weight ticket must contain the following six items:
    (1) The complete name and location of the scale.
    (2) The date of each weighing.
    (3) The identification of the weight entries as being the tare, 
gross, or net weights.

the actual weight or charges for a shipment before I tender delivery?

    (a) If an individual shipper of a shipment being transported on a 
collect-on-delivery basis specifically requests notification of the 
actual weight or volume and charges on the shipment, you must comply 
with this request. This requirement is conditioned upon the individual 
shipper's supplying you with an address or telephone number where the 
individual shipper will receive the communication. You must make your 
notification by telephone; in person; fax transmissions; e-mail; 
overnight

[[Page 100]]

courier; or certified mail, return receipt requested.
    (b) The individual shipper must receive your notification at least 
one full 24-hour day before any tender of the shipment for delivery, 
excluding Saturdays, Sundays and Federal holidays.
    (c) You may disregard the 24-hour notification requirement on 
shipments in any one of the following three circumstances:
    (1) The shipment will be back weighed (i.e., weighed at 
destination).
    (2) Pickup and delivery encompass two consecutive weekdays, if the 
individual shipper agrees.
    (3) The shipment is moving under a non-binding estimate and the 
maximum payment required at time of delivery is 110 percent of the 
estimated charges, but only if the individual shipper agrees to waive 
the 24-hour notification requirement.

                  Subpart F_Transportation of Shipments


<R05>
Sec. 375.601  Must I transport the shipment in a timely manner?

dispatch service.'' You must provide reasonable dispatch service to all 
individual shippers, except for transportation on the basis of 
guaranteed pickup and delivery dates.


<R05>
Sec. 375.603  When must I tender a shipment for delivery?

    You must tender a shipment for delivery for an individual shipper on 
the agreed delivery date or within the period specified on the bill of 
lading. Upon the request or concurrence of the individual shipper, you 
may waive this requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 375.605  How must I notify an individual shipper of any service 
delays?

    (a) When you are unable to perform either the pickup or delivery of 
a shipment on the dates or during the periods specified in the order for 
service and as soon as the delay becomes apparent to you, you must 
notify the individual shipper of the delay, at your expense, in one of 
the following six ways:
    (1) By telephone.
    (2) In person.
    (3) Fax transmissions.
    (4) E-mail.
    (5) Overnight courier.
    (6) Certified mail, return receipt requested.

of notification.
    (2) You must prepare a written record of your amended date or period 
for pick-up or delivery.

<R05>
Sec. 375.607  What must I do if I am able to tender a shipment for final 
delivery more than 24 hours before a specified date?

    (a) You may ask the individual shipper to accept an early delivery 
date. If the individual shipper does not concur with your request or the 
individual shipper does not request an early delivery date, you may, at 
your discretion, place a shipment in storage under your own account and 
at your own expense in a warehouse located near the destination of the 
shipment. If you place the shipment in storage, you must comply with 
paragraph (b) of this section. You may comply with paragraph (c) of this 
section, at your discretion.
    (b) You must immediately notify the individual shipper of the name 
and address of the warehouse where you place the shipment. You must make 
and keep a record of your notification as a part of your shipment 
records. You have responsibility for the shipment under the terms and 
conditions of the

[[Page 101]]

bill of lading. You are responsible for the charges for redelivery, 
handling, and storage until you make final delivery.
    (c) You may limit your responsibility under paragraph (b) of this 
section up to the agreed delivery date or the first day of the period of 
time of delivery as specified in the bill of lading.


<R05>
Sec. 375.609  What must I do for shippers who store household goods in 
transit?

    (a) If you are holding goods for storage-in-transit (SIT) and the 
period of time is about to expire, you must comply with this section.
    (b) You must notify the individual shipper, in writing of the 
following four items:
    (1) The date of conversion to permanent storage.
    (2) The existence of a nine-month period after the date of

claims against you for loss or damage occurring to the goods in transit 
or during the storage-in-transit period.

    (4) The fact the individual shipper's property will be subject to 
the rules, regulations, and charges of the warehouseman.
    (c) You must make this notification at least 10 days before the 
expiration date of either one of the following two periods:
    (1) The specified period of time when the goods are to be held in 
storage.
    (2) The maximum period of time provided in your tariff for storage-
in-transit.
    (d) You must notify the individual shipper by facsimile 
transmission; e-mail; overnight courier; or certified mail, return 
receipt requested.
    (e) If you are holding household goods in storage-in-transit for a

individual shipper of the information specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section one day before the expiration date of the specified time when 
the goods are to be held in such storage.
    (f) You must maintain a record of notifications as part of the 
records of the shipment.
    (g) Your failure or refusal to notify the individual shipper will 
automatically effect a continuance of your carrier liability according 
to the applicable tariff provisions with respect to storage-in-transit, 
until the end of the day following the date when you actually gave 
notice.

                     Subpart G_Delivery of Shipments


<R05>
Sec. 375.701  May I provide for a release of liability on my delivery 
receipt?

    (a) Your delivery receipt or shipping document must not contain any 
language purporting to release or discharge you or your agents from 
liability.
    (b) The delivery receipt may include a statement the property was 
received in apparent good condition except as noted on the shipping 
documents.


<R05>
Sec. 375.703  What is the maximum collect-on-delivery amount I may 
demand at the time of delivery?

    (a) On a binding estimate, the maximum amount is the exact estimate 
of the charges.
    (b) On a non-binding estimate, the maximum amount is 110 percent of 
the non-binding estimate of the charges.


<R05>
Sec. 375.705  If a shipment is transported on more than one vehicle, 
what charges may I collect at delivery?

    (a) At your discretion, you may do one of the following three 
things:
    (1) You may defer the collection of all charges until you deliver 
the entire shipment.
    (2) If you have determined the charges for the entire shipment, you 
may collect charges for the portion of the shipment tendered for 
delivery. You must determine the percentage of the charges for the 
entire shipment represented by the portion of the shipment tendered for 
delivery.
    (3) If you cannot reasonably calculate the charges for the entire 
shipment, you must determine the charges for the portion of the shipment 
being delivered. You must collect this amount. The total charges you 
assess for the transportation of the separate portions of the shipment 
must not be more than

[[Page 102]]

the charges due for the entire shipment.
    (b) In the event of the loss or destruction of any part of a 
shipment transported on more than one vehicle, you must collect the 
charges as provided in Sec. 375.707.


<R05>
Sec. 375.707  If a shipment is partially lost or destroyed, what 
charges may I collect at delivery?

    (a) If a shipment is partially lost or destroyed, you may first 
collect your freight charges for the entire shipment, if you choose. If 
you do this, you must refund the portion of your published freight 
charges corresponding to the portion of the lost or destroyed shipment 
(including any charges for accessorial or terminal services), at the 
time you dispose of claims for loss, damage, or injury to the articles 
in the shipment under part 370 of this chapter.
    (b) To calculate the amount of charges applicable to the shipment as 
delivered, you must multiply the percentage corresponding to the 
delivered shipment by the total charges applicable to the shipment 
tendered by the individual shipper. The following four conditions also 
apply:
    (1) If the charges computed exceed the charges otherwise applicable 
to the shipment as delivered, the lesser of those charges must apply. 
This will apply only to the transportation of household goods and not to 
charges for other services the individual shipper ordered.
    (2) You must collect any specific valuation charge due.
    (3) You may disregard paragraph (a) of this section if loss or 
destruction was due to an act or omission of the individual shipper.
    (4) You must determine, at your own expense, the proportion of the 
shipment, based on actual or constructive weight, not lost or destroyed 
in transit.
    (c) The individual shipper's rights are in addition to, and not in 
lieu of, any other rights the individual shipper may have with respect 
to a shipment of household goods you or your agent(s) partially lost or 
destroyed in transit. This applies whether or not the individual shipper 
exercises its rights provided in paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 375.709  If a shipment is totally lost or destroyed, what charges 
may I collect at delivery?

    (a) You are forbidden from collecting, or requiring an individual 
shipper to pay, any freight charges (including any charges for 
accessorial or terminal services) when a household goods shipment is 
totally lost or destroyed in transit. The following two conditions also 
apply:
    (1) You must collect any specific valuation charge due.
    (2) You may disregard paragraph (a) of this section if loss or 
destruction was due to an act or omission of the individual shipper.
    (b) The individual shipper's rights are in addition to, and not in 
lieu of, any other rights the individual shipper may have with respect 
to a shipment of household goods you or your agent(s) totally lost or 
destroyed in transit. This applies whether or not the individual shipper 
exercises its rights provided in paragraph (a) of this section.


<R04>
                     Subpart H_Collection of Charges


<R05>
Sec. 375.801  What types of charges apply to subpart H?

    (a) Entail a balance due freight or expense bill, or
    (b) Are transported on an extension of credit basis.

shipment before the payment of ALL charges, how do I collect the balance?

    On ``collect-on-delivery'' shipments, you must present your freight 
bill for all transportation charges within 15 days as required by Sec. 
375.807.

[[Page 103]]


<R05>
Sec. 375.807  What actions may I take to collect the charges upon my 
freight bill?

    (a) You must present a freight bill within 15 days (excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays) of the date of delivery of a 
shipment at its destination.
    (b) The credit period must be seven days (including Saturdays, 
Sundays, and Federal holidays).
    (c) You must provide in your tariffs the following four things:
    (1) You must automatically extend the credit period to a total of 30 
calendar days for any shipper who has not paid your freight bill within 
the 7-day period.
    (2) You will assess a service charge to each individual shipper 
equal to one percent of the amount of the freight bill, subject to a $20 
minimum charge, for the extension of the credit period. You will assess 
the service charge for each 30-day extension the charges go unpaid.
    (3) You must deny credit to any shipper who fails to pay a duly-
presented freight bill within the 30-day period. You may grant credit to 
the individual shipper when the individual shipper satisfies he/she will 
promptly pay all future freight bills duly presented.
    (4) You must ensure all payments of freight bills are strictly in 
accordance with the rules and regulations of this part for the 
settlement of your rates and charges.


<R04>
                           Subpart I_Penalties

Sec. 375.901  What penalties do we impose for violations of this part?

    The penalty provisions of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 149, Civil and Criminal 
Penalties apply to this part. These penalties do not overlap. 
Notwithstanding these civil penalties, nothing in this section shall 
deprive any holder of a receipt or a bill of lading any remedy or right 
of action under existing law.

    What may I do to resolve disputes with my mover?

                     Why Was I Given This Pamphlet?

    The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's (FMCSA) 
regulations protect consumers on interstate moves and define the rights 
and responsibilities of consumers and household goods carriers.
    The household goods carrier (mover) gave you this booklet to provide 
information about your rights and responsibilities as an individual 
shipper of household goods. Your primary responsibility is to select a 
reputable household goods carrier, ensure that you understand the terms 
and conditions of the contract, and understand and pursue the remedies 
that are available to you in case problems arise. You should talk to 
your mover if you have further questions. The mover will also furnish 
you with additional written information describing its procedure for 
handling your questions and complaints. The additional written 
information will include a telephone number you can call to obtain 
additional information about your move.

What Are the Most Important Points I Should Remember From This Pamphlet?

    1. Movers must give written estimates.
    2. Movers may give binding estimates.
    3. Non-binding estimates are not always accurate; actual charges may 
exceed the estimate.
    4. If your mover provides you (or someone representing you) with any 
partially complete document for your signature, you should verify the 
document is as complete as possible before signing it. Make sure the 
document contains all relevant shipping information, except the actual 
shipment weight and any other information necessary to determine the 
final charges for all services performed.
    5. You may request from your mover the availability of guaranteed 
pickup and delivery dates.
    6. Be sure you understand the mover's responsibility for loss or 
damage, and request an explanation of the difference between valuation 
and actual insurance.
    7. You have the right to be present each time your shipment is 
weighed.
    8. You may request a reweigh of your shipment.
    9. If you agree to move under a non-binding estimate, you should 
confirm with your mover--in writing--the method of payment at delivery 
as cash, certified check, cashier's check, money order, or credit card.
    10. Movers must offer a dispute settlement program as an alternative 
means of settling

[[Page 105]]

loss or damage claims. Ask your mover for details.
    11. You should ask the person you speak to whether he or she works 
for the actual mover or a household goods broker. A household goods 
broker only arranges for the transportation. A household goods broker 
must not represent itself as a mover. A household goods broker does not 
own trucks of its own. The broker is required to find an authorized 
mover to provide the transportation. You should know that a household 
goods broker generally has no authority to provide you an estimate on 
behalf of a specific mover. If a household goods broker provides you an 
estimate, it may not be binding on the actual mover and you may have to 
pay the actual charges the mover incurs. A household goods broker is not 
responsible for loss or damage.
    12. You may request complaint information about movers from the 
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration under the Freedom of 
Information Act. You may be assessed a fee to obtain this information. 
See 49 CFR part 7 for the schedule of fees.
    13. You should seek estimates from at least three different movers. 
You should not disclose any information to the different movers about 
their competitors, as it may affect the accuracy of their estimates.

                     What If I Have More Questions?

    If this pamphlet does not answer all of your questions about your 
move, do not hesitate to ask your mover's representative who handled the 
arrangements for your move, the driver who transports your shipment, or 
the mover's main office for additional information.

                     Subpart A--General Requirements

    The primary responsibility for your protection lies with you in 
selecting a reputable household goods carrier, ensuring you understand 
the terms and conditions of your contract with your mover, and 
understanding and pursuing the remedies that are available to you in 
case problems arise.

                    Who Must Follow the Regulations?

    The regulations inform motor carriers engaged in the interstate 
transportation of household goods (movers) what standards they must 
follow when offering services to you. You, an individual shipper, are 
not directly subject to the regulations. However, your mover may be 
required by the regulations to force you to pay on time. The regulations 
only apply to your mover when the mover transports your household goods 
by motor vehicle in interstate commerce--that is, when you are moving 
from one State to another. The regulations do not apply when your 
interstate move takes place within a single commercial zone. A 
commercial zone is roughly equivalent to the local metropolitan area of 
a city or town. For example, a move between Brooklyn, NY, and 
Hackensack, NJ, would be considered to be within the New York City 
commercial zone and would not be subject to these regulations. 
Commercial zones are defined in 49 CFR part 372.

               What Definitions Are Used in This Pamphlet?

    Accessorial (Additional) Services--These are services such as 
packing, appliance servicing, unpacking, or piano stair carries that you 
request to be performed (or that are necessary because of landlord 
requirements or other special circumstances). Charges for these services 
may be in addition to the line haul charges.
    Advanced Charges--These are charges for services performed by 
someone other than the mover. A professional, craftsman, or other third 
party may perform these services at your request. The mover pays for 
these services and adds the charges to your bill of lading charges.
    Advertisement--This is any communication to the public in connection 
with an offer or sale of any interstate household goods transportation 
service. This will include written or electronic database listings of 
your mover's name, address, and telephone number in an on-line database. 
This excludes listings of your mover's name, address, and telephone 
number in a telephone directory or similar publication. However, Yellow 
Pages advertising is included within the definition.
    Agent--A local moving company authorized to act on behalf of a 
larger, national company.
    Appliance Service by Third Party--The preparation of major 
electrical appliances to make them safe for shipment. Charges for these 
services may be in addition to the line haul charges.
    Bill of Lading--The receipt for your goods and the contract for 
their transportation.
    Carrier--The mover transporting your household goods.
    Cash on Delivery (COD)--This means payment is required at the time 
of delivery at the destination residence (or warehouse).
    Certified Scale--Any scale designed for weighing motor vehicles, 
including trailers or semitrailers not attached to a tractor, and 
certified by an authorized scale inspection and licensing authority. A 
certified scale may also be a platform or warehouse type scale that is 
properly inspected and certified.
    Estimate, Binding--This is an agreement made in advance with your 
mover. It guarantees the total cost of the move based upon the 
quantities and services shown on the estimate.
    Estimate, Non-Binding--This is what your mover believes the cost 
will be, based upon

[[Page 106]]

the estimated weight of the shipment and the accessorial services 
requested. A non-binding estimate is not binding on the mover. The final 
charges will be based upon the actual weight of your shipment, the 
services provided, and the tariff provisions in effect.
    Expedited Service--This is an agreement with the mover to perform 
transportation by a set date in exchange for charges based upon a higher 
minimum weight.
    Flight Charge--A charge for carrying items up or down flights of 
stairs. Charges for these services may be in addition to the line haul 
charges.
    Guaranteed Pickup and Delivery Service--An additional level of 
service featuring guaranteed dates of service. Your mover will provide 
reimbursement to you for delays. This premium service is often subject 
to minimum weight requirements.
    High Value Article--These are items included in a shipment valued at 
more than $100 per pound ($220 per kilogram).
    Household Goods, as used in connection with transportation, means 
the personal effects or property used, or to be used, in a dwelling, 
when part of the equipment or supplies of the dwelling. Transportation 
of the household goods must be arranged and paid for by you or by 
another individual on your behalf. This may include items moving from a 
factory or store when you purchase them to use in your dwelling. You 
must request that these items be transported, and you (or another 
individual on your behalf) must pay the transportation charges to the 
mover.
    Inventory--The detailed descriptive list of your household goods 
showing the number and condition of each item.
    Line Haul Charges--The charges for the vehicle transportation 
portion of your move. These charges, if separately stated, apply in 
addition to the accessorial service charges.
    Long Carry--A charge for carrying articles excessive distances 
between the mover's vehicle and your residence. Charges for these 
services may be in addition to the line haul charges.
    May--An option. You or your mover may do something, but it is not a 
requirement.
    Mover--A motor carrier engaged in the transportation of household 
goods and its household goods agents.
    Must--A legal obligation. You or your mover must do something.
    Order for Service--The document authorizing the mover to transport 
your household goods.
    Order (Bill of Lading) Number--The number used to identify and track 
your shipment.
    Peak Season Rates--Higher line haul charges applicable during the 
summer months.
    Pickup and Delivery Charges--Separate transportation charges 
applicable for transporting your shipment between the storage-in-transit 
warehouse and your residence.
    Reasonable Dispatch--The performance of transportation on the dates, 
or during the period of time, agreed upon by you and your mover and 
shown on the Order for Service/Bill of Lading. For example, if your 
mover deliberately withholds any shipment from delivery after you offer 
to pay the binding estimate or 110 percent of a non-binding estimate, 
your mover has not transported the goods with reasonable dispatch. The 
term ``reasonable dispatch'' excludes transportation provided under your 
mover's tariff provisions requiring guaranteed service dates. Your mover 
will have the defense of force majeure, i.e., that the contract cannot 
be performed owing to causes that are outside the control of the parties 
and that could not be avoided by exercise of due care.
    Should--A recommendation. We recommend you or your mover do 
something, but it is not a requirement.
    Shuttle Service--The use of a smaller vehicle to provide service to 
residences not accessible to the mover's normal line haul vehicles.
    Storage-In-Transit (SIT)--The temporary warehouse storage of your 
shipment pending further transportation, with or without notification to 
you. If you (or someone representing you) cannot accept delivery on the 
agreed-upon date or within the agreed-upon time period (for example, 
because your home is not quite ready to occupy), your mover may place 
your shipment into SIT without notifying you. In those circumstances, 
you will be responsible for the added charges for SIT service, as well 
as the warehouse handling and final delivery charges.
    However, your mover also may place your shipment into SIT if your 
mover was able to make delivery before the agreed-upon date (or before 
the first day of the agreed-upon delivery period), but you did not 
concur with early delivery. In those circumstances, your mover must 
notify you immediately of the SIT, and your mover is fully responsible 
for redelivery charges, handling charges, and storage charges.
    Surface Transportation Board--An agency within the U.S. Department 
of Transportation that regulates household goods carrier tariffs, among 
other responsibilities. The Surface Transportation Board's address is 
1925 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20423-0001 Tele. 202-565-1674.
    Tariff--An issuance (in whole or in part) containing rates, rules, 
regulations, classifications, or other provisions. The Surface 
Transportation Board requires that a tariff contain three specific 
items. First, an accurate description of the services the mover offers 
to the public. Second, the specific applicable rates (or the basis for 
calculating the specific applicable rates) and service terms for 
services offered to the public. Third, the

[[Page 107]]

mover's tariff must be arranged in a way that allows you to determine 
the exact rate(s) and service terms applicable to your shipment.
    Valuation--The degree of worth of the shipment. The valuation charge 
compensates the mover for assuming a greater degree of liability than is 
provided for in its base transportation charges.
    Warehouse Handling--A charge may be applicable each time SIT service 
is provided. Charges for these services may be in addition to the line 
haul charges. This charge compensates the mover for the physical 
placement and removal of items within the warehouse.
    We, Us, and Our--The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration 
(FMCSA).
    You and Your--You are an individual shipper of household goods. You 
are a consignor or consignee of a household goods shipment and your 
mover identifies you as such in the bill of lading contract. You own the 
goods being transported and pay the transportation charges to the mover.
    Where may other terms used in this pamphlet be defined? You may find 
other terms used in this pamphlet defined in 49 U.S.C. 13102. The 
statute controls the definitions in this pamphlet. If terms are used in 
this pamphlet and the terms are defined neither here nor in 49 U.S.C. 
13102, the terms will have the ordinary practical meaning of such terms.

          Subpart B--Before Requesting Services From Any Mover

  What Is My Mover's Normal Liability for Loss or Damage When My Mover 
                         Accepts Goods From Me?

    In general, your mover is legally liable for loss or damage that 
occurs during performance of any transportation of household goods and 
of all related services identified on your mover's lawful bill of 
lading.
    Your mover is liable for loss of, or damage to, any household goods 
to the extent provided in the current Surface Transportation Board's 
Released Rates Order. You may obtain a copy of the current Released 
Rates Order by contacting the Surface Transportation Board at the 
address provided under the definition of the Surface Transportation 
Board. The rate may be increased annually by your mover based on the 
U.S. Department of Commerce's Cost of Living Adjustment. Your mover may 
have additional liability if your mover sells liability insurance to 
you.
    All moving companies are required to assume liability for the value 
of the goods transported. However, there are different levels of 
liability, and you should be aware of the amount of protection provided 
and the charges for each option.
    Basically, most movers offer two different levels of liability 
(options 1 and 2 below) under the terms of their tariffs and the Surface 
Transportation Board's Released Rates Orders. These orders govern the 
moving industry.

                        Option 1: Released Value

    This is the most economical protection option available. This no-
additional-cost option provides minimal protection. Under this option, 
the mover assumes liability for no more than 60 cents per pound ($1.32 
cents per kilogram), per article. Loss or damage claims are settled 
based upon the pound (kilogram) weight of the article multiplied by 60 
cents per pound ($1.32 cents per kilogram). For example, if your mover 
lost or destroyed a 10-pound (4.54-kilogram) stereo component valued at 
$1,000, your mover would be liable for no more than $6.00. Obviously, 
you should think carefully before agreeing to such an arrangement. There 
is no extra charge for this minimal protection, but you must sign a 
specific statement on the bill of lading agreeing to it.

                  Option 2: Full Value Protection (FVP)

    Under this option, the mover is liable for the replacement value of 
lost or damaged goods (as long as it doesn't exceed the total declared 
value of the shipment). If you elect to purchase full value protection, 
and your mover loses, damages or destroys your articles, your mover must 
repair, replace with like items, or settle in cash at the current market 
replacement value, regardless of the age of the lost or damaged item. 
The minimum declared value of a shipment under this option is $5,000 or 
$4.00 times the actual total weight (in pounds) of the shipment, 
whichever is greater. For example, the minimum declared value for a 
4,000-pound (1,814.4-kilogram) shipment would be $16,000. Your mover may 
offer you FVP with a $250 or $500 deductible, or with no deductible at 
all. The amount of the deductible will affect the cost of your FVP 
coverage. The $4.00 per pound minimum valuation rate may be increased 
annually by your mover based on changes in the household furnishings 
element of the Consumer Price Index established by the U.S. Department 
of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
    Unless you specifically agree to other arrangements, the mover must 
assume liability for the entire shipment based upon this option. The 
approximate cost for FVP is $8.50 for each $1,000 of declared value; 
however, it may vary by mover. In the example above, the valuation 
charge for a shipment valued at $16,000 would be $136.00. As noted 
above, this fee may be adjusted annually by your mover based on changes 
in the household furnishings element of the Consumer Price Index.
    Under both of these liability options, movers are permitted to limit 
their liability for loss or damage to articles of extraordinary

[[Page 108]]

value, unless you specifically list these articles on the shipping 
documents. An article of extraordinary value is any item whose value 
exceeds $100 per pound ($220 per kilogram). Ask your mover for a 
complete explanation of this limitation before your move. It is your 
responsibility to study this provision carefully and make the necessary 
declaration.
    These optional levels of liability are not insurance agreements 
governed by State insurance laws, but instead are authorized under 
Released Rates Orders of the Surface Transportation Board of the U.S. 
Department of Transportation.
    In addition to these options, some movers may also offer to sell, or 
procure for you, separate liability insurance from a third-party 
insurance company when you release your shipment for transportation at 
the minimum released value of 60 cents per pound ($1.32 per kilogram) 
per article (option 1). This is not valuation coverage governed by 
Federal law, but optional insurance regulated under State law. If you 
purchase this separate coverage and your mover is responsible for loss 
or damage, the mover is liable only for an amount not exceeding 60 cents 
per pound ($1.32 per kilogram) per article, and the balance of the loss 
is recoverable from the insurance company up to the amount of insurance 
purchased. The mover's representative can advise you of the availability 
of such liability insurance, and the cost.
    If you purchase liability insurance from or through your mover, the 
mover is required to issue a policy or other written record of the 
purchase and to provide you with a copy of the policy or other document 
at the time of purchase. If the mover fails to comply with this 
requirement, the mover becomes fully liable for any claim for loss or 
damage attributed to its negligence.

     What Actions by Me Limit or Reduce My Mover's Normal Liability?

    Your actions may limit or reduce your mover's normal liability under 
the following three circumstances:
    (1) You include perishable, dangerous, or hazardous materials in 
your household goods without your mover's knowledge.
    (2) You choose liability option 1 but ship household goods valued at 
more than 60 cents per pound ($1.32 per kilogram) per article.
    (3) You fail to notify your mover in writing of articles valued at 
more than $100 per pound ($220 per kilogram). (If you do notify your 
mover, you will be entitled to full recovery up to the declared value of 
the article or articles, not to exceed the declared value of the entire 
shipment.)

 What Are Dangerous or Hazardous Materials That May Limit or Reduce My 
                        Mover's Normal Liability?

    Federal law forbids you to ship hazardous materials in your 
household goods boxes or luggage without informing your mover. A 
violation can result in five years' imprisonment and penalties of 
$250,000 or more (49 U.S.C. 5124). You could also lose or damage your 
household goods by fire, explosion, or contamination.
    If you offer hazardous materials to your mover, you are considered a 
hazardous materials shipper and must comply with the hazardous materials 
requirements in 49 CFR parts 171, 172, and 173, including but not 
limited to package labeling and marking, shipping papers, and emergency 
response information. Your mover must comply with 49 CFR parts 171, 172, 
173, and 177 as a hazardous materials carrier.
    Hazardous materials include explosives, compressed gases, flammable 
liquids and solids, oxidizers, poisons, corrosives, and radioactive 
materials. Examples: Nail polish remover, paints, paint thinners, 
lighter fluid, gasoline, fireworks, oxygen bottles, propane cylinders, 
automotive repair and maintenance chemicals, and radio-pharmaceuticals.
    There are special exceptions for small quantities (up to 70 ounces 
total) of medicinal and toilet articles carried in your household goods 
and certain smoking materials carried on your person. For further 
information, contact your mover.

                        May My Mover Have Agents?

    Yes, your mover may have agents. If your mover has agents, your 
mover must have written agreements with its prime agents. Your mover and 
its retained prime agent must sign their agreements. Copies of your 
mover's prime agent agreements must be in your mover's files for a 
period of at least 24 months following the date of termination of each 
agreement.

            What Items Must Be in My Mover's Advertisements?

    Your mover must publish and use only truthful, straightforward, and 
honest advertisements. Your mover must include certain information in 
all advertisements for all services (including any accessorial services 
incidental to or part of interstate transportation). Your mover must 
require each of its agents to include the same information in its 
advertisements. The information must include the following two pieces of 
information about your mover:
    (1) Name or trade name of the mover under whose USDOT number the 
advertised service will originate.
    (2) USDOT number, assigned by FMCSA, authorizing your mover to 
operate. Your

[[Page 109]]

mover must display the information as: USDOT No. (assigned number).
    You should compare the name or trade name of the mover and its USDOT 
number to the name and USDOT number on the sides of the truck(s) that 
arrive at your residence. The names and numbers should be identical. If 
the names and numbers are not identical, you should ask your mover 
immediately why they are not. You should not allow the mover to load 
your household goods on its truck(s) until you obtain a satisfactory 
response from the mover's local agent. The discrepancies may warn of 
problems you will have later in your business dealings with this mover.

           How Must My Mover Handle Complaints and Inquiries?

    All movers are expected to respond promptly to complaints or 
inquiries from you, the customer. Should you have a complaint or 
question about your move, you should first attempt to obtain a 
satisfactory response from the mover's local agent, the sales 
representative who handled the arrangements for your move, or the driver 
assigned to your shipment.
    If for any reason you are unable to obtain a satisfactory response 
from one of these persons, you should then contact the mover's principal 
office. When you make such a call, be sure to have available your copies 
of all documents relating to your move. Particularly important is the 
number assigned to your shipment by your mover.
    Interstate movers are also required to offer neutral arbitration as 
a means of resolving consumer loss or damage disputes involving loss of 
or damage to household goods. Your mover is required to provide you with 
information regarding its arbitration program. You have the right to 
pursue court action under 49 U.S.C. 14706 to seek judicial redress 
directly rather than participate in your mover's arbitration program.
    All interstate moving companies are required to maintain a complaint 
and inquiry procedure to assist their customers. At the time you make 
the arrangements for your move, you should ask the mover's 
representative for a description of the mover's procedure, the telephone 
number to be used to contact the mover, and whether the mover will pay 
for such telephone calls. Your mover's procedure must include the 
following four things:
    (1) A communications system allowing you to communicate with your 
mover's principal place of business by telephone.
    (2) A telephone number.
    (3) A clear and concise statement about who must pay for complaint 
and inquiry telephone calls.
    (4) A written or electronic record system for recording all 
inquiries and complaints received from you by any means of 
communication.
    Your mover must give you a clear and concise written description of 
its procedure. You may want to be certain that the system is in place.

Do I Have the Right to Inspect My Mover's Tariffs (Schedules of Charges) 
                         Applicable to My Move?

    Federal law requires your mover to advise you of your right to 
inspect your mover's tariffs (its schedules of rates or charges) 
governing your shipment. Movers' tariffs are made a part of the contract 
of carriage (bill of lading) between you and the mover. You may inspect 
the tariff at the mover's facility, or, upon request, the mover will 
furnish you a free copy of any tariff provision containing the mover's 
rates, rules, or charges governing your shipment.
    Tariffs may include provisions limiting the mover's liability. This 
would generally be described in a section on declaring value on the bill 
of lading. A second tariff provision may set the periods for filing 
claims. This would generally be described in Section 6 on the reverse 
side of a bill of lading. A third tariff provision may reserve your 
mover's right to assess additional charges for additional services 
performed. For non-binding estimates, another tariff provision may base 
charges upon the exact weight of the goods transported. Your mover's 
tariff may contain other provisions that apply to your move. Ask your 
mover what they might be, and request a copy.

               Must My Mover Have an Arbitration Program?

    Your mover must have an arbitration program for your use in 
resolving disputes concerning loss or damage to your household goods. 
You have the right not to participate in the arbitration program. You 
may pursue court action under 49 U.S.C. 14706 to seek judicial remedies 
directly. Your mover must establish and maintain an arbitration program 
with the following 11 minimum elements:
    (1) The arbitration program offered to you must prevent your mover 
from having any special advantage because you live or work in a place 
distant from the mover's principal or other place of business.
    (2) Before your household goods are tendered for transport, your 
mover must provide notice to you of the availability of neutral 
arbitration, including the following three things:
    (a) A summary of the arbitration procedure.
    (b) Any applicable costs.
    (c) A disclosure of the legal effects of electing to use 
arbitration.

[[Page 110]]

    (3) Upon your request, your mover must provide information and forms 
it considers necessary for initiating an action to resolve a dispute 
under arbitration.
    (4) Each person authorized to arbitrate must be independent of the 
parties to the dispute and capable of resolving such disputes fairly and 
expeditiously. Your mover must ensure the arbitrator is authorized and 
able to obtain from you or your mover any material or relevant 
information to carry out a fair and expeditious decision-making process.
    (5) You must not be required to pay more than one-half of the 
arbitration's cost. The arbitrator may determine the percentage of 
payment of the costs for each party in the arbitration decision, but 
must not make you pay more than half.
    (6) Your mover must not require you to agree to use arbitration 
before a dispute arises.
    (7) You will be bound by arbitration for claims of $5,000 or less if 
you request arbitration.
    (8) You will be bound by arbitration for claims of more than $5,000 
only if you request arbitration and your mover agrees to it.
    (9) If you and your mover both agree, the arbitrator may provide for 
an oral presentation of a dispute by a party or representative of a 
party.
    (10) The arbitrator must render a decision within 60 days of receipt 
of written notification of the dispute, and a decision by an arbitrator 
may include any remedies appropriate under the circumstances.
    (11) The 60-day period may be extended for a reasonable period if 
you fail, or your mover fails, to provide information in a timely 
manner.
    Your mover must produce and distribute a concise, easy-to-read, 
accurate summary of its arbitration program.

   Must My Mover Inform Me About My Rights and Responsibilities Under 
                              Federal Law?

    Yes, your mover must inform you about your rights and 
responsibilities under Federal law. Your mover must produce and 
distribute this document. It should be in the general order and contain 
the text of appendix A to 49 CFR part 375.

            What Other Information Must My Mover Provide Me?

    Before your mover executes an order for service for a shipment of 
household goods, your mover must furnish you with the following four 
documents:
    (1) The contents of appendix A, ``Your Rights and Responsibilities 
When You Move''--this pamphlet.
    (2) A concise, easy-to-read, accurate summary of your mover's 
arbitration program.
    (3) A notice of availability of the applicable sections of your 
mover's tariff for the estimate of charges, including an explanation 
that you may examine the tariff sections or have copies sent to you upon 
request.
    (4) A concise, easy-to-read, accurate summary of your mover's 
customer complaint and inquiry handling procedures. Included in this 
summary must be the following two items:
    (a) The main telephone number you may use to communicate with your 
mover.
    (b) A clear and concise statement concerning who must pay for 
telephone calls.
    Your mover may, at its discretion, provide additional information to 
you.

                   How Must My Mover Collect Charges?

    Your mover must issue you an honest, truthful freight or expense 
bill for each shipment transported. Your mover's freight or expense bill 
must contain the following 19 items:
    (1) Name of the consignor.
    (2) Name of the consignees.
    (3) Date of the shipment.
    (4) Origin point.
    (5) Destination points.
    (6) Number of packages.
    (7) Description of the freight.
    (8) Weight of the freight (if applicable to the rating of the 
freight).
    (9) The volume of the freight (if applicable to the rating of the 
freight).
    (10) The measurement of the freight (if applicable to the rating of 
the freight).
    (11) Exact rate(s) assessed.
    (12) Disclosure of the actual rates, charges, and allowances for the 
transportation service, when your mover electronically presents or 
transmits freight or expense bills to you. These rates must be in 
accordance with the mover's applicable tariff.
    (13) An indication of whether adjustments may apply to the bill.
    (14) Total charges due and acceptable methods of payment.
    (15) The nature and amount of any special service charges.
    (16) The points where special services were rendered.
    (17) Route of movement and name of each mover participating in the 
transportation.
    (18) Transfer points where shipments moved.
    (19) Address where you must pay or address of bill issuer's 
principal place of business.
    Your mover must present its freight or expense bill to you within 15 
days of the date of delivery of a shipment at its destination. The 
computation of time excludes Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays. 
(Bills for charges exceeding 110 percent of a non-binding estimate, and 
for additional services

[[Page 111]]

requested or found necessary after the shipment is in transit, will be 
presented no sooner than 30 days after the date of delivery.)
    If your mover lacks sufficient information to compute its charges, 
your mover must present its freight bill for payment within 15 days of 
the date when sufficient information does become available.

               May My Mover Collect Charges Upon Delivery?

    Yes. Your mover must specify the form of payment acceptable at 
delivery when the mover prepares an estimate and order for service. The 
mover and its agents must honor the form of payment at delivery, except 
when you mutually agree to a change in writing. The mover must also 
specify the same form of payment when it prepares your bill of lading, 
unless you agree to a change. See also ``May my mover accept charge or 
credit cards for my payments?'
    You must be prepared to pay 10 percent more than the estimated 
amount, if your goods are moving under a non-binding estimate. Every 
collect-on-delivery shipper must have available 110 percent of the 
estimate at the time of delivery.

                    May My Mover Extend Credit to Me?

    Extending credit to you is not the same as accepting your charge or 
credit card(s) as payment. Your mover may extend credit to you in the 
amount of the tariff charges. If your mover extends credit to you, your 
mover becomes like a bank offering you a line of credit, whose size and 
interest rate are determined by your ability to pay its tariff charges 
within the credit period. Your mover must ensure you will pay its tariff 
charges within the credit period. Your mover may relinquish possession 
of freight before you pay its tariff charges, at its discretion.
    The credit period must begin on the day following presentation of 
your mover's freight bill to you. Under Federal regulation, the standard 
credit period is 7 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal 
holidays. Your mover must also extend the credit period to a total of 30 
calendar days if the freight bill is not paid within the 7-day period. A 
service charge equal to one percent of the amount of the freight bill, 
subject to a $20 minimum, will be assessed for this extension and for 
each additional 30-day period the charges go unpaid.
    Your failure to pay within the credit period will require your mover 
to determine whether you will comply with the Federal household goods 
transportation credit regulations in good faith in the future before 
extending credit again.

       May My Mover Accept Charge or Credit Cards for My Payments?

    Your mover may allow you to use a charge or credit card for payment 
of the freight charges. Your mover may accept charge or credit cards 
whenever you ship with it under an agreement and tariff requiring 
payment by cash or cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are a certified 
check, money order, or cashier's check (a check that a financial 
institution--bank, credit union, savings and loan--draws upon itself and 
that is signed by an officer of the financial institution).
    If your mover allows you to pay for a freight or expense bill by 
charge or credit card, your mover deems such a payment to be equivalent 
to payment by cash, certified check, or cashier's check. It must note in 
writing on the order for service and the bill of lading whether you may 
pay for the transportation and related services using a charge or credit 
card. You should ask your mover at the time the estimate is written 
whether it will accept charge or credit cards at delivery.
    The mover must specify what charge or credit cards it will accept, 
such as American Express<SUP>TM</SUP>, Discover<SUP>TM</SUP>, 
MasterCard<SUP>TM</SUP>, or Visa<SUP>TM</SUP>. If your mover agrees to 
accept payment by charge or credit card, you must arrange with your 
mover for the delivery only at a time when your mover can obtain 
authorization for your credit card transaction.
    If you cause a charge or credit card issuer to reverse a 
transaction, your mover may consider your action tantamount to forcing 
your mover to provide an involuntary extension of its credit.

                   Subpart C--Service Options Provided

               What Service Options May My Mover Provide?

    Your mover may provide any service options it chooses. It is 
customary for movers to offer several price and service options.
    The total cost of your move may increase if you want additional or 
special services. Before you agree to have your shipment moved under a 
bill of lading providing special service, you should have a clear 
understanding with your mover of what the additional cost will be. You 
should always consider whether other movers may provide the services you 
require without requiring you to pay the additional charges.
    One service option is a space reservation. If you agree to have your 
shipment transported under a space reservation agreement, you will pay 
for a minimum number of cubic feet of space in the moving van regardless 
of how much space in the van your shipment actually occupies.
    A second option is expedited service. This aids you if you must have 
your shipments transported on or between specific dates

[[Page 112]]

when the mover could not ordinarily agree to do so in its normal 
operations.
    A third customary service option is exclusive use of a vehicle. If 
for any reason you desire or require that your shipment be moved by 
itself on the mover's truck or trailer, most movers will provide such 
service.
    Another service option is guaranteed service on or between agreed 
dates. You enter into an agreement with the mover where the mover 
provides for your shipment to be picked up, transported to destination, 
and delivered on specific guaranteed dates. If the mover fails to 
provide the service as agreed, you are entitled to be compensated at a 
predetermined amount or a daily rate (per diem) regardless of the 
expense you might actually have incurred as a result of the mover's 
failure to perform.
    Before requesting or agreeing to any of these price and service 
options, be sure to ask the mover's representatives about the final 
costs you will pay.

             Transport of Shipments on Two or More Vehicles

    Although all movers try to move each shipment on one truck, it 
becomes necessary, at times, to divide a shipment among two or more 
trucks. This may occur if your mover has underestimated the cubic feet 
(meters) of space required for your shipment and it will not all fit on 
the first truck. Your mover will pick up the remainder, or ``leave 
behind,'' on a second truck at a later time, and this part of your 
shipment may arrive at the destination later than the first truck. When 
this occurs, your transportation charges will be determined as if the 
entire shipment had moved on one truck.
    If it is important for you to avoid this inconvenience of a ``leave 
behind,'' be sure your estimate includes an accurate calculation of the 
cubic feet (meters) required for your shipment. Ask your estimator to 
use a ``Table of Measurements'' form in making this calculation. 
Consider asking for a binding estimate. A binding estimate is more 
likely to be conservative with regard to cubic feet (meters) than a non-
binding estimate. If the mover offers space reservation service, 
consider purchasing this service for the necessary amount of space plus 
some margin for error. In any case, you would be prudent to 
``prioritize'' your goods in advance of the move so the driver will load 
the more essential items on the first truck if some are left behind.

 If My Mover Sells Liability Insurance Coverage, What Must My Mover Do?

    If your mover provides the service of selling additional liability 
insurance, your mover must follow certain regulations.
    Your mover, its employees, or its agents, may sell, offer to sell, 
or procure additional liability insurance coverage for you for loss or 
damage to your shipment if you release the shipment for transportation 
at a value not exceeding 60 cents per pound ($1.32 per kilogram) per 
article.
    Your mover may offer, sell, or procure any type of insurance policy 
covering loss or damage in excess of its specified liability.
    Your mover must issue you a policy or other appropriate evidence of 
the insurance you purchased. Your mover must provide a copy of the 
policy or other appropriate evidence to you at the time your mover sells 
or procures the insurance. Your mover must issue policies written in 
plain English.
    Your mover must clearly specify the nature and extent of coverage 
under the policy. Your mover's failure to issue you a policy, or other 
appropriate evidence of insurance you purchased, will subject your mover 
to full liability for any claims to recover loss or damage attributed to 
it.
    Your mover's tariff must provide for liability insurance coverage. 
The tariff must also provide for the base transportation charge, 
including its assumption of full liability for the value of the 
shipment. This would offer you a degree of protection in the event your 
mover fails to issue you a policy or other appropriate evidence of 
insurance at the time of purchase.

                      Subpart D--Estimating Charges

Must My Mover Estimate the Transportation and Accessorial Charges for My 
                                  Move?

    We require your mover to prepare a written estimate on every 
shipment transported for you. You are entitled to a copy of the written 
estimate when your mover prepares it. Your mover must provide you a 
written estimate of all charges, including transportation, accessorial, 
and advance charges. Your mover's ``rate quote'' is not an estimate. You 
and your mover must sign the estimate of charges. Your mover must 
provide you with a dated copy of the estimate of charges at the time you 
sign the estimate.
    You should be aware that if you receive an estimate from a household 
goods broker, the mover is not required to accept the estimate. Be sure 
to obtain a written estimate from the mover if a mover tells you orally 
that it will accept the broker's estimate.
    Your mover must specify the form of payment the mover and its 
delivering agent will honor at delivery. Payment forms may include but 
are not limited to cash, certified check, money order, cashier s check, 
a specific charge card such as American Express <SUP>TM</SUP>, a 
specific credit card such as Visa <SUP>TM</SUP>, and your mover s own 
credit.
    If your mover provides you with an estimate based on volume that 
will later be converted to a weight-based rate, the mover must provide 
you an explanation in writing

[[Page 113]]

of the formula used to calculate the conversion to weight. Your mover 
must specify that the final charges will be based on actual weight and 
services. Before loading your household goods, and upon mutual agreement 
between you and your mover, your mover may amend an estimate of charges. 
Your mover may not amend the estimate after loading the shipment.
    A binding estimate is an agreement made in advance with your mover. 
It guarantees the total cost of the move based upon the quantities and 
services shown on your mover's estimate.
    A non-binding estimate is what your mover believes the total cost 
will be for the move, based upon the estimated weight of the shipment 
and the accessorial services requested. A non-binding estimate is not 
binding on your mover. Your mover will base the final charges upon the 
actual weight of your shipment, the services provided, and its tariff 
provisions in effect. You must be prepared to pay 10 percent more than 
the estimated amount at delivery.

        How Must My Mover Estimate Charges Under the Regulations?

                            Binding Estimates

    Your mover may charge you for providing a binding estimate. The 
binding estimate must clearly describe the shipment and all services 
provided.
    When you receive a binding estimate, you cannot be required to pay 
any more than the estimated amount at delivery. If you have requested 
the mover provide more services than those included in the estimate, the 
mover must not demand full payment for those added services at time of 
delivery. Instead, the mover must bill for those services later, as 
explained below. Such services might include destination charges that 
often are not known at origin (such as long carry charges, shuttle 
charges, or extra stair carry charges).
    A binding estimate must be in writing, and a copy must be made 
available to you before you move.
    If you agree to a binding estimate, you are responsible for paying 
the charges due by cash, certified check, money order, or cashier's 
check. The charges are due your mover at the time of delivery unless 
your mover agrees, before you move, to extend credit or to accept 
payment by a specific charge card such as American Express <SUP>TM</SUP> 
or a specific credit card such as Visa <SUP>TM</SUP>. If you are unable 
to pay at the time the shipment is delivered, the mover may place your 
shipment in storage at your expense until you pay the charges.
    Other requirements of binding estimates include the following eight 
elements:
    (1) Your mover must retain a copy of each binding estimate as an 
attachment to the bill of lading.
    (2) Your mover must clearly indicate upon each binding estimate's 
face that the estimate is binding upon you and your mover. Each binding 
estimate must also clearly indicate on its face that the charges shown 
are the charges to be assessed for only those services specifically 
identified in the estimate.
    (3) Your mover must clearly describe binding estimate shipments and 
all services to be provided.
    (4) If, before loading your shipment, your mover believes you are 
tendering additional household goods or are requiring additional 
services not identified in the binding estimate, and you and your mover 
cannot reach an agreement, your mover may refuse to service the 
shipment. If your mover agrees to service the shipment, your mover must 
do one of the following three things:
    (a) Reaffirm the binding estimate.
    (b) Negotiate a revised written binding estimate listing the 
additional household goods or services.
    (c) Add an attachment to the contract, in writing, stating you both 
will consider the original binding estimate as a non-binding estimate. 
You should read more below. This may seriously affect how much you may 
pay for the entire move.
    (5) Once your mover loads your shipment, your mover's failure to 
execute a new binding estimate or to agree with you to treat the 
original estimate as a non-binding estimate signifies it has reaffirmed 
the original binding estimate. Your mover may not collect more than the 
amount of the original binding estimate, except as provided in the next 
two paragraphs.
    (6) Your mover may believe additional services are necessary to 
properly service your shipment after your household goods are in 
transit. Your mover must inform you what the additional services are 
before performing them. Your mover must allow you at least one hour to 
determine whether you want the additional services performed. Such 
additional services include carrying your furniture up additional stairs 
or using an elevator. If these services do not appear on your mover's 
estimate, your mover must deliver your shipment and bill you later for 
the additional services.
    If you agree to pay for the additional services, your mover must 
execute a written attachment to be made an integral part of the bill of 
lading and have you sign the written attachment. This may be done 
through fax transmissions. You will be billed for the additional 
services 30 days following the date of delivery.
    (7) If you add additional services after your household goods are in 
transit, you will be billed for the additional services but only be

[[Page 114]]

expected to pay the full amount of the binding estimate to receive 
delivery. Your mover must bill you for the balance of any remaining 
charges for these additional services no sooner than 30 days after 
delivery. For example, if your binding estimate shows total charges at 
delivery should be $1,000 but your actual charges at destination are 
$1,500, your mover must deliver the shipment upon payment of $1,000. The 
mover must bill you for the remaining $500 no sooner than 30 days after 
the date of delivery.
    (8) Failure of your mover to relinquish possession of a shipment 
upon your offer to pay the binding estimate amount constitutes your 
mover's failure to transport a shipment with ``reasonable dispatch'' and 
subjects your mover to cargo delay claims pursuant to 49 CFR part 370.

                          Non-Binding Estimates

    Your mover is not permitted to charge you for giving a non-binding 
estimate.
    A non-binding estimate is not a bid or contract. Your mover provides 
it to you to give you a general idea of the cost of the move, but it 
does not bind your mover to the estimated cost. You should expect the 
final cost to be more than the estimate. The actual cost will be in 
accordance with your mover's tariffs. Federal law requires your mover to 
collect the charges shown in its tariffs, regardless of what your mover 
writes in its non-binding estimates. That is why it is important to ask 
for copies of the applicable portions of the mover's tariffs before 
deciding on a mover. The charges contained in movers' tariffs are 
essentially the same for the same weight shipment moving the same 
distance. If you obtain different non-binding estimates from different 
movers, you must pay only the amount specified in your mover's tariff. 
Therefore, a non-binding estimate may have no effect on the amount that 
you will ultimately have to pay.
    You must be prepared to pay 10 percent more than the estimated 
amount at the time of delivery. Every collect-on-delivery shipper must 
have available 110 percent of the estimate at the time of delivery. If 
you order additional services from your mover after your goods are in 
transit, the mover will then bill you 30 days after delivery for any 
remaining charges.
    Non-binding estimates must be in writing and clearly describe the 
shipment and all services provided. Any time a mover provides such an 
estimate, the amount of the charges estimated must be on the order for 
service and bill of lading related to your shipment. When you are given 
a non-binding estimate, do not sign or accept the order for service or 
bill of lading unless the mover enters the amount estimated on each form 
it prepares.
    Other requirements of non-binding estimates include the following 10 
elements:
    (1) Your mover must provide reasonably accurate non-binding 
estimates based upon the estimated weight of the shipment and services 
required.
    (2) Your mover must explain to you that all charges on shipments 
moved under non-binding estimates will be those appearing in your 
mover's tariffs applicable to the transportation. If your mover provides 
a non-binding estimate of approximate costs, your mover is not bound by 
such an estimate.
    (3) Your mover must furnish non-binding estimates without charge and 
in writing to you.
    (4) Your mover must retain a copy of each non-binding estimate as an 
attachment to the bill of lading.
    (5) Your mover must clearly indicate on the face of a non-binding 
estimate that the estimate is not binding upon your mover and the 
charges shown are the approximate charges to be assessed for the 
services identified in the estimate.
    (6) Your mover must clearly describe on the face of a non-binding 
estimate the entire shipment and all services to be provided.
    (7) If, before loading your shipment, your mover believes you are 
tendering additional household goods or requiring additional services 
not identified in the non-binding estimate, and you and your mover 
cannot reach an agreement, your mover may refuse to service the 
shipment. If your mover agrees to service the shipment, your mover must 
do one of the following two things:
    (a) Reaffirm the non-binding estimate.
    (b) Negotiate a revised written non-binding estimate listing the 
additional household goods or services.
    (8) Once your mover loads your shipment, your mover's failure to 
execute a new estimate signifies it has reaffirmed the original non-
binding estimate. Your mover may not collect more than 110 percent of 
the amount of this estimate at destination.
    (9) Your mover may believe additional services are necessary to 
properly service your shipment after your household goods are in 
transit. Your mover must inform you what the additional services are 
before performing them. Your mover must allow you at least one hour to 
determine whether you want the additional services performed. Such 
additional services include carrying your furniture up additional stairs 
or using an elevator. If these services do not appear on your mover's 
estimate, your mover must deliver your shipment and bill you later for 
the additional services.
    If you agree to pay for the additional services, your mover must 
execute a written attachment to be made an integral part of the bill of 
lading and have you sign the written attachment. This may be done 
through fax transmissions. You will be billed for the additional 
services after 30 days from delivery.

[[Page 115]]

    (10) If you add additional services after your household goods are 
in transit, you will be billed for the additional services. To receive 
delivery, however, you are required to pay no more than 110 percent of 
the non-binding estimate. At least 30 days after delivery, your mover 
must bill you for any remaining balance, including the additional 
services you requested. For example, if your non-binding estimate shows 
total charges at delivery should be $1,000 but your actual charges at 
destination are $1,500, your mover must deliver the shipment upon 
payment of $1,100. The mover must bill you for the remaining $400 no 
sooner than 30 days after the date of delivery.
    If your mover furnishes a non-binding estimate, your mover must 
enter the estimated charges upon the order for service and upon the bill 
of lading.
    Your mover must retain a record of all estimates of charges for each 
move performed for at least one year from the date your mover made the 
estimate.

What Payment Arrangements Must My Mover Have in Place To Secure Delivery 
                     of My Household Goods Shipment?

    If your total bill is 110 percent or less of the non-binding 
estimate, the mover can require payment in full upon delivery. If the 
bill exceeds 110 percent of the non-binding estimate, your mover must 
relinquish possession of the shipment at the time of delivery upon 
payment of 110 percent of the estimated amount. Your mover should have 
specified its acceptable form of payment on the estimate, order for 
service, and bill of lading. Your mover's failure to relinquish 
possession of a shipment after you offer to pay 110 percent of the 
estimated charges constitutes its failure to transport the shipment with 
``reasonable dispatch'' and subjects your mover to your cargo delay 
claims under 49 CFR part 370.
    Your mover must bill for the payment of the balance of any remaining 
charges after 30 days from delivery.

           Subpart E--Pickup of My Shipment of Household Goods

    Must My Mover Write Up an Order for Service?
    We require your mover to prepare an order for service on every 
shipment transported for you. You are entitled to a copy of the order 
for service when your mover prepares it.
    The order for service is not a contract. Should you cancel or delay 
your move or if you decide not to use the mover, you should promptly 
cancel the order.
    If you or your mover change any agreed-upon dates for pickup or 
delivery of your shipment, or agree to any change in the non-binding 
estimate, your mover may prepare a written change to the order for 
service. The written change must be attached to the order for service.
    The order for service must contain the following 15 elements:
    (1) Your mover's name and address and the USDOT number assigned to 
your mover.
    (2) Your name, address and, if available, telephone number(s).
    (3) The name, address, and telephone number of the delivering 
mover's office or agent at or nearest to the destination of your 
shipment.
    (4) A telephone number where you may contact your mover or its 
designated agent.
    (5) One of the following three dates and times:
    (i) The agreed-upon pickup date and agreed delivery date of your 
move.
    (ii) The agreed-upon period(s) of the entire move.
    (iii) If your mover is transporting the shipment on a guaranteed 
service basis, the guaranteed dates or periods of time for pickup, 
transportation, and delivery. Your mover must enter any penalty or per 
diem requirements upon the agreement under this item.
    (6) The names and addresses of any other motor carriers, when known, 
that will participate in interline transportation of the shipment.
    (7) The form of payment your mover will honor at delivery. The 
payment information must be the same as was entered on the estimate.
    (8) The terms and conditions for payment of the total charges, 
including notice of any minimum charges.
    (9) The maximum amount your mover will demand at the time of 
delivery to obtain possession of the shipment, when transported on a 
collect-on-delivery basis.
    (10) If not provided in the bill of lading, the Surface 
Transportation Board's required released rates valuation statement, and 
the charges, if any, for optional valuation coverage. The STB's required 
released rates may be increased annually by your mover based on the U.S. 
Department of Commerce's Cost of Living Adjustment.
    (11) A complete description of any special or accessorial services 
ordered and minimum weight or volume charges applicable to the shipment.
    (12) Any identification or registration number your mover assigns to 
the shipment.
    (13) For non-binding estimated charges, your mover's reasonably 
accurate estimate of the amount of the charges, the method of payment of 
total charges, and the maximum amount (110 percent of the non-binding 
estimate) your mover will demand at the time of delivery for you to 
obtain possession of the shipment.
    (14) For binding estimated charges, the amount of charges your mover 
will demand based upon the binding estimate and the terms of payment 
under the estimate.

[[Page 116]]

    (15) An indication of whether you request notification of the 
charges before delivery. You must provide your mover with the telephone 
number(s) or address(es) where your mover will transmit such 
communications.
    You and your mover must sign the order for service. Your mover must 
provide a dated copy of the order for service to you at the time your 
mover signs the order. Your mover must provide you the opportunity to 
rescind the order for service without any penalty for a three-day period 
after you sign the order for service, if you scheduled the shipment to 
be loaded more than three days after you sign the order.
    Your mover should provide you with documents that are as complete as 
possible, and with all charges clearly identified. However, as a 
practical matter, your mover usually cannot give you a complete bill of 
lading before transporting your goods. This is both because the shipment 
cannot be weighed until it is in transit and because other charges for 
service, such as unpacking, storage-in-transit, and various destination 
charges, cannot be determined until the shipment reaches its 
destination.
    Therefore, your mover can require you to sign a partially complete 
bill of lading if it contains all relevant information except the actual 
shipment weight and any other information necessary to determine the 
final charges for all services provided. Signing the bill of lading 
allows you to choose the valuation option, request special services, 
and/or acknowledge the terms and conditions of released valuation.
    Your mover also may provide you, strictly for informational 
purposes, with blank or incomplete documents pertaining to the move.
    Before loading your shipment, and upon mutual agreement of both you 
and your mover, your mover may amend an order for service. Your mover 
must retain records of an order for service it transported for at least 
one year from the date your mover wrote the order.
    Your mover must inform you, before or at the time of loading, if the 
mover reasonably expects a special or accessorial service is necessary 
to transport a shipment safely. Your mover must refuse to accept the 
shipment when your mover reasonably expects a special or accessorial 
service is necessary to transport a shipment safely, but you refuse to 
purchase the special or accessorial service. Your mover must make a 
written note if you refuse any special or accessorial services that your 
mover reasonably expects to be necessary.

          Must My Mover Write Up an Inventory of the Shipment?

    Yes. Your mover must prepare an inventory of your shipment before or 
at the time of loading. If your mover's driver fails to prepare an 
inventory, you should write a detailed inventory of your shipment 
listing any damage or unusual wear to any items. The purpose is to make 
a record of the existence and condition of each item.
    After completing the inventory, you should sign each page and ask 
the mover's driver to sign each page. Before you sign it, it is 
important you make sure that the inventory lists every item in the 
shipment and that the entries regarding the condition of each item are 
correct. You have the right to note any disagreement. If an item is 
missing or damaged when your mover delivers the shipment, your 
subsequent ability to dispute the items lost or damaged may depend upon 
your notations.
    You should retain a copy of the inventory. Your mover may keep the 
original if the driver prepared it. If your mover's driver completed an 
inventory, the mover must attach the complete inventory to the bill of 
lading as an integral part of the bill of lading.

                Must My Mover Write Up a Bill of Lading?

    The bill of lading is the contract between you and the mover. The 
mover is required by law to prepare a bill of lading for every shipment 
it transports. The information on a bill of lading is required to be the 
same information shown on the order for service. The driver who loads 
your shipment must give you a copy of the bill of lading before or at 
the time of loading your furniture and other household goods.
    It is your responsibility to read the bill of lading before you 
accept it. It is your responsibility to understand the bill of lading 
before you sign it. If you do not agree with something on the bill of 
lading, do not sign it until you are satisfied it is correct.
    The bill of lading requires the mover to provide the service you 
have requested. You must pay the charges set forth in the bill of 
lading.
    The bill of lading is an important document. Do not lose or misplace 
your copy. Have it available until your shipment is delivered, all 
charges are paid, and all claims, if any, are settled.
    A bill of lading must include the following 14 elements:
    (1) Your mover's name and address, or the name and address of the 
motor carrier issuing the bill of lading.
    (2) The names and addresses of any other motor carriers, when known, 
who will participate in the transportation of the shipment.
    (3) The name, address, and telephone number of the office of the 
motor carrier you must contact in relation to the transportation of the 
shipment.
    (4) The form of payment your mover will honor at delivery. The 
payment information

[[Page 117]]

must be the same that was entered on the estimate and order for service.
    (5) When your mover transports your shipment under a collect-on-
delivery basis, your name, address, and telephone number where the mover 
will notify you about the charges.
    (6) For non-guaranteed service, the agreed-upon date or period of 
time for pickup of the shipment and the agreed-upon date or period of 
time for the delivery of the shipment. The agreed-upon dates or periods 
for pickup and delivery entered upon the bill of lading must conform to 
the agreed-upon dates or periods of time for pickup and delivery entered 
upon the order for service or a proper amendment to the order for 
service.
    (7) For guaranteed service, the dates for pickup and delivery and 
any penalty or per diem entitlements due you under the agreement.
    (8) The actual date of pickup.
    (9) The identification number(s) of the vehicle(s) in which your 
mover loads your shipment.
    (10) The terms and conditions for payment of the total charges 
including notice of any minimum charges.
    (11) The maximum amount your mover will demand from you at the time 
of delivery for you to obtain possession of your shipment, when your 
mover transports under a collect-on-delivery basis.
    (12) If not provided in the order for service, the Surface 
Transportation Board's required released rates valuation statement, and 
the charges, if any, for optional valuation coverage. The Board's 
required released rates may be increased annually by your mover based on 
the U.S. Department of Commerce's Cost of Living Adjustment.
    (13) Evidence of any insurance coverage sold to or procured for you 
from an independent insurer, including the amount of the premium for 
such insurance.
    (14) Each attachment to the bill of lading. Each attachment is an 
integral part of the bill of lading contract. If not provided to you 
elsewhere by the mover, the following three items must be added as 
attachments:
    (i) The binding or non-binding estimate.
    (ii) The order for service.
    (iii) The inventory.
    A copy of the bill of lading must accompany your shipment at all 
times while in the possession of your mover or its agent(s). When your 
mover loads the shipment on a vehicle for transportation, the bill of 
lading must be in the possession of the driver responsible for the 
shipment. Your mover must retain bills of lading for shipments it 
transported for at least one year from the date your mover created the 
bill of lading.

  Should I Reach an Agreement With My Mover About Pickup and Delivery 
                                 Times?

    You and your mover should reach an agreement for pickup and delivery 
times. It is your responsibility to determine on what date, or between 
what dates, you need to have the shipment picked up and on what date, or 
between what dates, you require delivery. It is your mover's 
responsibility to tell you if it can provide service on or between those 
dates, or, if not, on what other dates it can provide the service.
    In the process of reaching an agreement with your mover, you may 
find it necessary to alter your moving and travel plans if no mover can 
provide service on the specific dates you desire.
    Do not agree to have your shipment picked up or delivered ``as soon 
as possible.'' The dates or periods you and your mover agree upon should 
be definite.
    Once an agreement is reached, your mover must enter those dates upon 
the order for service and the bill of lading.
    Once your goods are loaded, your mover is contractually bound to 
provide the service described in the bill of lading. Your mover's only 
defense for not providing the service on the dates called for is the 
defense of force majeure. This is a legal term. It means that when 
circumstances change, were not foreseen, and are beyond the control of 
your mover, preventing your mover from performing the service agreed to 
in the bill of lading, your mover is not responsible for damages 
resulting from its nonperformance.
    This may occur when you do not inform your mover of the exact 
delivery requirements. For example, because of restrictions trucks must 
follow at your new location, the mover may not be able to take its truck 
down the street of your residence and may need to shuttle the shipment 
using another type of vehicle.

           Must My Mover Determine the Weight of My Shipment?

    Generally, yes. If your mover transports your household goods on a 
non-binding estimate under the mover's tariffs based upon weight, your 
mover must determine the weight of the shipment. If your mover provided 
a binding estimate and has loaded your shipment without claiming you 
have added additional items or services, the weight of the shipment will 
not affect the charges you will pay. If your mover is transporting your 
shipment based upon the volume of the shipment--that is, a set number of 
cubic feet (or yards or meters)--the weight of the shipment likewise 
will not affect the charges you will pay.
    Your mover must determine the weight of your shipment before 
requesting you to pay for any charges dependent upon your shipment's 
weight.
    Most movers have a minimum weight or volume charge for transporting 
a shipment. Generally, the minimum is the charge for transporting a 
shipment of at least 3,000 pounds (1,362 kilograms).

[[Page 118]]

    If your shipment appears to weigh less than the mover's minimum 
weight, your mover must advise you on the order for service of the 
minimum cost before transporting your shipment. Should your mover fail 
to advise you of the minimum charges and your shipment is less than the 
minimum weight, your mover must base your final charges upon the actual 
weight, not upon the minimum weight.

         How Must My Mover Determine the Weight of My Shipment?

    Your mover must weigh your shipment upon a certified scale.
    The weight of your shipment must be obtained by using one of two 
methods.
    Origin Weighing--Your mover may weigh your shipment in the city or 
area where it loads your shipment. If it elects this option, the driver 
must weigh the truck before coming to your residence. This is called the 
tare weight. At the time of this first weighing, the truck may already 
be partially loaded with another shipment(s). This will not affect the 
weight of your shipment. The truck should also contain the pads, 
dollies, hand trucks, ramps, and other equipment normally used in the 
transportation of household goods shipments.
    After loading, the driver will weigh the truck again to obtain the 
loaded weight, called the gross weight. The net weight of your shipment 
is then obtained by subtracting the tare weight before loading from the 
gross weight.
    Gross Weight - Tare Weight Before Loading = Net Weight.
    Destination Weighing (Also called Back Weighing)--The mover is also 
permitted to determine the weight of your shipment at the destination 
after it delivers your load. Weighing your shipment at destination 
instead of at origin will not affect the accuracy of the shipment 
weight. The most important difference is that your mover will not 
determine the exact charges on your shipment before it is unloaded.
    Destination weighing is done in reverse of origin weighing. After 
arriving in the city or area where you are moving, the driver will weigh 
the truck. Your shipment will still be on the truck. Your mover will 
determine the gross weight before coming to your new residence to 
unload. After unloading your shipment, the driver will again weigh the 
truck to obtain the tare weight. The net weight of your shipment will 
then be obtained by subtracting the tare weight after delivery from the 
gross weight.
    Gross Weight - Tare Weight After Delivery = Net Weight.
    At the time of both weighings, your mover's truck must have 
installed or loaded all pads, dollies, hand trucks, ramps, and other 
equipment required in the transportation of your shipment. The driver 
and other persons must be off the vehicle at the time of both weighings. 
The fuel tanks on the vehicle must be full at the time of each weighing. 
In lieu of this requirement, your mover must not add fuel between the 
two weighings when the tare weighing is the first weighing performed.
    Your mover may detach the trailer of a tractor-trailer vehicle 
combination from the tractor and have the trailer weighed separately at 
each weighing provided the length of the scale platform is adequate to 
accommodate and support the entire trailer.
    Your mover may use an alternative method to weigh your shipment if 
it weighs 3,000 pounds (1,362 kilograms) or less. The only alternative 
method allowed is weighing the shipment upon a platform or warehouse 
certified scale before loading your shipment for transportation or after 
unloading.
    Your mover must use the net weight of shipments transported in large 
containers, such as ocean or railroad containers. Your mover will 
calculate the difference between the tare weight of the container 
(including all pads, blocking and bracing used in the transportation of 
your shipment) and the gross weight of the container with your shipment 
loaded in the container.
    You have the right, and your mover must inform you of your right, to 
observe all weighings of your shipment. Your mover must tell you where 
and when each weighing will occur. Your mover must give you a reasonable 
opportunity to be present to observe the weighings.
    You may waive your right to observe any weighing or reweighing. This 
does not affect any of your other rights under Federal law.
    Your mover may request you waive your right to have a shipment 
weighed upon a certified scale. Your mover may want to weigh the 
shipment upon a trailer's on-board, noncertified scale. You should 
demand your right to have a certified scale used. The use of a 
noncertified scale may cause you to pay a higher final bill for your 
move, if the noncertified scale does not accurately weigh your shipment. 
Remember that certified scales are inspected and approved for accuracy 
by a government inspection or licensing agency. Noncertified scales are 
not inspected and approved for accuracy by a government inspection or 
licensing agency.
    Your mover must obtain a separate weight ticket for each weighing. 
The weigh master must sign each weight ticket. Each weight ticket must 
contain the following six items:
    (1) The complete name and location of the scale.
    (2) The date of each weighing.
    (3) Identification of the weight entries as being the tare, gross, 
or net weights.
    (4) The company or mover identification of the vehicle.
    (5) Your last name as it appears on the Bill of Lading.

[[Page 119]]

    (6) Your mover's shipment registration or Bill of Lading number.
    Your mover must retain the original weight ticket or tickets 
relating to the determination of the weight of your shipment as part of 
its file on your shipment.
    When both weighings are performed on the same scale, one weight 
ticket may be used to record both weighings.
    Your mover must present all freight bills with true copies of all 
weight tickets. If your mover does not present its freight bill with all 
weight tickets, your mover is in violation of Federal law.
    Before the driver actually begins unloading your shipment weighed at 
origin and after your mover informs you of the billing weight and total 
charges, you have the right to demand a reweigh of your shipment. If you 
believe the weight is not accurate, you have the right to request your 
mover reweigh your shipment before unloading.
    You have the right, and your mover must inform you of your right, to 
observe all reweighings of your shipment. Your mover must tell you where 
and when each reweighing will occur. Your mover must give you a 
reasonable opportunity to be present to observe the reweighings.
    You may waive your right to observe any reweighing; however, you 
must waive that right in writing. You may send the written waiver via 
fax or e-mail, as well as by overnight courier or certified mail, return 
receipt requested. This does not affect any of your other rights under 
Federal law.
    Your mover is prohibited from charging you for the reweighing. If 
the weight of your shipment at the time of the reweigh is different from 
the weight determined at origin, your mover must recompute the charges 
based upon the reweigh weight.
    Before requesting a reweigh, you may find it to your advantage to 
estimate the weight of your shipment using the following three-step 
method:
    1. Count the number of items in your shipment. Usually there will be 
either 30 or 40 items listed on each page of the inventory. For example, 
if there are 30 items per page and your inventory consists of four 
complete pages and a fifth page with 15 items listed, the total number 
of items will be 135. If an automobile is listed on the inventory, do 
not include this item in the count of the total items.
    2. Subtract the weight of any automobile included in your shipment 
from the total weight of the shipment. If the automobile was not weighed 
separately, its weight can be found on its title or license receipt.
    3. Divide the number of items in your shipment into the weight. If 
the average weight resulting from this exercise ranges between 35 and 45 
pounds (16 and 20 kilograms) per article, it is unlikely a reweigh will 
prove beneficial to you. In fact, it could result in your paying higher 
charges.
    Experience has shown that the average shipment of household goods 
will weigh about 40 pounds (18 kilograms) per item. If a shipment 
contains a large number of heavy items, such as cartons of books, boxes 
of tools or heavier than average furniture, the average weight per item 
may be 45 pounds or more (20 kilograms or more).

What Must My Mover Do if I Want To Know the Actual Weight or Charges for 
                      My Shipment Before Delivery?

    If you request notification of the actual weight or volume and 
charges upon your shipment, your mover must comply with your request if 
it is moving your goods on a collect-on-delivery basis. This requirement 
is conditioned upon your supplying your mover with an address or 
telephone number where you will receive the communication. Your mover 
must make its notification by telephone; fax transmissions; e-mail; 
overnight courier; certified mail, return receipt requested; or in 
person.
    You must receive the mover's notification at least one full 24-hour 
day before its scheduled delivery, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and 
Federal holidays.
    Your mover may disregard this 24-hour notification requirement on 
shipments subject to one of the following three things:
    (1) Back weigh (when your mover weighs your shipment at its 
destination).
    (2) Pickup and delivery encompassing two consecutive weekdays, if 
you agree.
    (3) Maximum payment amounts at time of delivery of 110 percent of 
the estimated charges, if you agree.

                Subpart F--Transportation of My Shipment

        Must My Mover Transport the Shipment in a Timely Manner?

    Yes, your mover must transport your household goods in a timely 
manner. This is also known as ``reasonable dispatch service.'' Your 
mover must provide reasonable dispatch service to you, except for 
transportation on the basis of guaranteed delivery dates.
    When your mover is unable to perform either the pickup or delivery 
of your shipment on the dates or during the periods of time specified in 
the order for service, your mover must notify you of the delay, at the 
mover's expense. As soon as the delay becomes apparent to your mover, it 
must give you notification it will be unable to provide the service 
specified in the terms of the order for service. Your mover may notify 
you of the delay in any of the following ways: by telephone; fax 
transmissions; e-mail; overnight courier; certified mail, return receipt 
requested; or in person.
    When your mover notifies you of a delay, it also must advise you of 
the dates or periods

[[Page 120]]

of time it may be able to pick up and/or deliver the shipment. Your 
mover must consider your needs in its advisement.
    Your mover must prepare a written record of the date, time, and 
manner of its notification. Your mover must prepare a written record of 
its amended date or period for delivery. Your mover must retain these 
records as a part of its file on your shipment. The retention period is 
one year from the date of notification. Your mover must furnish a copy 
of the notification to you either by first class mail or in person, if 
you request a copy of the notice.
    Your mover must tender your shipment for delivery on the agreed-upon 
delivery date or within the period specified on the bill of lading. Upon 
your request or concurrence, your mover may deliver your shipment on 
another day.
    The establishment of a delayed pickup or delivery date does not 
relieve your mover from liability for damages resulting from your 
mover's failure to provide service as agreed. However, when your mover 
notifies you of alternate delivery dates, it is your responsibility to 
be available to accept delivery on the dates specified. If you are not 
available and are not willing to accept delivery, your mover has the 
right to place your shipment in storage at your expense or hold the 
shipment on its truck and assess additional charges.
    If after the pickup of your shipment, you request your mover to 
change the delivery date, most movers will agree to do so provided your 
request will not result in unreasonable delay to its equipment or 
interfere with another customer's move. However, your mover is under no 
obligation to consent to amended delivery dates. Your mover has the 
right to place your shipment in storage at your expense if you are 
unwilling or unable to accept delivery on the date agreed to in the bill 
of lading.
    If your mover fails to pick up and deliver your shipment on the date 
entered on the bill of lading and you have expenses you otherwise would 
not have had, you may be able to recover those expenses from your mover. 
This is what is called an inconvenience or delay claim. Should your 
mover refuse to honor such a claim and you continue to believe you are 
entitled to be paid damages, you may take your mover to court under 49 
U.S.C. 14706. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) 
has no authority to order your mover to pay such claims.
    While we hope your mover delivers your shipment in a timely manner, 
you should consider the possibility your shipment may be delayed, and 
find out what payment you can expect if a mover delays service through 
its own fault, before you agree with the mover to transport your 
shipment.

What Must My Mover Do if It Is Able To Deliver My Shipment More Than 24 
               Hours Before I Am Able to Accept Delivery?

    At your mover's discretion, it may place your shipment in storage. 
This will be under its own account and at its own expense in a warehouse 
located in proximity to the destination of your shipment. Your mover may 
do this if you fail to request or concur with an early delivery date, 
and your mover is able to deliver your shipment more than 24 hours 
before your specified date or the first day of your specified period.
    If your mover exercises this option, your mover must immediately 
notify you of the name and address of the warehouse where your mover 
places your shipment. Your mover must make and keep a record of its 
notification as a part of its shipment records. Your mover has full 
responsibility for the shipment under the terms and conditions of the 
bill of lading. Your mover is responsible for the charges for 
redelivery, handling, and storage until it makes final delivery. Your 
mover may limit its responsibility to the agreed-upon delivery date or 
the first day of the period of delivery as specified in the bill of 
lading.

  What Must My Mover Do for Me When I Store Household Goods in Transit?

    If you request your mover to hold your household goods in storage-
in-transit and the storage period is about to expire, your mover must 
notify you, in writing, about the four following items:
    (1) The date when storage-in-transit will convert to permanent 
storage.
    (2) The existence of a nine-month period after the date of 
conversion to permanent storage, during which you may file claims 
against your mover for loss or damage occurring to your goods while in 
transit or during the storage-in-transit period.
    (3) Your mover's liability will end.
    (4) Your property will be subject to the rules, regulations, and 
charges of the warehouseman.
    Your mover must make this notification at least 10 days before the 
expiration date of one of the following two periods of time:
    (1) The specified period of time when your mover is to hold your 
goods in storage.
    (2) The maximum period of time provided in its tariff for storage-
in-transit.
    Your mover must notify you by facsimile transmission; overnight 
courier; e-mail; or certified mail, return receipt requested.
    If your mover holds your household goods in storage-in-transit for 
less than 10 days, your mover must notify you, one day before the 
storage-in-transit period expires, of the same information specified 
above.
    Your mover must maintain a record of all notifications to you as 
part of the records of

[[Page 121]]

your shipment. Under the applicable tariff provisions regarding storage-
in-transit, your mover's failure or refusal to notify you will 
automatically extend your mover's liability until the end of the day 
following the date when your mover actually gives you notice.

                   Subpart G--Delivery of My Shipment

May My Mover Ask Me To Sign a Delivery Receipt Purporting To Release It 
                             From Liability?

    At the time of delivery, your mover will expect you to sign a 
receipt for your shipment. Normally, you will sign each page of your 
mover's copy of the inventory.
    Your mover's delivery receipt or shipping document must not contain 
any language purporting to release or discharge it or its agents from 
liability.
    Your mover may include a statement about your receipt of your 
property in apparent good condition, except as noted on the shipping 
documents.
    Do not sign the delivery receipt if it contains any language 
purporting to release or discharge your mover or its agents from 
liability. Strike out such language before signing, or refuse delivery 
if the driver or mover refuses to provide a proper delivery receipt.

What Is the Maximum Collect-on-Delivery Amount My Mover May Demand I Pay 
                        at the Time of Delivery?

    On a binding estimate, the maximum amount is the exact estimate of 
the charges. Your mover must specify on the estimate, order for service, 
and bill of lading the form of payment acceptable to it (for example, a 
certified check).
    On a non-binding estimate, the maximum amount is 110 percent of the 
approximate costs. Your mover must specify on the estimate, order for 
service, and bill of lading the form of payment acceptable to it (for 
example, cash).

If My Shipment Is Transported on More Than One Vehicle, What Charges May 
                      My Mover Collect at Delivery?

    Although all movers try to move each shipment on one truck, it 
becomes necessary at times to divide a shipment among two or more 
trucks. This frequently occurs when an automobile is included in the 
shipment and it is transported on a vehicle specially designed to 
transport automobiles. When this occurs, your transportation charges are 
the same as if the entire shipment moved on one truck.
    If your shipment is divided for transportation on two or more 
trucks, the mover may require payment for each portion as it is 
delivered.
    Your mover may delay the collection of all the charges until the 
entire shipment is delivered, at its discretion, not yours. When you 
order your move, you should ask the mover about its policies in this 
regard.

If My Shipment Is Partially Lost or Destroyed, What Charges May My Mover 
                          Collect at Delivery?

    Movers customarily make every effort to avoid losing, damaging, or 
destroying any of your items while your shipment is in their possession 
for transportation. However, despite the precautions taken, articles are 
sometimes lost or destroyed during the move.
    In addition to any money you may recover from your mover to 
compensate for lost or destroyed articles, you may also recover the 
transportation charges represented by the portion of the shipment lost 
or destroyed. Your mover may only apply this paragraph to the 
transportation of household goods. Your mover may disregard this 
paragraph if loss or destruction was due to an act or omission by you. 
Your mover must require you to pay any specific valuation charge due.
    For example, if you pack a hazardous material (i.e., gasoline, 
aerosol cans, motor oil, etc.) and your shipment is partially lost or 
destroyed by fire in storage or in the mover's trailer, your mover may 
require you to pay for the full cost of transportation.
    Your mover may first collect its freight charges for the entire 
shipment, if your mover chooses. At the time your mover disposes of 
claims for loss, damage, or injury to the articles in your shipment, it 
must refund the portion of its freight charges corresponding to the 
portion of the lost or destroyed shipment (including any charges for 
accessorial or terminal services).
    Your mover is forbidden from collecting, or requiring you to pay, 
any freight charges (including any charges for accessorial or terminal 
services) when your household goods shipment is totally lost or 
destroyed in transit, unless the loss or destruction was due to an act 
or omission by you.

 How Must My Mover Calculate the Charges Applicable to the Shipment as 
                               Delivered?

    Your mover must multiply the percentage corresponding to the 
delivered shipment times the total charges applicable to the shipment 
tendered by you to obtain the total charges it must collect from you.
    If your mover's computed charges exceed the charges otherwise 
applicable to the shipment as delivered, the lesser of those charges 
must apply. This will apply only to the transportation of your household 
goods.
    Your mover must require you to pay any specific valuation charge 
due.

[[Page 122]]

    Your mover may not refund the freight charges if the loss or 
destruction was due to an act or omission by you. For example, you fail 
to disclose to your mover that your shipment contains perishable live 
plants. Your mover may disregard its loss or destruction of your plants, 
because you failed to inform your mover you were transporting live 
plants.
    Your mover must determine, at its own expense, the proportion of the 
shipment, based on actual or constructive weight, not lost or destroyed 
in transit.
    Your rights are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights 
you may have with respect to your shipment of household goods your mover 
lost or destroyed, or partially lost or destroyed, in transit. This 
applies whether or not you have exercised your rights provided above.

                    Subpart H--Collection of Charges

               Does This Subpart Apply to Most Shipments?

    It applies to all shipments of household goods that involve a 
balance due freight or expense bill or are shipped on credit.

      How Must My Mover Present Its Freight or Expense Bill to Me?

    At the time of payment of transportation charges, your mover must 
give you a freight bill identifying the service provided and the charge 
for each service. It is customary for most movers to use a copy of the 
bill of lading as a freight bill; however, some movers use an entirely 
separate document for this purpose.
    Except in those instances where a shipment is moving on a binding 
estimate, the freight bill must specifically identify each service 
performed, the rate or charge per service performed, and the total 
charges for each service. If this information is not on the freight 
bill, do not accept or pay the freight bill.
    Movers' tariffs customarily specify that freight charges must be 
paid in cash, by certified check, or by cashier's check. When this 
requirement exists, the mover will not accept personal checks. At the 
time you order your move, you should ask your mover about the form of 
payment your mover requires.
    Some movers permit payment of freight charges by use of a charge or 
credit card. However, do not assume your nationally recognized charge, 
credit, or debit card will be acceptable for payment. Ask your mover at 
the time you request an estimate. Your mover must specify the form of 
payment it will accept at delivery.
    If you do not pay the transportation charges at the time of 
delivery, your mover has the right, under the bill of lading, to refuse 
to deliver your goods. The mover may place them in storage, at your 
expense, until the charges are paid. However, the mover must deliver 
your goods upon payment of 100 percent of a binding estimate.
    If, before payment of the transportation charges, you discover an 
error in the charges, you should attempt to correct the error with the 
driver, the mover's local agent, or by contacting the mover's main 
office. If an error is discovered after payment, you should write the 
mover (the address will be on the freight bill) explaining the error, 
and request a refund.
    Movers customarily check all shipment files and freight bills after 
a move has been completed to make sure the charges were accurate. If an 
overcharge is found, you should be notified and a refund made. If an 
undercharge occurred, you may be billed for the additional charges due.
    On ``to be prepaid'' shipments, your mover must present its freight 
bill for all transportation charges within 15 days of the date your 
mover received the shipment. This period excludes Saturdays, Sundays, 
and Federal holidays.
    On ``collect'' shipments, your mover must present its freight bill 
for transportation charges on the date of delivery, or, at its 
discretion, within 15 days, calculated from the date the shipment was 
delivered at your destination. This period excludes Saturdays, Sundays, 
and Federal holidays. (Bills for charges exceeding 110 percent of a non-
binding estimate, and for additional services requested or found 
necessary after the shipment is in transit, will be presented no sooner 
than 30 days from the date of delivery.)
    Your mover's freight bills and accompanying written notices must 
state the following five items:
    (1) Penalties for late payment.
    (2) Credit time limits.
    (3) Service or finance charges.
    (4) Collection expense charges.
    (5) Discount terms.
    If your mover extends credit to you, freight bills or a separate 
written notice accompanying a freight bill or a group of freight bills 
presented at one time must state, ``You may be subject to tariff 
penalties for failure to timely pay freight charges,'' or a similar 
statement. Your mover must state on its freight bills or other notices 
when it expects payment, and any applicable service charges, collection 
expense charges, and discount terms.
    When your mover lacks sufficient information to compute its tariff 
charges at the time of billing, your mover must present its freight bill 
for payment within 15 days following the day when sufficient information 
becomes available. This period excludes Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal 
holidays.
    Your mover must not extend additional credit to you if you fail to 
furnish sufficient information to your mover. Your mover must have 
sufficient information to render a

[[Page 123]]

freight bill within a reasonable time after shipment.
    When your mover presents freight bills by mail, it must deem the 
time of mailing to be the time of presentation of the bills. The term 
``freight bills,'' as used in this paragraph, includes both paper 
documents and billing by use of electronic media such as computer tapes, 
disks, or the Internet (e-mail).
    When you mail acceptable checks or drafts in payment of freight 
charges, your mover must deem the act of mailing the payment within the 
credit period to be the proper collection of the tariff charges within 
the credit period for the purposes of Federal law. In case of a dispute 
as to the date of mailing, your mover must accept the postmark as the 
date of mailing.

If I Forced My Mover To Relinquish a Collect-on-Delivery Shipment Before 
   the Payment of ALL Charges, How Must My Mover Collect the Balance?

    On ``collect-on-delivery'' shipments, your mover must present its 
freight bill for transportation charges within 15 days, calculated from 
the date the shipment was delivered at your destination. This period 
excludes Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays. (Bills for charges 
exceeding 110 percent of a non-binding estimate, and charges for 
additional services requested or found necessary after the shipment is 
in transit, will be presented no sooner than 30 days after the date of 
delivery.)

 What Actions May My Mover Take To Collect From Me the Charges Upon Its 
                              Freight Bill?

    Your mover must present a freight bill within 15 days (excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays) of the date of delivery of a 
shipment at your destination. (Bills for charges exceeding 110 percent 
of a non-binding estimate, and for additional services requested or 
found necessary after the shipment is in transit, will be presented no 
sooner than 30 days after the date of delivery.)
    The credit period must be 7 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and 
Federal holidays).
    Your mover must provide in its tariffs the following three things:
    (1) A provision automatically extending the credit period to a total 
of 30 calendar days for you if you have not paid its freight bill within 
the 7-day period.
    (2) A provision indicating you will be assessed a service charge by 
your mover equal to one percent of the amount of the freight bill, 
subject to a $20 minimum charge, for the extension of the credit period. 
The mover will assess the service charge for each 30-day extension that 
the charges go unpaid.
    (3) A provision that your mover must deny credit to you if you fail 
to pay a duly presented freight bill within the 30-day period. Your 
mover may grant credit to you, at its discretion, when you satisfy your 
mover's condition that you will pay all future freight bills duly 
presented. Your mover must ensure all your payments of freight bills are 
strictly in accordance with Federal rules and regulations for the 
settlement of its rates and charges.

Do I Have a Right To File a Claim To Recover Money for Property My Mover 
                            Lost or Damaged?

    Should your move result in the loss of or damage to any of your 
property, you have the right to file a claim with your mover to recover 
money for such loss or damage.
    You should file a claim as soon as possible. If you fail to file a 
claim within 9 months, your mover may not be required to accept your 
claim. If you institute a court action and win, you may be entitled to 
attorney's fees, but only in either of two circumstances. You may be 
entitled to attorney's fees if you submitted your claim to the carrier 
within 120 days after delivery, and a decision was not rendered through 
arbitration within the time required by law. You also may be entitled to 
attorney's fees if you submitted your claim to the carrier within 120 
days after delivery, the court enforced an arbitration decision in your 
favor, and the time for the carrier to comply with the decision has 
passed.
    While the Federal Government maintains regulations governing the 
processing of loss and damage claims (49 CFR part 370), it cannot 
resolve those claims. If you cannot settle a claim with the mover, you 
may file a civil action to recover your claim in court under 49 U.S.C. 
14706. You may obtain the name and address of the mover's agent for 
service of legal process in your state by contacting the Federal Motor 
Carrier Safety Administration. You may also obtain the name of a process 
agent via the Internet by going to http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov and then 
clicking on Licensing and Insurance (L&I) section.
    In addition, your mover must participate in an arbitration program. 
As described earlier in this pamphlet, an arbitration program gives you 
the opportunity to settle certain types of unresolved loss or damage 
claims through a neutral arbitrator. You may find submitting your claim 
to arbitration under such a program to be a less expensive and more 
convenient way to seek recovery of your claim. Your mover is required to 
provide you with information about its arbitration program before you 
move. If your mover fails to do so, ask the mover for details of its 
program.

[[Page 124]]

               Subpart I--Resolving Disputes With My Mover

            What May I Do To Resolve Disputes With My Mover?

    The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration does not help you 
settle your dispute with your mover.
    Generally, you must resolve your own loss and damage disputes with 
your mover. You enter a contractual arrangement with your mover. You are 
bound by each of the following three things:
    (1) The terms and conditions you negotiated before your move.
    (2) The terms and conditions you accepted when you signed the bill 
of lading.
    (3) The terms and conditions you accepted when you signed for 
delivery of your goods.
    You have the right to take your mover to court. We require your 
mover to offer you arbitration to settle your disputes with it.
    If your mover holds your goods ``hostage''--refuses delivery unless 
you pay an amount you believe the mover is not entitled to charge--the 
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration does not have the resources 
to seek a court injunction on your behalf.

<R05>
Sec. 376.11  General leasing requirements.

    Other than through the interchange of equipment as set forth in 
Sec. 376.31, and under the exemptions set forth in subpart C of these 
regulations, the authorized carrier may perform authorized 
transportation in equipment it does not own only under the following 
conditions:
    (a) Lease. There shall be a written lease granting the use of the 
equipment and meeting the requirements contained in Sec. 376.12.
    (b) Receipts for equipment. Receipts, specifically identifying the 
equipment to be leased and stating the date and time of day possession 
is transferred, shall be given as follows:
    (1) When possession of the equipment is taken by the authorized 
carrier, it shall give the owner of the equipment a receipt. The receipt 
identified in this section may be transmitted by mail, telegraph, or 
other similar means of communication.
    (2) When possession of the equipment by the authorized carrier ends, 
a receipt shall be given in accordance with the terms of the lease 
agreement if the lease agreement requires a receipt.
    (3) Authorized representatives of the carrier and the owner may take 
possession of leased equipment and give and receive the receipts 
required under this subsection.
    (c) Identification of equipment. The authorized carrier acquiring 
the use of equipment under this section shall identify the equipment as 
being in its service as follows:
    (1) During the period of the lease, the carrier shall identify the 
equipment in accordance with the FMCSA's requirements in 49 CFR part 390 
of this chapter (Identification of Vehicles).
    (2) Unless a copy of the lease is carried on the equipment, the 
authorized carrier shall keep a statement with the equipment during the 
period of the lease certifying that the equipment is being operated by 
it. The statement shall also specify the name of the owner, the date and 
length of the lease, any restrictions in the lease relative to the 
commodities to be transported, and the address at which the original 
lease is kept by the authorized carrier. This statement shall be 
prepared by the authorized carrier or its authorized representative.
    (d) Records of equipment. The authorized carrier using equipment 
leased under this section shall keep records of the equipment as

point of final destination. Also, the authorized carrier shall carry 
papers with the leased equipment during its operation containing this 
information and identifying the lading and clearly indicating that the 
transportation is under its responsibility. These papers shall be 
preserved by the authorized carrier as part of its transportation 
records. Leases which contain the information required by the provisions 
in this paragraph may be used and retained instead of such documents or 
papers. As to lease agreements negotiated under a master lease, this 
provision is complied with by having a copy of a master lease in the 
unit of equipment in question and where the balance f documentation

<R05>
Sec. 376.12  Written lease requirements.

    Except as provided in the exemptions set forth in subpart C of this 
part, the written lease required under Sec. 376.11(a) shall contain the 
following provisions. The required lease provisions shall be adhered to 
and performed by the authorized carrier.
    (a) Parties. The lease shall be made between the authorized carrier 
and the owner of the equipment. The lease shall be signed by these 
parties or by their authorized representatives.
    (b) Duration to be specific. The lease shall specify the time and 
date or the circumstances on which the lease begins and ends. These 
times or circumstances shall coincide with the times for the giving of 
receipts required by Sec. 376.11(b).
    (c) Exclusive possession and responsibilities. (1) The lease shall 
provide that the authorized carrier lessee shall have exclusive 
possession, control, and use of the equipment for the duration of the 
lease. The lease shall further provide that the authorized carrier 
lessee shall assume complete responsibility for the operation of the 
equipment for the duration of the lease.
    (2) Provision may be made in the lease for considering the 
authorized carrier lessee as the owner of the equipment for the purpose 
of subleasing it under these regulations to other authorized carriers 
during the lease.
    (3) When an authorized carrier of household goods leases equipment 
for the transportation of household goods, as defined by the Secretary, 
the parties may provide in the lease that the provisions required by 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section apply only during the time the 
equipment is operated by or for the authorized carrier lessee.
    (4) Nothing in the provisions required by paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section is intended to affect whether the lessor or driver provided by 
the lessor is an independent contractor or an employee of the authorized 
carrier lessee. An independent contractor relationship may exist when a 
carrier lessee complies with 49 U.S.C. 14102 and attendant 
administrative requirements.
    (d) Compensation to be specified. The amount to be paid by the 
authorized carrier for equipment and driver's services shall be clearly 
stated on the face of the lease or in an addendum which is attached to 
the lease. Such lease or addendum shall be delivered to the lessor prior 
to the commencement of any trip in the service of the authorized 
carrier. An authorized representative of the lessor may accept these 
documents. The amount to be paid may be expressed as a percentage of 
gross revenue, a flat rate per mile, a variable rate depending on the 
direction traveled or the type of commodity transported, or by any other 
method of compensation mutually agreed upon by the parties to the lease. 
The compensation stated on the lease or in the attached addendum may 
apply to equipment and driver's services either separately or as a 
combined amount.
    (e) Items specified in lease. The lease shall clearly specify which 
party is responsible for removing identification devices from the 
equipment upon the termination of the lease and when and how these 
devices, other than those painted directly on the equipment, will be 
returned to the carrier. The lease shall clearly specify the manner in 
which a receipt will be given to the authorized carrier by the equipment

[[Page 127]]

owner when the latter retakes possession of the equipment upon 
termination of the lease agreement, if a receipt is required at all by 
the lease. The lease shall clearly specify the responsibility of each 
party with respect to the cost of fuel, fuel taxes, empty mileage, 
permits of all types, tolls, ferries, detention and accessorial 
services, base plates and licenses, and any unused portions of such 
items. The lease shall clearly specify who is responsible for loading 
and unloading the property onto and from the motor vehicle, and the 
compensation, if any, to be paid for this service. Except when the 
violation results from the acts or omissions of the lessor, the 
authorized carrier lessee shall assume the risks and costs of fines for 
overweight and oversize trailers when the trailers are pre-loaded, 
sealed, or the load is containerized, or when the trailer or lading is 
otherwise outside of the lessor's control, and for improperly permitted 
overdimension and overweight loads and shall reimburse the lessor for 
any fines paid by the lessor. If the authorized carrier is authorized to 
receive a refund or a credit for base plates purchased by the lessor 
from, and issued in the name of, the authorized carrier, or if the base 
plates are authorized to be sold by the authorized carrier to another 
lessor the authorized carrier shall refund to the initial lessor on 
whose behalf the base plate was first obtained a prorated share of the 
amount received.
    (f) Payment period. The lease shall specify that payment to the 
lessor shall be made within 15 days after submission of the necessary 
delivery documents and other paperwork concerning a trip in the service 
of the authorized carrier. The paperwork required before the lessor can 
receive payment is limited to log books required by the Department of 
Transportation and those documents necessary for the authorized carrier 
to secure payment from the shipper. In addition, the lease may provide 
that, upon termination of the lease agreement, as a condition precedent 
to payment, the lessor shall remove all identification devices of the 
authorized carrier and, except in the case of identification painted 
directly on equipment, return them to the carrier. If the identification 
device has been lost or stolen, a letter certifying its removal will 
satisfy this requirement. Until this requirement is complied with, the 
carrier may withhold final payment. The authorized carrier may require 
the submission of additional documents by the lessor but not as a 
prerequisite to payment. Payment to the lessor shall not be made 
contingent upon submission of a bill of lading to which no exceptions 
have been taken. The authorized carrier shall not set time limits for 
the submission by the lessor of required delivery documents and other 
paperwork.
    (g) Copies of freight bill or other form of freight documentation. 
When a lessor's revenue is based on a percentage of the gross revenue 
for a shipment, the lease must specify that the authorized carrier will 
give the lessor, before or at the time of settlement, a copy of the 
rated freight bill or a computer-generated document containing the same 
information, or, in the case of contract carriers, any other form of 
documentation actually used for a shipment containing the same 
information that would appear on a rated freight bill. When a computer-
generated document is provided, the lease will permit lessor to view, 
during normal business hours, a copy of any actual document underlying 
the computer-generated document. Regardless of the method of 
compensation, the lease must permit lessor to examine copies of the 
carrier's tariff or, in the case of contract carriers, other documents 
from which rates and charges are computed, provided that where rates and 
charges are computed from a contract of a contract carrier, only those 
portions of the contract containing the same information that would 
appear on a rated freight bill need be disclosed. The authorized carrier 
may delete the names of shippers and consignees shown on the freight 
bill or other form of documentation.
    (h) Charge-back items. The lease shall clearly specify all items 
that may be initially paid for by the authorized carrier, but ultimately 
deducted from the lessor's compensation at the time of payment or 
settlement, together with a recitation as to how the amount of each item 
is to be computed. The lessor

[[Page 128]]

shall be afforded copies of those documents which are necessary to 
determine the validity of the charge.
    (i) Products, equipment, or services from authorized carrier. The 
lease shall specify that the lessor is not required to purchase or rent 
any products, equipment, or services from the authorized carrier as a 
condition of entering into the lease arrangement. The lease shall 
specify the terms of any agreement in which the lessor is a party to an 
equipment purchase or rental contract which gives the authorized carrier 
the right to make deductions from the lessor's compensation for purchase 
or rental payments.
    (j) Insurance. (1) The lease shall clearly specify the legal 
obligation of the authorized carrier to maintain insurance coverage for 
the protection of the public pursuant to FMCSA regulations under 49 
U.S.C. 13906. The lease shall further specify who is responsible for 
providing any other insurance coverage for the operation of the leased 
equipment, such as bobtail insurance. If the authorized carrier will 
make a charge back to the lessor for any of this insurance, the lease 
shall specify the amount which will be charged-back to the lessor.
    (2) If the lessor purchases any insurance coverage for the operation 
of the leased equipment from or through the authorized carrier, the 
lease shall specify that the authorized carrier will provide the lessor 
with a copy of each policy upon the request of the lessor. Also, where 
the lessor purchases such insurance in this manner, the lease shall 
specify that the authorized carrier will provide the lessor with a 
certificate of insurance for each such policy. Each certificate of 
insurance shall include the name of the insurer, the policy number, the 
effective dates of the policy, the amounts and types of coverage, the 
cost to the lessor for each type of coverage, and the deductible amount 
for each type of coverage for which the lessor may be liable.
    (3) The lease shall clearly specify the conditions under which 
deductions for cargo or property damage may be made from the lessor's 
settlements. The lease shall further specify that the authorized carrier 
must provide the lessor with a written explanation and itemization of 
any deductions for cargo or property damage made from any compensation 
of money owed to the lessor. The written explanation and itemization 
must be delivered to the lessor before any deductions are made.
    (k) Escrow funds. If escrow funds are required, the lease shall 
specify:
    (1) The amount of any escrow fund or performance bond required to be 
paid by the lessor to the authorized carrier or to a third party.
    (2) The specific items to which the escrow fund can be applied.
    (3) That while the escrow fund is under the control of the 
authorized carrier, the authorized carrier shall provide an accounting 
to the lessor of any transactions involving such fund. The carrier shall 
perform this accounting in one of the following ways:
    (i) By clearly indicating in individual settlement sheets the amount 
and description of any deduction or addition made to the escrow fund; or
    (ii) By providing a separate accounting to the lessor of any 
transactions involving the escrow fund. This separate accounting shall 
be done on a monthly basis.
    (4) The right of the lessor to demand to have an accounting for 
transactions involving the escrow fund at any time.
    (5) That while the escrow fund is under the control of the carrier, 
the carrier shall pay interest on the escrow fund on at least a 
quarterly basis. For purposes of calculating the balance of the escrow 
fund on which interest must be paid, the carrier may deduct a sum equal 
to the average advance made to the individual lessor during the period 
of time for which interest is paid. The interest rate shall be 
established on the date the interest period begins and shall be at least 
equal to the average yield or equivalent coupon issue yield on 91-day, 
13-week Treasury bills as established in the weekly auction by the 
Department of Treasury.
    (6) The conditions the lessor must fulfill in order to have the 
escrow fund returned. At the time of the return of the escrow fund, the 
authorized carrier may deduct monies for those obligations incurred by 
the lessor which have been previously specified in the lease, and shall 
provide a final accounting to the lessor of all such final deductions

[[Page 129]]

made to the escrow fund. The lease shall further specify that in no 
event shall the escrow fund be returned later than 45 days from the date 
of termination.
    (l) Copies of the lease. An original and two copies of each lease 
shall be signed by the parties. The authorized carrier shall keep the 
original and shall place a copy of the lease on the equipment during the 
period of the lease unless a statement as provided for in Sec. 
376.11(c)(2) is carried on the equipment instead. The owner of the 
equipment shall keep the other copy of the lease.
    (m) This paragraph applies to owners who are not agents but whose 
equipment is used by an agent of an authorized carrier in providing 
transportation on behalf of that authorized carrier. In this situation, 
the authorized carrier is obligated to ensure that these owners receive 
all the rights and benefits due an owner under the leasing regulations, 
especially those set forth in paragraphs (d)-(k) of this section. This 
is true regardless of whether the lease for the equipment is directly 
between the authorized carrier and its agent rather than directly 
between the authorized carrier and each of these owners. The lease 
between an authorized carrier and its agent shall specify this 
obligation.

shall be signed by the parties or by their authorized representatives.
    (b) Operating authority. The carriers participating in the 
interchange shall be registered with the Secretary to provide the 
transportaiton of the commodities at the point where the physical 
exchange occurs.
    (c) Through bills of lading. The traffic transported in interchange 
service must move on through bills of lading issued by the originating 
carrier. The rates charged and the revenues collected must be accounted 
for in the same manner as if there had been no interchange. Charges for 
the use of the interchanged equipment shall be kept separate from 
divisions of the joint rates or the proportions of such rates accruing 
to the carriers by the application of local or proportional rates.
    (d) Identification of equipment. The authorized common carrier 
receiving the equipment shall identify equipment operated by it in 
interchange service as follows:
    (1) The authorized common carrier shall identify power units in

operating carrier.
    (2) Unless a copy of the interchange agreement is carried on the 
equipment, the authorized common carrier shall carry a statement with 
each vehicle during interchange service certifying that it is operating 
the equipment. The statement shall also identify the equipment by 
company or State registration number and shall show the specific point 
of interchange, the date and time it assumes responsibility for the

Sec. 377.101  Applicability.

    The rules and regulations in this part apply to the transportation 
by motor vehicle of c.o.d. shipments by all common carriers of property 
subject to 49 U.S.C. 13702, except such transportation which is 
auxiliary to or supplemental of transportation by railroad and performed 
on railroad bills of lading, and except such transportation which is 
performed for freight forwarders and on freight forwarder bills of 
lading.

<R05>
Sec. 377.103  Tariff requirements.

    No common carrier of property subject to the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 
13702, except as otherwise provided in Sec. 377.101, shall render any 
c.o.d. service unless such carrier has published, posted and filed 
tariffs which contain the rates, charges and rules governing such 
service, which rules shall conform to the regulations in this part.

Sec. 377.105  Collection and remittance.

    Every common carrier of property subject to 49 U.S.C. 13702, except 
as otherwise provided in Sec. 377.101, which chooses to provide c.o.d. 
service may publish and maintain, or cause to be published and 
maintained for its account, a tariff or tariffs which set forth 
nondiscriminatory rules governing c.o.d. service and the collection and 
remittance of c.o.d. funds. Alternatively, any carrier that provides 
c.o.d. service, but does not wish to publish and maintain, or cause to 
be published and maintained, its own nondiscriminatory tariff, may adopt 
a rule requiring remittance of each c.o.d. collection directly to the 
consignor or other person designated by the consignor as payee within 
fifteen (15) days after delivery of the c.o.d. shipment to the 
consignee.

<R05>
Sec. 377.201  Scope.

    (a) General. These regulations apply to the extension of credit in 
the transportation of property under Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration regulation by motor carriers and household goods freight 
forwarders, except as otherwise provided.
    (b) Exceptions. These regulations do not apply to--
    (1) Contract carriage operations.
    (2) Transportation for--
    (i) The United States or any department, bureau, or agency thereof,
    (ii) Any State, or political subdivision thereof,
    (iii) The District of Columbia.
    (3) Property transportation incidental to passenger operations.

FR 15424, Apr. 1, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 377.203  Extension of credit to shippers.

    (a) Authorization to extend credit. (1) A carrier that meets the 
requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may--
    (i) Relinquish possession of freight in advance of the payment of 
the tariff charges, and
    (ii) Extend credit in the amount of such charges to those who 
undertake to pay them (such persons are called shippers in this part).
    (2) For such authorization, the carrier shall take reasonable 
actions to assure payment of the tariff charges within the credit 
periods specified--
    (i) In this part, or
    (ii) In tariff provisions published pursuant to the regulations in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) When the credit period begins. The credit period shall begin on 
the day following presentation of the freight bill.
    (c) Length of credit period. Unless a different credit period has 
been established by tariff publication pursuant to paragraph (d) of this 
section, the credit period is 15 days. It includes Saturdays, Sundays, 
and legal holidays.
    (d) Carriers may establish different credit periods in tariff rules. 
Carriers may publish tariff rules establishing credit periods different 
from those in paragraph (c) of this section. Such credit periods shall 
not be longer than 30 calendar days.
    (e) Service charges. (1) Service charges shall not apply when credit 
is extended and payments are made within the standard credit period. The 
term standard credit period, as used in the preceding sentence, means--
    (i) The credit period prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, 
or
    (ii) A substitute credit period published in a tariff rule pursuant 
to the authorization in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) Carriers may, by tariff rule, extend credit for an additional 
time period, subject if they wish to a service charge for that 
additional time. The combined length of the carrier's standard credit 
period (as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section) and its 
additional credit period shall not exceed the 30-day maximum credit 
period prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section. When such a tariff 
rule is in effect, shippers may elect to postpone payment until the end 
of the extended credit period if, in consideration therefor, they 
include any published service charges when making their payment.
    (3) Carriers may, by tariff rule, establish service charges for 
payments made after the expiration of an authorized credit period. Such 
a rule shall--
    (i) Institute such charges on the day following the last day of an 
authorized credit period, and
    (ii) Notify shippers--
    (A) That its only purpose is to prevent a shipper who does not pay 
on time from having free use of funds due to the carrier,
    (B) That it does not sanction payment delays, and
    (C) That failure to pay within the authorized credit period will, 
despite this provision for such charges, continue to require the 
carrier, before again extending credit, to determine in good faith 
whether the shipper will comply

[[Page 133]]

with the credit regulations in the future.
    (4) Tariff rules that establish charges pursuant to paragraph (e) 
(2) or (3) of this section may establish minimum charges.
    (f) Discounts. Carriers may, by tariff rule, authorize discounts for 
early freight bill payments when credit is extended.
    (g)(1) Collection expense charges. Carriers may, by tariff rule, 
assess reasonable and certain liquidated damages for all costs incurred 
in the collection of overdue freight charges. Carriers may use one of 
two methods in their tariffs:
    (i) The first method is to assess liquidated damages as a separate 
additional charge to the unpaid freight bill. In doing so, the tariff 
rule shall disclose the exact amount of the charges by stating either a 
dollar or specified percentage amount (or a combination of both) of the 
unpaid freight bill. The tariff shall further specify the time period 
(which shall at least allow for the authorized credit period) within 
which the shipper must pay to avoid such liquidated damages.
    (ii) The second method is to require payment of the full, 
nondiscounted rate instead of the discounted rate otherwise applicable. 
The difference between the discount and the full rate constitutes a 
carrier's liquidated damages for its collection effort. Under this 
method the tariff shall identify the discount rates that are subject to 
the condition precedent and which require the shipper to make payment by 
a date certain. The date certain may not be set to occur by the carrier 
until at least after the expiration of the carrier's authorized credit 
period.
    (2) The damages, the timing of their applicability, and the 
conditions, if any, as provided by the tariff-rule methods allowed under 
paragraphs (g)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section also:
    (i) Shall be clearly described in the tariff rule;
    (ii) Shall be applied without unlawful prejudice and/or unjust 
discrimination between similarly situated shippers and/or consignees;
    (iii) Shall be applied only to the nonpayment of original, separate 
and independent freight bills and shall not apply to aggregate balance-
due claims sought for collection on past shipments by a bankruptcy 
trustee, or any other person or agent;
    (iv) Shall not apply to instances of clear clerical or ministerial 
error such as non-receipt of a carrier's freight bill, or shipper's 
payment check lost in the mail, or carrier mailing of the freight bill 
to the wrong address;
    (v) Shall not apply in any way to a charge for a transportation 
service if the carrier's bill of lading independently provides that the 
shipper is liable for fees incurred by the carrier in the collection of 
freight charges on that same transportation service;
    (vi) shall be applied only after the authorized credit period, and 
when the carrier has issued a revised freight bill or notice of 
imposition of collection expense charges for late payment within 90 days 
after expiration of the authorized credit period.
    (3) As an alternative to the tariff-rule methods allowed under 
paragraphs (g)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, a carrier may, wholly 
outside of its tariff, assess collection charges though contract terms 
in a bill of lading. By using the carrier and its bill of lading, the 
shipper accepts the bill of lading terms.
    (h) Discrimination prohibited. Tariff rules published pursuant to 
paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section shall not result in 
unreasonable discrimination among shippers.

<R05>
Sec. 377.205  Presentation of freight bills.

    (a) ``To be prepaid'' shipments. (1) On ``to be prepaid'' shipments, 
the carrier shall present its freight bill for all transportation 
charges within the time period prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, except--
    (i) As noted in paragraph (d) of this section, or
    (ii) As otherwise excepted in this part.
    (2) The time period for a carrier to present its freight bill for 
all transportation charges shall be 7 days, measured from the date the 
carrier received the shipment. This time period does not include 
Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays.

[[Page 134]]

    (b) ``Collect'' shipments. (1) On ``collect'' shipments, the carrier 
shall present its freight bill for all transportation charges within the 
time period prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) and of this section, except--
    (i) As noted in paragraph (d) of this section, or
    (ii) As otherwise excepted in this part.
    (2) The time period for a carrier to present its freight bill for 
all transportation charges shall be 7 days, measured from the date the 
shipment was delivered at its destination. This time period does not 
include Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays.
    (c) Bills or accompanying written notices shall state penalties for 
late payment, credit time limits and service charge and/or collection 
expense charge and discount terms. When credit is extended, freight 
bills or a separate written notice accompanying a freight bill or a 
group of freight bills presented at one time shall state that ``failure 
timely to pay freight charges may be subject to tariff penalties'' (or a 
statement of similar import). The bills or other notice shall also state 
the time by which payment must be made and any applicable service charge 
and/or collection expense charge and discount terms.
    (d) When the carrier lacks sufficient information to compute tariff 
charges. (1) When information sufficient to enable the carrier to 
compute the tariff charges is not then available to the carrier at its 
billing point, the carrier shall present its freight bill for payment 
within 7 days following the day upon which sufficient information 
becomes available at the billing point. This time period does not 
include Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays.
    (2) A carrier shall not extend further credit to any shipper which 
fails to furnish sufficient information to allow the carrier to render a 
freight bill within a reasonable time after the shipment is tendered to 
the origin carrier.
    (3) As used in this paragraph, the term ``shipper'' includes, but is 
not limited to, freight forwarders, and shippers' associations and 
shippers' agents.

<R05>
Sec. 377.207  Effect of mailing freight bills or payments.

    (a) Presentation of freight bills by mail. When carriers present 
freight bills by mail, the time of mailing shall be deemed to be the 
time of presentation of the bills. The term freight bills, as used in 
this paragraph, includes both paper documents and billing by use of 
electronic media such as computer tapes or disks, when the mails are 
used to transmit them.
    (b) Payment by mail. Wnen shippers mail acceptable checks, drafts, 
or money orders in payment of freight charges, the act of mailing them 
within the credit period shall be deemed to be the collection of the 
tariff charges within the credit period for the purposes of the 
regulations in this part.
    (c) Disputes as to date of mailing. In case of dispute as to the 
date of mailing, the postmark shall be accepted as such date.


<R05>
Sec. 377.209  Additional charges.

    When a carrier--
    (a) Has collected the amount of tariff charges represented in a 
freight bill presented by it as the total amount of such charges, and
    (b) Thereafter presents to the shipper another freight bill for 
additional charges--

the carrier may extend credit in the amount of such additional charges 
for a period of 30 calendar days from the date of the presentation of 
the freight bill for the additional charges.


<R05>
Sec. 377.211  Computation of time.

    Time periods involving calendar days shall be calculated pursuant to

filing a request with a carrier for the refund of an overcharge, 
duplicate payment, or overcollection.

<R05>
Sec. 378.3  Filing and processing claims.

    (a) A claim for overcharge, duplicate payment, or overcollection 
shall not be paid unless filed in writing or electronically communicated 
(when agreed to by the carrier and shipper or receiver involved) with 
the carrier that collected the transportation charges. The collecting 
carrier shall be the carrier to process all such claims. When a claim is 
filed with another carrier that participated in the transportation, that 
carrier shall transmit the claim to the collecting carrier within 15 
days after receipt of the claim. If the collecting carrier is unable to 
dispose of the claim for any reason, the claim may be filed with or 
transferred to any participating carrier for final disposition.
    (b) A single claim may include more than one shipment provided the 
claim on each shipment involves:
    (1) The same tariff issue or authority or circumstances,

<R05>
Sec. 378.4  Documentation of claims.

    (a) Claims for overcharge, duplicate payment, or overcollection 
shall be accompanied by sufficient information to allow the carriers to 
conduct an investigation and pay or decline the claim within the time 
limitations set forth in Sec. 378.8. Claims shall include the name of 
the claimant, its file number, if any, and the amount of the refund 
sought to be recovered, if known.
    (b) Except when the original freight bill is not a paper document 
but is electronically transmitted, claims for overcharge shall be 
accompanied by the original freight bill. Additional information may 
include, but is not limited to, the following:
    (1) The rate, classification, or commodity description or weight 
claimed to have been applicable.
    (2) Complete tariff authority for the rate, classification, or 
commodity description claimed.
    (3) Freight bill payment information.
    (4) Other documents or data which is believed by claimant to 
substantiate the basis for its claim.
    (c) Claims for duplicate payment and overcollection shall be 
accompanied by the original freight bill(s) for which charges were paid 
(except when the original freight bill is not a paper document but is 
electronically transmitted) and by freight bill payment information.
    (d) Regardless of the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of 
this section, the failure to provide sufficient information and 
documentation to allow a carrier to conduct an investigation and pay or 
decline the claim within the allowable time limitation shall not 
constitute grounds for disallowance of the claim. Rather, the carrier 
shall comply with Sec. 378.5(c) to obtain the additional information 
required.
    (e) A carrier shall accept copies instead of the orginal documents 
required to be submitted in this section where the carrier is furnished 
with an agreement entered into by the claimant which indemnifies the 
carrier for subsequent duplicate claims which might be filed and 
supported by the original documents.

Sec. 378.5  Investigation of claims.

    (a) Upon receipt of a claim, whether written or otherwise, the 
processing carrier shall promptly initiate an investigation and 
establish a file, as required by Sec. 378.6.
    (b) If a carrier discovers an overcharge, duplicate payment, or 
overcollection which has not been the subject of a claim, it shall 
promptly initiate an investigation and comply with the provisions in 
Sec. 378.9.
    (c) In the event the carrier processing the claim requires 
information or documents in addition to that submitted with the claim, 
the carrier shall promptly notify the claimant and request the 
information required. This includes notifying the claimant that a 
written or electronically transmitted claim must be filed before the 
carrier becomes subject to the time limits for settling such a claim 
under Sec. 378.8.

<R05>
Sec. 378.6  Claim records.

    At the time a claim is received the carrier shall create a separate 
file and assign it a successive claim file number and note that number 
on all documents filed in support of the claim and all records and 
correspondence with respect to the claim, including the written or 
electronic acknowledgment of receipt required under Sec. 378.7. If 
pertinent to the disposition of the claim, the carrier shall also note 
that number on the shipping order and delivery receipt, if any, covering 
the shipment involved.

<R05>
Sec. 378.7  Acknowledgment of claims.

    Upon receipt of a written or electronically transmitted claim, the 
carrier shall acknowledge its receipt in

[[Page 137]]

writing or electronically to the claimant within 30 days after the date 
of receipt except when the carrier shall have paid or declined in 
writing or electronically within that period. The carrier shall include 
the date of receipt in its written or electronic claim which shall be 
placed in the file for that claim.

<R05>
Sec. 378.8  Disposition of claims.

    The processing carrier shall pay, decline to pay, or settle each 
written or electronically communicated claim within 60 days after its 
receipt by that carrier, except where the claimant and the carrier agree 
in writing or electronically to a specific extension based upon 
extenuating circumstances. If the carrier declines to pay a claim or 
makes settlement in an amount different from that sought, the carrier 
shall notify the claimant in writing or electronically, of the reason(s) 
for its action, citing tariff authority or other pertinent information 
developed as a result of its investigation.

[47 FR 12804, Mar. 25, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 378.9  Disposition of unidentified payments, overcharges, duplicate 
payments, and overcollections not supported by claims.

    (a)(1) Carriers shall establish procedures for identifying and 
properly applying all unidentified payments. If a carrier does not have 
sufficient information with which properly to apply such a payment, the 
carrier shall notify the payor of the unidentified payment within 60 
days of receipt of the payment and request information which will enable 
it to identify the payment. If the carrier does not receive the 
information requested within 90 days from the date of the notice, the 
carrier may treat the unidentified payment as a payment in fact of 
freight charges owing to it. Following the 90-day period, the regular 
claims procedure under this part shall be applicable.
    (2) Notice shall be in writing and clearly indicate that it is a 
final notice and not a bill. Notice shall include: The check number, 
amount, and date; the payor's name; and any additional basic information 
the carrier is able to provide. The final notice also must inform payor 
that: (i) Applicable regulations allow the carrier to conditionally 
retain the payment as revenue in the absence of a timely response by the 
payor; and (ii) following the 90-day period the regular claims procedure 
shall be applicable.
    (3) Upon a carrier's receipt of information from the payor, the 
carrier shall, within 14 days: (i) Make a complete refund of such funds 
to the payor; or (ii) notify the payor that the information supplied is 
not sufficient to identify the unapplied payment and request additional 
information; or (iii) notify the payor of the carrier's determination 
that such payment was applicable to particular freight charges lawfully 
due the carrier. Where no refund is made by the carrier, the carrier 
shall advise the payor of its right to file a formal claim for refund 
with the carrier in accordance with the regular claims procedure under 
this part.
    (b) When a carrier which participates in a transportation movement, 
but did not collect the transporation charges, finds that an overpayment 
has been made, that carrier shall immediately notify the collecting 
carrier. When the collecting carrier (when single or joint line haul) 
discovers or is notified by such a participating carrier that an 
overcharge, duplicate payment, or overcollection exists for any 
tranportation charge which has not been the subject of a claim, the 
carrier shall create a file as if a claim had been submitted and shall 
record in the file the date it discovered or was notified of the 
overpayment. The carrier that collected the charges shall then refund 
the amount of the overpayment to the person who paid the transportation 
charges or to the person that made duplicate payment within 30 days from 
the date of such discovery or notification.

<R05>
Sec. 379.3  Records required to be retained.

    Companies subject to this part shall retain records for the minimum 
retention periods provided in appendix A to this part. After the 
required retention periods, the records may be destroyed at the 
discretion of each company's management. It shall be the obligation of 
the subject company to maintain records that adequately support 
financial and operational data required by the Secretary. The company 
may request a ruling from the Secretary on the retention of any record. 
The provisions of this part shall not be construed as excusing 
compliance with the lawful requirements of any other governmental body 
prescribing longer retention periods for any category of records.


<R05>
Sec. 379.5  Protection and storage of records.

    (a) The company shall protect records subject to this part from 
fires, floods, and other hazards, and safeguard the records from 
unnecessary exposure to deterioration from excessive humidity, dryness, 
or lack of ventilation.
    (b) The company shall notify the Secretary if prescribed records are 
substantially destroyed or damaged before the term of the prescribed 
retention periods.


<R05>
Sec. 379.7  Preservation of records.

    (a) All records may be preserved by any technology that is immune to 
alteration, modification, or erasure of the underlying data and will 
enable production of an accurate and unaltered paper copy.
    (b) Records not originally preserved on hard copy shall be 
accompanied by a statement executed by a person having personal 
knowledge of the facts indicating the type of data included within the 
records. One comprehensive statement may be executed in lieu of 
individual statements for multiple records if the type of data included 
in the multiple records is common to all such records. The records shall 
be indexed and retained in such a manner as will render them readily 
accessible. The company shall have facilities available to locate, 
identify and produce legible paper copies of the records.
    (c) Any significant characteristic, feature or other attribute that 
a particular medium will not preserve shall be clearly indicated at the 
beginning of the applicable records as appropriate.
    (d) The printed side of forms, such as instructions, need not be 
preserved for each record as long as the printed matter is common to all 
such forms and an identified specimen of the form is maintained on the 
medium for reference.


<R05>
Sec. 379.9  Companies going out of business.

    The records referred to in the regulations in this part may be 
destroyed after business is discontinued and the company is completely 
liquidated. The records may not be destroyed until dissolution is final 
and all pending transactions and claims are completed. When a company is 
merged with another company under jurisdiction of the Secretary, the 
successor company shall preserve records of the merged

[[Page 139]]

company in accordance with the regulations in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 379.11  Waiver of requirements of the regulations in this part.

    A waiver from any provision of the regulations in this part may be 
made by the Secretary upon his/her own initiative or upon submission of 
a written request by the company. Each request for waiver shall 
demonstrate that unusual circumstances warrant a departure from 
prescribed retention periods, procedures, or techniques, or that 
compliance with such prescribed requirements would impose an 
unreasonable burden on the company.


<R05>

commerce, employers of such persons, and LCV driver-instructors.


<R05>
Sec. 380.105  Definitions.

    (a) The definitions in part 383 of this subchapter apply to this 
part, except where otherwise specifically noted.
    (b) As used in this part:
    Classroom instructor means a qualified LCV driver-instructor who 
provides knowledge instruction that does not involve the actual 
operation of a longer combination vehicle or its components. Instruction 
may take place in a parking lot, garage, or any other facility suitable 
for instruction.
    Longer combination vehicle (LCV) means any combination of a truck-
tractor and two or more trailers or semi-trailers, which operate on the 
National System of Interstate and Defense Highways with a gross vehicle 
weight (GVW) greater than 36,288 kilograms (80,000 pounds).
    LCV Double means an LCV consisting of a truck-tractor in combination 
with two trailers and/or semi-trailers.
    LCV Triple means an LCV consisting of a truck-tractor in combination 
with three trailers and/or semi-trailers.
    Qualified LCV driver-instructor means an instructor meeting the 
requirements contained in subpart C of this part. There are two types of 
qualified LCV driver-instructors: (1) classroom instructor and (2) 
skills instructor.
    Skills instructor means a qualified LCV driver-instructor who 
provides behind-the-wheel instruction involving the actual operation of 
a longer combination vehicle or its components outside a classroom.
    Training institution means any technical or vocational school 
accredited by an accrediting institution recognized by the U.S. 
Department of Education. A motor carrier's training program for its 
drivers or an entity that exclusively offers services to a single motor 
carrier is not a training institution.


<R05>
Sec. 380.107  General requirements.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 380.111, a driver who wishes to 
operate an LCV shall first take and successfully complete an LCV driver-
training program that provides the knowledge and skills necessary to 
operate an LCV. The specific types of knowledge and skills that a 
training program shall include are outlined in the appendix to this 
part.
    (b) Before a person receives training:
    (1) That person shall present evidence to the LCV driver-instructor 
showing that he/she meets the general requirements set forth in subpart 
B of this part for the specific type of LCV training to be taken.
    (2) The LCV driver-instructor shall verify that each trainee 
applicant meets the general requirements for the specific type of LCV 
training to be taken.
    (c) Upon successful completion of the training requirement, the 
driver-student shall be issued an LCV Driver Training Certificate by a 
certifying official of the training entity in accordance with the 
requirements specified in subpart D of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 380.109  Driver testing.

    (a) Testing methods. The driver-student must pass knowledge and 
skills tests in accordance with the following requirements, to determine 
whether a driver-student has successfully completed an LCV driver-
training program as specified in subpart B of this part. The written 
knowledge test may be administered by any qualified driver-instructor. 
The skills tests, based on actual operation of an LCV, must be 
administered by a qualified LCV skills instructor.
    (1) All tests shall be constructed to determine if the driver-
student possesses the required knowledge and skills set forth in the 
appendix to this part for the specific type of LCV training program 
being taught.
    (2) Instructors shall develop their own tests for the specific type 
of LCV-training program being taught, but those tests must be at least 
as stringent as the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (3) LCV driver-instructors shall establish specific methods for 
scoring the knowledge and skills tests.
    (4) Passing scores must meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of 
this section.

[[Page 144]]

both theoretical and behind-the-wheel instruction, and include at least 
one question from each of the units listed in the table to the appendix 
to this part, for the specific type of LCV training program being 
taught.
    (7) Each skills test shall include all the maneuvers and operations 
practiced during the Proficiency Development unit of instruction 
(behind-the-wheel instruction), as described in the appendix to this 
part, for the specific type of LCV training program being taught.
    (b) Proficiency determinations. The driver-student must meet the 
following conditions to be certified as an LCV driver:
    (1) Answer correctly at least 80 percent of the questions on each 
knowledge test; and
    (2) Demonstrate that he/she can successfully perform all of the 
skills addressed in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
    (c) Automatic test failure. Failure to obey traffic laws or 
involvement in a preventable crash during the skills portion of the test 
will result in automatic failure. Automatic test failure determinations 
are made at the sole discretion of the qualified LCV driver-instructor.
    (d) Guidance for testing methods and proficiency determinations. 
Motor carriers should refer to the Examiner's Manual for Commercial 
Driver's License Tests for help in developing testing methods and making 
proficiency determinations. You may obtain a copy of this document by 
contacting the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators 
(AAMVA), 4300 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 400, Arlington, Virginia 22203.

                         Section 1--Orientation

    The units in this section must provide an orientation to the 
training curriculum and must cover the role LCVs play within the motor 
carrier industry, the factors that affect their operations, and the role 
that drivers play in the safe operation of LCVs.
    Unit 1.1--LCVs in Trucking. This unit must provide an introduction 
to the emergence of LCVs in trucking and must serve as an orientation to 
the course content. Emphasis must be placed upon the role the driver 
plays in transportation.
    Unit 1.2--Regulatory factors. This unit must provide instruction 
addressing the Federal, State, and local governmental bodies that 
propose, enact, and implement the laws, rules, and regulations that 
affect the trucking industry. Emphasis must be placed on those 
regulatory factors that affect LCVs, including 23 CFR 658.23 and 
Appendix C to part 658.
    Unit 1.3--Driver qualifications. This unit must provide classroom 
instruction addressing the Federal and State laws, rules, and 
regulations that define LCV driver qualifications. It also must include 
a discussion on medical examinations, drug and alcohol tests, 
certification, and basic health and wellness issues. Emphasis must be 
placed upon topics essential to physical and mental health maintenance, 
including (1) diet, (2) exercise, (3) avoidance of alcohol and drug 
abuse, and caution in the use of prescription and nonprescription drugs, 
(4) the adverse effects of driver fatigue, and (5) effective fatigue 
countermeasures. Driver-trainees who have successfully completed the 
Entry-level training segments at Sec. 380.503(a) and (c) are considered 
to have satisfied the requirements of Unit 1.3.
    Unit 1.4--Vehicle configuration factors. This unit must provide 
classroom instruction addressing the key vehicle components used in the 
configuration of longer combination vehicles. It also must familiarize 
the driver-trainee with various vehicle combinations, as well as provide 
instruction about unique characteristics and factors associated with LCV 
configurations.

                       Section 2--Basic Operation

    The units in this section must cover the interaction between the 
driver and the vehicle. They must teach driver-trainees how to couple 
and uncouple LCVs, ensure the vehicles are in proper operating 
condition, and control the motion of LCVs under various road and traffic 
conditions.
    During the driving exercises at off-highway locations required by 
this section, the driver-trainee must first familiarize himself/herself 
with basic operating characteristics of an LCV. Utilizing an LCV, 
students must be able to perform the skills learned in each unit to a 
level of proficiency required to permit safe transition to on-street 
driving.
    Unit 2.1--Coupling and uncoupling. This unit must provide 
instruction addressing the procedures for coupling and uncoupling LCVs. 
While vehicle coupling and uncoupling procedures are common to all 
truck-tractor/semi-trailer operations, some factors are peculiar to 
LCVs. Emphasis must be placed upon preplanning and safe operating 
procedures.
    Unit 2.2--Basic control and handling. This unit must provide an 
introduction to basic vehicular control and handling as it applies

[[Page 151]]

to LCVs. This must include instruction addressing brake performance, 
handling characteristics and factors affecting LCV stability while 
braking, turning, and cornering. Emphasis must be placed upon safe 
operating procedures.
    Unit 2.3--Basic maneuvers. This unit must provide instruction 
addressing the basic vehicular maneuvers that will be encountered by LCV 
drivers. This must include instruction relative to backing, lane 
positioning and path selection, merging situations, and parking LCVs. 
Emphasis must be placed upon safe operating procedures as they apply to 
brake performance and directional stability while accelerating, braking, 
merging, cornering, turning, and parking.
    Unit 2.4--Turning, steering, and tracking. This unit must provide 
instruction addressing turning situations, steering maneuvers, and the 
tracking of LCV trailers. This must include instruction related to 
trailer sway and off-tracking. Emphasis must be placed on maintaining 
directional stability.
    Unit 2.5--Proficiency development: basic operations. The purpose of 
this unit is to enable driver-students to gain the proficiency in basic 
operation needed to safely undertake on-street instruction in the Safe 
Operations Practices section of the curriculum.
    The activities of this unit must consist of driving exercises that 
provide practice for the development of basic control skills and mastery 
of basic maneuvers. Driver-students practice skills and maneuvers 
learned in the Basic Control and Handling; Basic Maneuvers; and Turning, 
Steering and Tracking units. A series of basic exercises is practiced at 
off-highway locations until students develop sufficient proficiency for 
transition to on-street driving.
    Once the driver-student's skills have been measured and found 
adequate, the driver-student must be allowed to move to on-the-street 
driving.
    Nearly all activity in this unit will take place on the driving 
range or on streets or roads that have low-density traffic conditions.

                   Section 3--Safe Operating Practices

    The units in this section must cover the interaction between student 
drivers, the vehicle, and the traffic environment. They must teach 
driver-students how to apply their basic operating skills in a way that 
ensures their safety and that of other road users under various road, 
weather, and traffic conditions.
    Unit 3.1--Interacting with traffic. This unit must provide 
instruction addressing the principles of visual search, communication, 
and sharing the road with other traffic. Emphasis must be placed upon 
visual search, mirror usage, signaling and/or positioning the vehicle to 
communicate, and understanding the special situations encountered by LCV 
drivers in various traffic situations.
    Unit 3.2--Speed and space management. This unit must provide 
instruction addressing the principles of speed and space management. 
Emphasis must be placed upon maintaining safe vehicular speed and 
appropriate space surrounding the vehicle under various traffic and road 
conditions. Particular attention must be placed upon understanding the 
special situations encountered by LCVs in various traffic situations.
    Unit 3.3--Night operations. This unit must provide instruction 
addressing the principles of Night Operations. Emphasis must be placed 
upon the factors affecting operation of LCVs at night. Night driving 
presents specific factors that require special attention on the part of 
the driver. Changes in vehicle safety inspection, vision, 
communications, speed management, and space management are needed to 
deal with the special problems night driving presents.
    Unit 3.4--Extreme driving conditions. This unit must provide 
instruction addressing the driving of LCVs under extreme driving 
conditions. Emphasis must be placed upon the factors affecting the 
operation of LCVs in cold, hot, and inclement weather and in the 
mountains and desert. Changes in basic driving habits are needed to deal 
with the specific problems presented by these extreme driving 
conditions.
    Unit 3.5--Security issues. This unit must include a discussion of 
security requirements imposed by the Department of Homeland Security, 
Transportation Security Administration; the U.S. Department of 
Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration; and any 
other State or Federal agency with responsibility for highway or motor 
carrier security.
    Unit 3.6--Proficiency development. This unit must provide driver-
students an opportunity to refine, within the on-street traffic 
environment, their vehicle handling skills learned in the first three 
sections. Driver-student performance progress must be closely monitored 
to determine when the level of proficiency required for carrying out the 
basic traffic maneuvers of stopping, turning, merging, straight driving, 
curves, lane changing, passing, driving on hills, driving through 
traffic restrictions, and parking has been attained. The driver-student 
must also be assessed for regulatory compliance with all traffic laws.
    Nearly all activity in this unit will take place on public roadways 
in a full range of traffic environments applicable to this vehicle 
configuration. This must include urban and rural uncontrolled roadways, 
expressways or freeways, under light, moderate, and heavy traffic 
conditions. There must be a brief classroom session to familiarize 
driver-

[[Page 152]]

students with the type of on-street maneuvers they will perform and how 
their performance will be rated.
    The instructor must assess the level of skill development of the 
driver-student and must increase in difficulty, based upon the level of 
skill attained, the types of maneuvers, roadways and traffic conditions 
to which the driver-student is exposed.

                     Section 4--Advanced Operations

    The units in this section must introduce higher level skills that 
can be acquired only after the more fundamental skills and knowledge 
taught in sections two and three have been mastered. They must teach the 
perceptual skills necessary to recognize potential hazards, and must 
demonstrate the procedures needed to handle an LCV when faced with a 
hazard.
    The Maintenance and Trouble-shooting Unit must provide instruction 
that addresses how to keep the vehicle in safe and efficient operating 
condition. The purpose of this unit is to teach the correct way to 
perform simple maintenance tasks, and how to troubleshoot and report 
those vehicle discrepancies or deficiencies that must be repaired by a 
qualified mechanic.
    Unit 4.1--Hazard perception. This unit must provide instruction 
addressing the principles of recognizing hazards in sufficient time to 
reduce the severity of the hazard and neutralize a possible emergency 
situation. While hazards are present in all motor vehicle traffic 
operations, some are peculiar to LCV operations. Emphasis must be placed 
upon hazard recognition, visual search, and response to possible 
emergency-producing situations encountered by LCV drivers in various 
traffic situations.
    Unit 4.2--Hazardous situations. This unit must address dealing with 
specific procedures appropriate for LCV emergencies. These must include 
evasive steering, emergency braking, off-road recovery, brake failures, 
tire blowouts, rearward amplification, hydroplaning, skidding, 
jackknifing and the rollover phenomenon. The discussion must include a 
review of unsafe acts and the role they play in producing hazardous 
situations.
    Unit 4.3--Maintenance and trouble-shooting. This unit must introduce 
driver-students to the basic servicing and checking procedures for the 
various vehicle components and provide knowledge of conducting 
preventive maintenance functions, making simple emergency repairs, and 
diagnosing and reporting vehicle malfunctions.

                    Section 5--Non-Driving Activities

    The units in this section must cover activities that are not 
directly related to the vehicle itself but must be performed by an LCV 
driver. The units in this section must ensure these activities are 
performed in a manner that ensures the safety of the driver, vehicle, 
cargo, and other road users.
    Unit 5.1--Routes and trip planning. This unit must address the 
importance of and requirements for planning routes and trips. This must 
include classroom discussion of Federal and State requirements for a 
number of topics including permits, vehicle size and weight limitations, 
designated highways, local access, the reasonable access rule, staging 
areas, and access zones.
    Unit 5.2--Cargo and weight considerations. This unit must address 
the importance of proper cargo documentation, loading, securing and 
unloading cargo, weight distribution, load sequencing and trailer 
placement. Emphasis must be placed on the importance of axle weight 
distribution, as well as on trailer placement and its effect on vehicle

<R05>
Sec. 381.305  How do I determine when I may apply for an exemption?

    (a) You may apply for an exemption if one or more FMCSR prevents you 
from implementing more efficient or effective operations that would 
maintain a level of safety equivalent to, or greater than, the level 
achieved without the exemption.
    (b) Before you decide to apply for an exemption you should carefully 
review the regulation to determine whether there are any practical 
alternatives already available that would allow you to conduct your 
motor carrier operations. You should also determine whether you need an 
exemption from all of the requirements in one or more parts of the 
regulations, or whether a more limited exemption from certain sections 
within one or more parts of the regulations would provide an acceptable 
level of regulatory relief. For example, if you need regulatory relief 
from one of the recordkeeping requirements concerning driver 
qualifications, you should not request regulatory relief from all of the 
requirements of part 391.

Sec. 381.405  Who determines whether a pilot program should be initiated?

    (a) Generally, pilot programs are initiated by the FMCSA when the 
agency determines that there may be an effective alternative to one or 
more of the requirements in the FMCSRs, but does not have sufficient 
research data to support the development of a notice of proposed 
rulemaking to change the regulation.
    (b) You may request the FMCSA to initiate a pilot program. However, 
the decision of whether to propose a pilot program will be made at the 
discretion of the FMCSA. The FMCSA is not required to publish a notice 
in the Federal Register requesting public comment on your ideas or 
suggestions for pilot programs.


<R05>
Sec. 381.410  What may I do if I have an idea or suggestion for a pilot 
program?

program, if there are motor carriers that have expressed

[[Page 158]]

an interest in participating in the program;
    (3) Principal place of business for the motor carrier (street 
address, city, State, and zip code); and
    (4) The USDOT identification number for the motor carrier.
    (c) You should provide a written statement that:
    (1) Presents your estimate of the potential benefits to the motor 
carrier industry, the FMCSA, and the general public if the pilot program 
is conducted, and describes how you developed your estimate;
    (2) Estimates of the amount of time that would be needed to conduct 
the pilot program (e.g., the time needed to complete the collection and 
analysis of data);
    (3) Identifies the regulation from which the participants would need 
to be exempted;
    (4) Recommends a reasonable number of participants necessary to 
yield statistically valid findings;
    (5) Provides ideas or suggestions for a monitoring plan to ensure 
that participants comply with the terms and conditions of participation;
    (6) Provides ideas or suggestions for a plan to protect the health 
and safety of study participants and the general public.
    (7) Assesses the safety impacts the pilot program exemption may 
have; and
    (8) Provides recommendations on how the safety measures in the pilot 
project would be designed to achieve a level a safety that is equivalent 
to, or greater than, the level of safety that would be obtained by 
complying with the regulation.

<R05>
Sec. 381.420  What will the FMCSA do after the agency receives my 
suggestion for a pilot program?

    (a) The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration will review your 
suggestion for a pilot program and make a recommendation to the 
Administrator. The final decision whether to propose the development of 
a pilot program based upon your recommendation will be made by the 
Administrator.
    (b) You will be sent a copy of the Administrator's decision. If the 
pilot program is approved, the agency will follow the administrative 
procedures contained in subpart E of this part.


<R04>
         Subpart E_Administrative Procedures for Pilot Programs


<R05>
Sec. 381.500  What are the general requirements the agency must satisfy 
in conducting a pilot program?

    (a) The FMCSA may conduct pilot programs to evaluate alternatives to 
regulations, or innovative approaches, concerning motor carrier, CMV, 
and driver safety.
    (b) Pilot programs may include exemptions from the regulations 
listed in Sec. 381.400(f) of this part.
    (c) Pilot programs must, at a minimum, include all of the program 
elements listed in Sec. 381.505.
    (d) The FMCSA will publish in the Federal Register a detailed 
description of each pilot program, including the exemptions to be 
considered, and provide notice and an opportunity for public comment 
before the effective date of the pilot program.


<R05>
Sec. 381.505  What are the minimum elements required for a pilot program?

    (a) Safety measures. Before granting exemptions for a pilot program, 
the FMCSA will ensure that the safety measures in a pilot program are 
designed to achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater 
than, the level of safety that would be achieved by complying with the 
regulations.
    (b) Pilot program plan. Before initiating a pilot program, the FMCSA 
will ensure that there is a pilot program plan which includes the 
following elements:
    (1) A scheduled duration of three years or less;

[[Page 159]]

    (2) A specific data collection and safety analysis plan that 
identifies a method of comparing the safety performance for motor 
carriers, CMVs, and drivers operating under the terms and conditions of 
the pilot program, with the safety performance of motor carriers, CMVs, 
and drivers that comply with the regulation;
    (3) A reasonable number of participants necessary to yield 
statistically valid findings;
    (4) A monitoring plan to ensure that participants comply with the 
terms and conditions of participation in the pilot program;
    (5) Adequate safeguards to protect the health and safety of study 
participants and the general public; and
    (6) A plan to inform the States and the public about the pilot 
program and to identify approved participants to enforcement personnel 
and the general public.


<R05>
Sec. 381.510  May the FMCSA end a pilot program before its scheduled 
completion date?

    The FMCSA will immediately terminate a pilot program if there is 
reason to believe the program is not achieving a level of safety that is 
at least equivalent to the level of safety that would be achieved by 
complying with the regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 381.515  May the FMCSA remove approved participants from a pilot 
program?

    The Administrator will immediately revoke participation in a pilot 
program of a motor carrier, CMV, or driver for failure to comply with 
the terms and conditions of the pilot program, or if continued 
participation is inconsistent with the goals and objectives of the 
safety regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 381.520  What will the FMCSA do with the results from a pilot 
program?

    At the conclusion of each pilot program, the FMCSA will report to 
Congress the findings and conclusions of the program and any 
recommendations it considers appropriate, including suggested amendments 
to laws and regulations that would enhance motor carrier, CMV, and 
driver safety and improve compliance with the FMCSRs.


<R04>
                   Subpart F_Preemption of State Rules


<R05>
Sec. 381.600  Do waivers, exemptions, and pilot programs preempt State 
laws and regulations?

    Yes. During the time period that a waiver, exemption, or pilot 
program authorized by this part is in effect, no State shall enforce any 
law or regulation that conflicts with or is inconsistent with the 
waiver, exemption, or pilot program with respect to a person operating 
under the waiver or exemption or participating in the pilot program.

Sec. 382.121  Employee admission of alcohol and controlled substances use.

    (a) Employees who admit to alcohol misuse or controlled substances 
use are not subject to the referral, evaluation and treatment 
requirements of this part and part 40 of this title, provided that:
    (1) The admission is in accordance with a written employer-
established voluntary self-identification program or policy that meets 
the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section;
    (2) The driver does not self-identify in order to avoid testing 
under the requirements of this part;
    (3) The driver makes the admission of alcohol misuse or controlled 
substances use prior to performing a safety sensitive function (i.e., 
prior to reporting for duty); and
    (4) The driver does not perform a safety sensitive function until 
the employer is satisfied that the employee has been evaluated and has 
successfully completed education or treatment requirements in accordance 
with the self-identification program guidelines.

[[Page 165]]

    (b) A qualified voluntary self-identification program or policy must 
contain the following elements:
    (1) It must prohibit the employer from taking adverse action against 
an employee making a voluntary admission of alcohol misuse or controlled 
substances use within the parameters of the program or policy and 
paragraph (a) of this section;

    (d)(1) Alcohol tests. If a test required by this section is not 
administered within two hours following the accident, the employer shall 
prepare and maintain on file a record stating the reasons the test was 
not promptly administered. If a test required by this section is not 
administered within eight hours following the accident, the employer 
shall cease attempts to administer an alcohol test and shall prepare and 
maintain the same record.

[[Page 168]]

Records shall be submitted to the FMCSA upon request.
    (2) Controlled substance tests. If a test required by this section 
is not administered within 32 hours following the accident, the employer 
shall cease attempts to administer a controlled substances test, and 
prepare and maintain on file a record stating the reasons the test was 
not promptly administered. Records shall be submitted to the FMCSA upon 
request.
    (e) A driver who is subject to post-accident testing shall remain 
readily available for such testing or may be deemed by the employer to 
have refused to submit to testing. Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to require the delay of necessary medical attention for 
injured people following an accident or to prohibit a driver from 
leaving the scene of an accident for the period necessary to obtain 
assistance in responding to the accident, or to obtain necessary 
emergency medical care.
    (f) An employer shall provide drivers with necessary post-accident 
information, procedures and instructions, prior to the driver operating 
a commercial motor vehicle, so that drivers will be able to comply with 
the requirements of this section.
    (g)(1) The results of a breath or blood test for the use of alcohol, 
conducted by Federal, State, or local officials having independent 
authority for the test, shall be considered to meet the requirements of 
this section, provided such tests conform to the applicable Federal, 
State or local alcohol testing requirements, and that the results of the 
tests are obtained by the employer.
    (2) The results of a urine test for the use of controlled 
substances, conducted by Federal, State, or local officials having 
independent authority for the test, shall be considered to meet the

passengers for hire or hazardous materials of a type and quantity that 
require the motor vehicle to be marked or placarded in accordance with 
Sec. 177.823 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 382.305  Random testing.

    (a) Every employer shall comply with the requirements of this 
section. Every driver shall submit to random alcohol and controlled 
substance testing as required in this section.
    (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this 
section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing 
shall be 10 percent of the average number of driver positions.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (f) through (h) of this 
section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random controlled 
substances testing shall be 50 percent of the average number of driver 
positions.
    (c) The FMCSA Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the 
minimum annual percentage rate for alcohol testing is based on the 
reported violation rate for the entire industry. All information used 
for this determination is drawn from the alcohol management information 
system reports required by Sec. 382.403. In order to ensure reliability 
of the data, the FMCSA Administrator considers the quality and 
completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional information or 
reports from employers, and may make appropriate modifications in 
calculating the industry violation rate. In the event of a change in the 
annual percentage rate, the FMCSA Administrator will publish in the 
Federal Register the new minimum annual percentage rate for random 
alcohol testing of drivers. The new minimum annual percentage rate for 
random alcohol testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the 
calendar year following publication in the Federal Register.

[[Page 169]]

    (d)(1) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 25 percent or more, the FMCSA Administrator may lower this 
rate to 10 percent of all driver positions if the FMCSA Administrator 
determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of 
Sec. 382.403 for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the 
violation rate is less than 0.5 percent.
    (2) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 50 percent, the FMCSA Administrator may lower this rate to 25 
percent of all driver positions if the FMCSA Administrator determines 
that the data received under the reporting requirements of Sec. 382.403 
for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is 
less than 1.0 percent but equal to or greater than 0.5 percent.
    (e)(1) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 10 percent, and the data received under the reporting 
requirements of Sec. 382.403 for that calendar year indicate that the 
violation rate is equal to or greater than 0.5 percent, but less than 
1.0 percent, the FMCSA Administrator will increase the minimum annual 
percentage rate for random alcohol testing to 25 percent for all driver 
positions.
    (2) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol 
testing is 25 percent or less, and the data received under the reporting 
requirements of Sec. 382.403 for that calendar year indicate that the 
violation rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the FMCSA 
Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for 
random alcohol testing to 50 percent for all driver positions.
    (f) The FMCSA Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the 
minimum annual percentage rate for controlled substances testing is 
based on the reported positive rate for the entire industry. All 
information used for this determination is drawn from the controlled 
substances management information system reports required by Sec. 
382.403. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the FMCSA 
Administrator considers the quality and completeness of the reported 
data, may obtain additional information or reports from employers, and 
may make appropriate modifications in calculating the industry positive 
rate. In the event of a change in the annual percentage rate, the FMCSA 
Administrator will publish in the Federal Register the new minimum 
annual percentage rate for controlled substances testing of drivers. The 
new minimum annual percentage rate for random controlled substances 
testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year 
following publication in the Federal Register.
    (g) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random controlled 
substances testing is 50 percent, the FMCSA Administrator may lower this 
rate to 25 percent of all driver positions if the FMCSA Administrator 
determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of 
Sec. 382.403 for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the 
positive rate is less than 1.0 percent.
    (h) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random controlled 
substances testing is 25 percent, and the data received under the 
reporting requirements of Sec. 382.403 for any calendar year indicate 
that the reported positive rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, 
the FMCSA Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate 
for random controlled substances testing to 50 percent of all driver 
positions.
    (i)(1) The selection of drivers for random alcohol and controlled 
substances testing shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such 
as a random number table or a computer-based random number generator 
that is matched with drivers' Social Security numbers, payroll 
identification numbers, or other comparable identifying numbers.
    (2) Each driver selected for random alcohol and controlled 
substances testing under the selection process used, shall have an equal 
chance of being tested each time selections are made.
    (3) Each driver selected for testing shall be tested during the 
selection period.
    (j)(1)To calculate the total number of covered drivers eligible for 
random testing throughout the year, as an employer, you must add the 
total number of covered drivers eligible for testing

[[Page 170]]

during each random testing period for the year and divide that total by 
the number of random testing periods. Covered employees, and only 
covered employees, are to be in an employer's random testing pool, and 
all covered drivers must be in the random pool. If you are an employer 
conducting random testing more often than once per month (e.g., daily, 
weekly, bi-weekly) you do not need to compute this total number of 
covered drivers rate more than on a once per month basis.
    (2) As an employer, you may use a service agent (e.g., a C/TPA) to 
perform random selections for you, and your covered drivers may be part 
of a larger random testing pool of covered employees. However, you must 
ensure that the service agent you use is testing at the appropriate 
percentage established for your industry and that only covered employees 
are in the random testing pool.
    (k)(1) Each employer shall ensure that random alcohol and controlled 
substances tests conducted under this part are unannounced.
    (2) Each employer shall ensure that the dates for administering 
random alcohol and controlled substances tests conducted under this part 
are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.
    (l) Each employer shall require that each driver who is notified of 
selection for random alcohol and/or controlled substances testing 
proceeds to the test site immediately; provided, however, that if the 
driver is performing a safety-sensitive function, other than driving a 
commercial motor vehicle, at the time of notification, the employer 
shall instead ensure that the driver ceases to perform the safety-
sensitive function and proceeds to the testing site as soon as possible.
    (m) A driver shall only be tested for alcohol while the driver is 
performing safety-sensitive functions, just before the driver is to 
perform safety-sensitive functions, or just after the driver has ceased 
performing such functions.
    (n) If a given driver is subject to random alcohol or controlled 
substances testing under the random alcohol or controlled substances 
testing rules of more than one DOT agency for the same employer, the 
driver shall be subject to random alcohol and/or controlled substances 
testing at the annual percentage rate established for the calendar year 
by the DOT agency regulating more than 50 percent of the driver's 
function.
    (o) If an employer is required to conduct random alcohol or 
controlled substances testing under the alcohol or controlled substances 
testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the employer may--
    (1) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool 
containing the DOT-covered employees who are subject to testing at the 
same required minimum annual percentage rate; or
    (2) Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest 
minimum annual percentage rate established for the calendar year by any 
DOT agency to which the employer is subject.

<R05>
Sec. 382.307  Reasonable suspicion testing.

    (a) An employer shall require a driver to submit to an alcohol test 
when the employer has reasonable suspicion to believe that the driver 
has violated the prohibitions of subpart B of this part concerning 
alcohol. The employer's determination that reasonable suspicion exists 
to require the driver to undergo an alcohol test must be based on 
specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the 
appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the driver.
    (b) An employer shall require a driver to submit to a controlled 
substances test when the employer has reasonable suspicion to believe 
that the driver has violated the prohibitions of subpart B of this part 
concerning controlled substances. The employer's determination that 
reasonable suspicion exists to require the driver to undergo a 
controlled substances test must be based on specific, contemporaneous, 
articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech or 
body odors of the driver. The observations may include indications of 
the chronic and withdrawal effects of controlled substances.

[[Page 171]]

    (c) The required observations for alcohol and/or controlled 
substances reasonable suspicion testing shall be made by a supervisor or 
company official who is trained in accordance with Sec. 382.603. The 
person who makes the determination that reasonable suspicion exists to 
conduct an alcohol test shall not conduct the alcohol test of the 
driver.
    (d) Alcohol testing is authorized by this section only if the 
observations required by paragraph (a) of this section are made during, 
just preceding, or just after the period of the work day that the driver 
is required to be in compliance with this part. A driver may be directed 
by the employer to only undergo reasonable suspicion testing while the 
driver is performing safety-sensitive functions, just before the driver 
is to perform safety-sensitive functions, or just after the driver has 
ceased performing such functions.
    (e)(1) If an alcohol test required by this section is not 
administered within two hours following the determination under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the employer shall prepare and maintain 
on file a record stating the reasons the alcohol test was not promptly 
administered. If an alcohol test required by this section is not 
administered within eight hours following the determination under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the employer shall cease attempts to 
administer an alcohol test and shall state in the record the reasons for 
not administering the test.
    (2) Notwithstanding the absence of a reasonable suspicion alcohol 
test under this section, no driver shall report for duty or remain on 
duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions while the 
driver is under the influence of or impaired by alcohol, as shown by the 
behavioral, speech, and performance indicators of alcohol misuse, nor 
shall an employer permit the driver to perform or continue to perform 
safety-sensitive functions, until:
    (i) An alcohol test is administered and the driver's alcohol 
concentration measures less than 0.02; or
    (ii) Twenty four hours have elapsed following the determination 
under paragraph (a) of this section that there is reasonable suspicion 
to believe that the driver has violated the prohibitions in this part 
concerning the use of alcohol.
    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, no 
employer shall take any action under this part against a driver based 
solely on the driver's behavior and appearance, with respect to alcohol 
use, in the absence of an alcohol test. This does not prohibit an 
employer with independent authority of this part from taking any action 
otherwise consistent with law.
    (f) A written record shall be made of the observations leading to an 
alcohol or controlled substances reasonable suspicion test, and signed 
by the supervisor or company official who made the observations, within 
24 hours of the observed behavior or before the results of the alcohol 
or controlled substances tests are released, whichever is earlier.

<R05>
Sec. 382.403  Reporting of results in a management information system.

    (a) An employer shall prepare and maintain a summary of the results 
of its alcohol and controlled substances testing programs performed 
under this part during the previous calendar year, when requested by the 
Secretary of Transportation, any DOT agency, or any State or local 
officials with regulatory authority over the employer or any of its 
drivers.
    (b) If an employer is notified, during the month of January, of a 
request by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to report the 
employer's annual calendar year summary information, the employer shall 
prepare and submit the report to the FMCSA by March 15 of that year. The 
employer shall ensure that the annual summary report is accurate and 
received by March 15 at the location that the FMCSA specifies in its 
request. The employer must use the Management Information System (MIS) 
form and instructions as required by 49 CFR part 40 (at Sec. 40.26 and 
appendix H to part 40). The employer may also use the electronic version 
of the MIS form provided by the DOT. The Administrator may designate 
means (e.g., electronic program transmitted via the Internet), other 
than hard-copy, for MIS form submission. For information on the 
electronic version of the form, see: http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/
safetyprogs/drugs/engtesting.htm.
    (c) When the report is submitted to the FMCSA by mail or electronic 
transmission, the information requested shall be typed, except for the 
signature of the certifying official. Each employer shall ensure the 
accuracy and timeliness of each report submitted by the employer or a 
consortium.
    (d) If you have a covered employee who performs multi-DOT agency 
functions (e.g., an employee drives a commercial motor vehicle and 
performs pipeline maintenance duties for the same employer), count the 
employee only on the MIS report for the DOT agency under which he or she 
is randomly tested. Normally, this will be the DOT agency under which 
the employee performs more than 50% of his or her duties. Employers may 
have to explain the testing data for these employees in the event of a 
DOT agency inspection or audit.
    (e) A service agent (e.g., Consortia/Third party administrator as 
defined in 49 CFR 382.107) may prepare the MIS report on behalf of an 
employer. However, a company official (e.g., Designated employer 
representative) must certify the accuracy and completeness

[[Page 174]]

of the MIS report, no matter who prepares it.

of validity may appear on the license document at a time. The good 
driving record must be confirmed prior to any renewal or revalidation.

vehicle beyond 241 kilometers (150 miles) from the place of business or 
the farm currently being served.
    (g) Restricted CDL for certain drivers in the pyrotechnic industry. 
(1) A State may, at its discretion, waive the required hazardous 
materials knowledge tests of subpart H of this part and issue restricted 
CDLs to part-time drivers operating commercial motor vehicles 
transporting less than 227 kilograms (500 pounds) of fireworks 
classified as DOT Class 1.3G explosives.
    (2) A State issuing a CDL under the terms of this paragraph must 
restrict issuance as follows:
    (i) The GVWR of the vehicle to be operated must be less than 4,537 
kilograms (10,001 pounds);
    (ii) If a State believes, at its discretion, that the training 
required by Sec. 172.704 of this title adequately prepares part-time 
drivers meeting the other requirements of this paragraph to deal with 
fireworks and the other potential dangers posed by fireworks 
transportation and use, the State may waive the hazardous materials 
knowledge tests of subpart H of this part. The State may impose any 
requirements it believes is necessary to ensure itself that a driver is 
properly trained pursuant to Sec. 172.704 of this title.

all the requirements of this part, except those specifically identified.

same reciprocity as a CDL meeting all of the requirements of this part. 
The restrictions imposed upon the issuance of this restricted CDL shall 
not limit a person's use of the CDL in a non-CMV during either validated 
or non-validated periods, nor shall the CDL affect a State's power to 
administer its driver licensing program for operators of vehicles other 
than CMVs.

may legally operate a CMV unless such person possesses a CDL which meets 
the standards contained in subpart J of this part, issued by his/her 
State or jurisdiction of domicile.
    (b) Exception. (1) If a CMV operator is not domiciled in a foreign 
jurisdiction which the Administrator has determined tests drivers and 
issues CDLs in accordance with, or under standards similar to, the 
standards contained in subparts F, G, and H of this part, the person may 
obtain a Nonresident CDL from a State which does comply with the testing

subchapter, that individual is eligible to obtain a Nonresident CDL from 
any State that elects to issue a Nonresident CDL and which complies with 
the testing and licensing standards contained in subparts F, G, and H of 
this part.
    (c) Learner's permit. State learners' permits, issued for limited

holder of a valid CDL;
    (2) He/she either holds a valid automobile driver's license, or has 
passed such vision, sign/symbol, and knowledge tests as the State

Sec. 383.73  State procedures.

    (a) Initial licensure. Prior to issuing a CDL to a person, a State 
shall:
    (1) Require the driver applicant to certify, pass tests, and provide 
information as described in Sec. Sec. 383.71(a) (1) through (6);
    (2) Check that the vehicle in which the applicant takes his/her test 
is representative of the vehicle group the applicant has certified that 
he/she operates or expects to operate;
    (3) Initiate and complete a check of the applicant's driving record 
to ensure that the person is not subject to any disqualification under 
Sec. 383.51, or any license suspension, revocation, or cancellation 
under State law, and that the person does not have a driver's license 
from more than one State or jurisdiction. The record check must include, 
but is not limited to, the following:
    (i) A check of the applicant's driving record as maintained by his/
her current State of licensure, if any;
    (ii) A check with the CDLIS to determine whether the driver 
applicant already has been issued a CDL, whether the applicant's license 
has been suspended, revoked, or canceled, or if the applicant has been 
disqualified from operating a commercial motor vehicle;
    (iii) A check with the National Driver Register (NDR) to determine 
whether the driver applicant has:
    (A) Been disqualified from operating a motor vehicle (other than a 
commercial motor vehicle);
    (B) Had a license (other than CDL) suspended, revoked, or canceled 
for cause in the 3-year period ending on the date of application; or

    (iv) A request for the applicant's complete driving record from all 
States where the applicant was previously licensed over the last 10 
years to drive any type of motor vehicle. Exception: A State is only 
required to make the driving record check specified in this paragraph 
(a)(3) for drivers renewing a CDL for the first time after September 30, 
2002, provided a notation is made on the driver's record confirming that 
the driver record check required by this paragraph (a)(3) has been made 
and noting the date it was done; and
    (4) Require the driver applicant to surrender his/her driver's 
license issued

[[Page 193]]

by another State, if he/she has moved from another State.
    (5) For persons applying for a hazardous materials endorsement, 
require compliance with the standards for such endorsement specified in 
Sec. 383.71(a)(9).
    (b) License transfers. Prior to issuing a CDL to a person who has a 
CDL from another State, a State shall:
    (1) Require the driver applicant to make the certifications 
contained in Sec. 383.71(a);
    (2) Complete a check of the driver applicant's record as contained 
in Sec. 383.73(a)(3);
    (3) Request and receive updates of information specified in subpart 
J of this part;
    (4) If such applicant wishes to retain a hazardous materials 
endorsement, require compliance with standards for such endorsement 
specified in Sec. 383.71(a)(9) and ensure that the driver has, within 
the 2 years preceding the transfer, either:
    (i) Passed the test for such endorsement specified in Sec. 383.121; 
or
    (ii) Successfully completed a hazardous materials test or training 
that is given by a third party and that is deemed by the State to 
substantially cover the same knowledge base as that described in Sec. 
383.121; and
    (5) Obtain the CDL issued by the applicant's previous State of 
domicile.
    (c) License Renewals. Prior to renewing any CDL a State shall:
    (1) Require the driver applicant to make the certifications 
contained in Sec. 383.71(a);
    (2) Complete a check of the driver applicant's record as contained 
in Sec. 383.73(a)(3);
    (3) Request and receive updates of information specified in subpart 
J of this part; and
    (4) If such applicant wishes to retain a hazardous materials 
endorsement, require the driver to pass the test specified in Sec. 
383.121 and comply with the standards specified in Sec. 383.71(a)(9) 
for such endorsement.
    (d) License upgrades. Prior to issuing an upgrade of a CDL, a State

    (2) Complete a check of the driver applicant's record as described 
in Sec. 383.73(a)(3).
    (e) Nonresident CDL. A State may issue a Nonresident CDL to a person 
domiciled in a foreign country if the Administrator has determined that 
the commercial motor vehicle testing and licensing standards in the 
foreign jurisdiction of domicile do not meet the standards contained in 
this part. State procedures for the issuance of a nonresident CDL, for 
any modifications thereto, and for notifications to the CDLIS shall at a 
minimum be identical to those pertaining to any other CDL, with the 
following exceptions:
    (1) If the applicant is requesting a transfer of his/her Nonresident 
CDL, the State shall obtain the Nonresident CDL currently held by the 
applicant and issued by another State;
    (2) The State shall add the word ``Nonresident'' to the face of the 
CDL, in accordance with Sec. 383.153(b); and
    (3) The State shall have established, prior to issuing any 
Nonresident CDL, the practical capability of disqualifying the holder of 
any Nonresident CDL, by withdrawing, suspending, canceling, and revoking 
his/her Nonresident CDL as if the Nonresident CDL were a CDL issued to a 
resident of the State.
    (f) License issuance. After the State has completed the procedures 
described in Sec. 383.73 (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e), it may issue a CDL 
to the driver applicant. The State shall notify the operator of the 
CDLIS of such issuance, transfer, renewal, or upgrade within the 10-day 
period beginning on the date of license issuance.
    (g) Penalties for false information. If a State determines, in its 
check of an applicant's license status and record prior to issuing a 
CDL, or at any time after the CDL is issued, that the applicant has 
falsified information contained in subpart J of this part or any of the 
certifications required in Sec. 383.71(a), the State shall at a minimum 
suspend, cancel, or revoke the person's CDL or his/her pending 
application, or disqualify the person from operating a commercial motor 
vehicle for a period of at least 60 consecutive days.

[[Page 194]]

    (h) Reciprocity. A State shall allow any person who has a valid CDL 
which is not suspended, revoked, or canceled, and who is not 
disqualified from operating a commercial motor vehicle, to operate a 
commercial motor vehicle in the State.
    (i) Alternative procedures. A State may implement alternative 
procedures to the certification requirements of Sec. 383.71(a) (1), 
(4), and (6), provided those procedures ensure that the driver meets the 
requirements of those paragraphs.

<R05>
Sec. 383.75  Third party testing.

    (a) Third party tests. A State may authorize a person (including 
another State, an employer, a private driver training facility or other 
private institution, or a department, agency or instrumentality of a 
local government) to administer the skills tests as specified in 
subparts G and H of this part, if the following conditions are met:
    (1) The tests given by the third party are the same as those which 
would otherwise be given by the State; and
    (2) The third party as an agreement with the State containing, at a 
minimum, provisions that:
    (i) Allow the FMCSA, or its representative, and the State to conduct 
random examinations, inspections and audits without prior notice;
    (ii) Require the State to conduct on-site inspections at least 
annually;
    (iii) Require that all third party examiners meet the same 
qualification and training standards as State examiners, to the extent 
necessary to conduct skills tests in compliance with subparts G and H;
    (iv) Require that, at least on an annual basis, State employees take 
the tests actually administered by the third party as if the State 
employee were a test applicant, or that States test a sample of drivers 
who were examined by the third party to compare pass/fail results; and
    (v) Reserve unto the State the right to take prompt and appropriate 
remedial action against the third-party testers in the event that the 
third-party fails to comply with State or Federal standards for the CDL 
testing program, or with any other terms of the third-party contract.
    (b) Proof of testing by a third party. A driver applicant who takes 
and passes driving tests administered by an authorized third party shall 
provide evidence to the State licensing agency that he/she has 
successfully passed the driving tests administered by the third party.

Sec. 383.77  Substitute for driving skills tests.

    At the discretion of a State, the driving skill test as specified in 
Sec. 383.113 may be waived for a CMV operator who is currently licensed 
at the time of his/her application for a CDL, and substituted with 
either an applicant's driving record and previous passage of an 
acceptable skills test, or an applicant's driving record in combination 
with certain driving experience. The State shall impose conditions and 
limitations to restrict the applicants from whom a State may accept 
alternative requirements for the skills test described in Sec. 383.113. 
Such conditions must require at least the following:
    (a) An applicant must certify that, during the two-year period 
immediately prior to applying for a CDL, he/she:
    (1) Has not had more than one license (except in the instances 
specified in Sec. 383.21(b));
    (2) Has not had any license suspended, revoked, or canceled;
    (3) Has not had any convictions for any type of motor vehicle for 
the disqualifying offenses contained in Sec. 383.51(b);

vehicle for serious traffic violations; and
    (5) Has not had any conviction for a violation of State or local law 
relating to motor vehicle traffic control (other than a parking 
violation) arising in connection with any traffic accident, and has no 
record of an accident in which he/she was at fault; and
    (b) An applicant must provide evidence and certify that:
    (1) He/she is regularly employed in a job requiring operation of a 
CMV, and that either:

[[Page 195]]

    (2) He/she has previously taken and passed a skills test given by a 
State with a classified licensing and testing system, and that the test 
was behind-the-wheel in a representative vehicle for that applicant's 
driver's license classification; or
    (3) He/she has operated, for at least 2 years immediately preceding 
application for a CDL, a vehicle representative of the commercial motor 
vehicle the driver applicant operates or expects to operate.

<R05>
Sec. 383.133  Testing methods.

    (a) All tests shall be constructed in such a way as to determine if 
the applicant possesses the required knowledge and skills contained in 
subpart G of this part for the type of motor vehicle or endorsement the 
applicant wishes to obtain.
    (b) States shall develop their own specifications for the tests for 
each vehicle group and endorsement which must be at least as stringent 
as the Federal standards.
    (c) States shall determine specific methods for scoring the 
knowledge and skills tests.
    (d) Passing scores must meet those standards contained in Sec. 
383.135.
    (e) Knowledge and skills tests shall be based solely on the 
information contained in the driver manuals referred to in Sec. 
383.131(a).
    (f) Each knowledge test shall be valid and reliable so as to assure 
that driver applicants possess the knowledge required under Sec. 
383.111.
    (g) Each basic knowledge test, i.e., the test covering the areas 
referred to in Sec. 383.111 for the applicable vehicle group, shall 
contain at least 30 items, exclusive of the number of items testing air 
brake knowledge. Each endorsement knowledge test, and the air brake 
component of the basic knowledge test as described in Sec. 383.111(g), 
shall contain a number of questions that is sufficient to test the 
driver applicant's knowledge of the required subject matter with 
validity and reliability.
    (h) The skills tests shall have administrative procedures, designed 
to achieve interexaminer reliability, that are sufficient to ensure 
fairness of pass/fail rates.


<R05>
Sec. 383.135  Minimum passing scores.

    (a) The driver applicant must correctly answer at least 80 percent 
of the questions on each knowledge test in order to achieve a passing 
score on such knowledge test.
    (b) To achieve a passing score on the skills test, the driver 
applicant must demonstrate that he/she can successfully perform all of 
the skills listed in Sec. 383.113.
    (c) If the driver applicant does not obey traffic laws, or causes an 
accident during the test, he/she shall automatically fail the test.
    (d) The scoring of the basic knowledge and skills tests shall be 
adjusted as follows to allow for the air brake restriction (Sec. 
383.95):
    (1) If the applicant scores less than 80 percent on the air brake 
component of the basic knowledge test as described in Sec. 383.111(g), 
the driver will have failed the air brake component and, if the driver 
is issued a CDL, an air brake restriction shall be indicated on the 
license; and
    (2) If the applicant performs the skills test in a vehicle not 
equipped with air brakes, the driver will have omitted the air brake 
component as described in Sec. 383.113(c) and, if the driver is issued 
a CDL, the air brake restriction shall be indicated on the license.

    Subpart I_Requirement for Transportation Security Administration 
          approval of hazardous materials endorsement issuances


<R05>
Sec. 383.141  General.

    (a) Applicability date. Beginning on the date(s) listed in 49 CFR 
1572.13(b), this section applies to State agencies responsible for 
issuing hazardous materials endorsements for a CDL, and applicants for 
such endorsements.
    (b) Prohibition. A State may not issue, renew, upgrade, or transfer 
a hazardous materials endorsement for a CDL to any individual 
authorizing that individual to operate a commercial motor vehicle 
transporting a hazardous material in commerce unless the Transportation 
Security Administration has determined that the individual does not pose 
a security risk warranting denial of the endorsement.
    (c) Individual notification. At least 60 days prior to the 
expiration date of the CDL or hazardous materials endorsement, a State 
must notify the holder of a hazardous materials endorsement that the 
individual must pass a Transportation Security Administration security 
threat assessment process as part of any application for renewal of the 
hazardous materials endorsement. The notice must advise a driver that, 
in order to expedite the security

[[Page 205]]

screening process, he or she should file a renewal application as soon 
as possible, but not later than 30 days before the date of expiration of 
the endorsement. An individual who does not successfully complete the 
Transportation Security Administration security threat assessment 
process referenced in paragraph (b) of this section may not be issued a 
hazardous materials endorsement.
    (d) Hazardous materials endorsement renewal cycle. Each State must 
require that hazardous materials endorsements be renewed every 5 years 
or less so that individuals are subject to a Transportation Security 
Administration security screening requirement referenced in paragraph 
(b) of this section at least every 5 years.

Sec. 384.307  FMCSA program reviews of State compliance.

    (a) FMCSA Program Reviews. Each State's CDL program will be subject 
to review to determine whether or not the State meets the general 
requirement for substantial compliance in Sec. 384.301. The State must 
cooperate with the review and provide any information requested by the

    (b) Preliminary FMCSA determination and State response. If, after 
review, a preliminary determination is made either that the State has 
not submitted the required annual self-certification or that the State 
does not meet one or more of the minimum standards for substantial 
compliance under subpart B of this part, the State will be informed 
accordingly.
    (c) Reply. The State will have up to 30 calendar days to respond to 
the preliminary determination. The State's reply must explain what 
corrective action it either has implemented or intends to implement to 
correct the deficiencies cited in the notice or, alternatively, why the 
FMCSA preliminary determination is incorrect. The State must provide 
documentation of corrective action as required by the agency. Corrective 
action must be adequate to correct the deficiencies noted in the program 
review and be implemented on a schedule mutually agreed upon by the 
agency and the State. Upon request by the State, an informal conference 
will be provided during this time.
    (d) Final FMCSA determination. If, after reviewing a timely response 
by the State to the preliminary determination, a final determination is 
made that the State is not in compliance with the affected standard, the 
State will be notified of the final determination. In making its final 
determination, the FMCSA will take into consideration the corrective 
action either implemented or planned to be implemented in accordance 
with the mutually agreed upon schedule.

<R05>
Sec. 384.405  Decertification of State CDL program.

    (a) Prohibition on CDL licensing activities. The Administrator may 
prohibit a State found to be in substantial noncompliance from 
performing any of the following four licensing transactions:
    (1) Issuance of initial CDLs.
    (2) Renewal of CDLs.
    (3) Transfer of out-of-State CDLs to the State.
    (4) Upgrade of CDLs.
    (b) Conditions considered in making decertification determination. 
The Administrator will consider, but is not limited to, the following 
five conditions in determining whether the CDL program of a State in 
substantial noncompliance should be decertified:
    (1) The State computer system does not check the Commercial Driver's 
License Information System (CDLIS) and/or National Driver Register (NDR) 
as required by Sec. 383.73 of this subchapter when processing CDL 
applicants, drivers transferring a CDL issued by another State, CDL 
renewals and/or upgrades.
    (2) The State does not disqualify drivers convicted of disqualifying 
offenses in commercial motor vehicles.
    (3) The State does not transmit convictions for out of State drivers 
to the State where the driver is licensed.
    (4) The State does not properly administer knowledge and/or skills 
tests to CDL applicants or drivers.
    (5) The State fails to submit a corrective action plan for a 
substantial compliance deficiency or fails to implement a corrective 
action plan within the agreed upon time frame.
    (c) Standard for considering deficiencies. The deficiencies 
described in paragraph (b) of this section must affect a substantial 
number of either CDL applicants or drivers.
    (d) Decertification: preliminary determination. If the Administrator 
finds that a State is in substantial noncompliance with subpart B of 
this part, as indicated by the factors specified in Sec. 384.405(b), 
among other things, the FMCSA will inform the State that it has made a 
preliminary determination of noncompliance and that the State's CDL 
program may therefore be decertified. Any response from the State, 
including factual or legal arguments or a plan to correct the 
noncompliance, must be submitted within 30 calendar days after receipt 
of the preliminary determination.
    (e) Decertification: final determination. If, after considering all 
material submitted by the State in response to the FMCSA preliminary 
determination, the Administrator decides that substantial noncompliance 
exists which warrants decertification of the CDL program, he or she will 
issue a decertification order prohibiting the State from issuing CDLs 
until such time as the Administrator determines that the

[[Page 215]]

condition(s) causing the decertification has (have) been corrected.
    (f) Recertification of a State. The Governor of the decertified 
State or his or her designated representative must submit a 
certification and documentation that the condition causing the 
decertification has been corrected. If the FMCSA determines that the 
condition causing the decertification has been satisfactorily corrected, 
the Administrator will issue a recertification order, including any 
conditions that must be met in order to begin issuing CDLs in the State.
    (g) State's right to judicial review. Any State aggrieved by an 
adverse decision under this section may seek judicial review under 5 
U.S.C. Chapter 7.
    (h) Validity of previously issued CDLs. A CDL issued by a State 
prior to the date the State is prohibited from issuing CDLs in 
accordance with provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, will remain 
valid until its stated expiration date.

[67 FR 49763, July 31, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 384.407  Emergency CDL grants.

    The FMCSA may provide grants of up to $1,000,000 per State from 
funds made available under 49 U.S.C. 31107(a), to assist States whose 
CDL programs may fail to meet the compliance requirements of subpart B 
of this part, but which are determined by the FMCSA to be making a good 
faith effort to comply with these requirements.

<R05>
Sec. 385.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This part establishes the FMCSA's procedures to determine the 
safety fitness of motor carriers, to assign safety ratings, to direct 
motor carriers to take remedial action when required, and to prohibit 
motor carriers receiving a safety rating of ``unsatisfactory'' from 
operating a CMV.
    (b) This part establishes the safety assurance program for a new 
entrant motor carrier initially seeking to register with FMCSA to 
conduct interstate operations. It also describes the consequences that 
will occur if the new entrant fails to maintain adequate basic safety 
management controls.
    (c) This part establishes the safety permit program for a motor 
carrier to transport the types and quantities of hazardous materials 
listed in Sec. 385.403.
    (d) The provisions of this part apply to all motor carriers subject 
to the requirements of this subchapter, except non-business private 
motor carriers of passengers.

Sec. 385.3  Definitions and acronyms.

    Applicable safety regulations or requirements means 49 CFR chapter 
III, subchapter B--Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations or, if the 
carrier is an intrastate motor carrier subject to the hazardous 
materials safety permit requirements in subpart E of this part, the 
equivalent State standards; and 49 CFR chapter I, subchapter C--
Hazardous Materials Regulations.
    CMV means a commercial motor vehicle as defined in Sec. 390.5 of 
this subchapter.
    Commercial motor vehicle shall have the same meaning as described in 
Sec. 390.5 of this subchapter, except that this definition will also 
apply to intrastate

[[Page 217]]

motor vehicles subject to the hazardous materials safety permit 
requirements of subpart E of this part.
    FMCSA means the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.
    FMCSRs mean Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (49 CFR parts 
350-399).
    HMRs means the Hazardous Materials Regulations (49 CFR parts 100-
178).
    New entrant is a motor carrier not domiciled in Mexico that applies 
for a United States Department of Transportation (DOT) identification 
number in order to initiate operations in interstate commerce.
    New entrant registration is the registration (US DOT number) granted 
a new entrant before it can begin interstate operations in an 18-month 
monitoring period. A safety audit must be performed on a new entrant's 
operations within 18 months after receipt of its US DOT number and it 
must be found to have adequate basic safety management controls to 
continue operating in interstate commerce at the end of the 18-month 
period.
    Preventable accident on the part of a motor carrier means an 
accident (1) that involved a commercial motor vehicle, and (2) that 
could have been averted but for an act, or failure to act, by the motor 
carrier or the driver.
    Reviews. For the purposes of this part:
    (1) Compliance review means an on-site examination of motor carrier 
operations, such as drivers' hours of service, maintenance and 
inspection, driver qualification, commercial drivers license 
requirements, financial responsibility, accidents, hazardous materials, 
and other safety and transportation records to determine whether a motor 
carrier meets the safety fitness standard. A compliance review may be 
conducted in response to a request to change a safety rating, to 
investigate potential violations of safety regulations by motor 
carriers, or to investigate complaints or other evidence of safety 
violations. The compliance review may result in the initiation of an 
enforcement action.
    (2) Safety Audit means an examination of a motor carrier's 
operations to provide educational and technical assistance on safety and 
the operational requirements of the FMCSRs and applicable HMRs and to 
gather critical safety data needed to make an assessment of the 
carrier's safety performance and basic safety management controls. 
Safety audits do not result in safety ratings.
    (3) Safety management controls means the systems, policies programs, 
practices, and procedures used by a motor carrier to ensure compliance 
with applicable safety and hazardous materials regulations which ensure 
the safe movement of products and passengers through the transportation 
system, and to reduce the risk of highway accidents and hazardous 
materials incidents resulting in fatalities, injuries, and property 
damage.
    RSPA means the Research and Special Programs Administration.
    Safety ratings: (1) Satisfactory safety rating means that a motor 
carrier has in place and functioning adequate safety management controls 
to meet the safety fitness standard prescribed in Sec. 385.5. Safety 
management controls are adequate if they are appropriate for the size 
and type of operation of the particular motor carrier.
    (2) Conditional safety rating means a motor carrier does not have 
adequate safety management controls in place to ensure compliance with 
the safety fitness standard that could result in occurrences listed in 
Sec. 385.5 (a) through (k).
    (3) Unsatisfactory safety rating means a motor carrier does not have 
adequate safety management controls in place to ensure compliance with 
the safety fitness standard which has resulted in occurrences listed in 
Sec. 385.5 (a) through (k).
    (4) Unrated carrier means that a safety rating has not been assigned 
to the motor carrier by the FMCSA.

<R05>
Sec. 385.5  Safety fitness standard.

    The Satisfactory safety rating is based on the degree of compliance 
with the safety fitness standard for motor carriers. For intrastate 
motor carriers subject to the hazardous materials safety permit 
requirements of subpart E of this part, the motor carrier must meet the 
equivalent State requirements. To meet the safety fitness standard, the 
motor carrier must demonstrate it has adequate safety management 
controls in place, which function effectively to ensure acceptable 
compliance with applicable safety requirements to reduce the risk 
associated with:
    (a) Commercial driver's license standard violations (part 383),
    (b) Inadequate levels of financial responsibility (part 387),
    (c) The use of unqualified drivers (part 391),
    (d) Improper use and driving of motor vehicles (part 392),
    (e) Unsafe vehicles operating on the highways (part 393),
    (f) Failure to maintain accident registers and copies of accident 
reports (part 390),
    (g) The use of fatigued drivers (part 395),
    (h) Inadequate inspection, repair, and maintenance of vehicles (part 
396),
    (i) Transportation of hazardous materials, driving and parking rule 
violations (part 397),
    (j) Violation of hazardous materials regulations (parts 170 through 
177), and
    (k) Motor vehicle accidents and hazardous materials incidents.

<R05>
Sec. 385.7  Factors to be considered in determining a safety rating.

    The factors to be considered in determining the safety fitness and 
assigning a safety rating include information from safety reviews, 
compliance reviews and any other data. The factors may include all or 
some of the following:
    (a) Adequacy of safety management controls. The adequacy of controls 
may be questioned if their degree of formalization, automation, etc., is 
found to be substantially below the norm for similar carriers. 
Violations, accidents or incidents substantially above the norm for 
similar carriers will be strong evidence that management controls are 
either inadequate or not functioning properly.
    (b) Frequency and severity of regulatory violations.
    (c) Frequency and severity of driver/vehicle regulatory violations 
identified in roadside inspections.

[[Page 219]]

    (d) Number and frequency of out-of-service driver/vehicle 
violations.
    (e) Increase or decrease in similar types of regulatory violations 
discovered during safety or compliance reviews.
    (f) Frequency of accidents; hazardous materials incidents; accident 
rate per million miles; preventable accident rate per million miles; and 
other accident indicators; and whether these accident and incident 
indicators have improved or deteriorated over time.
    (g) The number and severity of violations of state safety rules, 
regulations, standards, and orders applicable to commercial motor 
vehicles and motor carrier safety that are compatible with Federal 
rules, regulations, standards, and orders.

Sec. 385.9  Determination of a safety rating.

    (a) Following a compliance review of a motor carrier operation, the 
FMCSA, using the factors prescribed in Sec. 385.7 as computed under the 
Safety Fitness Rating Methodology set forth in appendix B of this part, 
shall determine whether the present operations of the motor carrier are 
consistent with the safety fitness standard set forth in Sec. 385.5, 
and assign a safety rating accordingly.
    (b) Unless otherwise specifically provided in this part, a safety 
rating will be issued to a motor carrier within 30 days following the 
completion of a compliance review.

[62 FR 60042, Nov. 6, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 385.11  Notification of safety fitness determination.

    (a) The FMCSA will provide a motor carrier written notice of any 
safety rating resulting from a compliance review as soon as practicable, 
but not later than 30 days after the review. The notice will take the 
form of a letter issued from the FMCSA's headquarters office and will 
include a list of FMCSR and HMR compliance deficiencies which the motor 
carrier must correct.
    (b) If the safety rating is ``satisfactory'' or improves a previous 
``unsatisfactory'' safety rating, it is final and becomes effective on 
the date of the notice.
    (c) In all other cases, a notice of a proposed safety rating will be 
issued. It becomes the final safety rating after the following time 
periods:
    (1) For motor carriers transporting hazardous materials in 
quantities requiring placarding or transporting passengers by CMV--45 
days after the date of the notice.
    (2) For all other motor carriers operating CMVs--60 days after the 
date of the notice.
    (d) A proposed safety rating of ``unsatisfactory'' is a notice to 
the motor carrier that the FMCSA has made a preliminary determination 
that the motor carrier is ``unfit'' to continue operating in interstate 
commerce, and that the prohibitions in Sec. 385.13 will be imposed 
after 45 or 60 days if necessary safety improvements are not made.
    (e) A motor carrier may request the FMCSA to perform an 
administrative review of a proposed or final safety rating. The process 
and the time limits are described in Sec. 385.15.
    (f) A motor carrier may request a change to a proposed or final 
safety rating based upon its corrective actions. The process and the 
time limits are described in Sec. 385.17.

<R05>
Sec. 385.13  Unsatisfactory rated motor carriers; prohibition on 
transportation; ineligibility for Federal contracts.

    (a) Generally, a motor carrier rated ``unsatisfactory'' is 
prohibited from operating a CMV. Information on motor carriers, 
including their most current safety rating, is available from the FMCSA 
on the Internet at http://www.safersys.org, or by telephone at (800) 
832-5660.
    (1) Motor carriers transporting hazardous materials in quantities 
requiring placarding, and motor carriers transporting passengers in a 
CMV, are prohibited from operating a CMV beginning on the 46th day after 
the date of the FMCSA's notice of proposed ``unsatisfactory'' rating.
    (2) All other motor carriers rated from reviews completed on or 
after November 20, 2000 are prohibited from operating a CMV beginning on 
the 61st

[[Page 220]]

day after the date of the FMCSA's notice of proposed ``unsatisfactory'' 
rating. If the FMCSA determines the motor carrier is making a good-faith 
effort to improve its safety fitness, the FMCSA may allow the motor 
carrier to operate for up to 60 additional days.
    (b) A Federal agency must not use a motor carrier that holds an 
``unsatisfactory'' rating to transport passengers in a CMV or to 
transport hazardous materials in quantities requiring placarding.
    (c) A Federal agency must not use a motor carrier for other CMV 
transportation if that carrier holds an ``unsatisfactory'' rating which 
became effective on or after January 22, 2001.
    (d) Penalties. If a proposed ``unsatisfactory'' safety rating 
becomes final, the FMCSA will issue an order placing its interstate 
operations out of service. Any motor carrier that operates CMVs in 
violation of this section will be subject to the penalty provisions 
listed in 49 U.S.C. 521(b).

administrative review if it believes the FMCSA has committed an error in 
assigning its proposed safety rating in accordance with Sec. 385.15(c) 
or its final safety rating in accordance with Sec. 385.11(b).
    (b) The motor carrier's request must explain the error it believes 
the FMCSA committed in issuing the safety rating. The motor carrier must 
include a list of all factual and procedural issues in dispute, and any 
information or documents that support its argument.
    (c) The motor carrier must submit its request in writing to the 
Chief Safety Officer, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, 400 
Seventh Street, SW., Washington DC 20590.
    (1) If a motor carrier has received a notice of a proposed 
``unsatisfactory'' safety rating, it should submit its request within 15 
days from the date of the notice. This time frame will allow the FMCSA 
to issue a written decision before the prohibitions outlined in Sec. 
385.13 (a)(1) and (2) take effect. Failure to petition within this 15-
day period may prevent the FMCSA from issuing a final decision before 
such prohibitions take effect.
    (2) A motor carrier must make a request for an administrative review 
within 90 days of the date of the proposed safety rating issued under 
Sec. 385.11 (c) or a final safety rating issued under Sec. 385.11 (b), 
or within 90 days after denial of a request for a change in rating under 
Sec. 385.17(i).
    (d) The FMCSA may ask the motor carrier to submit additional data 
and attend a conference to discuss the safety rating. If the motor 
carrier does not provide the information requested, or does not attend 
the conference, the FMCSA may dismiss its request for review.
    (e) The FMCSA will notify the motor carrier in writing of its 
decision following the administrative review. The FMCSA will complete 
its review:
    (1) Within 30 days after receiving a request from a hazardous 
materials or passenger motor carrier that has received a proposed or 
final ``unsatisfactory'' safety rating.
    (2) Within 45 days after receiving a request from any other motor 
carrier that has received a proposed or final ``unsatisfactory'' safety 
rating.
    (f) The decision constitutes final agency action.
    (g) Any motor carrier may request a rating change under the 
provisions of Sec. 385.17.

<R05>
Sec. 385.17  Change to safety rating based upon corrective actions.

    (a) A motor carrier that has taken action to correct the 
deficiencies that resulted in a proposed or final rating of 
``conditional'' or ``unsatisfactory'' may request a rating change at any 
time.
    (b) A motor carrier must make this request in writing to the FMCSA 
Service Center for the geographic area where the carrier maintains its 
principal place of business. The addresses and geographical boundaries 
of the Service Centers are listed in Sec. 390.27 of this chapter.
    (c) The motor carrier must base its request upon evidence that it 
has taken corrective actions and that its operations currently meet the 
safety standard and factors specified in Sec. Sec. 385.5 and 385.7. The 
request must include a written description of corrective actions taken, 
and other documentation the carrier wishes the FMCSA to consider.
    (d) The FMCSA will make a final determination on the request for 
change based upon the documentation the motor carrier submits, and any 
additional relevant information.
    (e) The FMCSA will perform reviews of requests made by motor 
carriers with a proposed or final ``unsatisfactory'' safety rating in 
the following time periods after the motor carrier's request:
    (1) Within 30 days for motor carriers transporting passengers in 
CMVs or placardable quantities of hazardous materials.
    (2) Within 45 days for all other motor carriers.
    (f) The filing of a request for change to a proposed or final safety 
rating under this section does not stay the 45-day period specified in 
Sec. 385.13(a)(1) for motor carriers transporting passengers or 
hazardous materials. If the motor carrier has submitted evidence that 
corrective actions have been taken pursuant to this section and the 
FMCSA cannot make a final determination within the 45-day period, the 
period before the proposed safety rating becomes final may be extended 
for up to 10 days at the discretion of the FMCSA.
    (g) The FMCSA may allow a motor carrier with a proposed rating of 
``unsatisfactory'' (except those transporting passengers in CMVs or 
placardable quantities of hazardous materials) to continue to operate in 
interstate commerce for up to 60 days beyond the 60 days specified in 
the proposed rating, if the FMCSA determines that the motor carrier is 
making a good faith effort to improve its safety status. This additional 
period would begin on the 61st day after the date of the notice of the 
proposed ``unsatisfactory'' rating.
    (h) If the FMCSA determines that the motor carrier has taken the 
corrective actions required and that its operations currently meet the 
safety standard and factors specified in Sec. Sec. 385.5 and 385.7, the 
agency will notify the motor carrier in writing of its upgraded safety 
rating.
    (i) If the FMCSA determines that the motor carrier has not taken all 
the corrective actions required, or that its operations still fail to 
meet the safety standard and factors specified in Sec. Sec. 385.5 and 
385.7, the agency will notify the motor carrier in writing.
    (j) Any motor carrier whose request for change is denied in 
accordance with paragraph (i) of this section may request administrative 
review under the procedures of Sec. 385.15. The motor carrier must make 
the request within 90 days of the denial of the request for a rating 
change. If the proposed rating has become final, it shall remain in 
effect during the period of any administrative review.

more based upon at least three inspections occurring within a 
consecutive 90-day period.
    (b) Failure to respond to an agency demand for a written response 
demonstrating corrective action within 30 days will result in the 
suspension of the carrier's provisional operating authority or 
provisional Certificate of Registration until the required showing of 
corrective action is submitted to the FMCSA.
    (c) A satisfactory response to a written demand for corrective 
action does not excuse a carrier from the requirement that it undergo a 
safety audit or compliance review, as appropriate, during the 
provisional registration period.


<R05>
Sec. 385.107  The safety audit.

    (a) The criteria used in a safety audit to determine whether a 
Mexico-domiciled carrier exercises the necessary basic safety management 
controls are specified in Appendix A to this part.
    (b) If the FMCSA determines, based on the safety audit, that the 
Mexico-domiciled carrier has adequate basic safety management controls, 
the FMCSA will provide the carrier written notice of this finding as 
soon as practicable, but not later than 45 days after the completion of 
the safety audit. The carrier's Certificate of Registration will remain 
provisional and the carrier's on-highway performance will continue to be 
closely monitored for the remainder of the 18-month provisional 
registration period.
    (c) If the FMCSA determines, based on the safety audit, that the 
Mexico-domiciled carrier's basic safety management controls are 
inadequate, it will initiate a suspension and revocation proceeding in 
accordance with Sec. 385.111 of this subpart.
    (d) The safety audit is also used to assess the basic safety 
management controls of Mexico-domiciled applicants for provisional 
operating authority to operate beyond United States municipalities and 
commercial zones on the United States-Mexico border under Sec. 365.507 
of this subchapter.


<R05>
Sec. 385.109  The compliance review.

    (a) The criteria used in a compliance review to determine whether a 
Mexico-domiciled carrier granted provisional operating authority under 
Sec. 365.507 of this subchapter exercises the necessary basic safety 
management controls are specified in Appendix B to this part.
    (b) Satisfactory Rating. If the FMCSA assigns a Mexico-domiciled 
carrier a Satisfactory rating following a compliance review conducted 
under this subpart, the FMCSA will provide the carrier written notice as 
soon as practicable, but not later than 45 days after the completion of 
the compliance review. The carrier's operating authority will remain in 
provisional status and its on-highway performance will continue to be 
closely monitored for the remainder of the 18-month provisional 
registration period.
    (c) Conditional Rating. If the FMCSA assigns a Mexico-domiciled 
carrier a

[[Page 224]]

Conditional rating following a compliance review conducted under this 
subpart, it will initiate a revocation proceeding in accordance with 
Sec. 385.111 of this subpart. The carrier's provisional operating 
authority will not be suspended prior to the conclusion of the 
revocation proceeding.
    (d) Unsatisfactory Rating. If the FMCSA assigns a Mexico-domiciled 
carrier an Unsatisfactory rating following a compliance review conducted 
under this subpart, it will initiate a suspension and revocation 
proceeding in accordance with Sec. 385.111 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 385.111  Suspension and revocation of Mexico-domiciled carrier 
registration.

    (a) If a carrier is assigned an ``Unsatisfactory'' safety rating 
following a compliance review conducted under this subpart, or a safety 
audit conducted under this subpart determines that a carrier does not 
exercise the basic safety management controls necessary to ensure safe 
operations, the FMCSA will provide the carrier written notice, as soon 
as practicable, that its registration will be suspended effective 15 
days from the service date of the notice unless the carrier 
demonstrates, within 10 days of the service date of the notice, that the 
compliance review or safety audit contains material error.
    (b) For purposes of this section, material error is a mistake or 
series of mistakes that resulted in an erroneous safety rating or an 
erroneous determination that the carrier does not exercise the necessary 
basic safety management controls.
    (c) If the carrier demonstrates that the compliance review or safety 
audit contained material error, its registration will not be suspended. 
If the carrier fails to show a material error in the safety audit, the 
FMCSA will issue an Order:
    (1) Suspending the carrier's provisional operating authority or 
provisional Certificate of Registration and requiring it to immediately 
cease all further operations in the United States; and
    (2) Notifying the carrier that its provisional operating authority 
or provisional Certificate of Registration will be revoked unless it 
presents evidence of necessary corrective action within 30 days from the 
service date of the Order.
    (d) If a carrier is assigned a ``Conditional'' rating following a 
compliance review conducted under this subpart, the provisions of 
subparagraphs (a) through (c) of this section will apply, except that 
its provisional registration will not be suspended under paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section.
    (e) If a carrier subject to this subpart fails to provide the 
necessary documents for a safety audit or compliance review upon 
reasonable request, or fails to submit evidence of the necessary 
corrective action as required by Sec. 385.105 of this subpart, the 
FMCSA will provide the carrier with written notice, as soon as 
practicable, that its registration will be suspended 15 days from the 
service date of the notice unless it provides all necessary documents or 
information. This suspension will remain in effect until the necessary 
documents or information are produced and:
    (1) A safety audit determines that the carrier exercises basic 
safety management controls necessary for safe operations;
    (2) The carrier is rated Satisfactory or Conditional after a 
compliance review; or
    (3) The FMCSA determines, following review of the carrier's response 
to a demand for corrective action under Sec. 385.105, that the carrier 
has taken the necessary corrective action.
    (f) If a carrier commits any of the violations specified in Sec. 
385.105(a) of this subpart after the removal of a suspension issued 
under this section, the suspension will be automatically reinstated. The 
FMCSA will issue an Order requiring the carrier to cease further 
operations in the United States and demonstrate, within 15 days from the 
service date of the Order, that it did not commit the alleged 
violation(s). If the carrier fails to demonstrate that it did not commit 
the violation(s), the FMCSA will issue an Order revoking its provisional 
operating authority or provisional Certificate of Registration.
    (g) If the FMCSA receives credible evidence that a carrier has 
operated in violation of a suspension order issued under this section, 
it will issue an

[[Page 225]]

Order requiring the carrier to show cause, within 10 days of the service 
date of the Order, why its provisional operating authority or 
provisional Certificate of Registration should not be revoked. If the 
carrier fails to make the necessary showing, the FMCSA will revoke its 
registration.
    (h) If a Mexico-domiciled motor carrier operates a commercial motor 
vehicle in violation of a suspension or out-of-service order, it is 
subject to the penalty provisions in 49 U.S.C. 521(b)(2)(A), not to 
exceed $10,000 for each offense.
    (i) Notwithstanding any provision of this subpart, a carrier subject 
to this subpart is also subject to the suspension and revocation 
provisions of 49 U.S.C. 13905 for repeated violations of DOT regulations 
governing its motor carrier operations.


<R05>
Sec. 385.113  Administrative review.

    (a) A Mexico-domiciled motor carrier may request the FMCSA to 
conduct an administrative review if it believes the FMCSA has committed 
an error in assigning a safety rating or suspending or revoking the 
carrier's provisional operating authority or provisional Certificate of 
Registration under this subpart.
    (b) The carrier must submit its request in writing, in English, to 
the Associate Administrator for Enforcement, Federal Motor Carrier 
Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington DC 20590.
    (c) The carrier's request must explain the error it believes the 
FMCSA committed in assigning the safety rating or suspending or revoking 
the carrier's provisional operating authority or provisional Certificate 
of Registration and include any information or documents that support 
its argument.
    (d) The FMCSA will complete its administrative review no later than 
10 days after the carrier submits its request for review. The Associate 
Administrator's decision will constitute the final agency action.


<R05>
Sec. 385.115  Reapplying for provisional registration.

    (a) A Mexico-domiciled motor carrier whose provisional operating 
authority or provisional Certificate of Registration has been revoked 
may reapply under part 365 or 368 of this subchapter, as appropriate, no 
sooner than 30 days after the date of revocation.
    (b) The Mexico-domiciled motor carrier will be required to initiate 
the application process from the beginning. The carrier will be required 
to demonstrate how it has corrected the deficiencies that resulted in 
revocation of its registration and how it will ensure that it will have 
adequate basic safety management controls. It will also have to undergo 
a pre-authorization safety audit if it applies for provisional operating 
authority under part 365 of this subchapter.


<R05>
Sec. 385.117  Duration of safety monitoring system.

    (a) Each Mexico-domiciled carrier subject to this subpart will 
remain in the safety monitoring system for at least 18 months from the

Sec. 385.327  What happens when a new entrant receives a notice under 
Sec. 385.319(c) that its new entrant registration will be revoked and 
it believes the FMCSA made an error in its determination?

    (a) If a new entrant receives a revocation notice, it may request 
the FMCSA to conduct an administrative review if it believes the FMCSA 
has committed an error in determining that its basic safety management 
controls were inadequate.
    (1) The request must be made to the Field Administrator of the 
appropriate FMCSA Service Center.
    (2) The request must explain the error the new entrant believes the 
FMCSA committed in its determination.
    (3) The request must include a list of all factual and procedural 
issues in dispute, and any information or documents that support the new 
entrant's argument.
    (b) The new entrant should submit its request no later than 15 days 
from the date of the notice of the inadequacy of its basic safety 
management controls. Submitting the request within 15 days will allow 
the FMCSA to issue a written decision before the prohibitions outlined 
in Sec. 385.319(c) take effect. Failure to petition within this 15-day 
period may prevent the FMCSA from issuing a final decision before the 
prohibitions take effect.
    (c) The FMCSA may request that the new entrant submit additional 
data and attend a conference to discuss the issue(s) in dispute. If the 
new entrant does not attend the conference, or does not submit the 
requested data, the FMCSA may dismiss the new entrant's request for 
review.
    (d) The FMCSA will complete its review and notify the new entrant in 
writing of its decision within 30 days after receiving a request for 
review from a hazardous materials or passenger new entrant and within 45

within:
    (1) 90 days of the date when it was initially notified under Sec. 
385.319(c) that its basic safety management controls were inadequate; or
    (2) 90 days after it was notified that its corrective action under 
Sec. 385.319(c) was insufficient and its basic safety management 
controls remain inadequate.
    (f) The Field Administrator's decision constitutes the final agency 
action.
    (g) Notwithstanding this subpart, a new entrant is subject to the 
suspension and revocation provisions of 49 U.S.C. 13905 for violations 
of DOT regulations governing motor carrier operations.

operations out-of-service under Sec. 385.325(b) or under a notice 
ordering it to take specified actions to remedy its safety management 
controls under Sec. 385.319(c), the FMCSA will remove the new entrant 
designation and notify the new entrant in writing that its registration 
has become permanent. Thereafter, the FMCSA will evaluate the motor 
carrier on the same basis as any other carrier.
    (b) If a new entrant is determined to be ``unfit'' after a 
compliance review its new entrant registration will be revoked. (See 
Sec. 385.13)
    (c) A new entrant that has reached the conclusion of the 18-month 
period but is under an order to correct its safety management practices 
under Sec. 385.319(c) will have its new entrant registration removed 
following FMCSA's determination that the specified actions have been 
taken to remedy its safety management practices. The motor carrier will 
be notified in writing that its new entrant designation is removed and 
that its registration has become permanent. Thereafter, the FMCSA will 
evaluate the motor carrier on the same basis as any other carrier.
    (d) If a safety audit or compliance review has not been performed by 
the end of the 18-month monitoring period through no fault of the motor 
carrier, the carrier will be permitted to continue operating as a new 
entrant until a safety audit or compliance review is performed and a 
final determination is made regarding the adequacy of its safety 
management controls. Based on the results of the safety audit or 
compliance review, the FMCSA will either:
    (1) Remove the new entrant designation and notify the new entrant in

Sec. 385.335  If the FMCSA conducts a compliance review on a new entrant, 
will the new entrant also be subject to a safety audit?

    If the FMCSA conducts a compliance review on a new entrant that has 
not previously been subject to a safety audit and issues a safety 
fitness determination, the new entrant will not have to undergo a safety 
audit under this subpart. However, the new entrant will continue to be 
subject to the 18-month safety-monitoring period prior to removal of the 
new entrant designation.


<R05>
Sec. 385.337  What happens if a new entrant refuses to permit a safety 
audit to be performed on its operations?

    (a) If a new entrant refuses to permit a safety audit to be 
performed on its operations, the FMCSA will provide the carrier with 
written notice that its registration will be revoked and its operations 
placed out of service unless the new entrant agrees in writing, within 
10 days from the service date of the notice, to permit the safety audit 
to be performed. The initial refusal to permit a safety audit to be 
performed may subject the new entrant to the penalty provisions in 49 
U.S.C. 521(b)(2)(A).
    (b) If the new entrant does not agree to undergo a safety audit as 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section, its registration will be 
revoked and its interstate operations placed out of service effective on 
the 11th day from the service date of the notice issued under paragraph 
(a) of this section.

in the MCMIS.
    (c) A temporary safety permit shall be valid for 180 days after the 
date of issuance or until the motor carrier is assigned a new safety 
rating, whichever occurs first.
    (1) A motor carrier that receives a Satisfactory safety rating will 
be issued a safety permit (see Sec. 385.421).
    (2) A motor carrier that receives a less than Satisfactory safety 
rating is ineligible for a safety permit and will be subject to 
revocation of its temporary safety permit.
    (d) If a motor carrier has not received a safety rating within the 
180-day time period, FMCSA will extend the effective date of the 
temporary safety permit for an additional 60 days, provided the motor 
carrier demonstrates that it is continuing to operate in full compliance 
with the FMCSRs and HMRs.


<R05>
Sec. 385.411  Must a motor carrier obtain a safety permit if it has a 
State permit?

    Yes. However, if FMCSA is able to verify that a motor carrier has a 
safety permit issued by a State under a program that FMCSA has 
determined to be equivalent to the provisions of this subpart, FMCSA 
will immediately issue a safety permit to the motor carrier upon receipt 
of an application in accordance with Sec. 385.405, without further 
inspection or investigation.


<R05>
Sec. 385.413  What happens if a motor carrier receives a proposed 
safety rating that is less than Satisfactory?

    (a) If a motor carrier does not already have a safety permit, it 
will not be issued a safety permit (including a temporary safety permit) 
unless and until a Satisfactory safety rating is issued to the motor 
carrier.
    (b) If a motor carrier holds a safety permit (including a temporary 
safety permit), the safety permit will be subject to revocation or 
suspension (see Sec. 385.421).


<R05>
Sec. 385.415  What operational requirements apply to the transportation 
of a hazardous material for which a permit is required?

    (a) Information that must be carried in the vehicle. During 
transportation, the following must be maintained in each commercial 
motor vehicle that transports a hazardous material listed in Sec. 
385.403 and must be made available to an authorized official of a 
Federal, State, or local government agency upon request.
    (1) A copy of the safety permit or another document showing the 
permit number, provided that document clearly indicates the number is 
the FMCSA Safety Permit number;
    (2) A written route plan that meets the requirements of Sec. 
397.101 of this chapter for highway route-controlled Class 7 
(radioactive) materials or Sec. 397.67 of this chapter for Division 
1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 (explosive) materials; and

employee or representative must be able to verify that the shipment is 
within the general area for the expected route for the permitted 
material. The telephone number, when called, must be answered directly 
by the motor carrier or its representative at all times while the 
permitted material is in transportation including storage incidental to 
transportation. Answering machines are not sufficient to meet this 
requirement.
    (b)(1) Inspection of vehicle transporting Class 7 (radioactive) 
materials. Before a motor carrier may transport a highway route 
controlled quantity of a Class 7 (radioactive) material, the motor 
carrier must have a pre-trip inspection performed on each motor vehicle 
to be used to transport a highway route controlled quantity of a Class 7 
(radioactive) material, in accordance with the requirements of the 
``North American Standard Out-of-Service Criteria and Level VI 
Inspection Procedures and Out-of-Service Criteria for Commercial Highway 
Vehicles Transporting Transuranics and Highway Route Controlled 
Quantities of Radioactive Materials as defined in 49 CFR Part 173.403,'' 
January 1, 2004, which is incorporated by reference. The Director of the 
Federal Register has approved the materials incorporated by reference in

federal--regulations/ibr--locations.html.
    (c) Additional requirements. A motor carrier transporting hazardous 
materials requiring a permit under this part must also meet the 
following requirements:
    (1) The operator of a motor vehicle used to transport a hazardous 
material listed in Sec. 385.403 must follow the communications plan 
required in Sec. 385.407(b)(2) to make contact with the carrier at the 
beginning and end of each duty tour, and at the pickup and delivery of 
each permitted load. Contact may be by telephone, radio or via an 
electronic tracking or monitoring system. The motor carrier or driver 
must maintain a record of communications for 6 months after the initial 
acceptance of a shipment of hazardous material for which a safety permit 
is required. The record of communications must contain the name of the 
driver, identification of the vehicle, permitted material(s) being 
transported, and the date, location, and time of each contact required 
under this section.
    (2) The motor carrier should contact the Transportation Security 
Administration's Transportation Security Coordination Center (703-563-
3236 or 703-563-3237) at any time the motor carrier suspects its 
shipment of a hazardous material listed in Sec. 385.403 is lost, stolen 
or otherwise unaccounted for.


<R05>
Sec. 385.417  Is a motor carrier's safety permit number available to 
others?

    Upon request, a motor carrier must provide the number of its safety 
permit to a person who offers a hazardous material listed in Sec. 
385.403 for transportation in commerce. A motor carrier's permit number 
will also be available to the public on the FMCSA Safety and Fitness 
Electronic Records System at http://www.safersys.org.


<R05>
Sec. 385.419  How long is a safety permit effective?

    Unless suspended or revoked, a safety permit (other than a temporary 
safety permit) is effective for two years, except that:
    (a) A safety permit will be subject to revocation if a motor carrier 
fails to submit a renewal application (Form MCS-150B) in accordance with 
the schedule set forth for filing Form MCS-150 in Sec. 390.19(a) of 
this chapter; and
    (b) An existing safety permit will remain in effect pending FMCSA's 
processing of an application for renewal if a

[[Page 235]]

motor carrier submits the required application (Form MS-150B) in 
accordance with the schedule set forth in Sec. 390.19(a)(2) and (a)(3) 
of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 385.421  Under what circumstances will a safety permit be subject 
to revocation or suspension by FMCSA?

    (a) Grounds. A safety permit will be subject to revocation or 
suspension by FMCSA for the following reasons:
    (1) A motor carrier fails to submit a renewal application (Form MCS-
150B) in accordance with the schedule set forth in Sec. 390.19(a)(2) 
and (a)(3) of this chapter;
    (2) A motor carrier provides any false or misleading information on 
its application (Form MCS-150B), on Form MCS-150A (when required), or as 
part of updated information it is providing on Form MCS-150B (see Sec. 
385.405(d));
    (3) A motor carrier is issued a final safety rating that is less 
than Satisfactory;
    (4) A motor carrier fails to maintain a satisfactory security plan 
as set forth in Sec. 385.407(b);
    (5) A motor carrier fails to comply with applicable requirements in 
the FMCSRs, the HMRs, or compatible State requirements governing the 
transportation of hazardous materials, in a manner showing that the 
motor carrier is not fit to transport the hazardous materials listed in 
Sec. 385.403;
    (6) A motor carrier fails to comply with an out-of-service order;
    (7) A motor carrier fails to comply with any other order issued 
under the FMCSRs, the HMRs, or compatible State requirements governing 
the transportation of hazardous materials, in a manner showing that the 
motor carrier is not fit to transport the hazardous materials listed in 
Sec. 385.403;
    (8) A motor carrier fails to maintain the minimum financial 
responsibility required by Sec. 387.9 of this chapter or an applicable 
State requirement;
    (9) A motor carrier fails to maintain current hazardous materials 
registration with the Research and Special Programs Administration; or
    (10) A motor carrier loses its operating rights or has its 
registration suspended in accordance with Sec. 386.83 or Sec. 386.84 
of this chapter for failure to pay a civil penalty or abide by a payment 
plan.
    (b) Determining whether a safety permit is revoked or suspended. A 
motor carrier's safety permit will be suspended the first time any of 
the conditions specified in paragraph (a) of this section are found to 
apply to the motor carrier. A motor carrier's safety permit will be 
revoked if any of the conditions specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section are found to apply to the motor carrier and the carrier's safety 
permit has been suspended in the past for any of the reasons specified 
in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Effective date of suspension or revocation. A suspension or 
revocation of a safety permit is effective:
    (1) Immediately after FMCSA determines that an imminent hazard 
exists, after FMCSA issues a final safety rating that is less than 
Satisfactory, or after a motor carrier loses its operating rights or has 
its registration suspended for failure to pay a civil penalty or abide 
by a payment plan;
    (2) Thirty (30) days after service of a written notification that 
FMCSA proposes to suspend or revoke a safety permit, if the motor 
carrier does not submit a written request for administrative review 
within that time period; or
    (3) As specified in Sec. 385.423(c), when the motor carrier submits 
a written request for administrative review of FMCSA's proposal to 
suspend or revoke a safety permit.
    (4) A motor carrier whose safety permit has been revoked will not be 
issued a replacement safety permit or temporary safety permit for 365 
days from the time of revocation.


<R05>
Sec. 385.423  Does a motor carrier have a right to an administrative 
review of a denial, suspension, or revocation of a safety permit?

    A motor carrier has a right to an administrative review pursuant to 
the following procedures and conditions:
    (a) Less than Satisfactory safety rating. If a motor carrier is 
issued a proposed safety rating that is less than Satisfactory, it has 
the right to request (1) an administrative review of a proposed safety 
rating, as set forth in Sec. 385.15, and (2) a change to a proposed 
safety rating based on corrective action, as

[[Page 236]]

set forth in Sec. 385.17. After a motor carrier has had an opportunity 
for administrative review of, or change to, a proposed safety rating, 
FMCSA's issuance of a final safety rating constitutes final agency 
action, and a motor carrier has no right to further administrative 
review of FMCSA's denial, suspension, or revocation of a safety permit 
when the motor carrier has been issued a final safety rating that is 
less than Satisfactory.
    (b) Failure to pay civil penalty or abide by payment plan. If a 
motor carrier is notified that failure to pay a civil penalty will 
result in suspension or termination of its operating rights, it has the 
right to an administrative review of that proposed action in a show 
cause proceeding, as set forth in Sec. 386.83(b) or Sec. 386.84(b) of 
this chapter. The decision by FMCSA's Chief Safety Officer in the show 
cause proceeding constitutes final agency action, and a motor carrier 
has no right to further administrative review of FMCSA's denial, 
suspension, or revocation of a safety permit when the motor carrier has 
lost its operating rights or had its registration suspended for failure 
to pay a civil penalty or abide by a payment plan.
    (c) Other grounds. Under circumstances other than those set forth in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a motor carrier may submit a 
written request for administrative review within 30 days after service 
of a written notification that FMCSA has denied a safety permit, that 
FMCSA has immediately suspended or revoked a safety permit, or that 
FMCSA has proposed to suspend or revoke a safety permit. The rules for 
computing time limits for service and requests for extension of time in 
Sec. Sec. 386.31 and 386.33 of this chapter apply to the proceedings on 
a request for administrative review under this section.
    (1) The motor carrier must send or deliver its written request for 
administrative review to FMCSA Chief Safety Officer, with a copy to 
FMCSA Chief Counsel, at the following addresses:
    (i) FMCSA Chief Safety Officer, Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration, c/o Adjudications Counsel (MC-PSDCC), 400 Seventh 
Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590.
    (ii) FMCSA Chief Counsel, Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration, Office of the Chief Counsel, Room 8125, 400 Seventh 
Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590.
    (2) A request for administrative review must state the specific 
grounds for review and include all information, evidence, and arguments 
upon which the motor carrier relies to support its request for 
administrative review.
    (3) Within 30 days after service of a written request for 
administrative review, the Office of the Chief Counsel shall submit to 
the Chief Safety Officer a written response to the request for 
administrative review. The Office of the Chief Counsel must serve a copy 
of its written response on the motor carrier requesting administrative 
review.
    (4) The Chief Safety Officer may decide a motor carrier's request 
for administrative review on the written submissions, hold a hearing 
personally, or refer the request to an administrative law judge for a 
hearing and recommended decision. The Chief Safety Officer or 
administrative law judge is authorized to specify, and must notify the 
parties of, specific procedural rules to be followed in the proceeding 
(which may include the procedural rules in part 386 of this chapter that 
are considered appropriate).
    (5) If a request for administrative review is referred to an 
administrative law judge, the recommended decision of the administrative 
law judge becomes the final decision of the Chief Safety Officer 45 days 
after service of the recommended decision is served, unless either the 
motor carrier or the Office of the Chief Counsel submits a petition for 
review to the Chief Safety Officer (and serves a copy of its petition on 
the other party) within 15 days after service of the recommended 
decision. In response to a petition for review of a recommended decision 
of an administrative law judge:
    (i) The other party may submit a written reply within 15 days of 
service of the petition for review.
    (ii) The Chief Safety Officer may adopt, modify, or set aside the 
recommended decision of an administrative law judge, and may also remand

[[Page 237]]

the petition for review to the administrative law judge for further 
proceedings.
    (6) The Chief Safety Officer will issue a final decision on any 
request for administrative review when:
    (i) The request for administrative review has not been referred to 
an administrative law judge;
    (ii) A petition for review of a recommended decision by an 
administrative law judge has not been remanded to the administrative law 
judge for further proceedings; or
    (iii) An administrative law judge has held further proceedings on a 
petition for review and issued a supplementary recommended decision.
    (7) The decision of the Chief Safety Officer (including a 
recommended decision of an administrative law judge that becomes the 
decision of the Chief Safety Officer under paragraph (c)(5) of this 
section) constitutes final agency action, and there is no right to 
further administrative reconsideration or review.
    (8) Any appeal of a final agency action under this section must be 
taken to an appropriate United States Court of Appeals. Unless the Court 
of Appeals issues a stay pending appeal, the final agency action shall 
not be suspended while the appeal is pending.

 Appendix A to Part 385--Explanation of Safety Audit Evaluation Criteria

                               I. General

    (a) Section 210 of the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act (49 
U.S.C. 31144) directed the Secretary to establish a procedure whereby 
each owner and each operator granted new authority must undergo a safety 
review within 18 months after the owner or operator begins operations. 
The Secretary was also required to establish the elements of this safety 
review, including basic safety management controls. The Secretary, in 
turn, delegated this to the FMCSA.
    (b) To meet the safety standard, a motor carrier must demonstrate to 
the FMCSA that it has basic safety management controls in place which 
function adequately to ensure minimum acceptable compliance with the 
applicable safety requirements. A ``safety audit evaluation criteria'' 
was developed by the FMCSA, which uses data from the safety audit and 
roadside inspections to determine that each owner and each operator 
applicant for new entrant registration, provisional operating authority, 
or provisional Certificate of Registration has basic safety management 
controls in place. The term ``safety audit'' is the equivalent to the 
``safety review'' required by Sec. 210. Using ``safety audit'' avoids 
any possible confusion with the safety reviews previously conducted by 
the agency that were discontinued on September 30, 1994.
    (c) The safety audit evaluation process developed by the FMCSA is 
used to:
    1. Evaluate basic safety management controls and determine if each 
owner and each operator is able to operate safely in interstate 
commerce; and
    2. Identify owners and operators who are having safety problems and 
need improvement in their compliance with the FMCSRs and the HMRs, 
before they are granted permanent registration.

     II. Source of the Data for the Safety Audit Evaluation Criteria

    (a) The FMCSA's evaluation criteria are built upon the operational 
tool known as the safety audit. This tool was developed to assist 
auditors and investigators in assessing the adequacy of a new entrant's 
basic safety management controls.
    (b) The safety audit is a review of a Mexico-domiciled or new 
entrant motor carrier's operation and is used to:
    1. Determine if a carrier has the basic safety management controls 
required by 49 U.S.C. 31144;
    2. Meet the requirements of Section 350 of the DOT Appropriations 
Act; and
    3. In the event that a carrier is found not to be in compliance with 
applicable FMCSRs and HMRs, the safety audit can be used to educate the 
carrier on how to comply with U.S. safety rules.
    (c) Documents such as those contained in the driver qualification 
files, records of duty status, vehicle maintenance records, and other 
records are reviewed for compliance with the FMCSRs and HMRs. Violations 
are cited on the safety audit. Performance-based information, when 
available, is utilized to evaluate the carrier's compliance with the 
vehicle regulations. Recordable accident information is also collected.

  III. Determining if the Carrier Has Basic Safety Management Controls

    (a) During the safety audit, the FMCSA gathers information by 
reviewing a motor carrier's compliance with ``acute'' and ``critical'' 
regulations of the FMCSRs and HMRs.
    (b) Acute regulations are those where noncompliance is so severe as 
to require immediate corrective actions by a motor carrier regardless of 
the overall basic safety management controls of the motor carrier.
    (c) Critical regulations are those where noncompliance relates to 
management and/or operational controls. These are indicative

[[Page 238]]

of breakdowns in a carrier's management controls.
    (d) The list of the acute and critical regulations, which are used 
in determining if a carrier has basic safety management controls in 
place, is included in Appendix B, VII. List of Acute and Critical 
Regulations.
    (e) Noncompliance with acute and critical regulations are indicators 
of inadequate safety management controls and usually higher than average 
accident rates.
    (f) Parts of the FMCSRs and the HMRs having similar characteristics 
are combined together into six regulatory areas called ``factors.'' The 
regulatory factors, evaluated on the basis of the adequacy of the 
carrier's safety management controls, are:
    1. Factor 1--General: Parts 387 and 390;
    2. Factor 2--Driver: Parts 382, 383 and 391;
    3. Factor 3--Operational: Parts 392 and 395;
    4. Factor 4--Vehicle: Part 393, 396 and inspection data for the last 
12 months;
    5. Factor 5--Hazardous Materials: Parts 171, 177, 180 and 397; and
    6. Factor 6--Accident: Recordable Accident Rate per Million Miles.
    (g) For each instance of noncompliance with an acute regulation, 1.5 
points will be assessed.
    (h) For each instance of noncompliance with a critical regulation, 1 
point will be assessed.

                            A. Vehicle Factor

    (a) When at least three vehicle inspections are recorded in the 
Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS) during the twelve 
months before the safety audit or performed at the time of the review, 
the Vehicle Factor (Part 396) will be evaluated on the basis of the Out-
of-Service (OOS) rates and noncompliance with acute and critical 
regulations. The results of the review of the OOS rate will affect the 
Vehicle Factor as follows:
    1. If the motor carrier has had at least three roadside inspections 
in the twelve months before the safety audit, and the vehicle OOS rate 
is 34 percent or higher, one point will be assessed against the carrier. 
That point will be added to any other points assessed for discovered 
noncompliance with acute and critical regulations of part 396 to 
determine the carrier's level of safety management control for that 
factor; and
    2. If the motor carrier's vehicle OOS rate is less than 34 percent, 
or if there are less than three inspections, the determination of the 
carrier's level of safety management controls will only be based on 
discovered noncompliance with the acute and critical regulations of part 
396.
    (b) Over two million inspections occur on the roadside each year. 
This vehicle inspection information is retained in the MCMIS and is 
integral to evaluating motor carriers' ability to successfully maintain 
their vehicles, thus preventing them from being placed OOS during 
roadside inspections. Each safety audit will continue to have the 
requirements of part 396, Inspection, Repair, and Maintenance, reviewed 
as indicated by the above explanation.

                         B. The Accident Factor

    (a) In addition to the five regulatory factors, a sixth factor is 
included in the process to address the accident history of the motor 
carrier. This factor is the recordable accident rate, which the carrier 
has experienced during the past 12 months. Recordable accident, as 
defined in 49 CFR 390.5, means an accident involving a commercial motor 
vehicle operating on a public road in interstate or intrastate commerce 
which results in a fatality; a bodily injury to a person who, as a 
result of the injury, immediately receives medical treatment away from 
the scene of the accident; or one or more motor vehicles incurring 
disabling damage as a result of the accident requiring the motor vehicle 
to be transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other motor 
vehicle.
    (b) Experience has shown that urban carriers, those motor carriers 
operating entirely within a radius of less than 100 air miles (normally 
urban areas), have a higher exposure to accident situations because of 
their environment and normally have higher accident rates.
    (c) The recordable accident rate will be used in determining the 
carrier's basic safety management controls in Factor 6, Accident. It 
will be used only when a carrier incurs two or more recordable accidents 
within the 12 months before the safety audit. An urban carrier (a 
carrier operating entirely within a radius of 100 air miles) with a 
recordable rate per million miles greater than 1.7 will be deemed to 
have inadequate basic safety management controls for the accident 
factor. All other carriers with a recordable accident rate per million 
miles greater than 1.5 will be deemed to have inadequate basic safety 
management controls for the accident factor. The rates are the result of 
roughly doubling the national average accident rate in Fiscal Years 
1994, 1995, and 1996.
    (d) The FMCSA will continue to consider preventability when a new 
entrant contests the evaluation of the accident factor by presenting 
compelling evidence that the recordable rate is not a fair means of 
evaluating its accident factor. Preventability will be determined 
according to the following standard: ``If a driver, who exercises normal 
judgment and foresight, could have foreseen the possibility of the 
accident that in fact occurred, and avoided it by taking steps within 
his/her control which would not have risked causing another kind of 
mishap, the accident was preventable.''

[[Page 239]]

                            C. Factor Ratings

    For Factors 1 through 5, if the combined violations of acute and or 
critical regulations for each factor is equal to three or more points, 
the carrier is determined not to have basic safety management controls 
for that individual factor.
    If the recordable accident rate is greater than 1.7 recordable 
accidents per million miles for an urban carrier (1.5 for all other 
carriers), the carrier is determined to have inadequate basic safety 
management controls.

   IV. Overall Determination of the Carrier's Basic Safety Management 
                                Controls

    (a) If the carrier is evaluated as having inadequate basic safety 
management controls in at least three separate factors, the carrier will 
be considered to have inadequate safety management controls in place and 
corrective action will be necessary in order to avoid having its new 
entrant registration, provisional operating authority, or provisional 
Certificate of Registration revoked.
    (b)For example, FMCSA evaluates a carrier finding:
    (1) One instance of noncompliance with a critical regulation in part 
387 scoring one point for Factor 1;
    (2) Two instances of noncompliance with acute regulations in part 
382 scoring three points for Factor 2;
    (3) Three instances of noncompliance with critical regulations in 
part 396 scoring three points for Factor 4; and
    (4) Three instances of noncompliance with acute regulations in parts 
171 and 397 scoring four and one-half (4.5) points for Factor 5.
    (c) In this example, the carrier scored three or more points for 
Factors 2, 4 and 5 and FMCSA determined the carrier had inadequate basic 
safety management controls in at least three separate factors. FMCSA 
will require corrective action in order to avoid having the carrier's 
new entrant registration revoked, or having the provisional operating 
authority or provisional Certificate of Registration suspended and 
possibly revoked.

[67 FR 12773, Mar. 19, 2002, as amended a6 67 FR 31985, May 13, 2002]

      Appendix B to Part 385--Explanation of Safety Rating Process

    (a) Section 215 of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 (49 U.S.C. 
31144) directed the Secretary of Transportation to establish a procedure 
to determine the safety fitness of owners and operators of commercial 
motor vehicles operating in interstate or foreign commerce. The 
Secretary, in turn, delegated this responsibility to the Federal Motor 
Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).
    (b) As directed, FMCSA promulgated a safety fitness regulation, 
entitled ``Safety Fitness Procedures,'' which established a procedure to 
determine the safety fitness of motor carriers through the assignment of 
safety ratings and established a ``safety fitness standard'' which a 
motor carrier must meet to obtain a satisfactory safety rating.
    (c) Critical regulations are those identified as such where 
noncompliance relates to management and/or operational controls. These 
are indicative of breakdowns in a carrier's management controls. An 
example of a critical regulation is Sec. 395.3(a)(1), requiring or 
permitting a property-carrying commercial motor vehicle driver to drive 
more than 11 hours.
    (d) The safety rating process developed by FMCSA is used to:
    1. Evaluate safety fitness and assign one of three safety ratings 
(satisfactory, conditional or unsatisfactory) to motor carriers 
operating in interstate commerce. This process conforms to 49 CFR 385.5, 
Safety fitness standard, and Sec. 385.7, Factors to be considered in 
determining a safety rating.
    2. Identify motor carriers needing improvement in their compliance 
with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) and 
applicable Hazardous Material Regulations (HMRs). These are carriers 
rated unsatisfactory or conditional.
    (e) The hazardous materials safety permit requirements of part 385, 
subpart E apply to intrastate motor carriers. Intrastate motor carriers 
that are subject to the hazardous materials safety permit requirements 
in subpart E will be rated using equivalent State requirements whenever 
the FMCSRs are referenced in this appendix.

                I. Source of Data for Rating Methodology

    (a) The FMCSA's rating process is built upon the operational tool 
known as the CR. This tool was developed to assist Federal and State 
safety specialists in gathering pertinent motor carrier compliance and 
accident information.
    (b) The CR is an in-depth examination of a motor carrier's 
operations and is used (1) to rate unrated motor carriers, (2) to 
conduct a follow-up investigation on motor carriers rated unsatisfactory 
or conditional as a result of a previous review, (3) to investigate 
complaints, or (4) in response to a request by a motor carrier to 
reevaluate its safety rating. Documents such as those contained in 
driver qualification files, records of duty status, vehicle maintenance 
records, and other records are thoroughly examined for compliance with 
the FMCSRs and HMRs. Violations are cited on the CR document. 
Performance-based information, when available, is utilized to evaluate 
the carrier's compliance with the vehicle regulations. Recordable 
accident information is also collected.

[[Page 240]]

           II. Converting CR Information Into a Safety Rating

    (a) The FMCSA gathers information through an in-depth examination of 
the motor carrier's compliance with identified ``acute'' or ``critical'' 
regulations of the FMCSRs and HMRs.
    (b) Acute regulations are those identified as such where 
noncompliance is so severe as to require immediate corrective actions by 
a motor carrier regardless of the overall safety posture of the motor 
carrier. An example of an acute regulation is Sec. 383.37(b), allowing, 
requiring, permitting, or authorizing an employee with more than one 
Commercial Driver's License (CDL) to operate a commercial motor vehicle. 
Noncompliance with Sec. 383.37(b) is usually discovered when the motor 
carrier's driver qualification file reflects that the motor carrier had 
knowledge of a driver with more than one CDL, and still permitted the 
driver to operate a commercial motor vehicle. If the motor carrier did 
not have such knowledge or could not reasonably be expected to have such 
knowledge, then a violation would not be cited.
    (c) Critical regulations are those identified as such where 
noncompliance relates to management and/or operational controls. These 
are indicative of breakdowns in a carrier's management controls. An 
example of a critical regulation is Sec. 395.3(a)(1), requiring or 
permitting a property-carrying commercial motor vehicle driver to drive 
more than 11 hours.
    (d) The list of the acute and critical regulations which are used in 
determining safety ratings is included at the end of this document.
    (e) Noncompliance with acute regulations and patterns of non-
compliance with critical regulations are quantitatively linked to 
inadequate safety management controls and usually higher than average 
accident rates. The FMCSA has used noncompliance with acute regulations 
and patterns of noncompliance with critical regulations since 1989 to 
determine motor carriers' adherence to the Safety fitness standard in 
Sec. 385.5.
    (f) The regulatory factors, evaluated on the basis of the adequacy 
of the carrier's safety management controls, are (1) Parts 387 and 390; 
(2) Parts 382, 383 and 391; (3) Parts 392 and 395; (4) Parts 393 and 396 
when there are less than three vehicle inspections in the last 12 months 
to evaluate; and (5) Parts 397, 171, 177 and 180.
    (g) For each instance of noncompliance with an acute regulation or 
each pattern of noncompliance with a critical regulation during the CR, 
one point will be assessed. A pattern is more than one violation. When a 
number of documents are reviewed, the number of violations required to 
meet a pattern is equal to at least 10 percent of those examined.
    (h) However, each pattern of noncompliance with a critical 
regulation relative to Part 395, Hours of Service of Drivers, will be 
assessed two points.

                            A. Vehicle Factor

    (a) When a total of three or more inspections are recorded in the 
Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS) during the twelve 
months prior to the CR or performed at the time of the review, the 
Vehicle Factor (Parts 393 and 396) will be evaluated on the basis of the 
Out-of-Service (OOS) rates and noncompliance with acute regulations and/
or a pattern of noncompliance with critical regulations. The results of 
the review of the OOS rate will affect the Vehicle Factor rating as 
follows:
    1. If a motor carrier has three or more roadside vehicle inspections 
in the twelve months prior to the carrier review, or three vehicles 
inspected at the time of the review, or a combination of the two 
totaling three or more, and the vehicle OOS rate is 34 percent or 
greater, the initial factor rating will be conditional. The requirements 
of Part 396, Inspection, Repair, and Maintenance, will be examined 
during each review. The results of the examination could lower the 
factor rating to unsatisfactory if noncompliance with an acute 
regulation or a pattern of noncompliance with a critical regulation is 
discovered. If the examination of the Part 396 requirements reveals no 
such problems with the systems the motor carrier is required to maintain 
for compliance, the Vehicle Factor remains conditional.
    2. If a carrier's vehicle OOS rate is less than 34 percent, the 
initial factor rating will be satisfactory. If noncompliance with an 
acute regulation or a pattern of noncompliance with a critical 
regulation is discovered during the examination of Part 396 
requirements, the factor rating will be lowered to conditional. If the 
examination of Part 396 requirements discovers no such problems with the 
systems the motor carrier is required to maintain for compliance, the 
Vehicle Factor remains satisfactory.
    (b) Nearly two million vehicle inspections occur on the roadside 
each year. This vehicle inspection information is retained in the MCMIS 
and is integral to evaluating motor carriers' ability to successfully 
maintain their vehicles, thus preventing them from being placed OOS 
during roadside inspections. Since many of the roadside inspections are 
targeted to visibly defective vehicles and since there are a limited 
number of inspections for many motor carriers, the use of that data is 
limited. Each CR will continue to have the requirements of Part 396, 
Inspection, Repair, and Maintenance, reviewed as indicated by the above 
explanation.

[[Page 241]]

                           B. Accident Factor

    (a) In addition to the five regulatory rating factors, a sixth 
factor is included in the process to address the accident history of the 
motor carrier. This factor is the recordable accident rate which the 
carrier has experienced during the past 12 months. Recordable accident, 
as defined in 49 CFR 390.5, means an accident involving a commercial 
motor vehicle operating on a public road in interstate or intrastate 
commerce which results in a fatality; bodily injury to a person who, as 
a result of the injury, immediately receives medical treatment away from 
the scene of the accident; one or more motor vehicles incurring 
disabling damage as a result of the accident requiring the motor vehicle 
to be transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other motor 
vehicle.
    (b) Recordable accidents per million miles were computed for each CR 
performed in Fiscal Years 1994,1995 and 1996. The national average for 
all carriers rated was 0.747, and .839 for carriers operating entirely 
within the 100 air mile radius.
    (c) Experience has shown that urban carriers, those motor carriers 
operating primarily within a radius of less than 100 air miles (normally 
in urban areas) have a higher exposure to accident situations because of 
their environment and normally have higher accident rates.
    (d) The recordable accident rate will be used to rate Factor 6, 
Accident. It will be used only when a motor carrier incurs two or more 
recordable accidents occurred within the 12 months prior to the CR. An 
urban carrier (a carrier operating entirely within a radius of 100 air 
miles) with a recordable accident rate greater than 1.7 will receive an 
unsatisfactory rating for the accident factor. All other carriers with a 
recordable accident rate greater than 1.5 will receive an unsatisfactory 
factor rating. The rates are a result of roughly doubling the national 
average accident rate for each type of carrier rated in Fiscal Years 
1994, 1995 and 1996.
    (e) The FMCSA will continue to consider preventability when a motor 
carrier contests a rating by presenting compelling evidence that the 
recordable rate is not a fair means of evaluating its accident factor. 
Preventability will be determined according to the following standard: 
``If a driver, who exercises normal judgment and foresight could have 
foreseen the possibility of the accident that in fact occurred, and 
avoided it by taking steps within his/her control which would not have 
risked causing another kind of mishap, the accident was preventable.''

                            C. Factor Ratings

    (a) Parts of the FMCSRs and the HMRs having similar characteristics 
are combined together into five regulatory areas called ``factors.''
    (b) The following table shows the five regulatory factors, parts of 
the FMCSRs and HMRs associated with each factor, and the accident 
factor. Factor Ratings are determined as follows:

                                 Factors

Factor 1 General=Parts 387 and 390
Factor 2 Driver=Parts 382, 383 and 391
Factor 3 Operational=Parts 392 and 395
Factor 4 Vehicle=Parts 393 and 396
Factor 5 Haz. Mat.=Parts 397, 171, 177 and 180
Factor 6 Accident Factor=Recordable Rate

``Satisfactory''--if the acute and/or critical=0 points
``Conditional''--if the acute and/or critical=1 point
``Unsatisfactory''--if the acute and/or critical=2 or more points

                           III. Safety Rating

                             A. Rating Table

    (a) The ratings for the six factors are then entered into a rating 
table which establishes the motor carrier's safety rating.
    (b) The FMCSA has developed a computerized rating formula for 
assessing the information obtained from the CR document and is using 
that formula in assigning a safety rating.

                    Motor Carrier Safety Rating Table
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Factor ratings
-----------------------------------------------------   Overall  Safety
         Unsatisfactory               Conditional           rating
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0...............................  2 or fewer........  Satisfactory
0...............................  more than 2.......  Conditional
1...............................  2 or fewer........  Conditional
1...............................  more than 2.......  Unsatisfactory
2 or more.......................  0 or more.........  Unsatisfactory
------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        B. Proposed Safety Rating

    (a) The proposed safety rating will appear on the CR. The following 
appropriate information will appear after the last entry on the CR, MCS-
151, part B.
    ``Your proposed safety rating is SATISFACTORY.''

                                   OR

    ``Your proposed safety rating is CONDITIONAL.'' The proposed safety 
rating will become the final safety rating 45 days after you receive 
this notice.

                                   OR

    ``Your proposed safety rating is UNSATISFACTORY.'' The proposed 
safety rating will become the final safety rating 45 days after you 
receive this notice

[[Page 242]]

    (b) Proposed safety ratings of conditional or unsatisfactory will 
list the deficiencies discovered during the CR for which corrective 
actions must be taken.
    (c) Proposed unsatisfactory safety ratings will indicate that, if 
the unsatisfactory rating becomes final, the motor carrier will be 
subject to the provision of Sec. 385.13, which prohibits motor carriers 
rated unsatisfactory from transporting hazardous materials requiring 
placarding or more than 15 passengers, including the driver.

        IV. Assignment of Final Rating/Motor Carrier Notification

    When the official rating is determined in Washington, D.C., the 
FMCSA notifies the motor carrier in writing of its safety rating as 
prescribed in Sec. 385.11. A proposed conditional safety rating (which 
is an improvement of an existing unsatisfactory rating) becomes 
effective as soon as the official safety rating from Washington, D.C. is 
issued, and the carrier may also avail itself of relief under the Sec. 
385.15, Administrative Review and Sec. 385.17, Change to safety rating 
based on corrective actions.

        V. Motor Carrier Rights to a Change in the Safety Rating

    Under Sec. Sec. 385.15 and 385.17, motor carriers have the right to 
petition for a review of their ratings if there are factual or 
procedural disputes, and to request another review after corrective 
actions have been taken. They are the procedural avenues a motor carrier 
which believes its safety rating to be in error may exercise, and the 
means to request another review after corrective action has been taken.

                             VI. Conclusion

    (a) The FMCSA believes this ``safety fitness rating methodology'' is 
a reasonable approach for assigning a safety rating which best describes 
the current safety fitness posture of a motor carrier as required by the 
safety fitness regulations (Sec. 385.9). This methodology has the 
capability to incorporate regulatory changes as they occur.
    (b) Improved compliance with the regulations leads to an improved 
rating, which in turn increases safety. This increased safety is our 
regulatory goal.

Assistant Administrator's authority to assure that the complainant is 
not subject to harassment, intimidation, disciplinary action, 
discrimination, or financial loss as a result of such disclosure.

received, the Assistant Administrator may, on motion of any party, issue 
a final order in the proceeding.

    Effective Date Note: At 70 FR 28481, May 18, 2005, Sec. 386.14 was 
revised, effective November 14, 2005. For the convenience of the user, 
the revised text is set forth as follows:

Sec. 386.14  Reply.

    (a) Time for reply to the Notice of Claim. Respondent must serve a 
reply to the Notice of Claim in writing within 30 days following service 
of the Notice of Claim. The reply is to be served in accordance with 
Sec. 386.6 upon the Service Center indicated in the Notice of Claim.
    (b) Options for reply. The respondent must reply to the Notice of 
Claim within the time allotted by choosing one of the following:
    (1) Paying the full amount asserted in the Notice of Claim in 
accordance with Sec. 386.18 of this part;
    (2) Contesting the claim by requesting administrative adjudication 
pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section; or
    (3) Seeking binding arbitration in accordance with the Agency's 
program. Although the amount of the proposed penalty may be disputed, 
referral to binding arbitration is contingent upon an admission of 
liability that the violations occurred.
    (c) Failure to answer the Notice of Claim. (1) Respondent's failure 
to answer the Notice of Claim in accordance with paragraph (a) may 
result in the issuance of a Notice of Default and Final Agency Order by 
the Field Administrator. The Notice of Default and Final Agency Order 
will declare respondent to be in default and further declare the Notice 
of Claim, including the civil penalty proposed in the Notice of Claim, 
to be the Final Agency Order in the proceeding. The Final Agency Order 
will be effective five days following service of the Notice of Default 
and Final Agency Order.
    (2) The default constitutes an admission of all facts alleged in the 
Notice of Claim and a waiver of respondent's opportunity to contest the 
claim. The default will be reviewed by the Assistant Administrator in 
accordance with Sec. 386.64(b), and the Final Agency Order may be 
vacated where a respondent demonstrates excusable neglect, a meritorious 
defense, or due diligence in seeking relief.
    (3) Failure to pay the civil penalty as directed in a Final Agency 
Order constitutes a violation of that order, subjecting the respondent 
to an additional penalty as prescribed in Subpart G of this part.
    (d) Request for administrative adjudication. The respondent may 
contest the claim and request administrative adjudication pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section. An administrative adjudication is a 
process to resolve contested claims before the Assistant Administrator, 
Administrative Law Judge, or Hearing Officer. Once an administrative 
adjudication option is elected, it is binding on the respondent.
    (1) Contents. In addition to the general requirements of this 
section, the reply must be in writing and state the grounds for 
contesting the claim and must raise any affirmative defenses the 
respondent intends to assert. Specifically, the reply:
    (i) Must admit or deny each separately stated and numbered 
allegation of violation in the claim. A statement that the person is 
without sufficient knowledge or information to admit or deny will have 
the effect of a denial. Any allegation in the claim not specifically 
denied in the reply is deemed admitted. A mere general denial of the 
claim is insufficient and may result in a default being entered by the 
Agency decisionmaker upon motion by the Field Administrator.
    (ii) Must include all known affirmative defenses, including those 
relating to jurisdiction, limitations, and procedure.
    (iii) Must state which one of the following options respondent 
seeks:
    (A) To submit written evidence without hearing; or
    (B) An informal hearing; or
    (C) A formal hearing.
    (2) [Reserved]

<R05>
Sec. 386.16  Action on petitions or replies.

    (a) Replies not requesting an oral hearing. If the reply submitted 
does not request an oral hearing, the Assistant Administrator may issue 
a final decision and order based on the evidence and arguments 
submitted.
    (b) Request for oral hearing. If a request for an oral hearing has 
been filed, the Assistant Administrator shall determine whether there 
are any material factual issues in dispute. If there are, he/she shall 
call the matter for a hearing. If there are none, he/she shall issue an 
order to that effect and set a time for submission of argument by the 
parties. Upon the submission of argument he/she shall decide the case.
    (c) Settlement of civil forfeitures. (1) When negotiations produce 
an agreement as to the amount or terms of payment of a civil penalty or 
the terms and conditions of an order, a settlement agreement shall be 
drawn and signed by the respondent and the Assistant Administrator. Such 
settlement agreement must contain the following:
    (i) The statutory basis of the claim;
    (ii) A brief statement of the violations;
    (iii) The amount claimed and the amount paid;
    (iv) The date, time, and place and form of payment;
    (v) A statement that the agreement is not binding on the agency 
until executed by the Assistant Administrator; and
    (vi) A statement that failure to pay in accordance with the terms of 
the agreement which has been adopted as a Final Order will result in the 
loss of any reductions in penalties for claims found to be valid, and 
the original amount claimed will be due immediately.
    (2) Any settlement agreement may contain a consent order.
    (3) An executed settlement agreement is binding on the respondent 
and the claimant according to its terms. The respondent's consent to a 
settlement agreement that has not been executed by the Assistant 
Administrator may not be withdrawn for a period of 30 days after it is 
executed by the respondent.

    Effective Date Note: At 70 FR 28481, May 18, 2005, Sec. 386.16 was 
revised, effective November 14, 2005. For the convenience of the user, 
the revised text is set forth as follows:

Sec. 386.16  Action on replies to the Notice of Claim.

    (a) Requests to submit written evidence without a hearing. Where 
respondent has elected to submit written evidence in accordance with 
Sec. 386.14(d)(1)(iii)(A):
    (1) Agency Counsel must serve all written evidence and argument in 
support of the Notice of Claim no later than 60 days following service 
of respondent's reply. The written evidence and argument must be served 
on the Assistant Administrator in accordance with Sec. Sec. 386.6 and 
386.7. The submission must include all pleadings, notices, and other 
filings in the case to date.
    (2) Respondent will, not later than 45 days following service of 
Agency Counsel's written evidence and argument, serve its written 
evidence and argument on the Assistant Administrator in accordance with 
Sec. Sec. 386.6 and 386.7.
    (3) Agency Counsel may file a written response to respondent's 
submission. Any such submission must be filed within 20 days of service 
of respondent's submission.
    (4) All written evidence submitted by the parties must conform to 
the requirements of Sec. 386.49.
    (5) Following submission of evidence and argument as outlined in 
this section, the Assistant Administrator may issue a Final Agency Order 
and order based on the evidence and arguments submitted, or may issue 
any other order as may be necessary to adjudicate the matter.
    (b) Requests for hearing. (1) If a request for a formal or informal 
hearing has been filed, the Assistant Administrator will determine 
whether there exists a dispute of a material fact at issue in the 
matter. If so, the matter will be set for hearing in accordance with 
respondent's reply. If it is determined that there does not exist a 
dispute of a material fact at issue in the matter, the Assistant 
Administrator may issue a decision based on the written record, or may 
request the submission of further evidence or argument.
    (2) If a respondent requests a formal or informal hearing in its 
reply, the Field Administrator must serve upon the Assistant 
Administrator and respondent a notice of consent or objection with a 
basis to the request within 60 days of service of respondent's reply. 
Failure to serve an objection within the time allotted may result in 
referral of the matter to hearing.

[[Page 257]]

    (3) Requests for formal hearing. Following the filing of an 
objection with basis, the Field Administrator must serve a motion for 
Final Agency Order pursuant to Sec. 386.36 unless otherwise ordered by 
the Assistant Administrator. The motion must set forth the reasons why 
the Field Administrator is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
Respondent must, within 45 days of service of the motion for Final 
Agency Order, submit and serve a response to the Field Administrator's 
motion. After reviewing the record, the Assistant Administrator will 
either set the matter for hearing by referral to the Office of Hearings 
or issue a Final Agency Order based upon the submissions.
    (4) Requests for informal hearing.
    (i) If the Field Administrator objects with basis to a request for 
an informal hearing, he/she must serve the objection, a copy of the 
Notice of Claim, and a copy of respondent's reply, on the respondent and 
Assistant Administrator, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. 
Based upon the Notice of Claim, the reply, and the objection with basis, 
the Assistant Administrator will issue an order granting or denying the 
request for informal hearing.
    (A) Informal hearing granted. If the request for informal hearing is 
granted by the Assistant Administrator, a Hearing Officer will be 
assigned to hear the matter and will set forth the date, time and 
location for hearing. No further motions will be entertained, and no 
discovery will be allowed. At hearing, all parties may present evidence, 
written and oral, to the Hearing Officer, following which the Hearing 
Officer will issue a report to the Assistant Administrator containing 
findings of fact and recommending a disposition of the matter. The 
report will serve as the sole record of the proceedings. The Assistant 
Administrator may issue a Final Agency Order adopting the report, or 
issue other such orders as he/she may deem appropriate. By participating 
in an informal hearing, respondent waives its right to a formal hearing.
    (B) Informal hearing denied. If the request for informal hearing is 
denied, the Field Administrator must serve a motion for Final Agency 
Order pursuant to Sec. 386.36, unless otherwise directed by the 
Assistant Administrator. The motion must set forth the reasons why the 
Field Administrator is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
Respondent must, within 45 days of service of the motion for Final 
Agency Order, submit and serve a response to the Field Administrator's 
motion. After reviewing the record, the Assistant Administrator will set 
the matter for formal hearing by referral to the Office of Hearings, or 
will issue a Final Agency Order based upon the submissions.
    (C) Nothing in this section shall limit the Assistant 
Administrator's authority to refer any matter for formal hearing, even 
in instances where respondent seeks only an informal hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 386.17  Intervention.

    After the matter is called for hearing and before the date set for 
the hearing to begin, any person may petition for leave to intervene. 
The petition is to be served on the administrative law judge. The 
petition must set forth the reasons why the petitioner alleges he/she is 
entitled to intervene. The petition must be served on all parties in 
accordance with Sec. 386.31. Any party may file a response within 10 
days of service of the petition. The administrative law judge shall then 
determine whether to permit or deny the petition. The petition will be 
allowed if the administrative law judge determines that the final 
decision could directly and adversely affect the petitioner or the class 
he/she represents, and if the petitioner may contribute materially to 
the disposition of the proceedings and his/her interest is not 
adequately represented by existing parties. Once admitted, a petitioner 
is a party for the purpose of all subsequent proceedings.

Sec. 386.18  Payment of the claim.

    Effective Date Note: At 70 FR 28482, May 18, 2005, Sec. 368.18 was 
added, effective November 14, 2005.
    (a) Payment of the full amount claimed may be made at any time 
before issuance of a Final Agency Order. After the issuance of a Final 
Agency Order, claims are subject to interest, penalties, and 
administrative charges in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717; 49 CFR part 
89; and 31 CFR 901.9.
    (b) If respondent elects to pay the full amount as its response to 
the Notice of Claim, payment must be served upon the Field Administrator 
at the Service Center designated in the Notice of Claim within 30 days 
following service of the Notice of Claim. No written reply is necessary 
if respondent elects the payment option during the 30-day reply period. 
Failure to serve full payment within 30 days of service of the Notice of 
Claim when this option has been chosen may constitute a default and may 
result in the Notice of

[[Page 258]]

Claim, including the civil penalty assessed by the Notice of Claim, 
becoming the Final Agency Order in the proceeding pursuant to Sec. 
386.14(c).
    (c) Unless objected to in writing, submitted at the time of payment, 
payment of the full amount in response to the Notice of Claim 
constitutes an admission by the respondent of all facts alleged in the 
Notice of Claim. Payment waives respondent's opportunity to further 
contest the claim, and will result in the Notice of Claim becoming the 
Final Agency Order.

of Claim, in which case the original amount asserted will be due 
immediately; and
    (vii) A statement that the agreement is the Final Agency Order.
    (2) A settlement agreement may contain any conditions, actions, or

settlement agreement which has not yet been approved by the Assistant 
Administrator or Administrative Law Judge may not be withdrawn for a 
period of 30 days.

the parties have agreed to a settlement at any time prior to the case 
coming before the Agency decisionmaker, the parties may execute an

Administrator, who may accept it, reject it and direct that proceedings 
in the case continue, or take such other action as he/she deems 
appropriate. If the Assistant Administrator accepts the agreement, he/
she shall enter an order in accordance with its terms. The settlement 
agreement becomes the Final Agency Order as of the date the Assistant 
Administrator enters an order accepting the settlement agreement.
    (d) Civil Penalty Proceedings before Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). 
When a respondent has agreed to a settlement of a civil penalty before 
the hearing is concluded, the parties may execute an appropriate 
agreement for disposing of the case by consent for the consideration of 
the ALJ. The agreement is filed with the ALJ who may accept it, reject 
it, and direct that proceedings in the case continue, or take such other 
action as he/she deems appropriate. If the ALJ accepts the agreement, 
he/she shall enter an order in accordance with its terms. The settlement 
agreement becomes the Final Agency Order as per Sec. 386.61.
    (e) Civil Penalty Proceedings before Hearing Officer. When a 
respondent has agreed to a settlement of a civil penalty before the 
hearing is concluded, the parties may execute an appropriate agreement 
for disposal of the case for the consideration of the Hearing Officer. 
The agreement is filed with the Hearing Officer, who, within 20 days of 
receipt, will make a report and recommendation to the Assistant 
Administrator who may accept it, reject it, and direct that proceedings 
in the case continue, or take such other action as he/she deems 
appropriate. If the Assistant Administrator accepts the agreement, he/
she will enter an order in accordance with its terms. The settlement

    Effective Date Note: At 70 FR 28483, May 18, 2005, Sec. 386.37 was 
revised, effective November 14, 2005. For the convenience of the user, 
the revised text is set forth as follows:

Sec. 386.37  Discovery.

    (a) Parties may obtain discovery by one or more of the following

the Assistant Administrator or referred to the Office of Hearings.
    (c) Except as otherwise provided in these rules, in the 
Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., or by the Assistant 
Administrator or Administrative Law Judge, in the absence of specific 
Agency provisions or regulations, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
may serve as guidance in administrative adjudications.


<R05>
Sec. 386.38  Scope of discovery.

    (a) Unless otherwise limited by order of the Assistant Administrator 
or, in cases that have been called for a hearing, the administrative law 
judge, in accordance with these rules, the parties may obtain discovery 
regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject 
matter involved in the proceeding, including the existence, description, 
nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or 
other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having 
knowledge of any discoverable matter.
    (b) It is not ground for objection that information sought will not

otherwise discoverable under paragraph (a) of this section and prepared 
in anticipation of or for the hearing by or for another party's 
representative (including his or her attorney, consultant, surety,

seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials in the 
preparation of his or her case and that he or she is unable without 
undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by 
other means. In ordering discovery of such materials when the required 
showing has been made, the Assistant Administrator or the administrative 
law judge shall protect against disclosure of the mental impressions, 
conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other 
representative of a party concerning the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 386.39  Protective orders.

    Upon motion by a party or other person from whom discovery is

which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, including one or 
more of the following:
    (a) The discovery not be had;
    (b) The discovery may be had only on specified terms and conditions, 
including a designation of the time or place;
    (c) The discovery may be had only by a method of discovery other 
than that selected by the party seeking discovery;
    (d) Certain matters not relevant may not be inquired into, or that 
the scope of discovery be limited to certain matters;

designated by the Assistant Administrator or the administrative law 
judge; or
    (f) A trade secret or other confidential research, development, or 
commercial information may not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a 
designated way.

<R05>
Sec. 386.40  Supplementation of responses.

    A party who has responded to a request for discovery with a response 
that was complete when made is under no duty to supplement his/her 
response to include information thereafter acquired, except as follows:
    (a) A party is under a duty to supplement timely his/her response 
with respect to any question directly addressed to:
    (1) The identity and location of persons having knowledge of 
discoverable matters; and
    (2) The identity of each person expected to be called as an expert 
witness at the hearing, the subject matter on which he or she is 
expected to testify and the substance of his or her testimony.
    (b) A party is under a duty to amend timely a prior response if he 
or she later obtains information upon the basis of which:
    (1) he or she knows the response was incorrect when made; or
    (2) he or she knows that the response though correct when made is no 
longer true and the circumstances are such that a failure to amend the 
response is in substance a knowing concealment.
    (c) A duty to supplement responses may be imposed by order of the 
Assistant Administrator or the administrative law judge or agreement of 
the parties.


<R05>
Sec. 386.41  Stipulations regarding discovery.

    Unless otherwise ordered, a written stipulation entered into by all 
the parties and filed with the Assistant Administrator or the 
administrative law judge, if one has been appointed, may:
    (a) Provide that depositions be taken before any person, at any time 
or place, upon sufficient notice, and in any manner, and when so taken 
may be used like other depositions, and
    (b) Modify the procedures provided by these rules for other methods 
of discovery.


<R05>
Sec. 386.42  Written interrogatories to parties.

    (a) Any party may serve upon any other party written interrogatories 
to be answered in writing by the party served, or if the party served is 
a public or private corporation or a partnership or association or 
governmental agency, by any authorized officer or agent, who shall 
furnish such information as is available to the party. A copy of the 
interrogatories, answers, and all related pleadings shall be served on 
the Assistant Administrator or, in cases that have been called to a 
hearing, on the administrative law judge, and upon all parties to the 
proceeding.
    (b) Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in 
writing under oath or affirmation, unless it is objected to, in which 
event the reasons for objection shall be stated in lieu of an answer. 
The answers and objections shall be signed by the person making them. 
The party upon whom the interrogatories were served shall serve a copy 
of the answer and objections upon all parties to the proceeding within 
30 days after service of the interrogatories, or within such shortened 
or longer period as the Assistant Administrator or the administrative 
law judge may allow.
    (c) An interrogatory otherwise proper is not necessarily 
objectionable merely because an answer to the interrogatory involves an 
opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to 
fact, but the Assistant Administrator or administrative law judge may 
order that such an interrogatory need not be answered until after 
designated discovery has been completed or until a prehearing conference 
or other later time.

    Effective Date Note: At 70 FR 28483, May 18, 2005, Sec. 386.42 was

Sec. 386.42  Written interrogatories to parties.

    (a) Without leave, any party may serve upon any other party written 
interrogatories to be answered by the party to whom the interrogatories

partnership or association or governmental agency, by any officer or 
agent, who will furnish the information available to that party.
    (b) The maximum number of interrogatories served will not exceed 30, 
including all subparts, unless the Assistant Administrator or 
Administrative Law Judge permits a larger number on motion and for good 
cause shown. Other interrogatories may be added without leave, so long 
as the total

[[Page 264]]

number of approved and additional interrogatories does not exceed 30.
    (c) Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in 
writing under oath unless it is objected to, in which event the grounds 
for objection shall be stated and signed by the party, or counsel for 
the party, if represented, making the response. The party to whom the 
interrogatories are directed shall serve the answers and any objections 
within 30 days after the service of the interrogatories, or within such 
shortened or longer period as the Assistant Administrator or the 
Administrative Law Judge may allow.
    (d) Motions to compel may be made in accordance with Sec. 386.45.
    (e) A notice of discovery must be served on the Assistant 
Administrator or, in cases that have been referred to the Office of 
Hearings, on the Administrative Law Judge. A copy of the 
interrogatories, answers, and all related pleadings must be served on 
all parties to the proceeding.
    (f) An interrogatory otherwise proper is not necessarily 
objectionable merely because an answer to the interrogatory involves an 
opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to 
fact, but the Assistant Administrator or Administrative Law Judge may 
order that such an interrogatory need not be answered until after 
designated discovery has been completed or until a prehearing conference 
or other later time.


<R05>
Sec. 386.43  Production of documents and other evidence; entry upon land 
for inspection and other purposes; and physical and mental examination.

    (a) Any party may serve on any other party a request to:
    (1) Produce and permit the party making the request, or a person 
acting on his or her behalf, to inspect and copy any designated 
documents, or to inspect and copy, test, or sample any tangible things 
which are in the possession, custody, or control of the party upon whom 
the request is served; or
    (2) Permit entry upon designated land or other property in the 
possession or control of the party upon whom the request is served for 
the purpose of inspection and measuring, photographing, testing, or for 
other purposes as stated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (3) Submit to a physical or mental examination by a physician.
    (b) The request may be served on any party without leave of the 
Assistant Administrator or administrative law judge.
    (c) The request shall:
    (1) Set forth the items to be inspected either by individual item or 
category;
    (2) Describe each item or category with reasonable particularity;
    (3) Specify a reasonable time, place, and manner of making the 
inspection and performing the related acts;
    (4) Specify the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the 
physical or mental examination and the person or persons by whom it is 
to be made. A report of examining physician shall be made in accordance 
with Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, title 28, U.S. 
Code, as amended.
    (d) The party upon whom the request is served shall serve on the 
party submitting the request a written response within 30 days after 
service of the request.
    (e) The response shall state, with respect to each item or category:

requested; or
    (2) That objection is made in whole or in part, in which case the 
reasons for objection shall be stated.
    (f) A copy of each request for production and each written response 
shall be served on all parties and filed with the Assistant 
Administrator or the administrative law judge, if one has been 
appointed.


<R05>
Sec. 386.44  Request for admissions.

    (a) Request for admission. (1) Any party may serve upon any other 
party a request for admission of any relevant matter or the authenticity 
of any relevant document. Copies of any document about which an 
admission is requested must accompany the request.
    (2) Each matter for which an admission is requested shall be 
separately set forth and numbered. The matter is admitted unless within 
15 days after service of the request, the party to whom the request is 
directed serves upon the party requesting the admission a written answer 
signed by the party or his/her attorney.
    (3) Each answer must specify whether the party admits or denies the 
matter. If the matter cannot be admitted or denied, the party shall set 
out in detail the reasons.

[[Page 265]]

    (4) A party may not issue a denial or fail to answer on the ground 
that he/she lacks knowledge unless he/she has made reasonable inquiry to 
ascertain information sufficient to allow him/her to admit or deny.
    (5) A party may file an objection to a request for admission within 
10 days after service. Such motion shall be filed with the 
administrative law judge if one has been appointed, otherwise it shall 
be filed with the Assistant Administrator. An objection must explain in 
detail the reasons the party should not answer. A reply to the objection 
may be served by the party requesting the admission within 10 days after 
service of the objection. It is not sufficient ground for objection to 
claim that the matter about which an admission is requested presents an 
issue of fact for hearing.
    (b) Effect of admission. Any matter admitted is conclusively 
established unless the Assistant Administrator or administrative law 
judge permits withdrawal or amendment. Any admission under this rule is 
for the purpose of the pending action only and may not be used in any 
other proceeding.
    (c) If a party refuses to admit a matter or the authenticity of a 
document which is later proved, the party requesting the admission may 
move for an award of expenses incurred in making the proof. Such a 
motion shall be granted unless there was a good reason for failure to 
admit.


<R05>
Sec. 386.45  Motion to compel discovery.

    (a) If a deponent fails to answer a question propounded or a party 
upon whom a request is made pursuant to Sec. Sec. 386.42 through 
386.44, or a party upon whom interrogatories are served fails to respond 
adequately or objects to the request, or any part thereof, or fails to 
permit inspection as requested, the discovering party may move the 
Assistant Administrator or the administrative law judge, if one has been 
appointed, for an order compelling a response or inspection in 
accordance with the request.
    (b) The motion shall set forth:
    (1) The nature of the questions or request;
    (2) The response or objections of the party upon whom the request 
was served; and
    (3) Arguments in support of the motion.
    (c) For purposes of this section, an evasive answer or incomplete 
answer or response shall be treated as a failure to answer or respond.
    (d) In ruling on a motion made pursuant to this section, the 
Assistant Administrator or the administrative law judge, if one has been 
appointed, may make and enter a protective order such as he or she is 
authorized to enter on a motion made pursuant to Sec. 386.39(a).


<R05>
Sec. 386.46  Depositions.

    (a) When, how, and by whom taken. The deposition of any witness may

witness shall indicate to the witness and all other parties the time 
when, the place where, and the name and post office address of the 
person before whom the deposition is to be taken; the name and address 
of each witness; and the subject matter concerning which each such 
witness is expected to testify.
    (c) Notice. Notice shall be given for the taking of a deposition, 
which shall be not less than 5 days written notice when the deposition 
is to be taken within the continental United States and not less than 20 
days written notice when the deposition is to be taken elsewhere.
    (d) Taking and receiving in evidence. Each witness testifying upon 
deposition shall be sworn, and any other party shall have the right to 
cross-examine. The questions propounded and the answers thereto, 
together with all objections made, shall be reduced to writing; read by 
or to, and subscribed by the witness; and certified by the person 
administering the oath. Thereafter, such officer shall seal the 
deposition in an envelope and mail the same by certified mail to the 
Assistant Administrator or the administrative law judge, if one has been 
appointed. Subject to such objections to the questions

[[Page 266]]

and answers as were noted at the time of taking the deposition and which 
would have been valid if the witness were personally present and 
testifying, such deposition may be read and offered in evidence by the 
party taking it as against any party who was present or represented at 
the taking of the deposition or who had due notice thereof.
    (e) Motion to terminate or limit examination. During the taking of a 
deposition, a party or deponent may request suspension of the deposition 
on grounds of bad faith in the conduct of the examination, oppression of 
a deponent or party or improper questions propounded. The deposition 
will then be adjourned. However, the objecting party or deponent must 
immediately move the Assistant Administrator or administrative law judge 
for a ruling on his or her objections to the deposition conduct or 
proceedings. The Assistant Administrator or administrative law judge may 
then limit the scope or manner of the taking of the deposition.

    Effective Date Note: At 70 FR 28484, May 18, 2005, Sec. 386.46 was 
revised, effective November 14, 2005. For the convenience of the user, 
the revised text is set forth as follows:

Sec. 386.46  Depositions.

    (a) When, how, and by whom taken.
    (1) The deposition of any witness may be taken at reasonable times 
subsequent to the appointment of an Administrative Law Judge. Prior to 
referral to the Office of Hearings, a party may petition the Assistant 
Administrator, in accordance with Sec. 386.37, for leave to conduct a 
deposition based on good cause shown.
    (2) Depositions may be taken by oral examination or upon written 
interrogatories before any person having power to administer oaths.
    (3) The parties may stipulate in writing or the Administrative Law 
Judge may upon motion order that a deposition be taken by telephone or 
other remote electronic means.
    (4) If a subpoena duces tecum is to be served on the person to be 
examined, the designation of the materials to be produced as set forth 
in the subpoena shall be attached to, or included in, the notice.
    (5) If the deposition is to be recorded by videotape or audiotape, 
the notice shall specify the method of recording.
    (b) Application. Any party desiring to take the deposition of a 
witness must indicate to the witness and all other parties the time 
when, the place where, and the name and post office address of the 
person before whom the deposition is to be taken; the name and address 
of each witness; and the subject matter concerning which each such 
witness is expected to testify.
    (c) Notice. A party desiring to take a deposition must give notice 
to the witness and all other parties. Notice must be in writing. Notice 
of the deposition must be given not less than 20 days from when the 
deposition is to be taken if the deposition is to be held within the 
continental United States and not less than 30 days from when the 
deposition is to be taken if the deposition is to be held elsewhere, 
unless a shorter time is agreed to by the parties or by leave of the 
Assistant Administrator or Administrative Law Judge by motion for good 
cause shown.
    (d) Depositions upon written questions. Within 14 days after the 
notice and written questions are served, a party may serve cross-
questions upon all other parties. Within 7 days after being served with 
cross-questions, a party may serve redirect questions upon all other 
parties. Within 7 days after being served with redirect questions, a 
party may serve recross questions upon all other parties. The Assistant 
Administrator or Administrative Law Judge may enlarge or shorten the 
time for cause shown.
    (e) Taking and receiving in evidence. Each witness testifying upon 
deposition must be sworn, and any other party must be given the right to 
cross-examine. The questions propounded and the answers to them, 
together with all objections made, must be reduced to writing; read by 
or to, and subscribed by the witness; and certified by the person 
administering the oath. The person who took the deposition must seal the 
deposition transcript in an envelope and file it in accordance with 
Sec. 386.7. Subject to objections to the questions and answers as were 
noted at the time of taking the deposition and which would have been 
valid if the witness were personally present and testifying, the 
deposition may be read and offered in evidence by the party taking it as 
against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the 
deposition or who had due notice of it.
    (f) Witness Limit. No party may seek deposition testimony of more 
than five witnesses without leave of the Agency decisionmaker for good 
cause shown. Individual depositions are not to exceed 8 hours for any 
one witness.
    (g) Motion to terminate or limit examination. During the taking of a 
deposition, a party or deponent may request suspension of the deposition 
on grounds of bad faith in the conduct of the examination, oppression of 
a deponent or party or improper questions propounded. The deposition 
will then be adjourned. The objecting party or deponent must, however, 
immediately move for a ruling on his or her objections to the deposition 
conduct or proceedings before the Assistant

[[Page 267]]

Administrator or Administrative Law Judge, who then may limit the scope 
or manner of the taking of the deposition.


<R05>
Sec. 386.47  Use of deposition at hearings.

    (a) Generally. At the hearing, any part or all of a deposition, so 
far as admissible under the rules of evidence, may be used against any 
party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or 
who had due notice thereof in accordance with any one of the following 
provisions:
    (1) Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of 
contradicting or impeaching the testimony of the deponent as a witness.
    (2) The deposition of expert witnesses, particularly the deposition 
of physicians, may be used by any party for any purpose, unless the 
Assistant Administrator or administrative law judge rules that such use 
would be unfair or a violation of due process.
    (3) The deposition of a party or of anyone who at the time of taking 
the deposition was an officer, director, or duly authorized agent of a 
public or private organization, partnership, or association which is a 
party, may be used by any other party for any purpose.
    (4) The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used 
by any party for any purpose if the presiding officer finds:
    (i) That the witness is dead; or
    (ii) That the witness is out of the United States or more than 100 
miles from the place of hearing unless it appears that the absence of 
the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition; or
    (iii) That the witness is unable to attend to testify because of 
age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or
    (iv) That the party offering the deposition has been unable to 
procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or
    (v) Upon application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances 
exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due 
regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally 
in open hearing, to allow the deposition to be used.
    (5) If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, 
any other party may require him or her to introduce all of it which is 
relevant to the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other 
parts.
    (b) Objections to admissibility. Except as provided in this 
paragraph, objection may be made at the hearing to receiving in evidence 
any deposition or part thereof for any reason which would require the 
exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present and 
testifying.
    (1) Objections to the competency of a witness or to the competency, 
relevancy or materiality of testimony are not waived by failure to make 
them before or during the taking of the deposition, unless the ground of 
the objection is one which might have been obviated or removed if 
presented at that time.
    (2) Errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examination in 
the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the questions or 
answers, in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of parties and 
errors of any kind which might be obviated, removed, or cured if 
promptly presented, are waived unless reasonable objection thereto is 
made at the taking of the deposition.
    (3) Objections to the form or written interrogatories are waived 
unless served in writing upon the party propounding them.
    (c) Effect of taking using depositions. A party shall not be deemed 
to make a person his or her own witness for any purpose by taking his or 
her deposition. The introduction in evidence of the deposition or any 
part thereof for any purpose other than that of contradicting or 
impeaching the deponent makes the deponent the witness of the party 
introducing the deposition, but this shall not apply to the use by any 
other party of a deposition as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section. At the hearing, any party may rebut any relevant evidence 
contained in a deposition whether introduced by him or her or by any 
other party.


<R05>

    In cases involving the physical qualifications of drivers, copies of 
all physicians' reports, test results, and other medical records that a 
party intends to rely upon shall be served on all other parties at least 
30 days prior to the

[[Page 268]]

Truck and Bus Standards and Operations, reports, test results and 
medical records not served under this rule shall be excluded from 
evidence at any hearing.

Sec. 386.52  Appeals from interlocutory rulings.

    (a) General. Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, a party may 
not appeal a ruling or decision of the Administrative Law Judge to the 
Assistant Administrator until the Administrative Law Judge's decision 
has been entered on the record. A decision or order of the Assistant 
Administrator on the interlocutory appeal does not constitute a Final 
Agency Order for the purposes of judicial review under Sec. 386.67.
    (b) Interlocutory appeal for cause. If a party files a written 
request for an interlocutory appeal for cause with the Administrative 
Law Judge, or orally requests an interlocutory appeal for cause, the 
proceedings are stayed until the Administrative Law Judge issues a 
decision on the request. If the Administrative Law Judge grants the 
request, the proceedings are stayed until the Assistant Administrator 
issues a decision on the interlocutory appeal. The Administrative Law 
Judge must grant an interlocutory appeal for cause if a party shows that 
delay of the appeal would be detrimental to the public interest or would 
result in undue prejudice to any party.
    (d) Procedure. A party must file a notice of interlocutory appeal, 
with any supporting documents, with the Assistant Administrator, and 
serve copies on each party and the Administrative Law Judge, not later 
than 10 days after the Administrative Law Judge's oral decision has been 
issued, or a written decision has been served. A party must file a reply 
brief, if any, with the Assistant Administrator and serve a copy of the 
reply brief on each party, not later than 10 days after service of the 
appeal brief. The Assistant Administrator will render a decision on the 
interlocutory appeal, within a reasonable time after receipt of the 
interlocutory appeal.
    (e) The Assistant Administrator may reject frivolous, repetitive, or 
dilatory appeals, and may issue an order precluding one or more parties 
from making further interlocutory appeals, and may order such further 
relief as required.

general relevance and reasonable scope of the evidence sought. Any 
person served with a subpoena may, within 7 days after service, file a 
motion to quash or modify. The motion must be filed with the official 
who approved the subpoena. The filing of a motion shall stay the effect 
of the subpoena until a decision is reached.
    (b) Witnesses shall be entitled to the same fees and mileage as are 
paid witnesses in the courts of the United States. The fees shall be 
paid by the party at whose instance the witness is subpoenaed or 
appears.
    (c) Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to the 
Administrator or employees of the FMCSA or to the production of 
documents in their custody. Applications for the attendance of such 
persons or the production of such documents at a hearing shall be made 
to the Assistant Administrator or administrative law judge, if one is 
appointed, and shall set forth the need for such evidence and its 
relevancy.

    (b) In the event a Notice of Default and Final Agency Order is 
issued by the Field Administrator as a result of the respondent's 
failure to reply in accordance with Sec. 386.14(a), the only issue that

bring an action in the appropriate United States District Court for such 
relief as is necessary or appropriate, including mandatory or 
prohibitive injunctive relief, interim equitable relief, and punitive 
damages, as provided by section 213(c) of the Motor Carrier Safety Act 
of 1984 and section 111(a) of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act 
(49 U.S.C. 507(c), 5122).

    Whenever it is determined that a person has engaged, or is about to 
engage, in any act or practice constituting a violation of section 31502 
of title 49, United States Code; of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 
1984; the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act; or any regulation or 
order issued under that section or those Acts for which the Federal 
Motor Carrier Safety Administrator exercises enforcement responsibility, 
the Chief Counsel may request the United States Attorney General to

relief as is necessary or appropriate, including mandatory or 
prohibitive injunctive relief, interim equitable relief, and punitive 
damages, as provided by section 213(c) of the Motor Carrier Safety Act

Sec. 386.72  Imminent hazard.

    (a) Whenever it is determined that an imminent hazard exists as a 
result of the transportation by motor vehicle of a particular hazardous 
material, the Chief Counsel or Deputy Chief Counsel of the FMCSA may 
bring, or request the United States Attorney General to bring, an action 
in the appropriate United States District Court for an order suspending 
or restricting the transportation by motor vehicle of the hazardous 
material or for such other order as is necessary to eliminate or 
ameliorate the imminent hazard, as provided by 49 U.S.C. 5122. In this 
paragraph, ``imminent hazard'' means the existence of a condition that 
presents a substantial likelihood that death, serious illness, severe 
personal injury, or a substantial endangerment to health, property, or 
the environment may occur before a notice of investigation proceeding, 
or other administrative hearing or formal proceeding, to abate the risk 
of harm can be completed.
    (b)(1) Whenever it is determined that a violation of 49 U.S.C. 31502 
or the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984, as

[[Page 274]]

amended, or the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986, as amended, 
or a regulation issued under such section or Acts, or a combination of 
such violations, poses an imminent hazard to safety, the Director of the 
Office of Enforcement and Compliance or a State Director, or his or her 
delegate, shall order a vehicle or employee operating such vehicle out 
of service, or order an employer to cease all or part of the employer's 
commercial motor vehicle operations, as provided by 49 U.S.C. 521(b)(5). 
In making any such order, no restrictions shall be imposed on any 
employee or employer beyond that required to abate the hazard. In this 
paragraph, ``imminent hazard'' means any condition of vehicle, employee, 
or commercial motor vehicle operations which substantially increases the 
likelihood of serious injury or death if not discontinued immediately.
    (2) Upon the issuance of an order under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, the motor carrier employer or driver employee shall comply 
immediately with such order. Opportunity for review shall be provided in 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554, except that such review shall occur not 
later than 10 days after issuance of such order, as provided by section 
213(b) of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 (49 U.S.C. 521(b)(5)). An 
order to an employer to cease all or part of its operations shall not 
prevent vehicles in transit at the time the order is served from 
proceeding to their immediate destinations, unless any such vehicle or 
its driver is specifically ordered out of service forthwith. However, 
vehicles and drivers proceeding to their immediate destination shall be 
subject to compliance upon arrival.
    (3) For purposes of this section the term ``immediate destination'' 
is the next scheduled stop of the vehicle already in motion where the 
cargo on board can be safely secured.
    (4) Failure to comply immediately with an order issued under this 
section shall subject the motor carrier employer or driver to penalties 
prescribed in subpart G of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 386.81  General.

    (a) The amounts of civil penalties that can be assessed for 
regulatory violations subject to the proceedings in this subchapter are 
established in the statutes granting enforcement powers. The 
determination of the actual civil penalties assessed in each proceeding 
is based on those defined limits or minimums and consideration of 
information available at the time the claim is made concerning the 
nature, gravity of the violation and, with respect to the violator, the 
degree of culpability, history of prior offenses, ability to pay, effect 
on ability to continue to do business, and such other matters as justice 
and public safety may require. In addition to these factors, a civil 
penalty assessed under 49 U.S.C. 14901(a) and (d) concerning household 
goods is also based on the degree of harm caused to a shipper and 
whether the shipper has been adequately compensated before institution 
of the civil penalty proceeding. In adjudicating the claims and orders 
under the administrative procedures herein, additional information may 
be developed regarding these factors that may affect the final amount of 
the claim.
    (b) When assessing penalties for violations of notices and orders or 
settling claims based on these assessments, consideration will be given

    Effective Date Note: At 70 FR 28486, May 18, 2005, Sec. 386.82 was 
amended by revising paragraph (a)(3), effective November 14, 2005. For 
the convenience of the user the revised text is set forth as follows:

Sec. 386.82  Civil penalties for violations of notices and orders.

    (a) Additional civil penalties are chargeable for violations of 
notices and orders which are issued under civil forfeiture proceedings 
pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 521(b). These notices and orders are as follows:

                                * * * * *

    (3) Final order--Sec. 386.14, Sec. 386.17, Sec. 386.22, and Sec. 
386.61; and


<R05>
Sec. 386.83  Sanction for failure to pay civil penalties or abide by 
payment plan; operation in interstate commerce prohibited.

    (a)(1) General rule. A CMV owner or operator that fails to pay a 
civil penalty in full within 90 days after the date specified for 
payment by the FMCSA's final agency order is prohibited from operating 
in interstate commerce starting on the next (i.e., the 91st) day. The 
prohibition continues until the FMCSA has received full payment of the 
penalty.
    (2) Civil penalties paid in installments. The FMCSA Service Center 
may allow a CMV owner or operator to pay a civil penalty in 
installments. If the CMV owner or operator fails to make an installment 
payment on schedule, the payment plan is void and the entire debt is 
payable immediately. A CMV owner or operator that fails to pay the full 
outstanding balance of its civil penalty within 90 days after the date 
of the missed installment payment, is prohibited from operating in 
interstate commerce on the next (i.e., the 91st) day. The prohibition 
continues until the FMCSA has received full payment of the entire 
penalty.
    (3) Appeals to Federal Court. If the CMV owner or operator appeals 
the final agency order to a Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, the terms 
and payment due date of the final agency order are not stayed unless the 
Court so directs.
    (b) Show Cause Proceeding. (1) The FMCSA will notify a CMV owner or 
operator in writing if it has not received payment within 45 days after 
the date specified for payment by the final agency order or the date of 
a missed installment payment. The notice will include a warning that 
failure to pay the entire penalty within 90 days after payment was due, 
will result in the CMV owner or operator being prohibited from operating 
in interstate commerce.
    (2) The notice will order the CMV owner or operator to show cause 
why it should not be prohibited from operating in interstate commerce on 
the 91st day after the date specified for payment. The prohibition may 
be avoided only by submitting to the Chief Safety Officer:
    (i) Evidence that the respondent has paid the entire amount due; or
    (ii) Evidence that the respondent has filed for bankruptcy under 
chapter 11, title 11, United States Code. Respondents in bankruptcy must 
also submit the information required by paragraph (d) of this section.
    (3) The notice will be delivered by certified mail or commercial 
express service. If a CMV owner's or operator's principal place of 
business is in a foreign country, the notice will be delivered to the 
CMV owner's or operator's designated agent.
    (c) A CMV owner or operator that continues to operate in interstate 
commerce in violation of this section may

[[Page 276]]

be subject to additional sanctions under paragraph IV (h) of appendix A 
to part 386.
    (d) This section does not apply to any person who is unable to pay a 
civil penalty because the person is a debtor in a case under chapter 11, 
title 11, United States Code. CMV owners or operators in bankruptcy 
proceedings under chapter 11 must provide the following information in 
their response to the FMCSA:
    (1) The chapter of the Bankruptcy Code under which the bankruptcy 
proceeding is filed (i.e., chapter 7 or 11);
    (2) The bankruptcy case number;
    (3) The court in which the bankruptcy proceeding was filed; and
    (4) Any other information requested by the agency to determine a 
debtor's bankruptcy status.

Sec. 386.84  Sanction for failure to pay civil penalties or abide by 
payment plan; suspension or revocation of registration.

    (a)(1) General rule. The registration of a broker, freight 
forwarder, or for-hire motor carrier that fails to pay a civil penalty 
in full within 90 days after the date specified for payment by the 
FMCSA's final agency order, will be suspended starting on the next 
(i.e., the 91st) day. The suspension continues until the FMCSA has 
received full payment of the penalty.
    (2) Civil penalties paid in installments. The FMCSA Service Center 
may allow a respondent broker, freight forwarder, or for-hire motor 
carrier to pay a civil penalty in installments. If the respondent fails 
to make an installment payment on schedule, the payment plan is void and 
the entire debt is payable immediately. The registration of a respondent 
that fails to pay the remainder of its civil penalty in full within 90 
days after the date of the missed installment payment, is suspended on 
the next (i.e., the 91st) day. The suspension continues until the FMCSA 
has received full payment of entire penalty.
    (3) Appeals to Federal Court. If the respondent broker, freight 
forwarder, or for-hire motor carrier appeals the final agency order to a 
Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, the terms and payment due date of the 
final agency order are not stayed unless the Court so directs.
    (b) Show Cause Proceeding. (1) The FMCSA will notify a respondent 
broker, freight forwarder, or for-hire motor carrier in writing if it 
has not received payment within 45 days after the date specified for 
payment by the final agency order or the date of a missed installment 
payment. The notice will include a warning that failure to pay the 
entire penalty within 90 days after payment was due, will result in the 
suspension of the respondent's registration.
    (2) The notice will order the respondent to show cause why its 
registration should not be suspended on the 91st day after the date 
specified for payment. The prohibition may be avoided only by submitting 
to the Chief Safety Officer:
    (i) Evidence that the respondent has paid the entire amount due; or
    (ii) Evidence that the respondent has filed for bankruptcy under 
chapter 11, title 11, United States Code. Respondents in bankruptcy must 
also submit the information required by paragraph (d) of this section.
    (3) The notice will be delivered by certified mail or commercial 
express service. If a respondent's principal place of business is in a 
foreign country, it will be delivered to the respondent's designated 
agent.
    (c) The registration of a broker, freight forwarder or for-hire 
motor carrier that continues to operate in interstate commerce in 
violation of this section after its registration has been suspended may 
be revoked after an additional notice and opportunity for a proceeding 
in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 13905(c). Additional sanctions may be 
imposed under paragraph IV (h) of appendix A to part 386.
    (d) This section does not apply to any person who is unable to pay a 
civil penalty because the person is a debtor in a case under chapter 11, 
title 11, United States Code. Brokers, freight forwarders, or for-hire 
motor carriers in bankruptcy proceedings under chapter 11 must provide 
the following information in their response to the FMCSA:
    (1) The chapter of the Bankruptcy Code under which the bankruptcy 
proceeding is filed (i.e., chapter 7 or 11);

[[Page 277]]

    (2) The bankruptcy case number;
    (3) The court in which the bankruptcy proceeding was filed; and
    (4) Any other information requested by the agency to determine a 
debtor's bankruptcy status.

title III, chapter 10, Sec. 31001, par. (s), 110 Stat. 1321-373] amended 
the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 to require 
agencies to adjust for inflation ``each civil monetary penalty provided 
by law within the jurisdiction of the Federal agency * * *'' and to 
publish that regulation in the Federal Register. Pursuant to that 
authority, the inflation-adjusted civil penalties listed in paragraphs 
(a) through (g) of this appendix supersede the corresponding civil 
penalty amounts listed in title 49, United States Code.
    What are the types of violations and maximum monetary penalties?
    (a) Violations of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations 
(FMCSRs).
    (1) Recordkeeping. A person or entity that fails to prepare or 
maintain a record required by parts 385 and 390-399 of this subchapter, 
or prepares or maintains a required record that is incomplete, 
inaccurate, or false, is subject to a maximum civil penalty of $550 for 
each day the violation continues, up to $5,500.
    (2) Knowing falsification of records. A person or entity that

business fact or transaction, or knowingly makes, prepares, or preserves 
a record in violation of a regulation or order of the Secretary is 
subject to a maximum civil penalty of $5,500 if such action 
misrepresents a fact that constitutes a violation other than a reporting 
or recordkeeping violation.
    (3) Non-recordkeeping violations. A person or entity who violates 
parts 385 or 390-399 of this subchapter, except a recordkeeping 
requirement, is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $11,000 for

hours for violating the alcohol prohibitions of 49 CFR 392.5(a) or (b) 
who drives during that period is subject to a civil penalty not to 
exceed $3,750 for each violation.
    (b) Commercial driver's license (CDL) violations. Any person who

orders by CDL-holders. A CDL-holder who is convicted of violating an 
out-of-service order shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less 
than $2,100 nor more than $3,750. An employer of a CDL-holder who 
knowingly allows, requires, permits, or authorizes that employee to

out-of-service order, is subject to a civil penalty of not less than 
$3,750 or more than $16,000.
    (d) Financial responsibility violations. A motor carrier that fails 
to maintain the levels of financial responsibility prescribed by Part 
387 of this subchapter is subject to a maximum penalty of $16,000 for 
each violation. Each day of a continuing violation constitutes a 
separate offense.
    (e) Violations of the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMRs) and 
Safety Permitting Regulations found in subpart E of Part 385. This 
paragraph applies to violations by motor carriers, drivers, shippers and 
other persons who transport hazardous materials on the highway in

unsatisfactory safety rating. A motor carrier operating a commercial 
motor vehicle in interstate commerce after receiving a final 
unsatisfactory safety rating is subject to a civil penalty of not more 
than $11,000 (49 CFR 385.13). Each day the transportation continues 
constitutes a separate offense.

a carrier that is a corporation is also a violation by the corporation 
to which the penalties of Chapter 149 apply. Acts and omissions of 
individuals acting in the scope of their employment with a carrier are 
considered to be the actions and omissions of the carrier as well as the 
individual.
    (20) In a proceeding begun under 49 U.S.C. 14902 or 14903, the rate 
that a carrier publishes, files, or participates in under section 13702 
is conclusive proof against the carrier, its officers, and agents that 
it is the legal rate for the transportation or service. Departing, or 
offering to depart, from that published or filed rate is a violation of 
49 U.S.C. 14902 and 14903.

for transporting property, or any combination thereof.
Bodily Injury means injury to the body, sickness, or disease to any

Environmental Restoration means restitution for the loss, damage, or 
destruction of natural resources arising out of the accidental

Property Damage means damage to or loss of use of tangible property.
Public Liability means liability for bodily injury, property damage, and

    The insurance policy to which this endorsement is attached provides

the rules and regulations of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration.
    In consideration of the premium stated in the policy to which this

against the insured for public liability resulting from negligence in 
the operation, maintenance or use of motor vehicles subject to the

Carrier Act of 1980 regardless of whether or not each motor vehicle is 
specifically described in the policy and whether or not such negligence 
occurs on any route or in any territory authorized to be served by the 
insured or elsewhere. Such insurance as is afforded, for public 
liability, does not apply to injury to or death of the insured's 
employees while engaged in the course of their employment, or property 
transported by the insured, designated as cargo. It is understood and 
agreed that no condition, provision, stipulation, or limitation 
contained in the policy, this endorsement, or any other endorsement 
thereon, or violation thereof, shall relieve the company from liability 
or from the payment of any final judgment, within the limits of 
liability herein described, irrespective of the financial condition, 
insolvency or bankruptcy of the insured. However, all terms, conditions, 
and limitations in the policy to which the endorsement is attached shall 
remain in full force and effect as binding between the insured and the 
company. The insured agrees to reimburse the company for any payment 
made by the company on account of any accident, claim, or suit involving 
a breach of the terms of the policy, and for any payment that the 
company would not have been obligated to make under the provisions of 
the policy except for the agreement contained in this endorsement.
    It is further understood and agreed that, upon failure of the 
company to pay any final judgment recovered against the insured as 
provided herein, the judgment creditor may

[[Page 286]]

maintain an action in any court of competent jurisdiction against the 
company to compel such payment.
    The limits of the company's liability for the amounts prescribed in 
this endorsement apply separately to each accident and any payment under 
the policy because of any one accident shall not operate to reduce the 
liability of the company for the payment of final judgments resulting 
from any other accident.

    Purpose-- This is an agreement between the Surety and the Principal

responsible for the payment of any final judgment or judgments against 
the Principal for public liability, property damage, and environmental 
restoration liability claims in the sums prescribed herein; subject to 
the governing provisions and the following conditions.
    Governing provisions--(1) Sections 29 and 30 of the Motor Carrier 
Act of 1980 (49 U.S.C. 13906).
    (2) Rules and regulations of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration.

persons who shall recover a final judgment or judgments against the 
Principal for public liability, property damage, or environmental 
restoration liability claims (excluding injury to or death of the 
Principal's employees while engaged in the course of their employment, 
and loss of or damange to property of the principal, and the cargo 
transported by the Principal). If every final judgment shall be paid for 
such claims resulting from the negligent operation, maintenance, or use 
of motor vehicles in transportation subject to the applicable governing 
provisions, then this obligation shall be void, otherwise it will remain

    Within the limits described herein, the Surety extends to such 
losses regardless of whether such motor vehicles are specifically

*Note: The effective date of the current required minimum limit in Sec. 387.303(b)(2) was January 6, 1983, in
  accordance with the requirements of Pub. L. 97-424, 96 Stat. 2097.

    (3) Motor carriers subject to the minimum limits governed by this 
section, which are also subject to Department of Transportation limits 
requirements, are at no time required to have security for more than the 
required minimum limits established by the Secretary of Transportation 
in the applicable provisions of 49 CFR Part 387--Minimum Levels of 
Financial Responsibility for Motor Carriers.
    (4) Foreign motor carriers and foreign motor private carriers. 
Foreign motor carriers and foreign motor private carriers (Mexican), 
subject to the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 13902(c) and 49 CFR part 368 
regarding obtaining certificates of registration from the FMCSA, must 
meet our minimum financial responsibility requirements by obtaining 
insurance coverage, in the required amounts, for periods of 24 hours or 
longer, from insurance or surety companies, that meet the requirements 
of 49 CFR 387.315. These carriers must have available for inspection, in 
each vehicle operating in the United States, copies of the following 
documents:
    (i) The certificate of registration;
    (ii) The required insurance endorsement (Form MCS-90); and
    (iii) An insurance identification card, binder, or other document 
issued by an authorized insurer which specifies both the effective date 
and the expiration date of the insurance coverage.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 387.301(a)(1), the filing of 
evidence of insurance is not required as a condition to the issuance of 
a certificate of registration. Further, the reference to continuous 
coverage at Sec. 387.313(a)(6) and the reference to cancellation notice 
at Sec. 387.313(d) are not applicable to these carriers.
    (c) Motor common carriers: Cargo liability. Security required to 
compensate shippers or consignees for loss or damage to property 
belonging to shippers or consignees and coming into the possession of

(2) for less of or damage to or aggregate of losses or damages of or to 
property occurring at any one time and place--$10,000.

tractor is engaged solely in drawing the trailer or semitrailer, and (b) 
a truck and trailer when both together bear a single load.


<R05>
Sec. 387.307  Property broker surety bond or trust fund.

    (a) Security. A property broker must have a surety bond or trust 
fund in effect for $10,000. The FMCSA will not issue a property broker 
license until a surety bond or trust fund for the full

[[Page 295]]

limits of liability prescribed herein is in effect. The broker license 
shall remain valid or effective only as long as a surety bond or trust 
fund remains in effect and shall ensure the financial responsibility of 
the broker.
    (b) Evidence of Security. Evidence of a surety bond must be filed 
using the FMCSA's prescribed Form BMC 84. Evidence of a trust fund with 
a financial institution must be filed using the FMCSA's prescribed Form 
BMC 85. The surety bond or the trust fund shall ensure the financial 
responsibility of the broker by providing for payments to shippers or 
motor carriers if the broker fails to carry out its contracts, 
agreements, or arrangements for the supplying of transportation by 
authorized motor carriers.
    (c) Financial Institution--when used in this section and in forms 
prescribed under this section, where not otherwise distinctly expressed 
or manifestly incompatible with the intent thereof, shall mean--Each 
agent, agency, branch or office within the United States of any person, 
as defined by the ICC Termination Act, doing business in one or more of 
the capacities listed below:
    (1) An insured bank (as defined in section 3(h) of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(h));
    (2) A commercial bank or trust company;
    (3) An agency or branch of a foreign bank in the United States;
    (4) An insured institution (as defined in section 401(a) of the 
National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1724(a));
    (5) A thrift institution (savings bank, building and loan 
association, credit union, industrial bank or other);
    (6) An insurance company;
    (7) A loan or finance company; or
    (8) A person subject to supervision by any state or federal bank 
supervisory authority.
    (d) Forms and Procedures--(1) Forms for broker surety bonds and 
trust agreements. Form BMC-84 broker surety bond will be filed with the 
FMCSA for the full security limits under subsection (a); or Form BMC-85 
broker trust fund agreement will be filed with the FMCSA for the full 
security limits under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) Broker surety bonds and trust fund agreements in effect 
continuously. Surety bonds and trust fund agreements shall specify that 
coverage thereunder will remain in effect continuously until terminated 
as herein provided.
    (i) Cancellation notice. The surety bond and the trust fund 
agreement may be cancelled as only upon 30 days' written notice to the 
FMCSA, on prescribed Form BMC 36, by the principal or surety for the 
surety bond, and on prescribed Form BMC 85, by the trustor/broker or 
trustee for the trust fund agreement. The notice period commences upon 
the actual receipt of the notice at the FMCSA's Washington, DC office.
    (ii) Termination by replacement. Broker surety bonds or trust fund 
agreements which have been accepted by the FMCSA under these rules may 
be replaced by other surety bonds or trust fund agreements, and the 
liability of the retiring surety or trustee under such surety bond or 
trust fund agreements shall be considered as having terminated as of the 
effective date of the replacement surety bond or trust fund agreement. 
However, such termination shall not affect the liability of the surety 
or the trustee hereunder for the payment of any damages arising as the 
result of contracts, agreements or arrangements made by the broker for 
the supplying of transportation prior to the date such termination 
becomes effective.
    (3) Filing and copies. Broker surety bonds and trust fund agreements 
must be filed with the FMCSA in duplicate.

Sec. 387.309  Qualifications as a self-insurer and other securities or 
agreements.

    (a) As a self-insurer. The FMCSA will consider and will approve, 
subject to appropriate and reasonable conditions, the application of a 
motor carrier to qualify as a self-insurer, if the carrier furnishes a 
true and accurate statement of its financial condition and other 
evidence that establishes to the satisfaction of the FMCSA the ability 
of the motor carrier to satisfy its obligation for bodily injury 
liability, property damage liability, or cargo liability. Application 
Guidelines: In addition

[[Page 296]]

to filing Form BMC 40, applicants for authority to self-insure against 
bodily injury and property damage claims should submit evidence that 
will allow the FMCSA to determine:
    (1) The adequacy of the tangible net worth of the motor carrier in 
relation to the size of operations and the extent of its request for 
self-insurance authority. Applicant should demonstrate that it will 
maintain a net worth that will ensure that it will be able to meet its 
statutory obligations to the public to indemnify all claimants in the 
event of loss.
    (2) The existence of a sound self-insurance program. Applicant 
should demonstrate that it has established, and will maintain, an 
insurance program that will protect the public against all claims to the 
same extent as the minimum security limits applicable to applicant under 
Sec. 387.303 of this part. Such a program may include, but not be 
limited to, one or more of the following: Irrevocable letters of credit; 
irrevocable trust funds; reserves; sinking funds; third-party financial 
guarantees, parent company or affiliate sureties; excess insurance 
coverage; or other similar arrangements.
    (3) The existence of an adequate safety program. Applicant must 
submit evidence of a current ``satisfactory'' safety rating by the 
United States Department of Transportation. Non-rated carriers need only 
certify that they have not been rated. Applications by carriers with a 
less than satisfactory rating will be summarily denied. Any self-
insurance authority granted by the FMCSA will automatically expire 30 
days after a carrier receives a less than satisfactory rating from DOT.
    (4) Additional information. Applicant must submit such additional 
information to support its application as the FMCSA may require.
    (b) Other securities or agreements. The FMCSA also will consider 
applications for approval of other securities or agreements and will 
approve any such application if satisfied that the security or agreement 
offered will afford the security for protection of the public 
contemplated by 49 U.S.C. 13906.

<R05>
Sec. 387.311  Bonds and certificates of insurance.

    (a) Public liability. Each Form BMC 82 surety bond filed with the 
FMCSA must be for the full limits of liability required under Sec. 
387.303(b)(1). Form MCS-82 surety bonds and other forms of similar 
import prescribed by the Department of Transportation, may be aggregated 
to comply with the minimum security limits required under Sec. 
387.303(b)(1) or Sec. 387.303(b)(2). Each Form BMC 91 certificate of 
insurance filed with the FMCSA will always represent the full security 
minimum limits required for the particular carrier, while it remains in 
force, under Sec. 387.303(b)(1) or Sec. 387.303(b)(2), whichever is 
applicable. Any previously executed Form BMC 91 filed before the current 
revision which is left on file with the FMCSA after the effective date 
of this regulation, and not canceled within 30 days of that date will be 
deemed to certify the same coverage limits as would the filing of a 
revised Form BMC 91. Each Form BMC 91X certificate of insurance filed 
with the FMCSA will represent the full security limits under Sec. 
387.303(b)(1) or Sec. 387.303(b)(2) or the specific security limits of 
coverage as indicated on the face of the form. If the filing reflects 
aggregation, the certificate must show clearly whether the insurance is 
primary or, if excess coverage, the amount of underlying coverage as 
well as amount of the maximum limits of coverage. * Each Form BMC 91MX 
certificate of insurance filed with the FMCSA will represent the 
security limits of coverage as indicated on the face of the form. The 
Form BMC 91MX must show clearly whether the insurance is primary or, if 
excess coverage, the amount of underlying coverage as

[[Page 297]]

well as amount of the maximum limits of coverage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    *Note: Aggregation to meet the requirement of Sec. 387.303(b)(1) 
will not be allowed until the completion of our rulemaking in Ex Parte 
No. MC-5 (Sub-No. 2), Motor Carrier and Freight Forwarder Insurance 
Procedures and Minimum Amounts of Liability.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Cargo Liability. Each form BMC 83 surety bond filed with the 
FMCSA must be for the full limits of liability required under Sec. 
387.303(c). Each Form BMC 34 certificate of insurance filed with the 
FMCSA will represent the full security limits under Sec. 387.303(c) or 
the specific security limits of coverage as indicated on the face of the 
form. If the filing reflects aggregation, the certificate must show 
clearly whether the insurance is primary or, if excess coverage, the 
amount of underlying coverage as well as amount of the maximum limits of 
coverage.
    (c) Each policy of insurance in connection with the certificate of 
insurance which is filed with the FMCSA, shall be amended by attachment 
of the appropriate endorsement prescribed by the FMCSA and the 
certificate of insurance filed must accurately reflect that endorsement.

<R05>
Sec. 387.313  Forms and procedures.

    (a) Forms for endorsements, certificates of insurance and others. 
(1) In form prescribed. Endorsements for policies of insurance and 
surety bonds, certificates of insurance, applications to qualify as a 
self-insurer, or for approval of other securities or agreements, and 
notices of cancellation must be in the form prescribed and approved by 
the FMCSA.
    (2) Aggregation of Insurance.** When insurance is provided by more 
than one insurer in order to aggregate security limits for carriers 
operating only freight vehicles under 10,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight 
Rating, as defined in Sec. 387.303(b)(1), a separate Form BMC 90, with 
the specific amounts of underlying and limits of coverage shown thereon 
or appended thereto, and Form BMC 91X certificate is required of each 
insurer.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **Note: See Note for Rule 387.311. Also, it should be noted that DOT 
is considering prescribing adaptations of the Form MCS 90 endorsement 
and the Form MCS 82 surety bond for use by passenger carriers and Rules 
Sec. Sec. 387.311 and 387.313 have been written sufficiently broad to 
provide for this contingency when new forms are prescribed by that 
Agency.

For aggregation of insurance for all other carriers to cover security 
limits under Sec. 387.303 (b)(1) or (b)(2), a separate Department of 
Transportation prescribed form endorsement and Form BMC 91X certificate 
is required of each insurer. When insurance is provided by more than one 
insurer to aggregate coverage for security limits under Sec. 387.303(c) 
a separate Form BMC 32 endorsement and Form BMC 34 certificate of 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
insurance is required for each insurer.

For aggregation of insurance for foreign motor private carriers of 
nonhazardous commodities to cover security limits under Sec. 
387.303(b)(4), a separate Form BMC 90 with the specific amounts of 
underlying and limits of coverage shown thereon or appended thereto, or 
Department of Transportation prescribed form endorsement, and Form BMC 
91MX certificate is required for each insurer.

    (3) Use of Certificates and Endorsements in BMC Series. Form BMC 91 
certificates of insurance will be filed with the FMCSA for the full 
security limits under Sec. 387.303 (b)(1) or (b)(2).

Form BMC 91X certificate of insurance will be filed to represent full 
coverage or any level of aggregation for the security limits under Sec. 
387.303 (b)(1) or (b)(2).

Form BMC 90 endorsement will be used with each filing of Form BMC 91 or 
Form 91X certificate with the FMCSA which certifies to coverage not 
governed by the requirements of the Department of Transportation. Form 
BMC 32 endorsement and Form BMC 34 certificate of insurance and Form BMC 
83 surety bonds are used for the limits of cargo liability under Sec. 
387.303(c).

Form BMC 91MX certificate of insurance will be filed to represent any 
level of aggregation for the security limits under Sec. 387.303(b)(4).

    (4) Use of Endorsements in MCS Series. When Security limits 
certified under Sec. 387.303 (b)(1) or (b)(2) involves coverage also 
required by the Department of Transportation a Form MCS endorsement 
prescribed by the Department of Transportation such as, and including,

[[Page 298]]

the Form MCS 90 endorsement is required.
    (5) Surety bonds. When surety bonds are used rather than 
certificates of insurance, Form BMC 82 is required for the security 
limits under Sec. 387.303(b)(1) not subject to regulation by the 
Department of Transportation, and Form MCS 82, or any form of similar 
import prescribed by the Department of Transportation, is used for the 
security limits subject also to minimum coverage requirements of the 
Department of Transportation.
    (6) Surety bonds and certificates in effect continuously. Surety 
bonds and certificates of insurance shall specify that coverage 
thereunder will remain in effect continuously until terminated as herein 
provided, except: (1) When filed expressly to fill prior gaps or lapses 
in coverage or to cover grants of emergency temporary authority of 
unusually short duration and the filing clearly so indicates, or (2) in 
special or unusual circumstances, when special permission is obtained 
for filing certificates of insurance or surety bonds on terms meeting 
other particular needs of the situation.
    (b) Filing and copies. Certificates of insurance, surety bonds, and 
notices of cancellation must be filed with the FMCSA in triplicate.
    (c) Name of insured. Certificates of insurance and surety bonds 
shall be issued in the full and correct name of the individual, 
partnership, corporation or other person to whom the certificate, 
permit, or license is, or is to be, issued. In the case of a 
partnership, all partners shall be named.
    (d) Cancellation notice. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this 
section, surety bonds, certificates of insurance and other securities or 
agreements shall not be cancelled or withdrawn until 30 days after 
written notice has been submitted to the FMCSA at its offices in 
Washington, DC, on the prescribed form (Form BMC-35, Notice of 
Cancellation Motor Carrier Policies of Insurance under 49 U.S.C. 13906, 
and BMC-36, Notice of Cancellation Motor Carrier and Broker Surety 
Bonds, as appropriate) by the insurance company, surety or sureties, 
motor carrier, broker or other party thereto, as the case may be, which 
period of thirty (30) days shall commence to run from the date such 
notice on the prescribed form is actually received by the FMCSA.
    (e) Termination by replacement. Certificates of insurance or surety 
bonds which have been accepted by the FMCSA under these rules may be 
replaced by other certificates of insurance, surety bonds or other 
security, and the liability of the retiring insurer or surety under such 
certificates of insurance or surety bonds shall be considered as having 
terminated as of the effective date of the replacement certificate of 
insurance, surety bond or other security, provided the said replacement 
certificate, bond or other security is acceptable to the FMCSA under the 
rules and regulations in this part.

the FMCSA unless issued by an insurance or surety company that is 
authorized (licensed or admitted) to issue bonds or underlying insurance 
policies:
    (a) In each state in which the motor carrier is authorized by the 
FMCSA to operate, or
    (b) In the state in which the motor carrier has its principal place 
of business or domicile, and will designate in writing upon request by 
the FMCSA, a person upon whom process, issued by or under the authority 
of a court of competent jurisdiction, may be served in any proceeding at 
law or equity brought in any state in which the carrier operates, or
    (c) In any state, and is eligible as an excess or surplus lines 
insurer in any state in which business is written, and will make the 
designation of process agent described in paragraph (b) of this section.

of any surety bond, certificate of insurance, qualifications as a self-
insurer, or other securities or agreements if, in its judgment such 
security does not comply with these sections or for any reason fails to

of acceptance of any certificate of insurance, surety bond or other 
security shall not relieve the motor carrier from compliance with Sec.

Sec. 387.319  Fiduciaries.

    (a) Definitions. The terms ``insured'' and ``principal'' as used in 
a certificate of insurance, surety bond, and notice of cancellation, 
filed by or for a motor carrier, include the motor carrier and its 
fiduciary as of the moment of succession. The term ``fiduciary'' means 
any person authorized by law to collect and preserve property of 
incapacitated, financially disabled, bankrupt, or deceased holders of 
operating rights, and assignees of such holders.
    (b) Insurance coverage in behalf of fiduciaries to apply 
concurrently. The coverage furnished under the provisions of this 
section on behalf of fiduciaries shall not apply subsequent to the 
effective date of other insurance, or other security, filed with and 
approved by the FMCSA in behalf of such fiduciaries. After the coverage

Sec. 387.321  Operations in foreign commerce.

    No motor carrier may operate in the United States in the course of 
transportation between places in a foreign country or between a place in 
one foreign country and a place in another foreign country unless and 
until there shall have been filed with and accepted by the FMCSA a 
certificate of insurance, surety bond, proof of qualifications as a 
self-insurer, or other securities or agreements in the amount prescribed 
in Sec. 387.303(b), conditioned to pay any final judgment recovered 
against such motor carrier for bodily injuries to or the death of any 
person resulting from the negligent operation, maintenance, or use of 
motor vehicles in transportation between places in a foreign country or 
between a place in one foreign country and a place in another foreign 
country, insofar as such transportation takes place in the United 
States, or for loss of or damage to property of others. The security for 
the protection of the public required by this section shall be 
maintained in effect at all times and shall be subject to the provisions 
of Sec. Sec. 387.309 through 387.319. The requirements of Sec. 
387.315(a) shall be satisfied if the insurance or surety company, in 
addition to having been approved by the FMCSA, is legally authorized to 
issue policies or surety bonds in at least one of the States in the 
United States, or one of the Provinces in Canada, and has filed with the 
FMCSA the name and address of a person upon whom legal process may be 
served in each State in or through which the motor carrier operates. 
Such designation may from time to time be changed by like designation 
similarly filed, but shall be maintained during the effectiveness of any 
certificate of insurance or surety bond issued by the company, and 
thereafter with respect to any claims arising during the effectiveness 
of such certificate or bond. The term ``motor carrier'' as used in this 
section shall not include private carriers or carriers operating under 
the partial exemption from regulation in 49 U.S.C. 13503 and 13506.

Sec. 390.23  Relief from regulations.

    (a) Parts 390 through 399 of this chapter shall not apply to any 
motor carrier or driver operating a commercial motor vehicle to provide 
emergency relief during an emergency, subject to the following time 
limits:
    (1) Regional emergencies. (i) The exemption provided by paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section is effective only when:
    (A) An emergency has been declared by the President of the United 
States, the Governor of a State, or their authorized representatives 
having authority to declare emergencies; or
    (B) The FMCSA Field Administrator has declared that a regional 
emergency exists which justifies an exemption from parts 390 through 399 
of this chapter.
    (ii) Except as provided in Sec. 390.25, this exemption shall not 
exceed the duration of the motor carrier's or driver's direct assistance 
in providing emergency relief, or 30 days from the date of the initial 
declaration of the emergency or the exemption from the regulations by 
the FMCSA Field Administrator, whichever is less.
    (2) Local emergencies. (i) The exemption provided by paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section is effective only when:

[[Page 318]]

    (A) An emergency has been declared by a Federal, State or local 
government official having authority to declare an emergency; or
    (B) The FMCSA Field Administrator has declared that a local 
emergency exists which justifies an exemption from parts 390 through 399 
of this chapter.
    (ii) This exemption shall not exceed the duration of the motor 
carrier's or driver's direct assistance in providing emergency relief, 
or 5 days from the date of the initial declaration of the emergency or 
the exemption from the regulations by the FMCSA Field Administrator, 
whichever is less.
    (3) Tow trucks responding to emergencies. (i) The exemption provided 
by paragraph (a)(3) of this section is effective only when a request has 
been made by a Federal, State or local police officer for tow trucks to 
move wrecked or disabled motor vehicles.
    (ii) This exemption shall not exceed the length of the motor 
carrier's or driver's direct assistance in providing emergency relief, 
or 24 hours from the time of the initial request for assistance by the 
Federal, State or local police officer, whichever is less.
    (b) Upon termination of direct assistance to the regional or local 
emergency relief effort, the motor carrier or driver is subject to the 
requirements of parts 390 through 399 of this chapter, with the 
following exception: A driver may return empty to the motor carrier's 
terminal or the driver's normal work reporting location without 
complying with parts 390 through 399 of this chapter. However, a driver 
who informs the motor carrier that he or she needs immediate rest must 
be permitted at least 10 consecutive hours off duty before the driver is 
required to return to such terminal or location. Having returned to the 
terminal or other location, the driver must be relieved of all duty and 
responsibilities. Direct assistance terminates when a driver or 
commercial motor vehicle is used in interstate commerce to transport 
cargo not destined for the emergency relief effort, or when the motor 
carrier dispatches such driver or commercial motor vehicle to another 
location to begin operations in commerce.
    (c) When the driver has been relieved of all duty and 
responsibilities upon termination of direct assistance to a regional or 
local emergency relief effort, no motor carrier shall permit or require 
any driver used by it to drive nor shall any such driver drive in 
commerce until:
    (1) The driver has met the requirements of Sec. Sec. 395.3(a) and 
395.5(a) of this chapter; and
    (2) The driver has had at least 34 consecutive hours off-duty when:
    (i) The driver has been on duty for more than 60 hours in any 7 
consecutive days at the time the driver is relieved of all duty if the 
employing motor carrier does not operate every day in the week, or
    (ii) The driver has been on duty for more than 70 hours in any 8 
consecutive days at the time the driver is relieved of all duty if the 
employing motor carrier operates every day in the week.

<R05>
Sec. 390.25  Extension of relief from regulations--emergencies.

    The FMCSA Field Administrator may extend the 30-day time period of

period contained in Sec. 390.23(a)(2) or the 24-hour period contained 
in Sec. 390.23(a)(3). Any motor carrier or driver seeking to extend the 
30-day limit shall obtain approval from the FMCSA Field Administrator in 
the region in which the motor carrier's principal place of business is 
located before the expiration of the 30-day period. The motor carrier or 
driver shall give full details of the additional relief requested. The 
FMCSA Field Administrator shall determine if such relief is necessary 
taking into account both the severity of the ongoing emergency and the 
nature of the relief services to be provided by the carrier or driver. 
If the FMCSA Field Administrator approves an extension of the exemption, 
he or she shall establish a new time limit and place on the motor 
carrier or driver any other restrictions deemed necessary.

<R05>
Sec. 391.23  Investigation and inquiries.

    (a) Except as provided in subpart G of this part, each motor carrier 
shall make the following investigations and inquiries with respect to 
each driver it employs, other than a person who has been a regularly 
employed driver of the motor carrier for a continuous period which began 
before January 1, 1971:
    (1) An inquiry into the driver's driving record during the preceding 
3 years to the appropriate agency of every State in which the driver 
held a motor vehicle operator's license or permit during those 3 years; 
and

[[Page 325]]

    (2) An investigation of the driver's safety performance history with 
Department of Transportation regulated employers during the preceding 
three years.
    (b) A copy of the driver record(s) obtained in response to the 
inquiry or inquiries to each State driver record agency required by 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be placed in the driver 
qualification file within 30 days of the date the driver's employment 
begins and be retained in compliance with Sec. 391.51. If no driving 
record exists from the State or States, the motor carrier must document 
a good faith effort to obtain such information, and certify that no 
record exists for that driver in that State. The inquiry to the State 
driver record agencies must be made in the form and manner each agency 
prescribes.
    (c)(1) Replies to the investigations of the driver's safety 
performance history required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or 
documentation of good faith efforts to obtain the investigation data, 
must be placed in the driver investigation history file, after October 
29, 2004, within 30 days of the date the driver's employment begins. Any 
period of time required to exercise the driver's due process rights to 
review the information received, request a previous employer to correct 
or include a rebuttal, is separate and apart from this 30-day 
requirement to document investigation of the driver safety performance 
history data.
    (2) The investigation may consist of personal interviews, telephone 
interviews, letters, or any other method for investigating that the 
carrier deems appropriate. Each motor carrier must make a written record 
with respect to each previous employer contacted, or good faith efforts 
to do so. The record must include the previous employer's name and 
address, the date the previous employer was contacted, or the attempts 
made, and the information received about the driver from the previous 
employer. Failures to contact a previous employer, or of them to provide 
the required safety performance history information, must be documented. 
The record must be maintained pursuant to Sec. 391.53.
    (3) Prospective employers should report failures of previous 
employers to respond to an investigation to the FMCSA following 
procedures specified at Sec. 386.12 of this chapter and keep a copy of 
such reports in the Driver Investigation file as part of documenting a 
good faith effort to obtain the required information.
    (4) Exception. For a drivers with no previous employment experience 
working for a DOT regulated employer during the preceding three years, 
documentation that no investigation was possible must be placed in the 
driver history investigation file, after October 29, 2004, within the 
required 30 days of the date the driver's employment begins.
    (d) The prospective motor carrier must investigate, at a minimum, 
the information listed in this paragraph from all previous employers of 
the applicant that employed the driver to operate a CMV within the 
previous three years. The investigation request must contain specific 
contact information on where the previous motor carrier employers should 
send the information requested.
    (1) General driver identification and employment verification 
information.
    (2) The data elements as specified in Sec. 390.15(b)(1) of this 
chapter for accidents involving the driver that occurred in the three-
year period preceding the date of the employment application.
    (i) Any accidents as defined by Sec. 390.5 of this chapter.
    (ii) Any accidents the previous employer may wish to provide that 
are retained pursuant to Sec. 390.15(b)(2), or pursuant to the 
employer's internal policies for retaining more detailed minor accident 
information.
    (e) In addition to the investigations required by paragraph (d) of 
this section, the prospective motor carrier employers must investigate 
the information listed below in this paragraph from all previous DOT 
regulated employers that employed the driver within the previous three 
years from the date of the employment application, in a safety-sensitive 
function that required alcohol and controlled substance testing 
specified by 49 CFR part 40.

[[Page 326]]

    (1) Whether, within the previous three years, the driver had 
violated the alcohol and controlled substances prohibitions under 
subpart B of part 382 of this chapter, or 49 CFR part 40.
    (2) Whether the driver failed to undertake or complete a 
rehabilitation program prescribed by a substance abuse professional 
(SAP) pursuant to Sec. 382.605 of this chapter, or 49 CFR part 40, 
subpart O. If the previous employer does not know this information 
(e.g., an employer that terminated an employee who tested positive on a 
drug test), the prospective motor carrier must obtain documentation of 
the driver's successful completion of the SAP's referral directly from 
the driver.
    (3) For a driver who had successfully completed a SAP's 
rehabilitation referral, and remained in the employ of the referring 
employer, information on whether the driver had the following testing 
violations subsequent to completion of a Sec. 382.605 or 49 CFR part 
40, subpart O referral:
    (i) Alcohol tests with a result of 0.04 or higher alcohol 
concentration;
    (ii) Verified positive drug tests;
    (iii) Refusals to be tested (including verified adulterated or 
substituted drug test results).
    (f) A prospective motor carrier employer must provide to the 
previous employer the driver's written consent meeting the requirements 
of Sec. 40.321(b) for the release of the information in paragraph (e) 
of this section. If the driver refuses to provide this written consent, 
the prospective motor carrier employer must not permit the driver to 
operate a commercial motor vehicle for that motor carrier.
    (g) After October 29, 2004, previous employers must:
    (1) Respond to each request for the DOT defined information in 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section within 30 days after the request 
is received. If there is no safety performance history information to 
report for that driver, previous motor carrier employers are nonetheless 
required to send a response confirming the non-existence of any such 
data, including the driver identification information and dates of 
employment.
    (2) Take all precautions reasonably necessary to ensure the accuracy 
of the records.
    (3) Provide specific contact information in case a driver chooses to 
contact the previous employer regarding correction or rebuttal of the 
data.
    (4) Keep a record of each request and the response for one year, 
including the date, the party to whom it was released, and a summary 
identifying what was provided.
    (5) Exception. Until May 1, 2006, carriers need only provide 
information for accidents that occurred after April 29, 2003.
    (h) The release of information under this section may take any form 
that reasonably ensures confidentiality, including letter, facsimile, or 
e-mail. The previous employer and its agents and insurers must take all 
precautions reasonably necessary to protect the driver safety 
performance history records from disclosure to any person not directly 
involved in forwarding the records, except the previous employer's 
insurer, except that the previous employer may not provide any alcohol 
or controlled substances information to the previous employer's insurer.
    (i)(1) The prospective employer must expressly notify drivers with 
Department of Transportation regulated employment during the preceding 
three years--via the application form or other written document prior to 
any hiring decision--that he or she has the following rights regarding 
the investigative information that will be provided to the prospective 
employer pursuant to paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section:
    (i) The right to review information provided by previous employers;
    (ii) The right to have errors in the information corrected by the 
previous employer and for that previous employer to re-send the 
corrected information to the prospective employer;
    (iii) The right to have a rebuttal statement attached to the alleged 
erroneous information, if the previous employer and the driver cannot 
agree on the accuracy of the information.
    (2) Drivers who have previous Department of Transportation regulated 
employment history in the preceding

[[Page 327]]

three years, and wish to review previous employer-provided investigative 
information must submit a written request to the prospective employer, 
which may be done at any time, including when applying, or as late as 30 
days after being employed or being notified of denial of employment. The 
prospective employer must provide this information to the applicant 
within five (5) business days of receiving the written request. If the 
prospective employer has not yet received the requested information from 
the previous employer(s), then the five-business days deadline will 
begin when the prospective employer receives the requested safety 
performance history information. If the driver has not arranged to pick 
up or receive the requested records within thirty (30) days of the 
prospective employer making them available, the prospective motor 
carrier may consider the driver to have waived his/her request to review 
the records.
    (j)(1) Drivers wishing to request correction of erroneous 
information in records received pursuant to paragraph (i) of this 
section must send the request for the correction to the previous 
employer that provided the records to the prospective employer.
    (2) After October 29, 2004, the previous employer must either 
correct and forward the information to the prospective motor carrier 
employer, or notify the driver within 15 days of receiving a driver's 
request to correct the data that it does not agree to correct the data. 
If the previous employer corrects and forwards the data as requested, 
that employer must also retain the corrected information as part of the 
driver's safety performance history record and provide it to subsequent 
prospective employers when requests for this information are received. 
If the previous employer corrects the data and forwards it to the 
prospective motor carrier employer, there is no need to notify the 
driver.
    (3) Drivers wishing to rebut information in records received 
pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section must send the rebuttal to the 
previous employer with instructions to include the rebuttal in that 
driver's safety performance history.
    (4) After October 29, 2004, within five business days of receiving a 
rebuttal from a driver, the previous employer must:
    (i) Forward a copy of the rebuttal to the prospective motor carrier 
employer;
    (ii) Append the rebuttal to the driver's information in the 
carrier's appropriate file, to be included as part of the response for 
any subsequent investigating prospective employers for the duration of 
the three-year data retention requirement.
    (5) The driver may submit a rebuttal initially without a request for 
correction, or subsequent to a request for correction.
    (6) The driver may report failures of previous employers to correct 
information or include the driver's rebuttal as part of the safety 
performance information, to the FMCSA following procedures specified at 
Sec. 386.12.
    (k)(1) The prospective motor carrier employer must use the 
information described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section only as 
part of deciding whether to hire the driver.
    (2) The prospective motor carrier employer, its agents and insurers 
must take all precautions reasonably necessary to protect the records 
from disclosure to any person not directly involved in deciding whether 
to hire the driver. The prospective motor carrier employer may not 
provide any alcohol or controlled substances information to the 
prospective motor carrier employer's insurer.
    (l)(1) No action or proceeding for defamation, invasion of privacy, 
or interference with a contract that is based on the furnishing or use 
of information in accordance with this section may be brought against--
    (i) A motor carrier investigating the information, described in 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, of an individual under 
consideration for employment as a commercial motor vehicle driver,
    (ii) A person who has provided such information; or
    (iii) The agents or insurers of a person described in paragraph 
(l)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, except insurers are not granted a 
limitation on liability

[[Page 328]]

for any alcohol and controlled substance information.
    (2) The protections in paragraph (l)(1) of this section do not apply 
to persons who knowingly furnish false information, or who are not in 
compliance with the procedures specified for these investigations.

           Subpart E_Physical Qualifications and Examinations


<R05>
Sec. 391.41  Physical qualifications for drivers.

    (a) A person shall not drive a commercial motor vehicle unless he/
she is physically qualified to do so and, except as provided in Sec. 
391.67, has on his/her person the original, or a photographic copy, of a 
medical examiner's certificate that he/she is physically qualified to 
drive a commercial motor vehicle.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The United States and Canada entered into a Reciprocity Agreement, 
effective March 30, 1999, recognizing that a Canadian commercial 
driver's license is proof of medical fitness to drive. Therefore, 
Canadian commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers are no longer required 
to have in their possession a medical examiner's certificate if the 
driver has been issued, and possesses, a valid commercial driver's 
license issued by a Canadian Province or Territory. However, Canadian 
drivers who are insulin-using diabetics, who have epilepsy, or who are 
hearing impaired as defined in Sec. 391.41(b)(11) are not qualified to 
drive CMVs in the United States. Furthermore, Canadian drivers who do 
not meet the medical fitness provisions of the Canadian National Safety 
Code for Motor Carriers but who have been issued a waiver by one of the 
Canadian Provinces or Territories are not qualified to drive CMVs in the 
United States.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) A person is physically qualified to drive a commercial motor 
vehicle if that person--
    (1) Has no loss of a foot, a leg, a hand, or an arm, or has been 
granted a skill performance evaluation certificate pursuant to Sec. 
391.49;
    (2) Has no impairment of:
    (i) A hand or finger which interferes with prehension or power 
grasping; or
    (ii) An arm, foot, or leg which interferes with the ability to 
perform normal tasks associated with operating a commercial motor 
vehicle; or any other significant limb defect or limitation which 
interferes with the ability to perform normal tasks associated with 
operating a commercial motor vehicle; or has been granted a skill 
performance evaluation certificate pursuant to Sec. 391.49.
    (3) Has no established medical history or clinical diagnosis of 
diabetes mellitus currently requiring insulin for control;
    (4) Has no current clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction, 
angina pectoris, coronary insufficiency, thrombosis, or any other 
cardiovascular disease of a variety known to be accompanied by syncope, 
dyspnea, collapse, or congestive cardiac failure.
    (5) Has no established medical history or clinical diagnosis of a 
respiratory dysfunction likely to interfere with his/her ability to 
control and drive a commercial motor vehicle safely;
    (6) Has no current clinical diagnosis of high blood pressure likely 
to interfere with his/her ability to operate a commercial motor vehicle 
safely;
    (7) Has no established medical history or clinical diagnosis of 
rheumatic,

[[Page 331]]

arthritic, orthopedic, muscular, neuromuscular, or vascular disease 
which interferes with his/her ability to control and operate a 
commercial motor vehicle safely;
    (8) Has no established medical history or clinical diagnosis of 
epilepsy or any other condition which is likely to cause loss of 
consciousness or any loss of ability to control a commercial motor 
vehicle;
    (9) Has no mental, nervous, organic, or functional disease or 
psychiatric disorder likely to interfere with his/her ability to drive a 
commercial motor vehicle safely;
    (10) Has distant visual acuity of at least 20/40 (Snellen) in each

corrective lenses, field of vision of at least 70[deg] in the horizontal 
Meridian in each eye, and the ability to recognize the colors of traffic 
signals and devices showing standard red, green, and amber;
    (11) First perceives a forced whispered voice in the better ear at 
not less than 5 feet with or without the use of a hearing aid or, if 
tested by use of an audiometric device, does not have an average hearing 
loss in the better ear greater than 40 decibels at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz, and 
2,000 Hz with or without a hearing aid when the audiometric device is 
calibrated to American National Standard (formerly ASA Standard) Z24.5--
1951.
    (12)(i) Does not use a controlled substance identified in 21 CFR 
1308.11 Schedule I, an amphetamine, a narcotic, or any other habit-
forming drug.
    (ii) Exception. A driver may use such a substance or drug, if the 
substance or drug is prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner who:
    (A) Is familiar with the driver's medical history and assigned 
duties; and
    (B) Has advised the driver that the prescribed substance or drug 
will not adversely affect the driver's ability to safely operate a

Sec. 391.43  Medical examination; certificate of physical examination.

    (a) Except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section, the medical 
examination shall be performed by a licensed medical examiner as defined 
in Sec. 390.5 of this subchapter.
    (b) A licensed optometrist may perform so much of the medical 
examination as pertains to visual acuity, field of vision, and the 
ability to recognize colors as specified in paragraph (10) of Sec. 
391.41(b).
    (c) Medical examiners shall:
    (1) Be knowledgeable of the specific physical and mental demands 
associated with operating a commercial motor vehicle and the 
requirements of this subpart, including the medical advisory criteria 
prepared by the FMCSA as guidelines to aid the medical examiner in 
making the qualification determination; and
    (2) Be proficient in the use of and use the medical protocols 
necessary to adequately perform the medical examination required by this 
section.
    (d) Any driver authorized to operate a commercial motor vehicle 
within an exempt intracity zone pursuant to Sec. 391.62 of this part 
shall furnish the examining medical examiner with a copy of the medical 
findings that led to the issuance of the first certificate of medical 
examination which allowed the driver to operate a commercial motor 
vehicle wholly within an exempt intracity zone.
    (e) Any driver operating under a limited exemption authorized by 
Sec. 391.64 shall furnish the medical examiner with a copy of the 
annual medical findings of the endocrinologist, ophthalmologist or 
optometrist, as required under that section. If the medical examiner 
finds the driver qualified under the limited exemption in Sec. 391.64, 
such fact shall be noted on the Medical Examiner's Certificate.

[[Page 332]]

    (f) The medical examination shall be performed, and its results 
shall be recorded, substantially in accordance with the following 
instructions and examination form. Existing forms may be used until 
current printed supplies are depleted or until September 30, 2004, 
whichever occurs first.

     Instructions for Performing and Recording Physical Examinations

    The medical examiner must be familiar with 49 CFR 391.41, Physical 
qualifications for drivers, and should review these instructions before 
performing the physical examination. Answer each question ``yes'' or 
``no'' and record numerical readings where indicated on the physical 
examination form.
    The medical examiner must be aware of the rigorous physical, mental, 
and emotional demands placed on the driver of a commercial motor 
vehicle. In the interest of public safety, the medical examiner is 
required to certify that the driver does not have any physical, mental, 
or organic condition that might affect the driver's ability to operate a 
commercial motor vehicle safely.
    General information. The purpose of this history and physical 
examination is to detect the presence of physical, mental, or organic 
conditions of such a character and extent as to affect the driver's 
ability to operate a commercial motor vehicle safely. The examination 
should be conducted carefully and should at least include all of the 
information requested in the following form. History of certain 
conditions may be cause for rejection. Indicate the need for further 
testing and/or require evaluation by a specialist. Conditions may be 
recorded which do not, because of their character or degree, indicate 
that certification of physical fitness should be denied. However, these 
conditions should be discussed with the driver and he/she should be 
advised to take the necessary steps to insure correction, particularly 
of those conditions which, if neglected, might affect the driver's 
ability to drive safely.
    General appearance and development. Note marked overweight. Note any 
postural defect, perceptible limp, tremor, or other conditions that 
might be caused by alcoholism, thyroid intoxication or other illnesses.
    Head-eyes. When other than the Snellen chart is used, the results of 
such test must be expressed in values comparable to the standard Snellen 
test. If the driver wears corrective lenses for driving, these should be 
worn while driver's visual acuity is being tested. If contact lenses are 
worn, there should be sufficient evidence of good tolerance of and 
adaptation to their use. Indicate the driver's need to wear corrective 
lenses to meet the vision standard on the Medical Examiner's Certificate 
by checking the box, ``Qualified only when wearing corrective lenses.'' 
In recording distance vision use 20 feet as normal. Report all vision as 
a fraction with 20 as the numerator and the smallest type read at 20 
feet as the denominator. Monocular drivers are not qualified to operate 
commercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce.
    Ears. Note evidence of any ear disease, symptoms of aural vertigo, 
or Meniere's Syndrome. When recording hearing, record distance from 
patient at which a forced whispered voice can first be heard. For the 
whispered voice test, the individual should be stationed at least 5 feet 
from the examiner with the ear being tested turned toward the examiner. 
The other ear is covered. Using the breath which remains after a normal 
expiration, the examiner whispers words or random numbers such as 66, 
18, 23, etc. The examiner should not use only sibilants (s-sounding test 
materials). The opposite ear should be tested in the same manner. If the 
individual fails the whispered voice test, the audiometric test should 
be administered. For the audiometric test, record decibel loss at 500 
Hz, 1,000 Hz, and 2,000 Hz. Average the decibel loss at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz 
and 2,000 Hz and record as described on the form. If the individual 
fails the audiometric test and the whispered voice test has not been 
administered, the whispered voice test should be performed to determine 
if the standard applicable to that test can be met.
    Throat. Note any irremediable deformities likely to interfere with 
breathing or swallowing.
    Heart. Note murmurs and arrhythmias, and any history of an enlarged 
heart, congestive heart failure, or cardiovascular disease that is 
accompanied by syncope, dyspnea, or collapse. Indicate onset date, 
diagnosis, medication, and any current limitation. An electrocardiogram 
is required when findings so indicate.
    Blood pressure (BP). If a driver has hypertension and/or is being 
medicated for hypertension, he or she should be recertified more 
frequently. An individual diagnosed with Stage 1 hypertension (BP is 
140/90-159/99) may be certified for one year. At recertification, an 
individual with a BP equal to or less than 140/90 may be certified for 
one year; however, if his or her BP is greater than 140/90 but less than 
160/100, a one-time certificate for 3 months can be issued. An 
individual diagnosed with Stage 2 (BP is 160/100-179/109) should be 
treated and a one-time certificate for 3-month certification can be 
issued. Once the driver has reduced his or her BP to equal to or less 
than 140/90, he or she may be recertified annually thereafter. An 
individual diagnosed with Stage 3 hypertension (BP equal to or greater 
than 180/110) should not be certified until his or her BP is reduced to 
140/90 or less, and may be recertified every 6 months.

[[Page 333]]

    Lungs. Note abnormal chest wall expansion, respiratory rate, breath 
sounds including wheezes or alveolar rales, impaired respiratory 
function, dyspnea, or cyanosis. Abnormal finds on physical exam may 
require further testing such as pulmonary tests and/or x-ray of chest.
    Abdomen and Viscera. Note enlarged liver, enlarged spleen, abnormal 
masses, bruits, hernia, and significant abdominal wall muscle weakness 
and tenderness. If the diagnosis suggests that the condition might 
interfere with the control and safe operation of a commercial motor 
vehicle, further testing and evaluation is required.
    Genital-urinary and rectal examination. A urinalysis is required. 
Protein, blood or sugar in the urine may be an indication for further 
testing to rule out any underlying medical problems. Note hernias. A 
condition causing discomfort should be evaluated to determine the extent 
to which the condition might interfere with the control and safe 
operation of a commercial motor vehicle.
    Neurological. Note impaired equilibrium, coordination, or speech 
pattern; paresthesia; asymmetric deep tendon reflexes; sensory or 
positional abnormalities; abnormal patellar and Babinski's reflexes; 
ataxia. Abnormal neurological responses may be an indication for further 
testing to rule out an underlying medical condition. Any neurological 
condition should be evaluated for the nature and severity of the 
condition, the degree of limitation present, the likelihood of 
progressive limitation, and the potential for sudden incapacitation. In 
instances where the medical examiner has determined that more frequent 
monitoring of a condition is appropriate, a certificate for a shorter 
period should be issued.
    Spine, musculoskeletal. Previous surgery, deformities, limitation of 
motion, and tenderness should be noted. Findings may indicate additional 
testing and evaluation should be conducted.
    Extremities. Carefully examine upper and lower extremities and note 
any loss or impairment of leg, foot, toe, arm, hand, or finger. Note any 
deformities, atrophy, paralysis, partial paralysis, clubbing, edema, or 
hypotonia. If a hand or finger deformity exists, determine whether 
prehension and power grasp are sufficient to enable the driver to 
maintain steering wheel grip and to control other vehicle equipment 
during routine and emergency driving operations. If a foot or leg 
deformity exists, determine whether sufficient mobility and strength 
exist to enable the driver to operate pedals properly. In the case of 
any loss or impairment to an extremity which may interfere with the 
driver's ability to operate a commercial motor vehicle safely, the 
medical examiner should state on the medical certificate ``medically 
unqualified unless accompanied by a Skill Performance Evaluation 
Certificate.'' The driver must then apply to the Field Service Center of 
the FMCSA, for the State in which the driver has legal residence, for a 
Skill Performance Evaluation Certificate under Sec. 391.49.
    Laboratory and Other Testing. Other test(s) may be indicated based 
upon the medical history or findings of the physical examination.
    Diabetes. If insulin is necessary to control a diabetic driver's 
condition, the driver is not qualified to operate a commercial motor 
vehicle in interstate commerce. If mild diabetes is present and it is 
controlled by use of an oral hypoglycemic drug and/or diet and exercise, 
it should not be considered disqualifying. However, the driver must 
remain under adequate medical supervision.
    Upon completion of the examination, the medical examiner must date 
and sign the form, provide his/her full name, office address and 
telephone number. The completed medical examination form shall be 
retained on file at the office of the medical examiner.

motor vehicle, while the driver's ability or alertness is so impaired, 
or so likely to become impaired, through fatigue, illness, or any other 
cause, as to make it unsafe for him/her to begin or continue to operate 
the commercial motor vehicle. However, in a case of grave emergency 
where the hazard to occupants of the commercial motor vehicle or other 
users of the highway would be increased by compliance with this section, 
the driver may continue to operate the commercial motor vehicle to the 
nearest place at which that hazard is removed.

Sec. 392.22  Emergency signals; stopped commercial motor vehicles.

    (a) Hazard warning signal flashers. Whenever a commercial motor 
vehicle is stopped upon the traveled portion of a highway or the 
shoulder of a highway for any cause other than necessary traffic stops, 
the driver of the stopped commercial motor vehicle shall immediately 
activate the vehicular hazard warning signal flashers and continue the 
flashing until the driver places the warning devices required by 
paragraph (b) of this section. The flashing signals shall be used during 
the time the warning devices are picked up for storage before movement 
of the commercial motor vehicle. The flashing lights may be used at 
other times while a commercial motor vehicle is stopped in addition to, 
but not in lieu of, the warning devices required by paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (b) Placement of warning devices--(1) General rule. Except as 
provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, whenever a commercial 
motor vehicle is stopped upon the traveled portion or the shoulder of a 
highway for any cause other than necessary traffic stops, the driver 
shall, as soon as possible, but in any event within 10 minutes, place 
the warning devices required by Sec. 393.95 of this subchapter, in the 
following manner:
    (i) One on the traffic side of and 4 paces (approximately 3 meters 
or 10 feet) from the stopped commercial motor vehicle in the direction

    (ii) One at 40 paces (approximately 30 meters or 100 feet) from the 
stopped commercial motor vehicle in the center of the traffic lane or 
shoulder occupied by the commercial motor vehicle and in the direction 
of approaching traffic; and
    (iii) One at 40 paces (approximately 30 meters or 100 feet) from the 
stopped commercial motor vehicle in the center of the traffic lane or 
shoulder occupied by the commercial motor vehicle

[[Page 358]]

and in the direction away from approaching traffic.
    (2) Special rules--(i) Fusees and liquid-burning flares. The driver 
of a commercial motor vehicle equipped with only fusees or liquid-
burning flares shall place a lighted fusee or liquid-burning flare at 
each of the locations specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. 
There shall be at least one lighted fusee or liquid-burning flare at 
each of the prescribed locations, as long as the commercial motor 
vehicle is stopped. Before the stopped commercial motor vehicle is 
moved, the driver shall extinguish and remove each fusee or liquid-
burning flare.
    (ii) Daylight hours. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of 
this section, during the period lighted lamps are not required, three 
bidirectional reflective triangles, or three lighted fusees or liquid-
burning flares shall be placed as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section within a time of 10 minutes. In the event the driver elects to 
use only fusees or liquid-burning flares in lieu of bidirectional 
reflective triangles or red flags, the driver must ensure that at least 
one fusee or liquid-burning flare remains lighted at each of the 
prescribed locations as long as the commercial motor vehicle is stopped 
or parked.
    (iii) Business or residential districts. The placement of warning 
devices is not required within the business or residential district of a

Sec. 393.13  Retroreflective sheeting and reflex reflectors, requirements 
for semitrailers and trailers manufactured before December 1, 1993.

    (a) Applicability. All trailers and semitrailers manufactured prior 
to December 1, 1993, which have an overall width of 2,032 mm (80 inches) 
or more and a gross vehicle weight rating of 4,536 kg (10,001 pounds) or 
more, except trailers that are manufactured exclusively for use as 
offices or dwellings, pole trailers (as defined in Sec. 390.5 of this 
subchapter), and trailers transported in a driveaway-towaway operation, 
must be equipped with retroreflective sheeting or an array of reflex 
reflectors that meet the requirements of this section. Motor carriers 
operating trailers, other than container chassis (as defined in Sec. 
393.5), have until June 1, 2001, to comply with the requirements of this 
section. Motor carriers operating container chassis have until December 
1, 2001, to comply with the requirements of this section.
    (b) Retroreflective sheeting and reflex reflectors. Motor carriers 
are encouraged to retrofit their trailers with a conspicuity system that 
meets all of the requirements applicable to trailers manufactured on or 
after December 1, 1993, including the use of retroreflective sheeting or 
reflex reflectors in a red and white pattern (see Federal Motor Vehicle 
Safety Standard No. 108 (49 CFR 571.108), S5.7, Conspicuity systems). 
Motor carriers which do not retrofit their trailers to meet the 
requirements of FMVSS No. 108, for example by using an alternative color 
pattern, must comply with the remainder of this paragraph and with 
paragraph (c) or (d) of this section. Retroreflective sheeting or reflex 
reflectors in colors or color combinations other than red and white may 
be used on the sides or lower rear area of the semitrailer or trailer 
until June 1, 2009. The alternate color or color combination must be 
uniform along the sides and lower rear area of the trailer. The 
retroreflective sheeting or reflex reflectors on the upper rear area of 
the trailer must be white and conform to the requirements of FMVSS No. 
108 (S5.7). Red retroreflective sheeting or reflex reflectors shall not 
be used along the sides of the trailer unless it is used as part of a 
red and white pattern. Retroreflective sheeting shall have a width of at 
least 50 mm (2 inches).
    (c) Locations for retroreflective sheeting--(1) Sides. 
Retroreflective sheeting shall be applied to each side of the trailer or 
semitrailer. Each strip of retroreflective sheeting shall be positioned 
as horizontally as practicable, beginning and ending as close to the 
front and rear as practicable. The strip need not be continuous but the 
sum of the length of all of the segments shall be at least half of the 
length of the trailer and the spaces between the segments of the strip 
shall be distributed as evenly as practicable. The centerline for each 
strip of retroreflective sheeting shall be between 375 mm (15 inches) 
and 1,525 mm (60 inches) above the road surface when measured with the 
trailer empty or unladen, or as close as practicable to this area. If 
necessary to clear rivet heads or other similar obstructions, 50 mm (2 
inches) wide retroreflective sheeting may be separated into two 25 mm (1 
inch) wide strips of the same length and color, separated by a space of 
not more than 25 mm (1 inch).
    (2) Lower rear area. The rear of each trailer and semitrailer must 
be equipped with retroreflective sheeting. Each strip of retroreflective 
sheeting shall be positioned as horizontally as practicable, extending 
across the full width of the trailer, beginning and ending as close to 
the extreme edges as practicable. The centerline for each of the strips 
of retroreflective sheeting shall be between 375 mm (15 inches) and 
1,525 mm (60 inches) above the road surface when measured with the 
trailer empty or unladen, or as close as practicable to this area.
    (3) Upper rear area. Two pairs of white strips of retroreflective 
sheeting, each pair consisting of strips 300 mm (12 inches) long, must 
be positioned horizontally and vertically on the right and left upper 
corners of the rear of the body of each trailer and semitrailer, as 
close as practicable to the top of the trailer and as far apart as 
practicable. If the perimeter of the body, as viewed from the rear, is 
not square or rectangular, the strips may be applied along the 
perimeter, as close as practicable to the uppermost and outermost areas

[[Page 388]]

of the rear of the body on the left and right sides.
    (d) Locations for reflex reflectors.--(1) Sides. Reflex reflectors 
shall be applied to each side of the trailer or semitrailer. Each array 
of reflex reflectors shall be positioned as horizontally as practicable, 
beginning and ending as close to the front and rear as practicable. The 
array need not be continuous but the sum of the length of all of the 
array segments shall be at least half of the length of the trailer and 
the spaces between the segments of the strip shall be distributed as 
evenly as practicable. The centerline for each array of reflex 
reflectors shall be between 375 mm (15 inches) and 1,525 mm (60 inches) 
above the road surface when measured with the trailer empty or unladen, 
or as close as practicable to this area. The center of each reflector 
shall not be more than 100 mm (4 inches) from the center of each 
adjacent reflector in the segment of the array. If reflex reflectors are 
arranged in an alternating color pattern, the length of reflectors of 
the first color shall be as close as practicable to the length of the 
reflectors of the second color.
    (2) Lower rear area. The rear of each trailer and semitrailer must 
be equipped with reflex reflectors. Each array of reflex reflectors 
shall be positioned as horizontally as practicable, extending across the 
full width of the trailer, beginning and ending as close to the extreme 
edges as practicable. The centerline for each array of reflex reflectors 
shall be between 375 mm (15 inches) and 1,525 mm (60 inches) above the 
road surface when measured with the trailer empty or unladen, or as 
close as practicable to this area. The center of each reflector shall 
not be more than 100 mm (4 inches) from the center of each adjacent 
reflector in the segment of the array.
    (3) Upper rear area. Two pairs of white reflex reflector arrays, 
each pair at least 300 mm (12 inches) long, must be positioned 
horizontally and vertically on the right and left upper corners of the 
rear of the body of each trailer and semitrailer, as close as 
practicable to the top of the trailer and as far apart as practicable. 
If the perimeter of the body, as viewed from the rear, is not square or 
rectangular, the arrays may be applied along the perimeter, as close as 
practicable to the uppermost and outermost areas of the rear of the body 
on the left and right sides. The center of each reflector shall not be 
more than 100 mm (4 inches) from the center of each adjacent reflector 
in the segment of the array.

and truck when used for towing other vehicles equipped with vacuum 
brakes, shall have, in addition to the single control required by Sec. 
393.49 to operate all brakes of the combination, a second manual control 
device which can be used to operate the brakes on the towed vehicles in 
emergencies. Such second control shall be independent of brake air, 
hydraulic, and other pressure, and independent of other controls, unless 
the braking system be so arranged that failure of the pressure on which 
the second control depends will cause the towed vehicle brakes to be 
applied automatically. The second control is not required by this rule 
to provide modulated or graduated braking.
    (d) Breakaway braking requirements for trailers. Every trailer 
required to be equipped with brakes shall have brakes which apply 
automatically and immediately upon breakaway from the towing vehicle. 
With the exception of trailers having three or more axles, all brakes 
with which the trailer is required to be equipped must be applied upon 
breakaway from the towing vehicle. The brakes must remain in the applied 
position for at least 15 minutes.
    (e) Emergency valves. Air brake systems installed on towed vehicles 
shall be so designed, by the use of ``no-bleed-back'' relay emergency 
valves or equivalent devices, that the supply reservoir used to provide 
air for brakes shall be safeguarded against backflow of air to the 
towing vehicle upon reduction of the towing vehicle air pressure.
    (f) Exception. The requirements of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of 
this section shall not be applicable to commercial motor vehicles being 
transported in driveaway-towaway operations.

    (1) Manually operated devices. Manually operated devices to reduce 
or remove front-wheel braking effort may only be used on buses, trucks, 
and truck tractors manufactured before March 1, 1975. Such devices must 
not be

[[Page 401]]

used unless the vehicle is being operated under adverse conditions such 
as wet, snowy, or icy roads.
    (2) Automatic devices. Automatic devices must not reduce the front-
wheel braking force by more than 50 percent of the braking force 
available when the automatic device is disconnected (regardless of 
whether or not an antilock system failure has occurred on any axle). The 
device must not be operable by the driver except upon application of the 
control that activates the braking system. The device must not be 
operable when the brake control application pressure exceeds 85 psig 
(for vehicles equipped with air brakes) or 85 percent of the maximum 
system pressure (for vehicles which are not equipped with air brakes).
    (c) Exception. Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to--
    (1) A towed vehicle with disabling damage as defined in Sec. 390.5;
    (2) A vehicle which is towed in a driveaway-towaway operation and is 
included in the exemption to the requirement for brakes on all wheels, 
Sec. 393.42(b);
    (3) Unladen converter dollies with a gross weight of 1,361 kg (3,000 
lbs) or less, and manufactured prior to March 1, 1998;
    (4) The steering axle of a three-axle dolly which is steered by a 
co-driver;
    (5) Loaded house moving dollies, specialized trailers and dollies 
used to transport industrial furnaces, reactors, and similar motor 
vehicles provided the speed at which the combination of vehicles will be 
operated does not exceed 32 km/hour (20 mph) and brakes on the 
combination of vehicles are capable of stopping the combination within 
12.2 meters (40 feet) from the speed at which the vehicle is being 
operated or 32 km/hour (20 mph), whichever is less.
    (6) Raised lift axles. Brakes on lift axles need not be capable of 
being operated while the lift axle is raised. However, brakes on lift 
axles must be capable of being applied whenever the lift axle is lowered 
and the tires contact the roadway.

Sec. 393.49  Single valve to operate all brakes.

    Every motor vehicle, the date of manufacture of which is subsequent 
to June 30, 1953, which is equipped with power brakes, shall have the 
braking system so arranged that one application valve shall when applied 
operate all the service brakes on the motor vehicle or combination of 
motor vehicles. This requirement shall not be construed to prohibit 
motor vehicles from being equipped with an additional valve to be used 
to operate the brakes on a trailer or trailers or as provided in Sec. 
393.44. This section shall not be applicable to driveaway-towaway 
operations unless the brakes on such operations are designed to be 
operated by a single valve.


<R05>
Sec. 393.50  Reservoirs required.

    (a) Reservoir capacity for air-braked power units manufactured on or 
after March 1, 1975, and air-braked trailers manufactured on or after 
January 1, 1975. Buses, trucks, and truck-tractors manufactured on or 
after March 1, 1975, and air-braked trailers manufactured on or after 
January 1, 1975, must meet the reservoir requirements of FMVSS No. 121, 
S5.1.2, in effect on the date of manufacture.
    (b) Reservoir capacity for air-braked vehicles not subject to FMVSS 
No. 121 on the date of manufacture and all vacuum braked vehicles. Each 
motor vehicle using air or vacuum braking must have either reserve 
capacity, or a reservoir, that would enable the driver to make a full 
service brake application with the engine stopped without depleting the 
air pressure or vacuum below 70 percent of that indicated by the air or 
vacuum gauge immediately before the brake application is made. For the 
purposes of this paragraph, a full service brake application means 
depressing the brake pedal or treadle valve to the limit of its travel.
    (c) Safeguarding of air and vacuum. Each service reservoir system on 
a motor vehicle shall be protected against a loss of air pressure or 
vacuum due to a failure or leakage in the system between the service 
reservoir and the source of air pressure or vacuum, by check valves or 
equivalent devices whose proper functioning can be

[[Page 402]]

checked without disconnecting any air or vacuum line, or fitting.
    (d) Drain valves for air braked vehicles. Each reservoir must have a 
condensate drain valve that can be manually operated. Automatic 
condensate drain valves may be used provided (1) they may be operated 
manually, or (2) a manual means of draining the reservoirs is retained.

Sec. 393.51  Warning signals, air pressure and vacuum gauges.

    (a) General Rule. Every bus, truck and truck tractor, except as 
provided in paragraph (f), must be equipped with a signal that provides 
a warning to the driver when a failure occurs in the vehicle's service 
brake system. The warning signal must meet the applicable requirements 
of paragraphs (b), (c), (d) or (e) of this section.
    (b) Hydraulic brakes. Vehicles manufactured on or after September 1, 
1975, must meet the brake system indicator lamp requirements of FMVSS 
No. 571.105 (S5.3) applicable to the vehicle on the date of manufacture. 
Vehicles manufactured on or after July 1, 1973 but before September 1, 
1975, or to which FMVSS No. 571.105 was not applicable on the date of 
manufacture, must have a warning signal which operates before or upon 
application of the brakes in the event of a hydraulic-type complete 
failure of a partial system. The signal must be either visible within 
the driver's forward field of view or audible. The signal must be 
continuous. (NOTE: FMVSS No. 105 was applicable to trucks and buses from 
September 1, 1975 to October 12, 1976, and from September 1, 1983, to 
the present. FMVSS No. 105 was not applicable to trucks and buses 
manufactured between October 12, 1976, and September 1, 1983. Motor 
carriers have the option of equipping those vehicles to meet either the 
indicator lamp requirements of FMVSS No. 105, or the indicator lamp 
requirements specified in this paragraph for vehicles which were not 
subject to FMVSS No. 105 on the date of manufacture.)
    (c) Air brakes. A commercial motor vehicle (regardless of the date 
of manufacture) equipped with service brakes activated by compressed air 
(air brakes) or a commercial motor vehicle towing a vehicle with service 
brakes activated by compressed air (air brakes) must be equipped with a 
pressure gauge and a warning signal. Trucks, truck tractors, and buses 
manufactured on or after March 1, 1975, must, at a minimum, have a 
pressure gauge and a warning signal which meets the requirements of 
FMVSS No. 121 (S5.1.4 for the pressure gauge and S5.1.5 for the warning 
signal) applicable to the vehicle on the date of manufacture of the 
vehicle. Power units to which FMVSS No. 571.121 was not applicable on 
the date of manufacture of the vehicle must be equipped with--
    (1) A pressure gauge, visible to a person seated in the normal 
driving position, which indicates the air pressure (in kilopascals (kPa) 
or pounds per square inch (psi)) available for braking; and
    (2) A warning signal that is audible or visible to a person in the 
normal driving position and provides a continuous warning to the driver 
whenever the air pressure in the service reservoir system is at 379 kPa 
(55 psi) and below, or one-half of the compressor governor cutout 
pressure, whichever is less.
    (d) Vacuum brakes. A commercial motor vehicle (regardless of the 
date it was manufactured) having service brakes activated by vacuum or a 
vehicle towing a vehicle having service brakes activated by vacuum must 
be equipped with--
    (1) A vacuum gauge, visible to a person seated in the normal driving 
position, which indicates the vacuum (in millimeters or inches of 
mercury) available for braking; and
    (2) A warning signal that is audible or visible to a person in the 
normal driving position and provides a continuous warning to the driver 
whenever the vacuum in the vehicle's supply reservoir is less than 203 
mm (8 inches) of mercury.
    (e) Hydraulic brakes applied or assisted by air or vacuum. Each 
vehicle equipped with hydraulically activated service brakes which are 
applied or assisted by compressed air or vacuum, and to which FMVSS No. 
105 was not applicable on the date of manufacture, must be equipped with 
a warning signal that

[[Page 403]]

conforms to paragraph (b) of this section for the hydraulic portion of 
the system; paragraph (c) of this section for the air assist/air applied 
portion; or paragraph (d) of this section for the vacuum assist/vacuum 
applied portion. This paragraph shall not be construed as requiring air 
pressure gauges or vacuum gauges, only warning signals.
    (f) Exceptions. The rules in paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of this 
section do not apply to property carrying commercial motor vehicles 
which have less than three axles and (1) were manufactured before July 
1, 1973, and (2) have a manufacturer's gross vehicle weight rating less 
than 4,536 kg (10,001 pounds).

that is not greater than the distance specified in the table in 
paragraph (d) of this section; or, for motor vehicles or motor vehicle 
combinations that have a GVWR or GVW greater than 4,536 kg (10,000 
pounds),
    (4) Developing only the braking force specified in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section and the stopping distance specified in paragraph (a)(3) 
of this section, if braking force is measured by a performance-based 
brake tester which meets the requirements of functional specifications 
for performance-based brake testers for commercial motor vehicles, where 
braking force is the sum of the braking force at each wheel of the 
vehicle or vehicle combination as a percentage of gross vehicle or 
combination weight.
    (b) Upon application of its emergency brake system and with no other 
brake system applied, a motor vehicle or combination of motor vehicles 
must, under any condition of loading in which it is found on a public 
highway, be capable of stopping from 20 miles per hour in a distance, 
measured from the point at which movement of the emergency brake control 
begins, that is not greater than the distance specified in the table in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (c) Conformity to the stopping-distance requirements of paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section shall be determined under the following 
conditions:
    (1) Any test must be made with the vehicle on a hard surface that is 
substantially level, dry, smooth, and free of loose material.

Notes: (a) There is a definite mathematical relationship between the figures in columns 2 and 3. If the
  decelerations set forth in column 3 are divided by 32.2 feet per-second per-second, the figures in column 2
  will be obtained. (For example, 21 divided by 32.2 equals 65.2 percent.) Column 2 is included in the
  tabulation because certain brake testing devices utilize this factor.
(b) The decelerations specified in column 3 are an indication of the effectiveness of the basic brakes, and as
  measured in practical brake testing are the maximum decelerations attained at some time during the stop. These
  decelerations as measured in brake tests cannot be used to compute the values in column 4 because the
  deceleration is not sustained at the same rate over the entire period of the stop. The deceleration increases
  from zero to a maximum during a period of brake system application and brake-force buildup. Also, other
  factors may cause the deceleration to decrease after reaching a maximum. The added distance that results
  because maximum deceleration is not sustained is included in the figures in column 4 but is not indicated by
  the usual brake-testing devices for checking deceleration.
(c) The distances in column 4 and the decelerations in column 3 are not directly related. ``Brake-system
  application and braking distance in feet'' (column 4) is a definite measure of the overall effectiveness of
  the braking system, being the distance traveled between the point at which the driver starts to move the
  braking controls and the point at which the vehicle comes to rest. It includes distance traveled while the
  brakes are being applied and distance traveled while the brakes are retarding the vehicle.
(d) The distance traveled during the period of brake-system application and brake-force buildup varies with
  vehicle type, being negligible for many passenger cars and greatest for combinations of commercial vehicles.
  This fact accounts for the variation from 20 to 40 feet in the values in column 4 for the various classes of
  vehicles.
(e) The terms ``GVWR'' and ``GVW'' refer to the manufacturer's gross vehicle weight rating and the actual gross
  vehicle weight, respectively.

    (7) Motor vehicles that meet the fuel system integrity requirements 
of 49 CFR 571.301 are exempt from the requirements of this subpart, as 
they apply to the vehicle's fueling system.
    (b) Definitions. As used in this section--
    (1) The term liquid fuel tank means a fuel tank designed to contain 
a fuel that is liquid at normal atmospheric pressures and temperatures.
    (2) A side-mounted fuel tank is a liquid fuel tank which--
    (i) If mounted on a truck tractor, extends outboard of the vehicle 
frame and outside of the plan view outline of the cab; or
    (ii) If mounted on a truck, extends outboard of a line parallel to 
the longitudinal centerline of the truck and tangent to the outboard 
side of a front tire in a straight ahead position. In determining 
whether a fuel tank on a truck or truck tractor is side-mounted, the 
fill pipe is not considered a part of the tank.
    (c) Construction of liquid fuel tanks--(1) Joints. Joints of a fuel 
tank body must be closed by arc-, gas-, seam-, or spot-welding, by 
brazing, by silver soldering, or by techniques which provide heat 
resistance and mechanical securement at least equal to those 
specifically named. Joints must not be closed solely by crimping or by 
soldering with a lead-based or other soft solder.
    (2) Fittings. The fuel tank body must have flanges or spuds suitable 
for the installation of all fittings.
    (3) Threads. The threads of all fittings must be Dryseal American 
Standard Taper Pipe Thread or Dryseal SAE Short Taper Pipe Thread, 
specified in Society of Automotive Engineers Standard J476, as contained 
in the 1971 edition of the ``SAE Handbook,'' except that straight

damage from impact.
    (iii) If a fuel tank has drains the drain fittings must permit 
substantially complete drainage of the tank.
    (iv) Drains or other bottom fittings must be installed in a flange 
or spud designed to accommodate it.
    (5) Fuel withdrawal fittings. Except for diesel fuel tanks, the 
fittings through which fuel is withdrawn from a fuel tank must be 
located above the normal level of fuel in the tank when the tank is 
full.
    (6) [Reserved]
    (7) Fill pipe. (i) Each fill pipe must be designed and constructed 
to minimize the risk of fuel spillage during fueling operations and when 
the vehicle is involved in a crash.
    (ii) For diesel-fueled vehicles, the fill pipe and vents of a fuel 
tank having a capacity of more than 94.75 L (25 gallons) of fuel must 
permit filling the tank with fuel at a rate of at least 75.8 L/m (20 
gallons per minute) without fuel spillage.
    (iii) For gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles with a GVWR of 
3,744 kg (8,500 pounds) or less, the vehicle must permit filling the 
tank with fuel dispensed at the applicable fill rate required by the 
regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency under 40 CFR 80.22.

    (iv) For gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles with a GVWR of 
14,000 pounds (6,400 kg) or less, the vehicle must comply with the 
applicable fuel-spitback prevention and onboard refueling vapor recovery 
regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency under 40 CFR part 86.
    (v) Each fill pipe must be fitted with a cap that can be fastened 
securely over the opening in the fill pipe. Screw threads or a bayonet-
type point are methods of conforming to the requirements of paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (8) Safety venting system. A liquid fuel tank with a capacity of 
more than 25 gallons of fuel must have a venting system which, in the 
event the tank is subjected to fire, will prevent internal tank pressure 
from rupturing the tank's body, seams, or bottom opening (if any).
    (9) Pressure resistance. The body and fittings of a liquid fuel tank 
with a capacity of more than 25 gallons of fuel must be capable of 
withstanding an internal hydrostatic pressure equal to 150 percent of 
the maximum internal pressure reached in the tank during the safety 
venting systems test specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (10) Air vent. Each fuel tank must be equipped with a nonspill air 
vent (such as a ball check). The air vent may be combined with the fill-
pipe cap or safety vent, or it may be a separate unit installed on the 
fuel tank.
    (11) Markings. If the body of a fuel tank is readily visible when 
the tank is installed on the vehicle, the tank must be plainly marked 
with its liquid capacity. The tank must also be plainly marked with a 
warning against filling it to more than 95 percent of its liquid 
capacity.
    (12) Overfill restriction. A liquid fuel tank manufactured on or 
after January 1, 1973, must be designed and constructed so that--
    (i) The tank cannot be filled, in a normal filling operation, with a 
quantity of fuel that exceeds 95 percent of the tank's liquid capacity; 
and
    (ii) When the tank is filled, normal expansion of the fuel will not 
cause fuel spillage.
    (d) Liquid fuel tank tests. Each liquid fuel tank must be capable of 
passing the tests specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this 
section. The specified tests are a measure of performance only. 
Alternative procedures which assure that equipment meets the required 
performance standards may be used. .
    (1) Safety venting system test--(i) Procedure. Fill the tank three-
fourths full with fuel, seal the fuel feed outlet, and invert the tank. 
When the fuel temperature is between 50 [deg]F. and 80 [deg]F., apply an 
enveloping flame to the tank so that the temperature of the fuel rises 
at a rate of not less than 6 [deg]F. and not more than 8 [deg]F. per 
minute.
    (ii) Required performance. The safety venting system required by 
paragraph (c)(8) of this section must activate before the internal 
pressure in the tank exceeds 50 pounds per square inch, gauge, and the 
internal pressure must not thereafter exceed the pressure at which the 
system activated by more than five pounds per square inch despite any 
further increase in the temperature of the fuel.
    (2) Leakage test--(i) Procedure. Fill the tank to capacity with fuel 
having a temperature between 50 [deg]F. and 80 [deg]F. With the fill-
pipe cap installed, turn the tank through an angle of 150[deg] in any 
direction about any axis from its normal position.
    (ii) Required performance. Neither the tank nor any fitting may leak 
more than a total of one ounce by weight of fuel per minute in any 
position the tank assumes during the test.

fuel tank must be capable of passing the tests specified in paragraphs 
(e)(1) and (2) of this section and the test specified in paragraphs 
(d)(1) and (2) of this section. The specified tests are a measure of 
performance only. Alternative procedures which assure that equipment 
meets the required performance criteria may be used.
    (1) Drop test--(i) Procedure. Fill the tank with a quantity of water 
having a weight equal to the weight of the maximum fuel load of the tank 
and drop the tank 30 feet onto an unyielding surface so that it lands 
squarely on one corner.
    (ii) Required performance. Neither the tank nor any fitting may leak 
more

[[Page 411]]

than a total of 1 ounce by weight of water per minute.
    (2) Fill-pipe test--(i) Procedure. Fill the tank with a quantity of 
water having a weight equal to the weight of the maximum fuel load of 
the tank and drop the tank 10 feet onto an unyielding surface so that it 
lands squarely on its fill-pipe.
    (ii) Required performance. Neither the tank nor any fitting may leak

              Subpart F_Coupling Devices and Towing Methods


<R05>
Sec. 393.70  Coupling devices and towing methods, except for 
driveaway-towaway operations.

    (a) Tracking. When two or more vehicles are operated in combination, 
the coupling devices connecting the vehicles shall be designed, 
constructed, and installed, and the vehicles shall be designed and 
constructed, so that when the combination is operated in a straight line 
on a level, smooth, paved surface, the path of the towed vehicle will 
not deviate more than 3 inches to either side of the path of the vehicle 
that tows it.
    (b) Fifth wheel assemblies--(1) Mounting--(i) Lower half. The lower 
half of a fifth wheel mounted on a truck tractor or converter dolly must 
be secured to the frame of that vehicle with properly designed brackets, 
mounting plates or angles and properly tightened bolts of adequate size 
and grade, or devices that provide equivalent security. The installation 
shall not cause cracking, warping, or deformation of the frame. The 
installation must include a device for positively preventing the lower 
half of the fifth wheel from shifting on the frame to which it is 
attached.
    (ii) Upper half. The upper half of a fifth wheel must be fastened to 
the motor vehicle with at least the same security required for the 
installation of the lower half on a truck tractor or converter dolly.
    (2) Locking. Every fifth wheel assembly must have a locking 
mechanism. The locking mechanism, and any adapter used in conjunction 
with it, must prevent separation of the upper and lower halves of the 
fifth wheel assembly unless a positive manual release is activated. The 
release may be located so that the driver can operate it from the cab. 
If a motor vehicle has a fifth wheel designed and constructed to be 
readily separable, the fifth wheel locking devices shall apply 
automatically on coupling.
    (3) Location. The lower half of a fifth wheel shall be located so 
that, regardless of the condition of loading, the relationship between 
the kingpin and the rear axle or axles of the towing motor vehicle will 
properly distribute the gross weight of both the towed and towing 
vehicles on the axles of those vehicles, will not unduly interfere with 
the steering, braking, and other maneuvering of the towing vehicle, and 
will not otherwise contribute to unsafe operation of the vehicles 
comprising the combination. The upper half of a fifth wheel shall be 
located so that the weight of the vehicles is properly distributed on 
their axles and the combination of vehicles will operate safely during 
normal operation.
    (c) Towing of full trailers. A full trailer must be equipped with a 
tow-bar and a means of attaching the tow-bar to the towing and towed 
vehicles. The tow-bar and the means of attaching it must--
    (1) Be structurally adequate for the weight being drawn;
    (2) Be properly and securely mounted;
    (3) Provide for adequate articulation at the connection without 
excessive slack at that location; and
    (4) Be provided with a locking device that prevents accidental 
separation of the towed and towing vehicles. The mounting of the trailer 
hitch (pintle hook or equivalent mechanism) on the towing vehicle must 
include reinforcement or bracing of the frame sufficient to produce 
strength and rigidity of the frame to prevent its undue distortion.

[[Page 413]]

    (d) Safety devices in case of tow-bar failure or disconnection. 
Every full trailer and every converter dolly used to convert a 
semitrailer to a full trailer must be coupled to the frame, or an 
extension of the frame, of the motor vehicle which tows it with one or 
more safety devices to prevent the towed vehicle from breaking loose in 
the event the tow-bar fails or becomes disconnected. The safety device 
must meet the following requirements:
    (1) The safety device must not be attached to the pintle hook or any 
other device on the towing vehicle to which the tow-bar is attached. 
However, if the pintle hook or other device was manufactured prior to 
July 1, 1973, the safety device may be attached to the towing vehicle at 
a place on a pintle hook forging or casting if that place is independent 
of the pintle hook.
    (2) The safety device must have no more slack than is necessary to 
permit the vehicles to be turned properly.
    (3) The safety device, and the means of attaching it to the 
vehicles, must have an ultimate strength of not less than the gross 
weight of the vehicle or vehicles being towed.
    (4) The safety device must be connected to the towed and towing 
vehicles and to the tow-bar in a manner which prevents the tow-bar from 
dropping to the ground in the event it fails or becomes disconnected.
    (5) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, if the 
safety device consists of safety chains or cables, the towed vehicle 
must be equipped with either two safety chains or cables or with a 
bridle arrangement of a single chain or cable attached to its frame or 
axle at two points as far apart as the configuration of the frame or 
axle permits. The safety chains or cables shall be either two separate 
pieces, each equipped with a hook or other means for attachment to the 
towing vehicle, or a single piece leading along each side of the tow-bar 
from the two points of attachment on the towed vehicle and arranged into 
a bridle with a single means of attachment to be connected to the towing 
vehicle. When a single length of cable is used, a thimble and twin-base 
cable clamps shall be used to form the forward bridle eye. The hook or 
other means of attachment to the towing vehicle shall be secured to the 
chains or cables in a fixed position.
    (6) If the towed vehicle is a converter dolly with a solid tongue 
and without a hinged tow-bar or other swivel between the fifth wheel 
mounting and the attachment point of the tongue eye or other hitch 
device--
    (i) Safety chains or cables, when used as the safety device for that 
vehicle, may consist of either two chains or cables or a single chain or 
cable used alone;
    (ii) A single safety device, including a single chain or cable used

Sec. 393.71  Coupling devices and towing methods, driveaway-towaway 
operations.

    (a) Number in combination. (1) No more than three saddle-mounts may 
be used in any combination.
    (2) No more than one tow-bar or ball-and-socket type coupling device 
may be used in any combination.
    (3) When motor vehicles are towed by means of triple saddle-mounts, 
the towed vehicles shall have brakes acting on all wheels which are in 
contact with the roadway.
    (b) Carrying vehicles on towing vehicle. (1) When adequately and 
securely attached by means equivalent in security to that provided in 
paragraph (j)(2) of this section, a motor vehicle or motor vehicles may 
be full-mounted on the structure of a towing vehicle engaged in any 
driveaway-towaway operation.
    (2) No motor vehicle or motor vehicles may be full-mounted on a 
towing vehicle unless the relationship of such full-mounted vehicles to 
the rear axle or axles results in proper distribution of the total gross 
weight of the vehicles and does not unduly interfere with the steering, 
braking, or maneuvering of the towing vehicle, or otherwise contribute 
to the unsafe operation of the vehicles comprising the combination.
    (3) Saddle-mounted vehicles must be arranged such that the gross 
weight of the vehicles is properly distributed to prevent undue 
interference with the steering, braking, or maneuvering of the 
combination of vehicles.
    (c) Carrying vehicles on towed vehicles. (1) When adequately and 
securely attached by means equivalent in security to that provided in 
paragraph (j)(2) of this section, a motor vehicle or motor vehicles may 
be full-mounted on the structure of towed vehicles engaged in any 
driveaway-towaway operation.
    (2) No motor vehicle shall be full-mounted on a motor vehicle towed 
by means of a tow-bar unless the towed vehicle is equipped with brakes 
and is provided with means for effective application of brakes acting on 
all wheels and is towed on its own wheels.
    (3) No motor vehicle or motor vehicles shall be full-mounted on a 
motor vehicle towed by means of a saddle-mount unless the center line of 
the kingpin or equivalent means of attachment of such towed vehicle 
shall be so located on the towing vehicle that the relationship to the 
rear axle or axles results in proper distribution of the total gross 
weight of the vehicles and does not unduly interfere with the steering, 
braking, or maneuvering of the towing vehicle or otherwise contribute to 
the unsafe operation of vehicles comprising the combination; and unless 
a perpendicular to the ground from the center of gravity of the full-
mounted vehicles lies forward of the center line of the rear axle of the 
saddle-mounted vehicle.
    (4) If a motor vehicle towed by means of a double saddle-mount has 
any vehicle full-mounted on it, such saddle-mounted vehicle shall at all 
times while so loaded have effective brakes acting on those wheels which 
are in contact with the roadway.
    (d) Bumper tow-bars on heavy vehicles prohibited. Tow-bars of the 
type which depend upon the bumpers as a means of transmitting forces 
between the vehicles shall not be used to tow a motor vehicle weighing 
more than 5,000 pounds.
    (e) Front wheels of saddle-mounted vehicles restrained. A motor 
vehicle towed by means of a saddle-mount shall have the motion of the 
front wheels restrained if under any condition of turning of such wheels 
they will project beyond the widest part of either the towed or towing 
vehicle.
    (f) Vehicles to be towed in forward position. Unless the steering 
mechanism is adequately locked in a straight-forward position, all motor 
vehicles towed by means of a saddle-mount shall be towed with the front 
end mounted on the towing vehicle.
    (g) Means required for towing. No motor vehicles or combination of 
motor vehicles shall be towed in driveaway-towaway operations by means 
other than a tow-bar, ball-and-socket type coupling device, saddle-mount 
connections which meet the requirements of this section, or in the case 
of a semi-trailer equipped with an upper coupler assembly, a fifth-wheel 
meeting the requirements of Sec. 393.70.
    (h) Requirements for tow-bars. Tow-bars shall comply with the 
following requirements:

[[Page 415]]

    (1) Tow-bars, structural adequacy and mounting. Every tow-bar shall 
be structurally adequate and properly installed and maintained. To 
insure that it is structurally adequate, it must, at least, meet the 
requirements of the following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    Longitudinal strength in tension and

\1\ The required strength of tow-bars for towed vehicles of 15,000
  pounds and over gross weight and of new tow-bars acquired and used
  after Sept. 30, 1948, for towed vehicles of 5,000 pounds and over
  gross weight shall be computed by means of the following formulae:
  Longitudinal strength=gross weight of towed vehicle x 1.3. Strength as
  a beam=gross weight of towed vehicle x 0.6.
\2\ In testing, the whole unit shall be tested with all clamps, joints,
  and pins so mounted and fastened as to approximate conditions of
  actual operation.
\3\ This test shall be applicable only to tow-bars which are, in normal
  operation, subjected to a bending movement such as tow-bars for house
  trailers.

    (2) Tow-bars, jointed. The tow-bar shall be so constructed as to 
freely permit motion in both horizontal and vertical planes between the 
towed and towing vehicles. The means used to provide the motion shall be 
such as to prohibit the transmission of stresses under normal operation 
between the towed and towing vehicles, except along the longitudinal 
axis of the tongue or tongues.
    (3) Tow-bar fastenings. The means used to transmit the stresses to 
the chassis or frames of the towed and towing vehicles may be either 
temporary structures or bumpers or other integral parts of the vehicles: 
Provided, however, That the means used shall be so constructed, 
installed, and maintained that when tested as an assembly, failure in 
such members shall not occur when the weakest new tow-bar which is 
permissible under paragraph (h)(1) of this section is subjected to the 
tests given therein.
    (4) Means of adjusting length. On tow-bars, adjustable as to length, 
the means used to make such adjustment shall fit tightly and not result 
in any slackness or permit the tow-bar to bend. With the tow-bar 
supported rigidly at both ends and with a load of 50 pounds at the 
center, the sag, measured at the center, in any direction shall not 
exceed 0.25 inch under any condition of adjustment as to length.
    (5) Method of clamping. Adequate means shall be provided for 
securely fastening the tow-bar to the towed and towing vehicles.
    (6) Tow-bar connection to steering mechanism. The tow-bar shall be 
provided with suitable means of attachment to and actuation of the 
steering mechanism, if any, of the towed vehicle. The attachment shall 
provide for sufficient angularity of movement of the front wheels of the 
towed vehicle so that it may follow substantially in the path of the 
towing vehicle without cramping the tow-bar. The tow-bar shall be 
provided with suitable joints to permit such movement.
    (7) Tracking. The tow-bar shall be so designed, constructed, 
maintained, and mounted as to cause the towed vehicle to follow 
substantially in the path of the towing vehicle. Tow-bars of such design 
on in our condition as to permit the towed vehicle to deviate more than 
3 inches to either side of the path of a towing vehicle moving in a 
straight line as measured from the center of the towing vehicle are 
prohibited.
    (8) Passenger car-trailer type couplings. Trailer couplings used for 
driveaway-towaway operations of passenger car trailers shall conform to 
Society of Automotive Engineers Standard No. J684c, ``Trailer Couplings 
and Hitches--Automotive Type,'' July 1970. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 393.24(c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (9) Marking tow-bars. Every tow-bar acquired and used in driveaway-
towaway operations by a motor carrier shall be plainly marked with the 
following certification of the manufacturer thereof (or words of 
equivalent meaning):

    This tow-bar complies with the requirements of the Federal Motor 
Carrier Safety Administration for (maximum gross weight for which tow-
bar is manufactured) vehicles.
Allowable Maximum Gross Weight__________________________________________

 (name of manufacturer)


Tow-bar certification manufactured before the effective date of this 
regulation must meet requirements in effect at the time of manufacture.
    (10) Safety devices in case of tow-bar failure or disconnection. (i) 
The towed vehicle shall be connected to the towing vehicle by a safety 
device to prevent the towed vehicle from breaking loose in the event the 
tow-bar fails or becomes disconnected. When safety chains or cables are 
used as the safety device for that vehicle, at least two safety chains 
or cables meeting the requirements of paragraph (h)(10)(ii) of this 
section shall be used. The tensile strength of the safety device and the 
means of attachment to the vehicles shall be at least equivalent to the 
corresponding longitudinal strength for tow-bars required in the table 
of paragraph (h)(1) of this section. If safety chains or cables are used 
as the safety device, the required strength shall be the combined 
strength of the combination of chains and cables.
    (ii) If chains or cables are used as the safety device, they shall 
be crossed and attached to the vehicles near the points of bumper 
attachments to the chassis of the vehicles. The length of chain used 
shall be no more than necessary to permit free turning of the vehicles. 
The chains shall be attached to the tow-bar at the point of crossing or 
as close to that point as is practicable.
    (iii) A safety device other than safety chains or cables must 
provide strength, security of attachment, and directional stability 
equal to, or greater than, that provided by safety chains or cables 
installed in accordance with paragraph (h)(10)(ii) of this section. A 
safety device other than safety chains or cables must be designed, 
constructed, and installed so that, if the tow-bar fails or becomes 
disconnected, the tow-bar will not drop to the ground.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Requirements for upper-half of saddle-mounts. The upper-half of 
any saddle-mount shall comply with the following requirements:
    (1) Upper-half connection to towed vehicle. The upper-half shall be 
securely attached to the frame or axle of the towed vehicle by means of 
U-bolts or other means providing at least equivalent security.
    (2) U-bolts or other attachments. U-bolts used to attach the upper 
half to the towed vehicle shall be made of steel rod, free of defects, 
so shaped as to avoid at any point a radius of less than 1 inch: 
Provided, however, That a lesser radius may be utilized if the U-bolt is 
so fabricated as not to cause more than 5 percent reduction in cross-
sectional area at points of curvature, in which latter event the minimum 
radius shall be one-sixteenth inch. U-bolts shall have a diameter not 
less than required by the following table:

\1\ The total weight of all the vehicles being towed shall govern. If
  other devices are used to accomplish the same purposes as U-bolts they
  shall have at least equivalent strength of U-bolts made of mild steel.
  Cast iron shall not be used for clamps or any other holding devices.

    (3) U-bolts and points of support, location. The distance between 
the most widely separated U-bolts shall not be less than 9 inches. The 
distance between the widely separated points where the upper-half 
supports the towed vehicle shall not be less than 9 inches, except that 
saddle-mounts employing ball and socket joints shall employ a device 
which clamps the axle of the towed vehicle throughout a length of not 
less than 5 inches.
    (4) Cradle-type upper-halves, specifications. Upper-halves of the 
cradle-type using vertical members to restrain the towed vehicle from 
relative movement in the direction of motion of the vehicles shall be 
substantially constructed and adequate for the purpose. Such cradle-
mounts shall be equipped with at least one bolt or equivalent means to 
provide against relative vertical movement between the upper-half and 
the towed vehicle. Bolts, if used, shall be at least one-half inch in 
diameter. Devices using equivalent means shall have at least equivalent 
strength. The means used to provide against relative vertical motion 
between the upper-half and the towed vehicle shall be such as not to 
permit a relative motion of over

[[Page 417]]

one-half inch. The distance between the most widely separated points of 
support between the upper-half and the towed vehicle shall be at least 9 
inches.
    (5) Lateral movement of towed vehicle. (i) Towed vehicles having a 
straight axle or an axle having a drop of less than 3 inches, unless the 
saddle-mount is constructed in accordance with paragraph (m)(2) of this 
section, shall be securely fastened by means of chains or cables to the 
upper-half so as to insure against relative lateral motion between the 
towed vehicle and the upper-half. The chains or cables shall be at least 
\3/16\-inch diameter and secured by bolts of at least equal diameter.
    (ii) Towed vehicles with an axle with a drop of 3 inches or more, or 
connected by a saddle-mount constructed in accordance with paragraph 
(m)(2) of this section, need not be restrained by chains or cables 
provided that the upper-half is so designed as to provide against such 
relative motion.
    (iii) Chains or cables shall not be required if the upper-half is so 
designed as positively to provide against lateral movement of the axle.
    (k) Requirements for lower half of saddle-mounts. The lower half of 
any saddle-mount shall comply with the following requirements:
    (1) U-bolts or other attachments. U-bolts used to attach the lower 
half to the towing vehicle shall be made of steel rod, free of defects, 
so shaped as to avoid at any point a radius of less than 1 inch: 
Provided, however, That a lesser radius may be utilized if the U-bolt is 
so fabricated as not to cause more than 5 percent reduction in cross-
sectional area at points of curvature, in which latter event the minimum 
radius shall be one-sixteenth inch. U-bolts shall have a total cross-
sectional area not less than as required by the following table:

\1\ The total weight of all the vehicles being towed shall govern. If
  other devices are used to accomplish the same purposes as U-bolts they
  shall have at least equivalent strength of U-bolts made of mild steel.
  Cast iron shall not be used for clamps or any other holding devices.

    (2) Shifting. Adequate provision shall be made by design and 
installation to provide against relative movement between the lower-half 
and the towing vehicle especially during periods of rapid acceleration 
and deceleration. To insure against shifting, designs of the tripod type 
shall be equipped with adequate and securely fastened hold-back chains 
or similar devices.
    (3) Swaying. (i) Adequate provision shall be made by design and 
installation to provide against swaying or lateral movement of the towed 
vehicle relative to the towing vehicle. To insure against swaying, 
lower-halves designed with cross-members attached to but separable from 
vertical members shall have such cross-members fastened to the vertical 
members by at least two bolts on each side. Such bolts shall be of at 
least equivalent cross-sectional area as those required for U-bolts for 
the corresponding saddle-mount as given in the table in paragraph (k)(1) 
of this section. The minimum distance between the most widely separated 
points of support of the cross-member by the vertical member shall be 
three inches as measured in a direction parallel to the longitudinal 
axis of the towing vehicle.
    (ii) The lower-half shall have a bearing surface on the frame of the 
towing vehicle of such dimensions that the pressure exerted by the 
lower-half upon the frame of the towing vehicle shall not exceed 200 
pounds per square inch under any conditions of static loading. Hardwood 
blocks or blocks of other suitable material, such as hard rubber, 
aluminum or brakelining, if used between the lower half and the frame of 
the towing vehicle shall be at least \1/2\ inch thick, 3 inches wide, 
and a combined length of 6 inches.

[[Page 418]]

    (iii) Under no condition shall the highest point of support of the 
towed vehicle by the upper-half be more than 24 inches, measured 
vertically, above the top of the frame of the towing vehicle, measured 
at the point where the lower-half rests on the towing vehicle.
    (4) Wood blocks. (i) Hardwood blocks of good quality may be used to 
build up the height of the front end of the towed vehicle, provided that 
the total height of such wood blocks shall not exceed 8 inches and not 
over two separate pieces are placed upon each other to obtain such 
height; however, hardwood blocks, not over 4 in number, to a total 
height not to exceed 14 inches, may be used if the total cross-sectional 
area of the U-bolts used to attach the lower-half of the towing vehicle 
is at least 50 percent greater than that required by the table contained 
in paragraph (k)(1) of this section, or, if other devices are used in 
lieu of U-bolts, they shall provide for as great a resistance to bending 
as is provided by the larger U-bolts above prescribed.
    (ii) Hardwood blocks must be at least 4 inches in width and the 
surfaces between blocks or block and lower-half or block and upper-half 
shall be planed and so installed and maintained as to minimize any 
tendency of the towed vehicle to sway or rock.
    (5) Cross-member, general requirements. The cross-member, which is 
that part of the lower-half used to distribute the weight of the towed 
vehicle equally to each member of the frame of the towing vehicle, if 
used, shall be structurally adequate and properly installed and 
maintained adequately to perform this function.
    (6) Cross-member, use of wood. No materials, other than suitable 
metals, shall be used as the cross-member, and wood may not be used 
structurally in any manner that will result in its being subject to 
tensile stresses. Wood may be used in cross-members if supported 
throughout its length by suitable metal cross-members.
    (7) Lower half strength. The lower half shall be capable of 
supporting the loads given in the following table. For the purpose of 
test, the saddle-mount shall be mounted as normally operated and the 
load applied through the upper half:

into the upper and lower-halves but shall not bind. Those portions of 
the upper or lower-halves in moving contact with the kingpin shall be 
smoothly machined with no rough or sharp edges. The bearing surface thus 
provided shall not be less in depth than the radius of the kingpin.
    (3) Kingpin bushing on saddle-mounts. The kingpin of all new saddle-
mounts acquired and used shall be snugly enclosed in a bushing at least 
along such length of the kingpin as may be in moving contact with either 
the upper or lower-halves. The bearing surface thus provided shall not 
be less in depth than the radius of the kingpin.
    (4) Kingpin to restrain vertical motion. The kingpin shall be so 
designed and installed as to restrain the upper-half from moving in a 
vertical direction relative to the lower-half.
    (m) Additional requirements for saddle-mounts. Saddle-mounts shall 
comply with the following requirements:
    (1) Bearing surface between upper and lower-halves. The upper and 
lower-halves shall be so constructed and connected that the bearing 
surface between the two halves shall not be less than 16 square inches 
under any conditions of angularity between the towing and towed 
vehicles: Provided, however, That saddle-mounts using a ball and socket 
joint shall have a ball of such dimension that the static bearing load 
shall not exceed 800 pounds per square inch, based on the projected 
cross-sectional area of the ball: And further provided, That saddle-
mounts having the upper-half supported by ball, taper, or roller-
bearings shall not have such bearings loaded beyond the limits 
prescribed for such bearings by the manufacturer thereof. The upper-half 
shall rest evenly and smoothly upon the lower-half and the contact 
surfaces shall be lubricated and maintained so that there shall be a 
minimum of frictional resistance between the parts.
    (2) Saddle-mounts, angularity. All saddle-mounts acquired and used 
shall provide for angularity between the towing and towed vehicles due 
to vertical curvatures of the highway. Such means shall not depend upon 
either the looseness or deformation of the parts of either the saddle-
mount or the vehicles to provide for such angularity.
    (3) Tracking. The saddle-mount shall be so designed, constructed, 
maintained, and installed that the towed vehicle or vehicles will follow 
substantially in the path of the towing vehicle without swerving. Towed 
vehicles shall not deviate more than 3 inches to either side of the path 
of the towing vehicle when moving in a straight line.
    (4) Prevention of frame bending. Where necessary, provision shall be 
made to prevent the bending of the frame of the towing vehicle by 
insertion of suitable blocks inside the frame channel to prevent 
kinking. The saddle-mount shall not be so located as to cause 
deformation of the frame by reason of cantilever action.
    (5) Extension of frame. No saddle-mount shall be located at a point 
to the rear of the frame of a towing vehicle.
    (6) Nuts, secured. All nuts used on bolts, U-bolts, king-pins, or in 
any other part of the saddle-mount shall be secured against accidental 
disconnection by means of cotter-keys, lock-washers, double nuts, safety 
nuts, or equivalent means. Parts shall be so designed and installed that 
nuts shall be fully engaged.
    (7) Inspection of all parts. The saddle-mount shall be so designed 
that it may be disassembled and each separate part inspected for worn, 
bent, cracked, broken, or missing parts.
    (8) Saddle-mounts, marking. Every new saddle-mount acquired and used 
in driveaway-towaway operations by a motor carrier shall have the upper-
half and the lower-half separately marked with the following 
certification of the manufacturer thereof (or words of equivalent 
meaning).

    This saddle-mount complies with the requirements of the Federal 
Motor Carrier Safety Administration for vehicles up to 5,000 pounds (or 
over 5,000 pounds):

Sec. 393.77  Heaters.

    On every motor vehicle, every heater shall comply with the following 
requirements:
    (a) Prohibited types of heaters. The installation or use of the 
following types of heaters is prohibited:
    (1) Exhaust heaters. Any type of exhaust heater in which the engine 
exhaust gases are conducted into or through any space occupied by 
persons or any heater which conducts engine compartment air into any 
such space.
    (2) Unenclosed flame heaters. Any type of heater employing a flame 
which is not fully enclosed, except that such heaters are not prohibited 
when used for heating the cargo of tank motor vehicles.
    (3) Heaters permitting fuel leakage. Any type of heater from the 
burner of which there could be spillage or leakage of fuel upon the 
tilting or overturning of the vehicle in which it is mounted.
    (4) Heaters permitting air contamination. Any heater taking air, 
heated or to be heated, from the engine compartment or from direct 
contact with any portion of the exhaust system; or any heater taking air 
in ducts from the outside atmosphere to be conveyed through the engine 
compartment, unless said ducts are so constructed and installed as to 
prevent contamination of the air so conveyed by exhaust or engine 
compartment gases.
    (5) Solid fuel heaters except wood charcoal. Any stove or other 
heater employing solid fuel except wood charcoal.
    (6) Portable heaters. Portable heaters shall not be used in any 
space occupied by persons except the cargo space of motor vehicles which 
are being loaded or unloaded.
    (b) Heater specifications. All heaters shall comply with the 
following specifications:
    (1) Heating elements, protection. Every heater shall be so located 
or protected as to prevent contact therewith by occupants, unless the 
surface temperature of the protecting grilles or of any exposed portions 
of the heaters, inclusive of exhaust stacks, pipes, or conduits shall be 
lower than would cause contact burns. Adequate protection shall be 
afforded against igniting parts of the vehicle or burning occupants by 
direct radiation. Wood charcoal heaters shall be enclosed within a metal 
barrel, drum, or similar protective enclosure which enclosure shall be 
provided with a securely fastened cover.
    (2) Moving parts, guards. Effective guards shall be provided for the 
protection of passengers or occupants against injury by fans, belts, or 
any other moving parts.
    (3) Heaters, secured. Every heater and every heater enclosure shall 
be securely fastened to the vehicle in a substantial manner so as to 
provide against relative motion within the vehicle during normal usage 
or in the event the vehicle overturns. Every heater shall be so 
designed, constructed, and mounted as to minimize the likelihood of 
disassembly of any of

[[Page 423]]

its parts, including exhaust stacks, pipes, or conduits, upon overturn 
of the vehicle in or on which it is mounted. Wood charcoal heaters shall 
be secured against relative motion within the enclosure required by 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and the enclosure shall be securely 
fastened to the motor vehicle.
    (4) Relative motion between fuel tank and heater. When either in 
normal operation or in the event of overturn, there is or is likely to 
be relative motion between the fuel tank for a heater and the heater, or 
between either of such units and the fuel lines between them, a suitable 
means shall be provided at the point of greatest relative motion so as 
to allow this motion without causing failure of the fuel lines.
    (5) Operating controls to be protected. On every bus designed to 
transport more than 15 passengers, including the driver, means shall be 
provided to prevent unauthorized persons from tampering with the 
operating controls. Such means may include remote control by the driver; 
installation of controls at inaccessible places; control of adjustments 
by key or keys; enclosure of controls in a locked space, locking of 
controls, or other means of accomplishing this purpose.
    (6) Heater hoses. Hoses for all hot water and steam heater systems 
shall be specifically designed and constructed for that purpose.
    (7) Electrical apparatus. Every heater employing any electrical 
apparatus shall be equipped with electrical conductors, switches, 
connectors, and other electrical parts of ample current-carrying 
capacity to provide against overheating; any electric motor employed in 
any heater shall be of adequate size and so located that it will not be 
overheated; electrical circuits shall be provided with fuses and/or 
circuit breakers to provide against electrical overloading; and all 
electrical conductors employed in or leading to any heater shall be 
secured against dangling, chafing, and rubbing and shall have suitable 
protection against any other condition likely to produce short or open 
circuits.

    Note: Electrical parts certified as proper for use by Underwriters' 
Laboratories, Inc., shall be deemed to comply with the foregoing 
requirements.

    (8) Storage battery caps. If a separate storage battery is located 
within the personnel or cargo space, such battery shall be securely 
mounted and equipped with nonspill filler caps.
    (9) Combustion heater exhaust construction. Every heater employing 
the combustion of oil, gas, liquefied petroleum gas, or any other 
combustible material shall be provided with substantial means of 
conducting the products of combustion to the outside of the vehicle: 
Provided, however, That this requirement shall not apply to heaters used 
solely to heat the cargo space of motor vehicles where such motor 
vehicles or heaters are equipped with means specifically designed and 
maintained so that the carbon monoxide concentration will never exceed 
0.2 percent in the cargo space. The exhaust pipe, stack, or conduit if 
required shall be sufficiently substantial and so secured as to provide 
reasonable assurance against leakage or discharge of products of 
combustion within the vehicle and, if necessary, shall be so insulated 
as to make unlikely the burning or charring of parts of the vehicle by 
radiation or by direct contact. The place of discharge of the products 
of combustion to the atmosphere and the means of discharge of such 
products shall be such as to minimize the likelihood of their reentry 
into the vehicle under all operating conditions.
    (10) Combustion chamber construction. The design and construction of 
any combustion-type heater except cargo space heaters permitted by the 
proviso of paragraph (c)(9) of this section and unenclosed flame heaters 
used for heating cargo of tank motor vehicles shall be such as to 
provide against the leakage of products of combustion into air to be 
heated and circulated. The material employed in combustion chambers 
shall be such as to provide against leakage because of corrosion, 
oxidation, or other deterioration. Joints between combustion chambers 
and the air chambers with which they are in thermal and mechanical 
contact shall be so designed and constructed as to prevent leakage 
between the chambers and the materials employed in such joints shall 
have melting points substantially higher than the maximum

[[Page 424]]

temperatures likely to be attained at the points of jointure.
    (11) Heater fuel tank location. Every bus designed to transport more 
than 15 passengers, including the driver, with heaters of the combustion 
type shall have fuel tanks therefor located outside of and lower than 
the passenger space. When necessary, suitable protection shall be 
afforded by shielding or other means against the puncturing of any such 
tank or its connections by flying stones or other objects.
    (12) Heater, automatic fuel control. Gravity or siphon feed shall 
not be permitted for heaters using liquid fuels. Heaters using liquid 
fuels shall be equipped with automatic means for shutting off the fuel 
or for reducing such flow of fuel to the smallest practicable magnitude, 
in the event of overturn of the vehicle. Heaters using liquefied 
petroleum gas as fuel shall have the fuel line equipped with automatic 
means at the source of supply for shutting off the fuel in the event of 
separation, breakage, or disconnection of any of the fuel lines between 
the supply source and the heater.
    (13) ``Tell-tale'' indicators. Heaters subject to paragraph (c)(14) 
of this section and not provided with automatic controls shall be 
provided with ``tell-tale'' means to indicate to the driver that the 
heater is properly functioning. This requirement shall not apply to 
heaters used solely for the cargo space in semitrailers or full 
trailers.
    (14) Shut-off control. Automatic means, or manual means if the 
control is readily accessible to the driver without moving from the 
driver's seat, shall be provided to shut off the fuel and electrical 
supply in case of failure of the heater to function for any reason, or 
in case the heater should function improperly or overheat. This 
requirement shall not apply to wood charcoal heaters or to heaters used 
solely to heat the contents of cargo tank motor vehicles, but wood 
charcoal heaters must be provided with a controlled method of regulating 
the flow of combustion air.
    (15) Certification required. Every combustion-type heater, except 
wood charcoal heaters, the date of manufacture of which is subsequent to 
December 31, 1952, and every wood charcoal heater, the date of 
manufacture of which is subsequent to September 1, 1953, shall be marked 
plainly to indicate the type of service for which such heater is 
designed and with a certification by the manufacturer that the heater 
meets the applicable requirements for such use. For example, ``Meets 
I.C.C. Bus Heater Requirements,'' Meets I.C.C. Flue-Vented Cargo Space 
Heater Requirements,'' and after December 31, 1967, such certification 
shall read ``Meets FMCSA Bus Heater Requirements,'' ``Meets FMCSA Flue-

         Subpart I_Protection Against Shifting and Falling Cargo

    Source: 67 FR 61225, Sept. 27, 2002, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 393.100  Which types of commercial motor vehicles are subject to 
the cargo securement standards of this subpart, and what general 
requirements apply?

    (a) Applicability. The rules in this subpart are applicable to 
trucks, truck tractors, semitrailers, full trailers, and pole trailers.
    (b) Prevention against loss of load. Each commercial motor vehicle 
must, when transporting cargo on public roads, be loaded and equipped, 
and the cargo secured, in accordance with this subpart to prevent the 
cargo from leaking, spilling, blowing or falling from the motor vehicle.
    (c) Prevention against shifting of load. Cargo must be contained, 
immobilized or secured in accordance with this subpart to prevent 
shifting upon or within the vehicle to such an extent that the vehicle's 
stability or maneuverability is adversely affected.


<R05>
Sec. 393.102  What are the minimum performance criteria for cargo 
securement devices and systems?

    (a) Performance criteria. Cargo securement devices and systems must 
be capable of withstanding the following three forces, applied 
separately:
    (1) 0.8 g deceleration in the forward direction;
    (2) 0.5 g acceleration in the rearward direction; and
    (3) 0.5 g acceleration in a lateral direction.
    (b) Performance criteria for devices to prevent vertical movement of 
loads that are not contained within the structure of the vehicle. 
Securement systems must provide a downward force equivalent to at least 
20 percent of the weight of the article of cargo if the article is not 
fully contained within the structure of the vehicle. If the article is 
fully contained within the structure of the vehicle, it may be secured 
in accordance with Sec. 393.106(b).
    (c) Prohibition on exceeding working load limits. Cargo securement 
devices and systems must be designed, installed, and maintained to 
ensure that the maximum forces acting on the devices or systems do not 
exceed the working load limit for the devices under the conditions 
listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (d) Equivalent means of securement. Cargo that is immobilized, or 
secured in accordance with the applicable requirements of Sec. Sec. 
393.104 through 393.136, is considered as meeting the performance 
criteria of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 393.104  What standards must cargo securement devices and systems 
meet in order to satisfy the requirements of this subpart?

    (a) General. All devices and systems used to secure cargo to or 
within a vehicle must be capable of meeting the requirements of Sec. 
393.102.
    (b) Prohibition on the use of damaged securement devices. All 
vehicle structures, systems, parts, and components used to secure cargo 
must be in proper working order when used to perform that function with 
no damaged or weakened components that will adversely effect their 
performance for cargo securement purposes, including reducing the 
working load limit, and must not have any cracks or cuts.
    (c) Vehicle structures and anchor points. Vehicle structures, 
floors, walls, decks, tiedown anchor points, headerboards, bulkheads, 
stakes, posts and associated mounting pockets used to contain or secure 
articles of cargo must be strong enough to meet the performance criteria 
of Sec. 393.102, with no damaged or weakened components that will 
adversely effect their performance for cargo securement purposes, 
including reducing the working load limit, and must not have any cracks 
or cuts.
    (d) Material for dunnage, chocks, cradles, shoring bars, blocking 
and bracing. Material used as dunnage or dunnage

[[Page 432]]

bags, chocks, cradles, shoring bars, or used for blocking and bracing, 
must not have damage or defects which would compromise the effectiveness 
of the securement system.
    (e) Manufacturing standards for tiedown assemblies. Tiedown 
assemblies (including chains, wire rope, steel strapping, synthetic 
webbing, and cordage) and other attachment or fastening devices used to 
secure articles of cargo to, or in, commercial motor vehicles must 
conform to the following applicable standards:

    (f) Use of tiedowns. (1) Tiedowns and securing devices must not 
contain knots.
    (2) If a tiedown is repaired, it must be repaired in accordance with 
the applicable standards in paragraph (e) of this section, or the 
manufacturer's instructions.
    (3) Each tiedown must be attached and secured in a manner that 
prevents it from becoming loose, unfastening, opening or releasing while 
the vehicle is in transit.
    (4) All tiedowns and other components of a cargo securement system 
used to secure loads on a trailer equipped with rub rails, must be 
located inboard of the rub rails whenever practicable.
    (5) Edge protection must be used whenever a tiedown would be subject 
to abrasion or cutting at the point where it touches an article of 
cargo. The edge protection must resist abrasion, cutting and crushing.


<R05>
Sec. 393.106  What are the general requirements for securing articles 
of cargo?

    (a) Applicability. The rules in this section are applicable to the 
transportation of all types of articles of cargo, except commodities in 
bulk that lack structure or fixed shape (e.g., liquids, gases, grain, 
liquid concrete, sand, gravel, aggregates) and are transported in a 
tank, hopper, box or similar device that forms part of the structure of 
a commercial motor vehicle. The rules in this section apply to the cargo 
types covered by the commodity-specific rules of Sec. 393.116 through 
Sec. 393.136. The commodity-specific rules take precedence over the 
general requirements of this section when additional requirements are 
given for a commodity listed in those sections.
    (b) General. Cargo must be firmly immobilized or secured on or 
within a vehicle by structures of adequate strength, dunnage or dunnage 
bags, shoring bars, tiedowns or a combination of these.
    (c) Cargo placement and restraint. (1) Articles of cargo that are 
likely to roll must be restrained by chocks, wedges, a cradle or other 
equivalent means to prevent rolling. The means of preventing rolling 
must not be capable of becoming unintentionally unfastened or loose 
while the vehicle is in transit.
    (2) Articles or cargo placed beside each other and secured by 
transverse tiedowns must either:
    (i) Be placed in direct contact with each other, or
    (ii) Be prevented from shifting towards each other while in transit.
    (d) Minimum strength of cargo securement devices and systems. The 
aggregate working load limit of any securement system used to secure an 
article or group of articles against movement must be at least one-half 
times the weight of the article or group of articles. The aggregate 
working load limit is the sum of:
    (1) One-half of the working load limit of each associated connector 
or attachment mechanism used to secure a part of the article of cargo to 
the vehicle; and
    (2) One-half of the working load limit for each end section of a 
tiedown that is attached to an anchor point.

<R05>
Sec. 393.108  How is the working load limit of a tiedown determined?

    (a) The working load limit (WLL) of a tiedown, associated connector 
or attachment mechanism is the lowest working load limit of any of its 
components (including tensioner), or the working load limit of the 
anchor points to which it is attached, whichever is less.
    (b) The working load limits of tiedowns may be determined by using 
either the tiedown manufacturer's markings or by using the tables in 
this section. The working load limits listed in the tables are to be 
used when the tiedown material is not marked by the manufacturer with 
the working load limit. Tiedown materials which are marked by the 
manufacturer with working load limits that differ from the tables, shall 
be considered to have a working load limit equal to the value for which 
they are marked.
    (c) Synthetic cordage (e.g., nylon, polypropylene, polyester) which 
is not marked or labeled to enable identification of its composition or 
working load limit shall be considered to have a

[[Page 435]]

working load limit equal to that for polypropylene fiber rope.
    (d) Welded steel chain which is not marked or labeled to enable 
identification of its grade or working load limit shall be considered to 
have a working load limit equal to that for grade 30 proof coil chain.
    (e)(1) Wire rope which is not marked by the manufacturer with a 
working load limit shall be considered to have a working load limit 
equal to one-fourth of the nominal strength listed in the Wire Rope 
Users Manual.
    (2) Wire which is not marked or labeled to enable identification of 
its construction type shall be considered to have a working load limit 
equal to that for 6 x 37, fiber core wire rope.
    (f) Manila rope which is not marked by the manufacturer with a 
working load limit shall be considered to have a working load limit 
based on its diameter as provided in the tables of working load limits.
    (g) Friction mats which are not marked or rated by the manufacturer 
shall be considered to provide resistance to horizontal movement equal 
to 50 percent of the weight placed on the mat.

                                                                Tables to Sec. 393.108

Sec. 393.110  What else do I have to do to determine the minimum number 
of tiedowns?

    (a) In addition to the requirements of Sec. 393.106, the minimum 
number of tiedowns required to secure an article or group of articles 
against movement depends on the length of the article(s) being secured, 
and the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) When an article is not blocked or positioned to prevent movement 
in the forward direction by a headerboard, bulkhead, other cargo that is 
positioned to prevent movement, or other appropriate blocking devices, 
it must be secured by at least:
    (1) One tiedown for articles 5 feet (1.52 meters) or less in length, 
and 1,100 pounds (500 kg) or less in weight;
    (2) Two tiedowns if the article is:
    (i) 5 feet (1.52 meters) or less in length and more than 1,100 
pounds (500 kg) in weight; or
    (ii) Longer than 5 feet (1.52 meters) but less than or equal to 10 
feet (3.04 meters) in length, irrespective of the weight.
    (3) Two tiedowns if the article is longer than 10 feet (3.04 
meters), and one additional tiedown for every 10 feet (3.04 meters) of 
article length, or fraction thereof, beyond the first 10 feet (3.04 
meters) of length.
    (c) If an individual article is required to be blocked, braced or 
immobilized to prevent movement in the forward direction by a 
headerboard, bulkhead, other articles which are adequately secured or by 
an appropriate blocking or immobilization method, it must be secured by 
at least one tiedown for every 3.04 meters (10 feet) or article length, 
or fraction thereof.
    (d) Special rule for special purpose vehicles. The rules in this 
section do not apply to a vehicle transporting one or more articles of 
cargo such as, but not limited to, machinery or fabricated structural 
items (e.g., steel or concrete beams, crane booms, girders, and trusses, 
etc.) which, because of their design, size, shape, or weight, must be 
fastened by special methods. However, any article of cargo carried on 
that vehicle must be securely and adequately fastened to the vehicle.


<R05>
Sec. 393.112  Must a tiedown be adjustable?

    Each tiedown, or its associated connectors, or its attachment 
mechanisms must be designed, constructed, and maintained so the driver 
of an in-transit commercial motor vehicle can tighten them. However, 
this requirement does not apply to the use of steel strapping.


<R05>
Sec. 393.114  What are the requirements for front end structures used 
as part of a cargo securement system?

    (a) Applicability. The rules in this section are applicable to 
commercial motor vehicles transporting articles of cargo that are in 
contact with the front end structure of the vehicle. The front end 
structure on these cargo-carrying vehicles must meet the performance 
requirements of this section.
    (b) Height and width. (1) The front end structure must extend either 
to a height of 4 feet above the floor of the vehicle or to a height at 
which it blocks forward movement of any item of article of cargo being 
carried on the vehicle, whichever is lower.
    (2) The front end structure must have a width which is at least 
equal to the width of the vehicle or which blocks forward movement of 
any article of cargo being transported on the vehicle, whichever is 
narrower.

[[Page 437]]

    (c) Strength. The front end structure must be capable of 
withstanding the following horizontal forward static load:
    (1) For a front end structure less than 6 feet in height, a 
horizontal forward static load equal to one-half (0.5) of the weight of 
the articles of cargo being transported on the vehicle uniformly 
distributed over the entire portion of the front end structure that is 
within 4 feet above the vehicle's floor or that is at or below a height 
above the vehicle's floor at which it blocks forward movement of any 
article of the vehicle's cargo, whichever is less; or
    (2) For a front end structure 6 feet in height or higher, a 
horizontal forward static load equal to four-tenths (0.4) of the weight 
of the articles of cargo being transported on the vehicle uniformly 
distributed over the entire front end structure.
    (d) Penetration resistance. The front end structure must be 
designed, constructed, and maintained so that it is capable of resisting 
penetration by any article of cargo that contacts it when the vehicle 
decelerates at a rate of 20 feet per second, per second. The front end 
structure must have no aperture large enough to permit any article of 
cargo in contact with the structure to pass through it.
    (e) Substitute devices. The requirements of this section may be met 
by the use of devices performing the same functions as a front end 
structure, if the devices are at least as strong as, and provide 
protection against shifting articles of cargo at least equal to, a front 
end structure which conforms to those requirements.

<R05>
Sec. 393.116  What are the rules for securing logs?

    (a) Applicability. The rules in this section are applicable to the 
transportation of logs with the following exceptions:
    (1) Logs that are unitized by banding or other comparable means may 
be transported in accordance with the general cargo securement rules of 
Sec. Sec. 393.100 through 393.114.
    (2) Loads that consist of no more than four processed logs may be 
transported in accordance with the general cargo securement rules of 
Sec. Sec. 393.100 through 393.114.
    (3) Firewood, stumps, log debris and other such short logs must be 
transported in a vehicle or container enclosed on both sides, front, and 
rear and of adequate strength to contain them. Longer logs may also be 
so loaded.
    (b) Components of a securement system. (1) Logs must be transported 
on a vehicle designed and built, or adapted, for the transportation of 
logs. Any such vehicle must be fitted with bunks, bolsters, stakes or 
standards, or other equivalent means, that cradle the logs and prevent 
them from rolling.
    (2) All vehicle components involved in securement of logs must be 
designed and built to withstand all anticipated operational forces 
without failure, accidental release or permanent deformation. Stakes or 
standards that are not permanently attached to the vehicle must be 
secured in a manner that prevents unintentional separation from the 
vehicle in transit.
    (3) Tiedowns must be used in combination with the stabilization 
provided by bunks, stakes and bolsters to secure the load.
    (c) Use of securement system. (1) Logs must be solidly packed, and 
the outer bottom logs must be in contact with and resting solidly 
against the bunks, bolsters, stakes or standards.
    (2) Each outside log on the side of a stack of logs must touch at 
least two stakes, bunks, bolsters, or standards. If one end does not 
actually touch a stake, it must rest on other logs in a stable manner 
and must extend beyond the stake, bunk, bolster or standard.
    (3) The center of the highest outside log on each side or end must 
be below the top of each stake, bunk or standard.
    (4) Each log that is not held in place by contact with other logs or 
the stakes, bunks, or standards must be held in place by a tiedown. 
Additional tiedowns or securement devices must be used when the 
condition of the wood results in such low friction between logs that 
they are likely to slip upon each other.

[[Page 438]]

    (d) Securement of shortwood logs loaded crosswise on frame, rail and 
flatbed vehicles. In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (b) and 
(c) of this section, each stack of logs loaded crosswise must meet the 
following rules:
    (1) In no case may the end of a log in the lower tier extend more 
than one-third of the log's total length beyond the nearest supporting 
structure on the vehicle.
    (2) When only one stack of shortwood is loaded crosswise, it must be 
secured with at least two tiedowns. The tiedowns must attach to the 
vehicle frame at the front and rear of the load, and must cross the load 
in this direction.
    (3) When two tiedowns are used, they must be positioned at 
approximately one-third and two-thirds of the length of the logs.
    (4) A vehicle that is more than 10 meters (33 feet) long must be 
equipped with center stakes, or comparable devices, to divide it into 
sections approximately equal in length. Where a vehicle is so divided, 
each tiedown must secure the highest log on each side of the center 
stake, and must be fastened below these logs. It may be fixed at each 
end and tensioned from the middle, or fixed in the middle and tensioned 
from each end, or it may pass through a pulley or equivalent device in 
the middle and be tensioned from one end.
    (5) Any structure or stake that is subjected to an upward force when 
the tiedowns are tensioned must be anchored to resist that force.
    (6) If two stacks of shortwood are loaded side-by-side, in addition 
to meeting the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this 
section, they must be loaded so that:
    (i) There is no space between the two stacks of logs;
    (ii) The outside of each stack is raised at least 2.5 cm (1 in) 
within 10 cm (4 in) of the end of the logs or the side of the vehicle;
    (iii) The highest log is no more than 2.44 m (8 ft) above the deck; 
and
    (iv) At least one tiedown is used lengthwise across each stack of 
logs.
    (e) Securement of logs loaded lengthwise on flatbed and frame 
vehicles. In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraphs (b) and 
(c) of this section, each stack of shortwood loaded lengthwise on a 
frame vehicle or on a flatbed must be secured to the vehicle by at least 
two tiedowns.
    (f) Securement of logs transported on pole trailers. (1) The load 
must be secured by at least one tiedown at each bunk, or alternatively, 
by at least two tiedowns used as wrappers that encircle the entire load 
at locations along the load that provide effective securement.
    (2) The front and rear wrappers must be at least 3.04 meters (10 
feet) apart.
    (3) Large diameter single and double log loads must be immobilized 
with chock blocks or other equivalent means to prevent shifting.
    (4) Large diameter logs that rise above bunks must be secured to the 
underlying load with at least two additional wrappers.

Sec. 393.122  What are the rules for securing paper rolls?

    (a) Applicability. The rules in this section apply to shipments of 
paper rolls which, individually or together, weigh 2268 kg (5000 lb) or 
more. Shipments of paper rolls that weigh less than 2268 kg (5000 lb), 
and paper rolls that are unitized on a pallet, may either be secured in 
accordance with the rules in this section or the requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 393.100 through 393.114.
    (b) Securement of paper rolls transported with eyes vertical in a 
sided vehicle. (1) Paper rolls must be placed tightly against the walls 
of the vehicle, other paper rolls, or other cargo, to prevent movement 
during transit.
    (2) If there are not enough paper rolls in the shipment to reach the 
walls of the vehicle, lateral movement must be prevented by filling the 
void, blocking, bracing, tiedowns or friction mats. The paper rolls may 
also be banded together.
    (3) When any void behind a group of paper rolls, including that at 
the rear of the vehicle, exceeds the diameter of the paper rolls, 
rearward movement

[[Page 442]]

must be prevented by friction mats, blocking, bracing, tiedowns, or 
banding to other rolls.
    (4)(i) If a paper roll is not prevented from tipping or falling 
sideways or rearwards by vehicle structure or other cargo, and its width 
is more than 2 times its diameter, it must be prevented from tipping or 
falling by banding it to other rolls, bracing, or tiedowns.
    (ii) If the forwardmost roll(s) in a group of paper rolls is not 
prevented from tipping or falling forwards by vehicle structure or other 
cargo and it is restrained against forward movement by friction mat(s) 
alone, and its width is more than 1.75 times its diameter, it must be 
prevented from tipping or falling forwards by banding it to other rolls, 
bracing, or tiedowns.
    (iii) Otherwise, when a paper roll or the forwardmost roll in groups 
of rolls that are not prevented from tipping or falling forwards by 
vehicle structure or other cargo and its width exceeds 1.25 times its 
diameter it must be prevented from tipping or falling by banding it to 
other rolls, bracing or tiedowns.
    (5) If paper rolls are banded together, the rolls must be placed 
tightly against each other to form a stable group. The bands must be 
applied tightly, and must be secured so that they cannot fall off the 
rolls or to the deck.
    (6) A friction mat used to provide the principal securement for a 
paper roll must protrude from beneath the roll in the direction in which 
it is providing that securement.
    (c) Securement of split loads of paper rolls transported with eyes 
vertical in a sided vehicle. (1) If a paper roll in a split load is not 
prevented from forward movement by vehicle structure or other cargo, it 
must be prevented from forward movement by filling the open space, or by 
blocking, bracing, tiedowns, friction mats, or some combination of 
these.
    (2) A friction mat used to provide the principal securement for a 
paper roll must protrude from beneath the roll in the direction in which 
it is providing that securement.
    (d) Securement of stacked loads of paper rolls transported with eyes 
vertical in a sided vehicle. (1) Paper rolls must not be loaded on a 
layer of paper rolls beneath unless the lower layer extends to the front 
of the vehicle.
    (2) Paper rolls in the second and subsequent layers must be 
prevented from forward, rearward or lateral movement by means as allowed 
for the bottom layer, or by use of a blocking roll from a lower layer.
    (3) The blocking roll must be at least 38 mm (1.5 in) taller than 
other rolls, or must be raised at least 38 mm (1.5 in) using dunnage.
    (4) A roll in the rearmost row of any layer must not be raised using 
dunnage.
    (e) Securement of paper rolls transported with eyes crosswise in a

receiving an inspection report shall deliver it to the motor carrier 
operating the vehicle upon his/her arrival at the next terminal or 
facility. If the driver is not scheduled to arrive at a terminal or 
facility of the motor carrier operating the vehicle within 24 hours, the 
driver shall immediately mail the report to the motor carrier.
    (2) Motor carriers shall examine the report. Violations or defects 
noted thereon shall be corrected.
    (3) Within 15 days following the date of the inspection, the motor 
carrier shall--
    (i) Certify that all violations noted have been corrected by 
completing the ``Signature of Carrier Official, Title, and Date Signed'' 
portions of the form; and
    (ii) Return the completed roadside inspection form to the issuing 
agency at the address indicated on the form and retain a copy at the 
motor carrier's principal place of business or where the vehicle is 
housed for 12 months from the date of the inspection.

    (b) Report content. The report shall identify the vehicle and list 
any defect or deficiency discovered by or reported to the driver which 
would affect the safety of operation of the vehicle or result in its 
mechanical breakdown. If no defect or deficiency is discovered by or 
reported to the driver, the report shall so indicate. In all instances, 
the driver shall sign the report. On two-driver operations, only one 
driver needs to sign the driver vehicle inspection report, provided both 
drivers agree as to the defects or deficiencies identified. If a driver 
operates more than one vehicle during the day, a report shall be 
prepared for each vehicle operated.
    (c) Corrective action. Prior to requiring or permitting a driver to 
operate a vehicle, every motor carrier or its agent shall repair any 
defect or deficiency listed on the driver vehicle inspection report 
which would be likely to affect the safety of operation of the vehicle.
    (1) Every motor carrier or its agent shall certify on the original 
driver vehicle inspection report which lists any defect or deficiency 
that the defect or deficiency has been repaired or that repair is 
unnecessary before the vehicle is operated again.
    (2) Every motor carrier shall maintain the original driver vehicle 
inspection report, the certification of repairs, and the certification 
of the driver's review for three months from the date the written report 
was prepared.

    (1) Enhancement of public safety. The State or Indian tribe shall 
make a finding, supported by the record to be developed in accordance 
with paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(3)(iv) of this section, that any NRHM 
routing designation enhances public safety in the areas subject to its 
jurisdiction and in other areas which are directly affected by such 
highway routing designation. In making such a finding, the State or 
Indian tribe shall consider:
    (i) The factors listed in paragraph (b)(9) of this section; and
    (ii) The DOT ``Guidelines for Applying Criteria to Designate Routes 
for Transporting Hazardous Materials,'' DOT/RSPA/OHMT-89-02, July 1989 
\1\ or its most current version; or an equivalent routing analysis which 
adequately considers overall risk to the public.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Public participation. Prior to the establishment of any NRHM 
routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall undertake the 
following actions to ensure participation by the public in the routing 
process:
    (i) The State or Indian tribe shall provide the public with notice 
of any proposed NRHM routing designation and a 30-day period in which to 
comment. At any time during this period or following review of the 
comments received, the State or Indian tribe shall decide whether to 
hold a public hearing on the proposed NRHM route designation. The public 
shall be given 30 days prior notice of the public hearing which shall be 
conducted as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. Notice 
for both the comment period and the public hearing, if one is held, 
shall be given by publication in at least two newspapers of general 
circulation in the affected area or areas and shall contain a complete 
description of the proposed routing designation, together with the date, 
time, and location of any public hearings. Notice for both the comment 
period and any public hearing may also be published in the official 
register of the State.
    (ii) If it is determined that a public hearing is necessary, the 
State or Indian tribe shall hold at least one public hearing on the 
record during which the public will be afforded the opportunity to 
present their views and any information or data related to the proposed 
NRHM routing designation. The State shall make available to the public, 
upon payment of prescribed costs, copies of the transcript of the 
hearing, which shall include all exhibits and documents presented during 
the hearing or submitted for the record.
    (3) Consultation with others. Prior to the establishment of any NRHM 
routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall provide notice to, 
and consult with, officials of affected political subdivisions, States 
and Indian tribes, and any other affected parties. Such actions shall 
include the following:
    (i) At least 60 days prior to establishing a routing designation, 
the State or Indian tribe shall provide notice, in writing, of the 
proposed routing designation to officials responsible for highway 
routing in all other affected States or Indian tribes. A copy of this 
notice may also be sent to all affected political subdivisions. This 
notice shall request approval, in writing, by those States or Indian 
tribes, of the proposed routing designations. If no response is received 
within 60 days from the day of receipt of the notification of the 
proposed routing designation, the routing designation shall be 
considered approved by the affected State or Indian tribe.
    (ii) The manner in which consultation under this paragraph is 
conducted is left to the discretion of the State or Indian tribe.
    (iii) The State or Indian tribe shall attempt to resolve any concern 
or disagreement expressed by any consulted official related to the 
proposed routing designation.
    (iv) The State or Indian tribe shall keep a record of the names and 
addresses of the officials notified pursuant to this section and of any 
consultation or meeting conducted with these officials or their 
representatives. Such record shall describe any concern or

[[Page 475]]

disagreement expressed by the officials and any action undertaken to 
resolve such disagreement or address any concern.
    (4) Through routing. In establishing any NRHM routing designation, 
the State or Indian tribe shall ensure through highway routing for the 
transportation of NRHM between adjacent areas. The term ``through 
highway routing'' as used in this paragraph means that the routing 
designation must ensure continuity of movement so as to not impede or 
unnecessarily delay the transportation of NRHM. The State or Indian 
tribe shall utilize the procedures established in paragraphs (b)(2) and 
(b)(3) of this section in meeting these requirements. In addition, the 
State or Indian tribe shall make a finding, supported by a risk analysis 
conducted in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that the 
routing designation enhances public safety. If the risk analysis shows--
    (i) That the current routing presents at least 50 percent more risk 
to the public than the deviation under the proposed routing designation, 
then the proposed routing designation may go into effect.
    (ii) That the current routing presents a greater risk but less than 
50 percent more risk to the public than the deviation under the proposed 
routing restriction, then the proposed routing restriction made by a 
State or Indian tribe shall only go into effect if it does not force a 
deviation of more than 25 miles or result in an increase of more than 25 
percent of that part of a trip affected by the deviation, whichever is 
shorter, from the most direct route through a jurisdiction as compared 
to the intended deviation.
    (iii) That the current route has the same or less risk to the public 
than the deviation resulting from the proposed routing designation, then 
the routing designation shall not be allowed.
    (5) Agreement of other States; burden on commerce. Any NRHM routing 
designation which affects another State or Indian tribe shall be 
established, maintained, or enforced only if:
    (i) It does not unreasonably burden commerce, and
    (ii) It is agreed to by the affected State or Indian tribe within 60 
days of receipt of the notice sent pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of 
this section, or it is approved by the Administrator pursuant to Sec. 
397.75.
    (6) Timeliness. The establishment of a NRHM routing designation by 
any State or Indian tribe shall be completed within 18 months of the 
notice given in either paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, 
whichever occurs first.
    (7) Reasonable routes to terminals and other facilities. In 
establishing or providing for reasonable access to and from designated 
routes, the State or Indian tribe shall use the shortest practicable 
route considering the factors listed in paragraph (b)(9) of this 
section. In establishing any NRHM routing designation, the State or 
Indian tribe shall provide reasonable access for motor vehicles 
transporting NRHM to reach:
    (i) Terminals,
    (ii) Points of loading, unloading, pickup and delivery, and
    (iii) Facilities for food, fuel, repairs, rest, and safe havens.
    (8) Responsibility for local compliance. The States shall be 
responsible for ensuring that all of their political subdivisions comply 
with the provisions of this subpart. The States shall be responsible for 
resolving all disputes between such political subdivisions within their 
jurisdictions. If a State or any political subdivision thereof, or an 
Indian tribe chooses to establish, maintain, or enforce any NRHM routing 
designation, the Governor, or Indian tribe, shall designate a routing 
agency for the State or Indian tribe, respectively. The routing agency 
shall ensure that all NRHM routing designations within its jurisdiction 
comply with the Federal standards in this section. The State or Indian 
tribe shall comply with the public information and reporting 
requirements contained in Sec. 397.73.
    (9) Factors to consider. In establishing any NRHM routing 
designation, the State or Indian tribe shall consider the following 
factors:
    (i) Population density. The population potentially exposed to a NRHM 
release shall be estimated from the density of the residents, employees, 
motorists, and other persons in the area, using United States census 
tract maps or

[[Page 476]]

other reasonable means for determining the population within a potential 
impact zone along a designated highway route. The impact zone is the 
potential range of effects in the event of a release. Special 
populations such as schools, hospitals, prisons, and senior citizen 
homes shall, among other things, be considered when determining the 
potential risk to the populations along a highway routing. Consideration 
shall be given to the amount of time during which an area will 
experience a heavy population density.
    (ii) Type of highway. The characteristics of each alternative NRHM 
highway routing designation shall be compared. Vehicle weight and size 
limits, underpass and bridge clearances, roadway geometrics, number of 
lanes, degree of access control, and median and shoulder structures are 
examples of characteristics which a State or Indian tribe shall 
consider.
    (iii) Types and quantities of NRHM. An examination shall be made of 
the type and quantity of NRHM normally transported along highway routes 
which are included in a proposed NRHM routing designation, and 
consideration shall be given to the relative impact zone and risks of 
each type and quantity.
    (iv) Emergency response capabilities. In consultation with the 
proper fire, law enforcement, and highway safety agencies, consideration 
shall be given to the emergency response capabilities which may be 
needed as a result of a NRHM routing designation. The analysis of the 
emergency response capabilities shall be based upon the proximity of the 
emergency response facilities and their capabilities to contain and 
suppress NRHM releases within the impact zones.
    (v) Results of consultation with affected persons. Consideration 
shall be given to the comments and concerns of all affected persons and 
entities provided during public hearings and consultations conducted in 
accordance with this section.
    (vi) Exposure and other risk factors. States and Indian tribes shall 
define the exposure and risk factors associated with any NRHM routing 
designations. The distance to sensitive areas shall be considered. 
Sensitive areas include, but are not limited to, homes and commercial 
buildings; special populations in hospitals, schools, handicapped 
facilities, prisons and stadiums; water sources such as streams and 
lakes; and natural areas such as parks, wetlands, and wildlife reserves.
    (vii) Terrain considerations. Topography along and adjacent to the 
proposed NRHM routing designation that may affect the potential severity 
of an accident, the dispersion of the NRHM upon release and the control 
and clean up of NRHM if released shall be considered.
    (viii) Continuity of routes. Adjacent jurisdictions shall be 
consulted to ensure routing continuity for NRHM across common borders. 
Deviations from the most direct route shall be minimized.
    (ix) Alternative routes. Consideration shall be given to the 
alternative routes to, or resulting from, any NRHM route designation. 
Alternative routes shall be examined, reviewed, or evaluated to the 
extent necessary to demonstrate that the most probable alternative 
routing resulting from a routing designation is safer than the current 
routing.
    (x) Effects on commerce. Any NRHM routing designation made in 
accordance with this subpart shall not create an unreasonable burden 
upon interstate or intrastate commerce.
    (xi) Delays in transportation. No NRHM routing designations may 
create unnecessary delays in the transportation of NRHM.
    (xii) Climatic conditions. Weather conditions unique to a highway 
route such as snow, wind, ice, fog, or other climatic conditions that 
could affect the safety of a route, the dispersion of the NRHM upon 
release, or increase the difficulty of controlling it and cleaning it up 
shall be given appropriate consideration.
    (xiii) Congestion and accident history. Traffic conditions unique to 
a highway routing such as: traffic congestion; accident experience with 
motor vehicles, traffic considerations that could affect the potential 
for an accident, exposure of the public to any release, ability to 
perform emergency response operations, or the temporary closing of a 
highway for cleaning up any release

[[Page 477]]

shall be given appropriate consideration.

          Subpart D_Routing of Class 7 (Radioactive) Materials


<R05>
Sec. 397.101  Requirements for motor carriers and drivers.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section or in 
circumstances when there is only one practicable highway route 
available, considering operating necessity and safety, a carrier or any 
person operating a motor vehicle that contains a Class 7 (radioactive) 
material, as defined in 49 CFR 172.403, for which placarding is required 
under 49 CFR part 172 shall:
    (1) Ensure that the motor vehicle is operated on routes that 
minimize radiological risk;

[[Page 479]]

    (2) Consider available information on accident rates, transit time, 
population density and activities, and the time of day and the day of 
week during which transportation will occur to determine the level of 
radiological risk; and
    (3) Tell the driver which route to take and that the motor vehicle 
contains Class 7 (radioactive) materials.
    (b) Except as otherwise permitted in this paragraph and in paragraph 
(f) of this section, a carrier or any person operating a motor vehicle 
containing a highway route controlled quantity of Class 7 (radioactive) 
materials, as defined in 49 CFR 173.403(l), shall operate the motor 
vehicle only over preferred routes.
    (1) For purposes of this subpart, a preferred route is an Interstate 
System highway for which an alternative route is not designated by a 
State routing agency; a State-designated route selected by a State 
routing agency pursuant to Sec. 397.103; or both of the above.
    (2) The motor carrier or the person operating a motor vehicle 
containing a highway route controlled quantity of Class 7 (radioactive) 
materials, as defined in 49 CFR 173.403(l) and (y), shall select routes 
to reduce time in transit over the preferred route segment of the trip. 
An Interstate System bypass or Interstate System beltway around a city, 
when available, shall be used in place of a preferred route through a 
city, unless a State routing agency has designated an alternative route.
    (c) A motor vehicle may be operated over a route, other than a 
preferred route, only under the following conditions:
    (1) The deviation from the preferred route is necessary to pick up 
or deliver a highway route controlled quantity of Class 7 (radioactive) 
materials, to make necessary rest, fuel or motor vehicle repair stops, 
or because emergency conditions make continued use of the preferred 
route unsafe or impossible;
    (2) For pickup and delivery not over preferred routes, the route 
selected must be the shortest-distance route from the pickup location to 
the nearest preferred route entry location, and the shortest-distance 
route to the delivery location from the nearest preferred route exit 
location. Deviation from the shortest-distance pickup or delivery route 
is authorized if such deviation:
    (i) Is based upon the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section to 
minimize the radiological risk; and
    (ii) Does not exceed the shortest-distance pickup or delivery route 
by more than 25 miles and does not exceed 5 times the length of the 
shortest-distance pickup or delivery route.
    (iii) Deviations from preferred routes, or pickup or delivery routes 
other than preferred routes, which are necessary for rest, fuel, or 
motor vehicle repair stops or because of emergency conditions, shall be 
made in accordance with the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section to 
minimize radiological risk, unless due to emergency conditions, time 
does not permit use of those criteria.
    (d) A carrier (or a designated agent) who operates a motor vehicle 
which contains a package of highway route controlled quantity of Class 7 
(radioactive) materials, as defined in 49 CFR 173.403(l), shall prepared 
a written route plan and supply a copy before departure to the motor 
vehicle driver and a copy to the shipper (before departure for exclusive 
use shipments, as defined in 49 CFR 173.403(i), or within fifteen 
working days following departure for all other shipments). Any variation 
between the route plan and routes actually used, and the reason for it, 
shall be reported in an amendment to the route plan delivered to the 
shipper as soon as practicable but within 30 days following the 
deviation. The route plan shall contain:
    (1) A statement of the origin and destination points, a route 
selected in compliance with this section, all planned stops, and 
estimated departure and arrival times; and
    (2) Telephone numbers which will access emergency assistance in each 
State to be entered.
    (e) No person may transport a package of highway route controlled 
quantity of Class 7 (radioactive) materials on a public highway unless:
    (1) The driver has received within the two preceding years, written 
training on:
    (i) Requirements in 49 CFR parts 172, 173, and 177 pertaining to the 
Class 7 (radioactive) materials transported;

[[Page 480]]

    (ii) The properties and hazards of the Class 7 (radioactive) 
materials being transported; and
    (iii) Procedures to be followed in case of an accident or other 
emergency.
    (2) The driver has in his or her immediate possession a certificate 
of training as evidence of training required by this section, and a copy 
is placed in his or her qualification file (see Sec. 391.51 of this 
subchapter), showing:
    (i) The driver's name and operator's license number;
    (ii) The dates training was provided;
    (iii) The name and address of the person providing the training;
    (iv) That the driver has been trained in the hazards and 
characteristics of highway route controlled quantity of Class 7 
(radioactive) materials; and
    (v) A statement by the person providing the training that 
information on the certificate is accurate.
    (3) The driver has in his or her immediate possession the route plan 
required by paragraph (d) of this section and operates the motor vehicle 
in accordance with the route plan.
    (f) A person may transport irradiated reactor fuel only in 
compliance with a plan if required under 49 CFR 173.22(c) that will 
ensure the physical security of the material. Variation for security 
purposes from the requirements of this section is permitted so far as 
necessary to meet the requirements imposed under such a plan, or 
otherwise imposed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 10 CFR 
part 73.
    (g) Except for packages shipped in compliance with the physical 
security requirements of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 10 
CFR part 73, each carrier who accepts for transportation a highway route 
controlled quantity of Class 7 (radioactive) material (see 49 CFR 
173.401(l)), must, within 90 days following the acceptance of the 
package, file the following information concerning the transportation of 
each such package with the Office of Enforcement and Compliance (MC-

that he or she has complied with this requirement. The

[[Page 483]]

Administrator may notify other persons participating in the proceeding 
of the comments and provide an opportunity for those other persons to 
respond.


<R05>
Sec. 397.209  Preemption processing.

    (a) The Administrator may initiate an investigation of any statement 
in an application and utilize in his or her evaluation any relevant 
facts obtained by that investigation. The Administrator may solicit and 
accept submissions from third persons relevant to an application and 
will provide the applicant an opportunity to respond to all third person 
submissions. In evaluating an application, the Administrator may 
consider any other source of information. The Administrator may convene 
a hearing or conference, if a hearing or conference will advance the 
evaluation of the application.
    (b) The Administrator may dismiss the application without prejudice 
if:
    (1) he or she determines that there is insufficient information upon 
which to base a determination; or
    (2) he or she requests additional information from the applicant and 
it is not submitted.


<R05>
Sec. 397.211  Preemption determination.

    (a) Upon consideration of the application and other relevant 
information received, the Administrator issues a determination.
    (b) Notwithstanding that an application for a determination has not 
been filed under Sec. 397.205, the Administrator, on his or her own 
initiative, may issue a determination as to whether a particular highway 
routing designation of a State, political subdivision thereof, or Indian 
tribe is preempted under the Act or the regulations issued under the 
Act.
    (c) The determination includes a written statement setting forth the 
relevant facts and the legal basis for the determination, and provides 
that any person aggrieved thereby may file a petition for 
reconsideration within 20 days in accordance with Sec. 397.223.
    (d) Unless the determination is issued pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section, the Administrator serves a copy of the determination upon 
the applicant. In all preemption determinations, the Administrator 
serves a copy of the determination upon any other person who 
participated in the proceeding or who is readily identifiable by the 
Administrator as affected by the determination. A copy of each 
determination is placed on file in the public docket. The Administrator 
may publish the determination or notice of the determination in the 
Federal Register.
    (e) If no petition for reconsideration is filed within 20 days in 
accordance with Sec. 397.223, a determination issued under this section 
constitutes the final agency decision as to whether a particular highway 
routing designation of a State, political subdivision thereof, or Indian 
tribe is preempted under the Act or regulations issued thereunder. The 
fact that a determination has not been issued under this section with 
respect to a particular highway routing designation of a State, 
political subdivision thereof, or Indian tribe carries no implication as 
to whether the requirement is preempted under the Act or regulations 
issued thereunder.

    (1) he or she determines that there is insufficient information upon 
which to base a determination;
    (2) Upon his or her request, additional information is not submitted 
by the applicant; or
    (3) The applicant fails to provide the notice required by this 
subpart.
    (c) Except as provided in this subpart, the Administrator will only 
consider an application for a waiver of preemption determination if:
    (1) The applicant expressly acknowledges in its application that the 
highway routing designation of the State, political subdivision thereof, 
or Indian tribe for which the determination is sought is preempted by 
the Act or the regulations thereunder; or
    (2) The highway routing designation of the State, political 
subdivision thereof, or Indian tribe has been determined by a court of 
competent jurisdiction or in a determination issued pursuant to Sec. 
397.211 to be preempted by the Act or the regulations issued thereunder.
    (d) When the Administrator has received all substantive information 
necessary to process an application for a waiver of preemption 
determination, notice of that fact will be served upon the applicant. 
Additional notice to all other persons who received notice of the 
proceeding may be served by publishing a notice in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 397.219  Waiver determination and order.

    (a) Upon consideration of the application and other relevant 
information received or obtained during the proceeding, the 
Administrator issues an order setting forth his or her determination.
    (b) The Administrator may issue a waiver of preemption order only if 
he or she finds that the requirement of the State, political subdivision 
thereof, or Indian tribe affords the public a level of safety at least 
equal to that afforded by the requirements of the Act and the 
regulations issued under the Act and does not unreasonably burden 
commerce. In determining whether the requirement of the State, political 
subdivision thereof, or Indian tribe unreasonably burdens commerce, the 
Administrator may consider the following factors:
    (1) The extent to which increased costs and impairment of efficiency 
result from the highway routing designation of the State, political 
subdivision thereof, or Indian tribe;
    (2) Whether the highway routing designation of the State, political 
subdivision thereof, or Indian tribe has a rational basis;
    (3) Whether the highway routing designation of the State, political 
subdivision thereof, or Indian tribe achieves its stated purpose; and
    (4) Whether there is need for uniformity with regard to the subject 
concerned and if so, whether the highway routing designation of the 
State, political subdivision thereof, or Indian tribe competes or 
conflicts with those of other States, political subdivisions thereof, or 
Indian tribes.
    (c) The order includes a written statement setting forth the 
relevant facts and the legal basis for the determination, and provides 
that any person aggrieved by the order may file a petition for 
reconsideration in accordance with Sec. 397.223.
    (d) The Administrator serves a copy of the order upon the applicant, 
any other person who participated in the proceeding and upon any other 
person readily identifiable by the Administrator as one who may be 
affected by the order. A copy of each order is placed on file in the 
public docket. The Administrator may publish the order or notice of the 
order in the Federal Register.
    (e) If no petition for reconsideration is filed within 20 days in 
accordance with Sec. 397.223, an order issued under this section 
constitutes the final agency decision regarding whether a particular 
requirement of a State, political subdivision thereof, or Indian tribe 
is preempted under the Act or any regulations issued thereunder, or 
whether preemption is waived.

[[Page 486]]


<R05>
Sec. 397.221  Timeliness.

    If the Administrator fails to take action on the application within 
90 days of serving the notice required by Sec. 397.217(d), the 
applicant may treat the application as having been denied in all 
respects.


<R05>
Sec. 397.223  Petition for reconsideration.

    (a) Any person aggrieved by an order issued under Sec. 397.211 or 
Sec. 397.219 may file a petition for reconsideration with the 
Administrator. The petition must be filed within 20 days of service of 
the determination or order issued under the above sections.
    (b) The petition must contain a concise statement of the basis for 
seeking reconsideration, including any specific factual or legal errors, 
or material information not previously available.
    (c) The petitioner shall mail a copy of the petition to each person 
who participated, either as an applicant or routing, in the waiver of 
preemption proceeding, accompanied by a statement that the person may 
submit comments concerning the petition to the Administrator within 20 
days. The petition filed with the Administrator must contain a 
certification that the petitioner has complied with this paragraph and 
include the names and addresses of all persons to whom a copy of the 
petition was sent.
    (d) The Administrator's decision under this section constitutes the 
final agency decision. If no petition for reconsideration is filed under 
this section, then the determination issued under Sec. 397.211 or Sec. 
397.219 becomes the final agency decision at the end of the 20 day 
period.


<R05>
Sec. 397.225  Judicial review.

    A party to a proceeding under Sec. 397.205(a), Sec. 397.213(a), or 
Sec. 397.223(a) may seek review by the appropriate district court of 
the United States of the decision of the Administrator under such 
proceeding only by filing a petition with such court within 60 days 
after the final agency decision.

<R05>
Sec. 399.207  Truck and truck-tractor access requirements.

    (a) General rule. Any person entering or exiting the cab or 
accessing the rear portion of a high profile COE truck or truck-tractor 
shall be afforded sufficient steps and handholds, and/or deck plates to 
allow the user to have at least 3 limbs in contact with the truck or 
truck-tractor at any time. This rule applies to intermediate positions 
as well as transition between intermediate positions. To allow for 
changes in climbing sequence, the step design shall include, as a 
minimum, one intermediate step of sufficient size to accommodate two 
feet. Exception. If air and electrical connections necessary to couple 
or uncouple a truck-tractor from a trailer are accessible from the 
ground, no step, handholds or deck plates are required to permit access 
to the rear of the cab.
    (b) Performance requirements. All high profile COE trucks or truck-
tractors shall be equipped on each side of the vehicle where a seat is 
located, with a sufficient number of steps and handholds to conform with 
the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and shall meet the 
performance requirements:
    (1) Vertical height. All measurements of vertical height shall be 
made from ground level with the vehicle at unladen weight.
    (2) Distance between steps. The distance between steps, up to and 
including the door sill step, shall provide any person a stable resting 
position which can be sustained without body motion and by exerting no 
more arm force than 35 percent of the person's body weight per grasp 
during all stages of entry and exit. This criterion applies to 
intermediate positions as well as transition between intermediate 
positions above ground level.
    (i) When the ground provides the person foot support during entry or 
is the final step in the sequence during exit, and the step is 508 
millimeters (20 inches) or more above ground, the stable resting 
position shall be achievable by the person using both hands to grasp the 
handhold(s) and requiring no more arm force than 35 percent of body 
weight per grasp.
    (ii) The vertical height of the first step shall be no more than 609 
millimeters (24 inches) from ground level.
    (3) Construction. Each step or deck plate shall be of a slip 
resistant design which minimizes the accumulation of foreign material. 
Wherever practicable, a self-cleaning material should be used.
    (4) Foot accommodation. Step depth or clearance and step width 
necessary to accommodate a climbing person are defined by using a 
minimum 127 millimeter (5 inch) diameter disc as shown in Illustration 
III.
    (i) Single foot accommodation. The disc shall fit on a tread rung, 
or in a step recess, with no exterior overhang.
    (ii) Two-foot accommodation. Two discs shall fit on a tread rung, or 
in a step recess, with no exterior overhang.

[[Page 496]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP91.038

    Note: The 127 millimeter (5 inch) disc is only intended to test for 
a minimum depth and width requirement. The step need not retain the disc 
at rest.

    (5) Step strength. Each step must withstand a vertical static load 
of at least 204 kilograms (450 pounds) uniformly distributed over any 
127 millimeter (5 inch) increment of step width.
    (6) Handhold location. A handhold must be located within the reach 
of any person entering or exiting the vehicle.
    (7) Exterior mounting specifications for handholds. Each handhold, 
affixed to the exterior of the vehicle, shall have at least 38 
millimeters (1.5 inches) clearance between the handhold and the surface 
to which it is mounted for the distance between its mounting points.
    (8) Handhold size and shape. Each handhold shall be free of sharp 
edges (minimum 1 millimeter [0.04 inch] radius) and have an effective 
peripheral grip length that permits full grasp by any person.
    (9) Handhold strength. Each handhold shall withstand a horizontal 
static load of at least 114 kilograms (250 pounds) uniformly distributed 
over the area of a hand print and applied away from the mounting 
surface.
    (10) Deck plates. Deck plates shall be on the rear of a truck-
tractor as necessary to couple or uncouple air and/or electrical 
connections.
    (11) Deck plate strength. Each deck plate shall be capable of 
withstanding the vertical static load of at least 205 kilograms (450 
pounds) uniformly distributed over a 127 millimeter (5 inch) diameter 
disc.


<R05>
Sec. 399.209  Test procedures.

    (a) The force exerted on a handhold will be measured using a 
handheld spring scale or force transducer which can be attached to the 
vehicle and is free to rotate into alignment with a person's hand 
position.
    (b) Hand grasp will be evaluated by observing the handgrip of any 
individual who conforms with the definition of ``person'' appearing in 
Sec. 399.205 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 399.211  Maintenance.

    All steps, handholds, and/or deck plates required by this subpart 
shall be adequately maintained to serve their intended function.

  Comparison of Appendix G, and the new North American Uniform Driver-
Vehicle Inspection Procedure (North American Commercial Vehicle Critical 
          Safety Inspection Items and Out-Of-Service Criteria)

    The vehicle portion of the FMCSA's North American Uniform Driver-
Vehicle Inspection Procedure (NAUD-VIP) requirements, CVSA's North 
American Commercial Vehicle Critical Safety Inspection Items and Out-Of-
Service Criteria and Appendix G of subchapter B are similar documents 
and follow the same inspection procedures. The same items are required 
to be inspected by each document. FMCSA's and CVSA's out-of-service 
criteria are intended to be used in random roadside inspections to 
identify critical vehicle inspection items and provide criteria for 
placing a vehicle(s) out-of-service. Avehicle(s) is placed out-of-
service only when by reason of its mechanical condition or loading it is 
determined to be so imminently hazardous as to likely cause an accident 
or breakdown, or when such condition(s) would likely contribute to loss 
of control of the vehicle(s) by the driver. A certain amount of 
flexibility is given to the inspecting official whether to place the 
vehicle out-of-service at the inspection site or if it would be less 
hazardous to allow the vehicle to proceed to a repair facility for 
repair. The distance to the repair facility must not exceed 25 miles. 
The roadside type of inspection, however, does not necessarily mean that 
a vehicle has to be defect-free in order to continue in service.
    In contrast, the Appendix G inspection procedure requires that all 
items required to be inspected are in proper adjustment, are not 
defective and function properly prior to the vehicle being placed in 
service.

    Differences Between the Out-of-Service Criteria & FMCSA's Annual 
                               Inspection

    1. Brake System.
    The Appendix G criteria rejects vehicles with any defective brakes, 
any air leaks, etc. The out-of-service criteria allows 20% defective 
brakes on non-steering axles and a certain latitude on air leaks before 
placing a vehicle out-of-service.
    2. Coupling Devices.
    Appendix G rejects vehicles with any fifth wheel mounting fastener 
missing or ineffective. The out-of-service criteria allows up to 20% 
missing or ineffective fasteners on frame mountings and pivot bracket 
mountings and 25% on slider latching fasteners. The out-of-service
