              Archivist of the United States or the Archivist's designee. 
              Any person using NARA's official seals and logos in a manner 
              inconsistent with the provisions of 36 CFR part 1200 is

                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2006), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

<R04>
                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 0.101  Purpose.

    (a) The Department of the Treasury Employee Rules of Conduct (Rules) 
are separate from and additional to the Standards of Ethical Conduct for 
Employees of the Executive Branch (Executive Branch-wide Standards) (5 
CFR part 2635) and the Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct for 
Employees of the Department of the Treasury (Treasury Supplemental 
Standards) (to be codified at 5 CFR part 3101). The Rules prescribe 
employee rules of conduct and procedure and provide for disciplinary 
action for the violation of the Rules, the Treasury Supplemental 
Standards, the Executive Branch-wide Standards, and any other rule, 
regulation or law governing Department employees.
    (b) The Rules are not all-inclusive and may be modified by 
interpretive guidelines and procedures issued by the Department's 
bureaus. The absence of a specific published rule of conduct covering an 
action does not constitute a condonation of that action or indicate that 
the action would not result in corrective or disciplinary action.


<R05>
Sec. 0.102  Policy.

    (a) All employees and officials of the Department are required to 
follow the rules of conduct and procedure contained in the Rules, the 
Treasury Supplemental Standards, the Executive Branch-wide Standards of 
Ethical Conduct, the Employee Responsibilities and Conduct (5 CFR part 
735), and any bureau issued rules.
    (b) Employees found in violation of the Rules, the Treasury 
Supplemental Standards, the Executive Branch-wide Standards or any 
applicable bureau rule may be instructed to take remedial or corrective 
action to eliminate the conflict. Remedial action may include, but is 
not limited to:
    (1) Reassignment of work duties;
    (2) Disqualification from a particular assignment;
    (3) Divestment of a conflicting interest; or
    (4) Other appropriate action.
    (c) Employees found in violation of the Rules, the Treasury 
Supplemental Standards, the Executive Branch-wide Standards or any 
applicable bureau rule may be disciplined in proportion to the gravity 
of the offense committed, including removal. Disciplinary action will be 
taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations

[[Page 6]]

and after consideration of the employee's explanation and any mitigating 
factors. Further, disciplinary action may include any additional penalty 
prescribed by law.


<R05>
Sec. 0.103  Definitions.

    The following definitions are used throughout this part:
    (a) Adviser means a person who provides advice to the Department as 
a representative of an outside group and is not an employee or special 
Government employee as those terms are defined in Sec. 0.103.
    (b) Bureau means:
    (1) Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms;
    (2) Bureau of Engraving and Printing;
    (3) Bureau of the Public Debt;
    (4) Departmental Offices;
    (5) Federal Law Enforcement Training Center;

Sec. 1.1  General.

    (a) Purpose and scope. (1) This subpart contains the regulations of

Any office which is now in existence or may hereafter be established, 
which is not specifically listed or known to be a component of any of 
those listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (xiii) of this section, 
shall be deemed a part of the Departmental Offices for the purpose of 
making requests for records under this subpart.
    (b) Definitions. As used in this subpart, the following terms shall 
have the following meanings:
    (1) Agency has the meaning given in 5 U.S.C. 551(1) and 5 U.S.C. 
552(f).
    (2) Appeal means a request for a review of an agency's determination 
with regard to a fee waiver, category of requester, expedited 
processing, or denial in whole or in part of a request for access to a 
record or records.
    (3) Bureau means an entity of the Department of the Treasury that is 
authorized to act independently in disclosure matters.
    (4) Business information means trade secrets or other commercial or 
financial information.
    (5) Business submitter means any entity which provides business 
information to the Department of the Treasury or its bureaus and which 
has a proprietary interest in the information.
    (6) Computer software means tools by which records are created, 
stored, and retrieved. Normally, computer software, including source 
code, object code, and listings of source and object codes, regardless 
of medium, are not agency records. However, when data are embedded 
within the software and cannot be extracted without the software, the 
software may have to be treated as an agency record. Proprietary (or 
copyrighted) software is not an agency record.
    (7) Confidential commercial information means records provided to 
the government by a submitter that arguably contain material exempt from 
release under Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 
552(b)(4), because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause 
substantial competitive harm.
    (8) Duplication refers to the process of making a copy of a record 
in order to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of 
paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine readable 
documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others.
    (9) Electronic records means those records and information which are 
created, stored, and retrievable by electronic means. This ordinarily 
does not include computer software, which is a tool by which to create, 
store, or retrieve electronic records.
    (10) Request means any request for records made pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552(a)(3).
    (11) Requester means any person who makes a request for access to 
records.

[[Page 13]]

    (12) Responsible official means a disclosure officer or the head of 
the organizational unit having immediate custody of the records 
requested, or an official designated by the head of the organizational 
unit.
    (13) Review, for fee purposes, refers to the process of examining 
records located in response to a commercial use request to determine 
whether any portion of any record located is permitted to be withheld. 
It also includes processing any records for disclosure; e.g., doing all 
that is necessary to excise them and otherwise prepare them for release.
    (14) Search includes all time spent looking for material that is 
responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line 
identification of material within records. Searches may be done manually 
or by automated means.

<R05>
Sec. 1.2  Information made available.

    (a) General. The FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552) provides for access to 
information and records developed or maintained by Federal agencies. The 
provisions of section 552 are intended to assure the right of the public 
to information. Generally, this section divides agency information into 
three major categories and provides methods by which each category of 
information is to be made available to the public. The three major 
categories of information are as follows:
    (1) Information required to be published in the Federal Register 
(see Sec. 1.3);
    (2) Information required to be made available for public inspection 
and copying or, in the alternative, to be published and offered for sale 
(see Sec. 1.4); and
    (3) Information required to be made available to any member of the 
public upon specific request (see Sec. 1.5).
    (b) Subject only to the exemptions and exclusions set forth in 5 
U.S.C. 552(b) and (c), any person shall be afforded access to 
information or records in the possession of any bureau of the Department 
of the Treasury, subject to the regulations in this subpart and any 
regulations of a bureau implementing or supplementing them.
    (c) Exemptions. (1) The disclosure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) 
do not apply to certain matters which are exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552(b); 
nor do the disclosure requirements apply to certain matters which are 
excluded under 5 U.S.C. 552(c).
    (2) Even though an exemption described in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) may be 
applicable to the information or records requested, a Treasury bureau 
may, if not precluded by law, elect under the circumstances of that 
request not to apply the exemption. The fact that the exemption is not 
applied by a bureau in response to a particular request shall have no 
precedential significance in processing other requests, but is merely an 
indication that, in the processing of the particular request, the bureau 
finds no necessity for applying the exemption.


<R05>
Sec. 1.3  Publication in the Federal Register.

    (a) Requirement. Subject to the application of the exemptions and 
exclusions in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) and (c) and subject to the limitations 
provided in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1), each Treasury bureau shall, in 
conformance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1), separately state, publish and 
maintain current in the Federal Register for the guidance of the public 
the following information with respect to that bureau:
    (1) Descriptions of its central and field organization and the 
established places at which, the persons from whom, and the methods 
whereby, the public may obtain information, make submittals or requests, 
or obtain decisions;
    (2) Statements of the general course and method by which its 
functions are channeled and determined, including the nature and 
requirements of all formal and informal procedures available;
    (3) Rules of procedure, descriptions of forms available or the 
places at which forms may be obtained, and instructions as to the scope 
and contents of all papers, reports, or examinations;
    (4) Substantive rules of general applicability adopted as authorized 
by law, and statements of general policy or interpretations of general 
applicability formulated and adopted by the bureau; and

[[Page 14]]

    (5) Each amendment, revision, or repeal of matters referred to in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.
    (b) The United States Government Manual. The functions of each 
bureau are summarized in the description of the Department and its 
bureaus in the United States Government Manual, which is issued annually 
by the Office of the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 1.4  Public inspection and copying.

    (a) In general. Subject to the application of the exemptions and 
exclusions described in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) and (c), each Treasury bureau 
shall, in conformance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), make available for public 
inspection and copying, or, in the alternative, promptly publish and 
offer for sale the following information with respect to the bureau:
    (1) Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, 
and orders, made in the adjudication of cases;
    (2) Those statements of policy and interpretations which have been 
adopted by the bureau but are not published in the Federal Register;
    (3) Its administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that 
affect a member of the public;
    (4) Copies of all records, regardless of form or format, which have 
been released to any person under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3), and which the 
bureau determines have become or are likely to become the subject of 
subsequent requests for substantially the same records because they are 
clearly of interest to the public at large. The determination that 
records have become or may become the subject of subsequent requests 
shall be made by the Responsible Official (as defined at Sec. 
1.1(b)(12)).
    (5) A general index of the records referred to in paragraph (a)(4) 
of this section.
    (b) Information made available by computer telecommunications. For 
records required to be made available for public inspection and copying 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) (paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this 
section) which are created on or after November 1, 1996, as soon as 
practicable but no later than one year after such records are created, 
each bureau shall make such records available on the Internet.
    (c) Deletion of identifying details. To prevent a clearly 
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, or pursuant to an exemption in 
5 U.S.C. 552(b), a Treasury bureau may delete information contained in 
any matter described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section 
before making such matters available for inspection or publishing it. 
The justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in writing, 
and the extent of such deletion shall be indicated on the portion of the 
record which is made available or published, unless including that 
indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption in 5 U.S.C. 
552(b) under which the deletion is made. If technically feasible, the 
extent of the deletion shall be indicated at the place in the record 
where the deletion was made.
    (d) Public reading rooms. Each bureau of the Department of the 
Treasury shall make available for public inspection and copying, in a 
reading room or otherwise, the material described in paragraphs (a)(1) 
through (5) of this section. Fees for duplication shall be charged in 
accordance with Sec. 1.7. See the appendices to this subpart for the 
location of established bureau reading rooms.
    (e) Indexes. (1) Each bureau of the Department of the Treasury shall 
maintain and make available for public inspection and copying current 
indexes identifying any material described in paragraphs (a)(1) through 
(3) of this section. In addition, each bureau shall promptly publish, 
quarterly or more frequently, and distribute (by sale or otherwise) 
copies of each index or supplement unless the head of each bureau (or a 
delegate) determines by order published in the Federal Register that the 
publication would be unnecessary and impractical, in which case the 
bureau shall nonetheless provide copies of the index on request at a 
cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication.
    (2) Each bureau shall make the index referred to in paragraph (a)(5) 
of this section available on the Internet by December 31, 1999.


<R05>
Sec. 1.5  Specific requests for other records.

    (a) In general. (1) Except for records made available under 5 U.S.C. 
552(a)(1)

[[Page 15]]

and (a)(2), but subject to the application of the exemptions and 
exclusions described in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) and (c), each bureau of the 
Department of the Treasury shall promptly make the requested records 
available to any person in conformance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3). The 
request must conform in every respect with the rules and procedures of 
this subpart and the applicable bureau's appendix to this subpart. Any 
request or appeal from the initial denial of a request that does not 
comply with the requirements in this subpart will not be considered 
subject to the time constraints of paragraphs (h), (i), and (j) of this 
section, unless and until the request is amended to comply. Bureaus 
shall promptly advise the requester in what respect the request or 
appeal is deficient so that it may be amended and resubmitted for 
consideration in accordance with this subpart. If a requester does not 
respond within 30 days to a communication from a bureau to amend the 
request in order for it to be in conformance with this subpart, the 
request file will be considered closed. When the request conforms with 
the requirements of this subpart, bureaus shall make every reasonable 
effort to comply with the request within the time constraints. If the 
description of the record requested is of a type that is not maintained 
by the bureau, the requester shall be so advised and the request shall 
be returned to the requester.
    (2) This subpart applies only to records in the possession or 
control of the bureau at the time of the request. Records considered to 
be responsive to the request are those in existence on or before the 
date of receipt of the request by the appropriate bureau official. 
Requests for the continuing production of records created after the date 
of the appropriate bureau official's receipt of the request shall not be 
honored. Bureaus shall provide the responsive record or records in the 
form or format requested if the record or records are readily 
reproducible by the bureau in that form or format. Bureaus shall make 
reasonable efforts to maintain their records in forms or formats that 
are reproducible for the purpose of disclosure. For purposes of this 
section, readily reproducible means, with respect to electronic format, 
a record or records that can be downloaded or transferred intact to a 
floppy disk, compact disk (CD), tape, or other electronic medium using 
equipment currently in use by the office or offices processing the 
request. Even though some records may initially be readily reproducible, 
the need to segregate exempt from nonexempt records may cause the 
releasable material to not be readily reproducible.
    (3) Requests for information classified pursuant to Executive Order 
12958, ``Classified National Security Information,'' require the 
responsible bureau to review the information to determine whether it 
continues to warrant classification. Information which no longer 
warrants classification under the Executive Order's criteria shall be 
declassified and made available to the requester, unless the information 
is otherwise exempt from disclosure.
    (4) When a bureau receives five or more requests for substantially 
the same records, it shall place those requests in front of an existing 
request backlog that the responsible official may have. Upon completion 
of processing, the released records shall be made available in the 
bureau's public reading room, and if created on or after November 1, 
1996, shall be made available in the electronic reading room of the 
bureau's web site.
    (b) Form of request. In order to be subject to the provisions of 
this section, the following must be satisfied.
    (1) The request for records shall be made in writing, signed by the 
person making the request, and state that it is made pursuant to the 
Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, or this subpart.
    (2) The request shall indicate whether the requester is a commercial 
user, an educational institution, non-commercial scientific institution, 
representative of the news media, or ``other'' requester, subject to the 
fee provisions described in Sec. 1.7. In order for the Department to 
determine the proper category for fee purposes as defined in this 
section, a request for records shall also state how the records released 
will be used. This information shall not be used to determine the 
releasibility of any record or records. A

[[Page 16]]

determination of the proper category of requester shall be based upon a 
review of the requester's submission and the bureau's own records. Where 
a bureau has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will 
put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request 
itself, bureaus should seek additional clarification before assigning 
the request to a specific category. The categories of requesters are 
defined as follows:
    (i) Commercial. A commercial use request refers to a request from or 
on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that 
furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or 
the person on whose behalf the request is made, which can include 
furthering those interests through litigation. The bureaus may determine 
from the use specified in the request that the requester is a commercial 
user.
    (ii) Educational institution. This refers to a preschool, a public 
or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate 
higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an 
institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational 
education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research. 
This category does not include requesters wanting records for use in 
meeting individual academic research or study requirements.
    (iii) Non-commercial scientific institution. This refers to an 
institution that is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as that term 
is defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and which is operated 
solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of 
which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.
    (iv) Representative of the news media. This refers to any person 
actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to 
publish or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information 
that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the 
public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio 
stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of 
periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as 
disseminators of ``news'') who make their products available for 
purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not 
intended to be all-inclusive. In the case of ``freelance'' journalists, 
they may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can 
demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that 
organization, even though not actually employed by it. A publication 
contract would be the clearest proof, but bureaus may also look to the 
past publication record of a requester in making this determination.
    (v) ``Other'' Requester. This refers to a requester who does not 
fall within any of the previously described categories.
    (3) The request must be properly addressed to the bureau that 
maintains the record. The functions of each bureau are summarized in The 
United States Government Manual which is issued annually and is 
available from the Superintendent of Documents. Both the envelope and 
the request itself should be clearly marked ``Freedom of Information Act 
Request.'' See the appendices to this subpart for the office or officer 
to which requests shall be addressed for each bureau. A requester in 
need of guidance in defining a request or determining the proper bureau 
to which a request should be sent may contact Disclosure Services at 
202/622-0930, or may write to Disclosure Services, Department of the 
Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20220. Requesters 
may access the ``FOIA Home Page'' at the Department of the Treasury 
World Wide Web site at: http://www.treas.gov.
    (4) The request must reasonably describe the records in accordance 
with paragraph (d) of this section.
    (5) The request must set forth the address where the person making 
the request wants to be notified about whether or not the request will 
be granted.
    (6) The request must state whether the requester wishes to inspect 
the records or desires to have a copy made and furnished without first 
inspecting them.
    (7) The request must state the firm agreement of the requester to 
pay the fees for search, duplication, and review

[[Page 17]]

as may ultimately be determined in accordance with Sec. 1.7. The 
agreement may state the upper limit (but not less than $25) that the 
requester is willing to pay for processing the request. A request that 
fees be waived or reduced may accompany the agreement to pay fees and 
shall be considered to the extent that such request is made in 
accordance with Sec. 1.7(d) and provides supporting information to be 
measured against the fee waiver standard set forth in Sec. 1.7(d)(1). 
The requester shall be notified in writing of the decision to grant or 
deny the fee waiver. A requester shall be asked to provide an agreement 
to pay fees when the request for a fee waiver or reduction is denied and 
the initial request for records does not include such agreement. If a 
requester has an outstanding balance of search, review, or duplication 
fees due for FOIA request processing, the requirements of this paragraph 
are not met until the requester has remitted the outstanding balance 
due.
    (c) Requests for records not in control of bureau; referrals; 
consultations. (1) When a requested record is in the possession or under 
the control of a bureau of the Department other than the office to which 
the request is addressed, the request for the record shall be 
transferred to the appropriate bureau and the requester notified. This 
referral shall not be considered a denial of access within the meaning 
of these regulations. The bureau of the Department to which this 
referral is made shall treat this request as a new request addressed to 
it and the time limits for response set forth by paragraph (h)(1) of 
this section shall begin when the referral is received by the designated 
office or officer of the bureau.
    (2) When a requested record has been created by an agency or 
Treasury bureau other than the Treasury bureau possessing the record, 
the bureau having custody of the record shall refer the record to the 
originating agency or Treasury bureau for a direct response to the 
requester. The requester shall be informed of the referral unless 
otherwise instructed by the originating agency. This is not a denial of 
a FOIA request; thus no appeal rights accrue to the requester.
    (3) When a FOIA request is received for a record created by a 
Treasury bureau that includes information originated by another bureau 
of the Department of the Treasury or another agency, the record shall be 
referred to the originating agency or bureau for review and 
recommendation on disclosure. The agency or bureau shall respond to the 
referring office. The Treasury bureau shall not release any such records 
without prior consultation with the originating bureau or agency.
    (4) In certain instances and at the discretion of the Departmental 
Offices, requests having impact on two or more bureaus of the Department 
may be coordinated by the Departmental Offices.
    (d) Reasonable description of records. The request for records must 
describe the records in reasonably sufficient detail to enable employees 
who are familiar with the subject area of the request to locate the 
records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the Department. 
Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about 
each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, 
and subject matter of the record. If the Department determines that the 
request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the requester 
shall be given an opportunity to provide additional information. Such 
opportunity may, when necessary, involve a discussion with knowledgeable 
Department of the Treasury personnel. The reasonable description 
requirement shall not be used by officers or employees of the Department 
of the Treasury to improperly withhold records from the public.
    (e) Requests for expedited processing. (1) When a request for 
records includes a request for expedited processing, both the envelope 
and the request itself must be clearly marked, ``Expedited Processing 
Requested.''
    (2) Records will be processed as soon as practicable when a 
requester asks for expedited processing in writing and is granted such 
expedited treatment by the Department. The requester must demonstrate a 
compelling need for expedited processing of the requested records. A 
compelling need is defined as follows:

[[Page 18]]

    (i) Failure to obtain the requested records on an expedited basis 
could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or 
physical safety of an individual. The requester shall fully explain the 
circumstances warranting such an expected threat so that the Department 
may make a reasoned determination that a delay in obtaining the 
requested records could pose such a threat; or
    (ii) With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in 
disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning 
actual or alleged Federal Government activity. A person ``primarily 
engaged in disseminating information'' does not include individuals who 
are engaged only incidentally in the dissemination of information. The 
standard of ``urgency to inform'' requires that the records requested 
pertain to a matter of current exigency to the American public and that 
delaying a response to a request for records would compromise a 
significant recognized interest to and throughout the American general 
public. The requester must adequately explain the matter or activity and 
why the records sought are necessary to be provided on an expedited 
basis.
    (3) A demonstration of a compelling need by a person making a 
request for expedited processing shall be made by a statement certified 
by the requester to be true and correct to the best of his or her 
knowledge and belief. The statement must be in the form prescribed by 28 
U.S.C. 1746, ``I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is 
true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. Executed on 
[date].''
    (4) Upon receipt by the appropriate bureau official, a request for 
expedited processing shall be considered and a determination as to 
whether to grant or deny the request for expedited processing shall be 
made, and the requester notified, within 10 calendar days of the date of 
the request. However, in no event shall the bureau have fewer than five 
days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the 
date of receipt of the request for such processing. The determination to 
grant or deny a request for expedited processing may be made solely on 
the information contained in the initial letter requesting expedited 
treatment.
    (5) Appeals of initial determinations to deny expedited processing 
must be made within 10 calendar days of the date of the initial letter 
of determination denying expedited processing. Both the envelope and the 
appeal itself shall be clearly marked, ``Appeal for Expedited 
Processing.''
    (6) An appeal determination regarding expedited processing shall be 
made, and the requester notified, within 10 days (excluding Saturdays, 
Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date of receipt of the 
appeal.
    (f) Date of receipt of request. A request for records shall be 
considered to have been received on the date on which a complete request 
containing the information required by paragraph (b) of this section has 
been received. A determination that a request is deficient in any 
respect is not a denial of access, and such determinations are not 
subject to administrative appeal. Requests shall be stamped with the 
date of receipt by the office prescribed in the appropriate appendix. As 
soon as the date of receipt has been established, the requester shall be 
so informed and shall also be advised when to expect a response. The 
acknowledgment of receipt requirement shall not apply if a disclosure 
determination will be issued prior to the end of the 20-day time limit.
    (g) Search for record requested. Department of the Treasury 
employees shall search to identify and locate requested records, 
including records stored at Federal Records Centers. Searches for 
records maintained in electronic form or format may require the 
application of codes, queries, or other minor forms of programming to 
retrieve the requested records. Wherever reasonable, searches shall be 
done by electronic means. However, searches of electronic records are 
not required when such searches would significantly interfere with the 
operation of a Treasury automated information system or would require 
unreasonable effort to conduct. The Department of the Treasury is not 
required under 5 U.S.C. 552 to tabulate or compile information for the 
purpose of creating a record or records that do not exist.

[[Page 19]]

    (h) Initial determination--(1) In general. The officers designated 
in the appendices to this part shall make initial determinations either 
to grant or to deny in whole or in part requests for records. Such 
officers shall respond in the approximate order of receipt of the 
requests, to the extent consistent with sound administrative practice. 
These determinations shall be made and the requester notified within 20 
days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the 
date of receipt of the request, as determined in accordance with 
paragraph (f) of this section, unless the designated officer invokes an 
extension pursuant to paragraph (j)(1) of this section or the requester 
otherwise agrees to an extension of the 20-day time limitation.
    (2) Granting of request. If the request is granted in full or in 
part, and if the requester wants a copy of the records, a copy of the 
records shall be mailed to the requester, together with a statement of 
the applicable fees, either at the time of the determination or shortly 
thereafter.
    (3) Inspection of records. In the case of a request for inspection, 
the requester shall be notified in writing of the determination, when 
and where the requested records may be inspected, and of the fees 
incurred in complying with the request. The records shall then promptly 
be made available for inspection at the time and place stated, in a 
manner that will not interfere with Department of the Treasury 
operations and will not exclude other persons from making inspections. 
The requester shall not be permitted to remove the records from the room 
where inspection is made. If, after making inspection, the requester 
desires copies of all or a portion of the requested records, copies 
shall be furnished upon payment of the established fees prescribed by 
Sec. 1.7. Fees may be charged for search and review time as stated in 
Sec. 1.7.
    (4) Denial of request. If it is determined that the request for 
records should be denied in whole or in part, the requester shall be 
notified by mail. The letter of notification shall:
    (i) State the exemptions relied on in not granting the request;
    (ii) If technically feasible, indicate the amount of information 
deleted at the place in the record where such deletion is made (unless 
providing such indication would harm an interest protected by the 
exemption relied upon to deny such material);
    (iii) Set forth the name and title or position of the responsible 
official;
    (iv) Advise the requester of the right to administrative appeal in 
accordance with paragraph (i) of this section; and
    (v) Specify the official or office to which such appeal shall be 
submitted.
    (5) No records found. If it is determined, after a thorough search 
for records by the responsible official or his delegate, that no records 
have been found to exist, the responsible official will so notify the 
requester in writing. The letter of notification will advise the 
requester of the right to administratively appeal the Department's 
determination that no records exist (i.e., to challenge the adequacy of 
the Department's search for responsive records) in accordance with 
paragraph (i) of this section. The response shall specify the official 
or office to which the appeal shall be submitted for review.
    (i) Administrative appeal. (1)(i) A requester may appeal a 
Department of the Treasury initial determination when:
    (A) Access to records has been denied in whole or in part;
    (B) There has been an adverse determination of the requester's 
category as provided in Sec. 1.7(d)(4);
    (C) A request for fee waiver or reduction has been denied;
    (D) It has been determined that no responsive records exist; or
    (E) A request for expedited processing has been denied.
    (ii) An appeal, other than an appeal for expedited processing, must 
be submitted within 35 days of the date of the initial determination or 
the date of the letter transmitting the last records released, whichever 
is later, except in the case of a denial for expedited processing. An 
appeal of a denial for expedited processing must be made within 10 days 
of the date of the initial determination to deny expedited processing 
(see Sec. 1.5(e)(5)). All appeals must be submitted to the official 
specified in the appropriate appendix to this subpart whose title and 
address should also

[[Page 20]]

have been included in the initial determination. An appeal that is 
improperly addressed shall be considered not to have been received by 
the Department until the office specified in the appropriate appendix 
receives the appeal.
    (2) The appeal shall--
    (i) Be made in writing and signed by the requester or his or her 
representative;
    (ii) Be addressed to and mailed or hand delivered within 35 days (or 
within 10 days when expedited processing has been denied) of the date of 
the initial determination, or the date of the letter transmitting the 
last records released, whichever is later, to the office or officer 
specified in the appropriate appendix to this subpart and also in the 
initial determination. (See the appendices to this subpart for the 
address to which appeals made by mail should be addressed);
    (iii) Set forth the address where the requester desires to be 
notified of the determination on appeal;
    (iv) Specify the date of the initial request and date of the letter 
of initial determination, and, where possible, enclose a copy of the 
initial request and the initial determination being appealed.
    (3)(i) Appeals shall be stamped with the date of their receipt by 
the office to which addressed, and shall be processed in the approximate 
order of their receipt. The receipt of the appeal shall be acknowledged 
by the office or officer specified in the appropriate appendix to this 
subpart and the requester advised of the date the appeal was received 
and the expected date of response. The decision to affirm the initial 
determination (in whole or in part) or to grant the request for records 
shall be made and notification of the determination mailed within 20 
days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after 
the date of receipt of the appeal, unless extended pursuant to paragraph 
(j)(1) of this section. If it is decided that the initial determination 
is to be upheld (in whole or in part) the requester shall be--
    (A) Notified in writing of the denial;
    (B) Notified of the reasons for the denial, including the FOIA 
exemptions relied upon;
    (C) Notified of the name and title or position of the official 
responsible for the determination on appeal; and
    (D) Provided with a statement that judicial review of the denial is 
available in the United States District Court for the judicial district 
in which the requester resides or has a principal place of business, the 
judicial district in which the requested records are located, or the 
District of Columbia in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B).
    (ii) If the initial determination is reversed on appeal, the 
requester shall be so notified and the request shall be processed 
promptly in accordance with the decision on appeal.
    (4) If a determination cannot be made within the 20-day period (or 
within a period of extension pursuant to paragraph (j)(1) of this 
section), the requester may be invited to agree to a voluntary extension 
of the 20-day appeal period. This voluntary extension shall not 
constitute a waiver of the right of the requester ultimately to commence 
an action in a United States district court.
    (j) Time extensions; unusual circumstances. (1) In unusual 
circumstances, the time limitations specified in paragraphs (h) and (i) 
of this section may be extended by written notice from the official 
charged with the duty of making the determination to the person making 
the request or appeal setting forth the reasons for this extension and 
the date on which the determination is expected to be sent. As used in 
this paragraph, unusual circumstances means, but only to the extent 
reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular 
requests:
    (i) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
office processing the request;
    (ii) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in 
a single request; or
    (iii) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in 
the determination of the request, or among two or

[[Page 21]]

more bureaus or components of bureaus of the Department of the Treasury 
having substantial subject matter interest therein.
    (2) Any extension or extensions of time shall not cumulatively total 
more than 10 days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public 
holidays). However, if additional time is needed to process the request, 
the bureau shall notify the requester and provide the requester an 
opportunity to limit the scope of the request or arrange for an 
alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request. 
The requester shall retain the right to define the desired scope of the 
request, as long as it meets the requirements contained in this subpart.
    (3) Bureaus may establish multitrack processing of requests based on 
the amount of work or time, or both, involved in processing requests.
    (4) If more than one request is received from the same requester, or 
from a group of requesters acting in concert, and the Department 
believes that such requests constitute a single request which would 
otherwise satisfy the unusual circumstances specified in paragraph 
(j)(1) of this section, and the requests involve clearly related 
matters, the Department may aggregate these requests for processing 
purposes.
    (k) Failure to comply. If a bureau of the Department of the Treasury 
fails to comply with the time limits specified in paragraphs (h) or (i) 
of this section , or the time extensions of paragraph (j) of this 
section, any person making a request for records in accordance with 
Sec. 1.5 shall be considered to have exhausted administrative remedies 
with respect to the request. Accordingly, the person making the request 
may initiate suit as set forth in paragraph (l) of this section.
    (l) Judicial review. If an adverse determination is made upon appeal 
pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section, or if no determination is 
made within the time limits specified in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this 
section, together with any extension pursuant to paragraph (j)(1) of 
this section or within the time otherwise agreed to by the requester, 
the requester may commence an action in a United States district court 
in the district in which he resides, in which his principal place of 
business is located, in which the records are situated, or in the 
District of Columbia, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4).
    (m) Preservation of records. Under no circumstances shall records be 
destroyed while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or 
lawsuit under the FOIA.
    (n) Processing requests that are not properly addressed. A request 
that is not properly addressed as specified in the appropriate appendix 
to this subpart shall be forwarded to the appropriate bureau or bureaus 
for processing. If the recipient of the request does not know the 
appropriate bureau to forward it to, the request shall be forwarded to 
the Departmental Disclosure Officer (Disclosure Services, DO), who will 
determine the appropriate bureau. A request not addressed to the 
appropriate bureau will be considered to have been received for purposes 
of paragraph (f) of this section when the request has been received by 
the appropriate bureau office as designated in the appropriate appendix 
to this subpart. An improperly addressed request, when received by the 
appropriate bureau office, shall be acknowledged by that bureau.

Sec. 1.6  Business information.

    (a) In general. Business information provided to the Department of 
the Treasury by a business submitter shall not be disclosed pursuant to 
a Freedom of Information Act request except in accordance with this 
section.
    (b) Notice to business submitters. A bureau shall provide a business 
submitter with prompt written notice of receipt of a request or appeal 
encompassing its business information whenever required in accordance 
with paragraph (c) of this section, and except as is provided in 
paragraph (g) of this section. Such written notice shall either describe 
the exact nature of the business information requested or provide copies 
of the records or portions of records containing the business 
information.
    (c) When notice is required. The bureau shall provide a business 
submitter with notice of receipt of a request or appeal whenever:
    (1) The business submitter has in good faith designated the 
information

[[Page 22]]

as commercially or financially sensitive information, or
    (2) The bureau has reason to believe that disclosure of the 
information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial 
competitive harm.
    (3) Notice of a request for business information falling within 
paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section shall be required for a period 
of not more than ten years after the date of submission unless the 
business submitter requests, and provides acceptable justification for, 
a specific notice period of greater duration.
    (4) The submitter's claim of confidentiality should be supported by 
a statement by an authorized representative of the company providing 
specific justification that the information in question is in fact 
confidential commercial or financial information and has not been 
disclosed to the public.
    (d) Opportunity to object to disclosure. (1) Through the notice 
described in paragraph (b) of this section, a bureau shall afford a 
business submitter ten days from the date of the notice (exclusive of 
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) to provide the bureau 
with a detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. Such statement 
shall specify all grounds for withholding any of the information under 
any exemption of the Freedom of Information Act and, in the case of 
Exemption 4, shall demonstrate why the information is considered to be a 
trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged 
or confidential. Information provided by a business submitter pursuant 
to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.
    (2) When notice is given to a submitter under this section, the 
requester shall be advised that such notice has been given to the 
submitter. The requester shall be further advised that a delay in 
responding to the request may be considered a denial of access to 
records and that the requester may proceed with an administrative appeal 
or seek judicial review, if appropriate. However, the requester will be 
invited to agree to a voluntary extension of time so that the bureau may 
review the business submitter's objection to disclose.
    (e) Notice of intent to disclose. A bureau shall consider carefully 
a business submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure 
prior to determining whether to disclose business information. Whenever 
a bureau decides to disclose business information over the objection of 
a business submitter, the bureau shall forward to the business submitter 
a written notice which shall include:
    (1) A statement of the reasons for which the business submitter's 
disclosure objections were not sustained;
    (2) A description of the business information to be disclosed; and
    (3) A specified disclosure date which is not less than ten days 
(exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the 
notice of the final decision to release the requested information has 
been mailed to the submitter. Except as otherwise prohibited by law, a 
copy of the disclosure notice shall be forwarded to the requester at the 
same time.
    (f) Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester brings suit seeking 
to compel disclosure of business information covered by paragraph (c) of 
this section, the bureau shall promptly notify the business submitter.
    (g) Exception to notice requirement. The notice requirements of this 
section shall not apply if:
    (1) The bureau determines that the information shall not be 
disclosed;
    (2) The information lawfully has been published or otherwise made 
available to the public; or
    (3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 
U.S.C. 552).


<R05>
Sec. 1.7  Fees for services.

    (a) In general. This fee schedule is applicable uniformly throughout 
the Department of the Treasury and pertains to requests processed under 
the Freedom of Information Act. Specific levels of fees are prescribed 
for each of the following categories of requesters. Requesters are asked 
to identify the applicable fee category they belong to in their initial 
request in accordance with Sec. 1.5(b).
    (1) Commercial use requesters. These requesters are assessed charges 
which

[[Page 23]]

recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing, and 
duplicating the records sought. Commercial use requesters are not 
entitled to two hours of free search time or 100 free pages of 
duplication of documents. Moreover, when a request is received for 
disclosure that is primarily in the commercial interest of the 
requester, the Department is not required to consider a request for a 
waiver or reduction of fees based upon the assertion that disclosure 
would be in the public interest. The Department may recover the cost of 
searching for and reviewing records even if there is ultimately no 
disclosure of records, or no records are located.
    (2) Educational and Non-Commercial Scientific Institution 
Requesters. Records shall be provided to requesters in these categories 
for the cost of duplication alone, excluding charges for the first 100 
pages. To be eligible, requesters must show that the request is made 
under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are 
not sought for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of 
scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or 
scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific 
institution) research. These categories do not include requesters who 
want records for use in meeting individual academic research or study 
requirements.
    (3) Requesters who are Representatives of the News Media. Records 
shall be provided to requesters in this category for the cost of 
duplication alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages.
    (4) All Other Requesters. Requesters who do not fit any of the 
categories described above shall be charged fees that will recover the 
full direct cost of searching for and duplicating records that are 
responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of 
duplication and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished 
without charge. The Department may recover the cost of searching for 
records even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records, or no 
records are located. Requests from persons for records about themselves 
filed in the Department's systems of records shall continue to be 
treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 which permit 
fees only for duplication, after the first 100 pages are furnished free 
of charge.
    (b) Fee waiver determination. Where the initial request includes a 
request for reduction or waiver of fees, the responsible official shall 
determine whether to grant the request for reduction or waiver before 
processing the request and notify the requester of this decision. If the 
decision does not waive all fees, the responsible official shall advise 
the requester of the fact that fees shall be assessed and, if 
applicable, payment must be made in advance pursuant to Sec. 1.7(e)(2).
    (c) When fees are not charged. (1) No fee shall be charged for 
monitoring a requester's inspection of records.
    (2) Fees shall be charged in accordance with the schedule contained 
in paragraph (g) of this section for services rendered in responding to 
requests for records, unless any one of the following applies:
    (i) Services were performed without charge;
    (ii) The cost of collecting a fee would be equal to or greater than 
the fee itself; or,
    (iii) The fees were waived or reduced in accordance with paragraph 
(d) of this section.
    (d) Waiver or reduction of fees. (1) Fees may be waived or reduced 
on a case-by-case basis in accordance with this paragraph by the 
official who determines the availability of the records, provided such 
waiver or reduction has been requested in writing. Fees shall be waived 
or reduced by this official when it is determined, based upon the 
submission of the requester, that a waiver or reduction of the fees is 
in the public interest because furnishing the information is likely to 
contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or 
activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial 
interest of the requester. Fee waiver/reduction requests shall be 
evaluated against the fee waiver policy guidance issued by the 
Department of Justice on April 2, 1987.
    (2) Normally no charge shall be made for providing records to state 
or foreign governments, international governmental organizations, or 
local government agencies or offices.

[[Page 24]]

    (3) Appeals from denials of requests for waiver or reduction of fees 
shall be decided in accordance with the criteria set forth in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section by the official authorized to decide appeals from 
denials of access to records. Appeals shall be addressed in writing to 
the office or officer specified in the appropriate appendix to this 
subpart within 35 days of the denial of the initial request for waiver 
or reduction and shall be decided within 20 days (excluding Saturdays, 
Sundays, and legal public holidays).
    (4) Appeals from an adverse determination of the requester's 
category as described in Sec. 1.5(b)(2) and provided in Sec.  1.5(i)(1) 
shall be decided by the official authorized to decide appeals from 
denials of access to records and shall be based upon a review of the 
requester's submission and the bureau's own records. Appeals shall be 
addressed in writing to the office or officer specified in the 
appropriate appendix to this subpart within 35 days of the date of the 
bureau's determination of the requester's category and shall be decided 
within 20 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public 
holidays).
    (e) Advance notice of fees. (1) When the fees for processing the 
request are estimated to exceed the limit set by the requester, and that 
amount is less than $250, the requester shall be notified of the 
estimated costs. The requester must provide an agreement to pay the 
estimated costs; however, the requester shall also be given an 
opportunity to reformulate the request in an attempt to reduce fees.
    (2) If the requester has failed to state a limit and the costs are 
estimated to exceed $250.00, the requester shall be notified of the 
estimated costs and must pre-pay such amount prior to the processing of 
the request, or provide satisfactory assurance of full payment if the 
requester has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees. The requester 
shall also be given an opportunity to reformulate the request in such a 
way as to constitute a request for responsive records at a reduced fee.
    (3) When the Department or a bureau of the Department acts under 
paragraphs (e)(1) or (2) of this section, the administrative time limits 
of 20 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) 
from receipt of initial requests or appeals, plus extensions of these 
time limits, shall begin only after fees have been paid, a written 
agreement to pay fees has been provided, or a request has been 
reformulated.
    (f) Form of payment. (1) Payment may be made by check or money order 
payable to the Treasury of the United States or the relevant bureau of 
the Department of the Treasury.
    (2) The Department of the Treasury reserves the right to request 
prepayment after a request is processed and before documents are 
released.
    (3) When costs are estimated or determined to exceed $250, the 
Department shall either obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment of 
the estimated cost where the requester has a history of prompt payment 
of FOIA fees or require a requester to make an advance payment of the 
entire estimated or determined fee before continuing to process the 
request.
    (4) If a requester has previously failed to pay a fee within 30 days 
of the date of the billing, the requester shall be required to pay the 
full amount owed plus any applicable interest, and to make an advance 
payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the Department 
begins to process a new request or the pending request. Whenever 
interest is charged, the Department shall begin assessing interest on 
the 31st day following the day on which billing was sent. Interest shall 
be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717. In addition, the Department 
shall take all steps authorized by the Debt Collection Act of 1982, as 
amended by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, including 
administrative offset pursuant to 31 CFR Part 5, disclosure to consumer 
reporting agencies and use of collection agencies, to effect payment.
    (g) Amounts to be charged for specific services. The fees for 
services performed by a bureau of the Department of the Treasury shall 
be imposed and collected as set forth in this paragraph.
    (1) Duplicating records. All requesters, except commercial 
requesters, shall receive the first 100 pages duplicated without charge. 
Absent a determination to waive fees, a bureau shall charge requesters 
as follows:

[[Page 25]]

    (i) $.20 per page, up to 8\1/2\x14<gr-thn-eq>, made by photocopy or 
similar process.
    (ii) Photographs, films, and other materials--actual cost of 
duplication.
    (iii) Other types of duplication services not mentioned above--
actual cost.
    (iv) Material provided to a private contractor for copying shall be 
charged to the requester at the actual cost charged by the private 
contractor.
    (2) Search services. Bureaus shall charge for search services 
consistent with the following:
    (i) Searches for other than electronic records. The Department shall 
charge for search time at the salary rate(s) (basic pay plus 16 percent) 
of the employee(s) making the search. However, where a single class of 
personnel is used exclusively (e.g., all administrative/clerical, or all 
professional/executive), an average rate for the range of grades 
typically involved may be established. This charge shall include 
transportation of personnel and records necessary to the search at 
actual cost. Fees may be charged for search time as prescribed in Sec. 
1.7, even if the search does not yield any responsive records, or if 
records are denied.
    (ii) Searches for electronic records. The Department shall charge 
for actual direct cost of the search, including computer search time, 
runs, and the operator's salary. The fee for computer output shall be 
actual direct costs. For requesters in the ``all other'' category, when 
the cost of the search (including the operator time and the cost of 
operating the computer to process a request) equals the equivalent 
dollar amount of two hours of the salary of the person performing the 
search (i.e., the operator), the charge for the computer search will 
begin.
    (3) Review of records. The Department shall charge commercial use 
requesters for review of records at the salary rate(s) (i.e., basic pay 
plus 16 percent) of the employee(s) making the review. However, when a 
single class of personnel is used exclusively (e.g., all administrative/
clerical, or all professional/executive), an average rate for the range 
of grades typically involved may be established. Fees may be charged for 
review time as prescribed in Sec. 1.7, even if records ultimately are 
not disclosed.
    (4) Inspection of records. Fees for all services provided shall be 
charged whether or not copies are made available to the requester for 
inspection.
    (5) Other services. Other services and materials requested which are 
not covered by this part nor required by the FOIA are chargeable at the 
actual cost to the Department. This includes, but is not limited to:
    (i) Certifying that records are true copies;
    (ii) Sending records by special methods such as express mail, etc.
    (h) Aggregating requests. When the Department or a bureau of the 
Department reasonably believes that a requester or group of requesters 
is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the 
purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the agency shall aggregate 
any such requests and charge accordingly.

for the testimony of Department employees regarding information 
protected by the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a), the Trade Secrets Act (18 
U.S.C. 1905) or other confidentiality statutes, must satisfy the 
requirements for disclosure set forth in those statutes and the 
applicable regulations of this part before the records may be provided 
or testimony given.
    (4) This section is intended only to provide guidance for the 
internal operations of the Department and to inform the public about 
Department procedures concerning the service of process and responses to 
demands or requests, and the procedures specified in this section, or 
the failure of any Treasury employee to follow the procedures specified 
in this section, are not intended to, do not, and may not be relied upon 
to create a right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at 
law by a party against the United States.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    (1) Agency counsel means:
    (i) With respect to the Departmental Offices, the General Counsel or 
his or her designee; or
    (ii) With respect to a bureau or office of the Department, the Chief 
Counsel or Legal Counsel (or his or her designee) of such bureau or 
office.
    (2) Demand means a request, order, or subpoena for testimony or 
documents related to or for possible use in a legal proceeding.
    (3) Department means the United States Department of the Treasury.

media and including copies thereof, held by the Department, including 
without limitation, official letters, telegrams, memoranda, reports, 
studies, calendar and diary entries, maps, graphs, pamphlets, notes, 
charts, tabulations, analyses, statistical or informational 
accumulations, any kind of summaries of meetings and conversations, film 
impressions, magnetic tapes and sound or mechanical reproductions.
    (5) Employee means all employees or officers of the Department, 
including contractors and any other individuals who have been appointed 
by, or are subject to the supervision, jurisdiction or control of the 
Secretary, as well as the Secretary of the Treasury. The procedures 
established within this subpart also apply to former employees of the 
Department where specifically noted.
    (6) General Counsel means the General Counsel of the Department or 
other Department employee to whom the General Counsel has delegated 
authority to act under this subpart.
    (7) Legal proceeding means all pretrial, trial and post trial stages

[[Page 34]]

responses to formal or informal requests by attorneys or others involved 
in legal proceedings.
    (8) Official business means the authorized business of the 
Department.
    (9) Secretary means the Secretary of the Treasury.
    (10) Testimony means a statement in any form, including personal 
appearances before a court or other legal tribunal, interviews, 
depositions, telephonic, televised, or videotaped statements or any 
responses given during discovery or similar proceedings, which response 
would involve more than the production of documents.
    (c) Department policy. No current or former employee shall, in 
response to a demand, produce any Department documents, provide 
testimony regarding any information relating to or based upon Department 
documents, or disclose any information or produce materials acquired as 
part of the performance of that employee's official duties or official 
status, without the prior authorization of the General Counsel or the 
appropriate agency counsel.
    (d) Procedures for demand for testimony or production of documents. 
(1) A demand directed to the Department for the testimony of a 
Department employee or for the production of documents shall be served 
in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Federal Rules 
of Criminal Procedure, or applicable state procedures and shall be 
directed to the General Counsel, Department of the Treasury, 1500 
Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20220, or to the Chief or Legal 
Counsel of the concerned Department component. Acceptance of a demand 
shall not constitute an admission or waiver with respect to 
jurisdiction, propriety of service, improper venue, or any other defense 
in law or equity available under the applicable laws or rules.
    (2) A subpoena or other demand for testimony directed to an employee 
or former employee shall be served in accordance with the Federal Rules 
of Civil or Criminal Procedure or applicable State procedure and a copy 
of the subpoena shall be sent to agency counsel.
    (3)(i) In court cases in which the United States or the Department 
is not a party, where the giving of testimony or the production of 
documents by the Department, or a current or former employee is desired, 
an affidavit (or if that is not feasible, a statement) by the litigant 
or the litigant's attorney, setting forth the information with respect 
to which the testimony or production is desired, must be submitted in 
order to obtain a decision concerning whether such testimony or 
production will be authorized. Such information shall include: the title 
of the legal proceeding, the forum, the requesting party's interest in 
the legal proceeding, the reason for the demand, a showing that other 
evidence reasonably suited to the requester's needs is not available 
from any other source and, if testimony is requested, the intended use 
of the testimony, a general summary of the desired testimony, and a 
showing that no document could be provided and used in lieu of 
testimony. The purpose of this requirement is to assist agency counsel 
in making an informed decision regarding whether testimony or the 
production of document should be authorized. Permission to testify or 
produce documents will, in all cases, be limited to the information set 
forth in the affidavit or statement, or to such portions thereof as may 
be deemed proper.
    (ii) Agency counsel may consult or negotiate with an attorney for a 
party, or the party if not represented by an attorney, to refine or 
limit a demand so that compliance is less burdensome or obtain 
information necessary to make the determination required by paragraph 
(e) of this section. Failure of the attorney or party to cooperate in 
good faith to enable agency counsel to make an informed determination 
under this subpart may serve, where appropriate, as a basis for a 
determination not to comply with the demand.
    (iii) A determination under this subpart to comply or not to comply 
with a demand is without prejudice as to any formal assertion or waiver 
of privilege, lack of relevance, technical deficiency or any other 
ground for noncompliance.
    (4)(i) Employees shall immediately refer all inquiries and demands 
made on the Department to agency counsel.

[[Page 35]]

    (ii) An employee who receives a subpoena shall immediately forward 
the subpoena to agency counsel. Agency counsel will determine the manner 
in which to respond to the subpoena.
    (e) Factors to be considered by agency counsel. (1) In deciding 
whether to authorize the release of official information or the 
testimony of personnel concerning official information (hereafter 
referred to as ``the disclosure'') agency counsel shall consider the 
following factors:
    (i) Whether the request or demand is unduly burdensome;
    (ii) Whether the request would involve the Department in 
controversial issues unrelated to the Department's mission;
    (iii) Whether the time and money of the United States would be used 
for private purposes;
    (iv) The extent to which the time of employees for conducting 
official business would be compromised;
    (v) Whether the public might misconstrue variances between personal 
opinions of employees and Department policy;
    (vi) Whether the request demonstrates that the information requested 
is relevant and material to the action pending, genuinely necessary to 
the proceeding, unavailable from other sources, and reasonable in its 
scope;
    (vii) Whether the number of similar requests would have a cumulative 
effect on the expenditure of agency resources;
    (viii) Whether disclosure otherwise would be inappropriate under the 
circumstances; and
    (ix) Any other factor that is appropriate.
    (2) Among those demands and requests in response to which compliance 
will not ordinarily be authorized are those with respect to which any of 
the following factors exists:
    (i) The disclosure would violate a statute, Executive order, or 
regulation;
    (ii) The integrity of the administrative and deliberative processes 
of the Department would be compromised;
    (iii) The disclosure would not be appropriate under the rules of 
procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand arose;
    (iv) The disclosure, including release in camera, is not appropriate 
or necessary under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege;
    (v) The disclosure, except when in camera and necessary to assert a 
claim of privilege, would reveal information properly classified or 
other matters exempt from unrestricted disclosure; or
    (vi) The disclosure would interfere with ongoing enforcement 
proceedings, compromise constitutional rights, reveal the identity of an 
intelligence source or confidential informant, or disclose trade secrets 
or similarly confidential commercial or financial information.
    (f) Requests for opinion or expert testimony. (1) Subject to 5 CFR 
2635.805, an employee or former employee shall not provide, with or 
without compensation, opinion or expert testimony concerning official 
information, subjects, or activities, except on behalf of the United 
States or a party represented by the Department of Justice, without 
written approval of agency counsel.
    (2) Upon a showing by the requestor of exceptional need or unique 
circumstances and that the anticipated testimony will not be adverse to 
the interests of the Department or the United States, agency counsel 
may, in writing, grant authorization for an employee, or former 
employee, to appear and testify at no expense to the United States.
    (3) Any expert or opinion testimony by a former employee of the 
Department shall be excepted from Sec. 1.11(f)(1) where the testimony 
involves only general expertise gained while employed at the Department.
    (g) Procedures when agency counsel directs an employee not to 
testify or provide documents. (1) If agency counsel determines that an 
employee or former employee should not comply with a subpoena or other 
request for testimony or the production of documents, agency counsel 
will so inform the employee and the party who submitted the subpoena or 
made the request.
    (2) If, despite the determination of the agency counsel that 
testimony should not be given and/or documents not be produced, a court 
of competent jurisdiction or other appropriate authority orders the 
employee or former

[[Page 36]]

employee to testify and/or produce documents, the employee shall notify 
agency counsel of such order.
    (i) If agency counsel determines that no further legal review of, or 
challenge to, the order will be sought, the employee or former employee 
shall comply with the order.
    (ii) If agency counsel determines to challenge the order, or that 
further legal review is necessary, the employee or former employee 
should not comply with the order. Where necessary, the employee should 
appear at the time and place set forth in the subpoena. If legal counsel 
cannot appear on behalf of the employee, the employee should produce a 
copy of this subpart and respectfully inform the legal tribunal that he/
she has been advised by counsel not to provide the requested testimony 
and/or produce documents. If the legal tribunal rules that the subpoena 
must be complied with, the employee shall respectfully decline to 
comply, citing this section and United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 
340 U.S. 462 (1951).

Sec. 1.12  Regulations not applicable to official request.

    The regulations in this part shall not be applicable to official 
requests of other governmental agencies or officers thereof acting in

defined in Sec. 1.11(b)(1)).

                          Subpart C_Privacy Act


<R05>
Sec. 1.20  Purpose and scope of regulations.

    The regulations in this subpart are issued to implement the 
provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a). The regulations 
apply to all records which are contained in systems of records 
maintained by the Department of the Treasury and which are retrieved by 
an individual's name or personal identifier. They do not relate to those 
personnel records of Government employees, which are under the 
jurisdiction of the Office of Personnel Management to the extent such 
records are subject to regulations issued by such OPM. The regulations 
apply to all components of the Department of the Treasury. Any reference 
in this subpart to the Department or its officials, employees, or 
records shall be deemed to refer also to the components or their 
officials, employees, or records. The regulations set forth the 
requirements applicable to Department of the Treasury employees 
maintaining, collecting, using or disseminating records pertaining to 
individuals. They also set forth the procedures by which individuals may 
request notification of whether the Department of the Treasury maintains 
or has disclosed a record pertaining to them or may seek access to such 
records maintained in any nonexempt system of records, request 
correction of such records, appeal any initial adverse determination of 
any request for amendment, or may seek an accounting of disclosures of 
such records. For the convenience of interested persons, the components 
of the Department of the Treasury may reprint these regulations in their 
entirety (less any appendices not applicable to the component in 
question) in those titles of the Code of Federal Regulations which 
normally contain regulations applicable to such components. In 
connection with such republication, and at other appropriate times, 
components may issue supplementary regulations applicable only to the 
component in question, which are consistent with these regulations. In 
the event of any actual or apparent inconsistency, these Departmental 
regulations shall govern. Persons interested in the records of a 
particular component should, therefore, also consult the Code of Federal 
Regulations for any rules or regulations promulgated specifically with 
respect to that component (see Appendices to this subpart for cross 
references). The head of each component is hereby also authorized to 
substitute other appropriate officials for those designated and correct 
addresses specified in the appendix to this subpart applicable to the 
component. The components of the Department of the Treasury for the 
purposes of this subpart are:

of the President (See 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1)).

inform each individual whom it asks to supply information, on the form 
which it uses to collect the information or on a separate form that can

    (c) Report on new systems. Each component of the Treasury shall 
provide adequate advance notice to Congress and the Office of Management

or property rights of individuals or the disclosure of information 
relating to such individuals, and its effect on the preservation of the 
constitutional principles of federalism and separation of powers. (See 5 
U.S.C. 552a(o)).
    (d) Accurate and secure maintenance of records. Each component 
shall:
    (1) Subject to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) and Sec. 1.23(c)(1), maintain all

with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is 
reasonably necessary to

[[Page 39]]

assure fairness to the individual in the determination (see 5 U.S.C. 
552a(e)(5);
    (2) Prior to disseminating any record about an individual to any 
person other than an agency, unless the dissemination is made pursuant

to assure that such records are accurate, complete, timely, and relevant

    (i) System managers, with the approval of the head of their offices 
within a component, shall establish administrative and physical 
controls, consistent with Department regulations, to insure the 
protection of records systems from unauthorized access or disclosure and 
from physical damage or destruction. The controls instituted shall be 
proportional to the degree of sensitivity of the records but at a 
minimum must insure that records other than those available to the 
general public under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), are 
protected from public view, that the area in which the records are 
stored is supervised during all business hours and physically secure 
during nonbusiness hours to prevent unauthorized personnel from 
obtaining access to the records. Automated systems shall comply with the 
security standards promulgated by the National Bureau of Standards.
    (ii) System managers, with the approval of the head of their offices 
within a component, shall adopt access restrictions to insure that only 
those individuals within the agency who have a need to have access to 
the records for the performance of their duties have access to them. 
Procedures shall also be adopted to prevent accidental access to, or 
dissemination of, records.
    (e) Prohibition against maintenance of records concerning First 
Amendment rights. No component shall maintain a record describing how 
any individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment (e.g. 
speech), unless the maintenance of such record is:
    (1) Expressly authorized by statute, or
    (2) Expressly authorized by the individual about whom the record is 
maintained, or
    (3) Pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law 
enforcement activity. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (e)(7))
    (f) Notification of disclosure under compulsory legal process. 
Subject to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) and Sec. 1.23(c)(1), when records 
concerning an individual are subpoenaed by a Grand Jury, Court, or 
quasi-judicial agency, or disclosed in accordance with an ex parte court 
order pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6103(i), the official served with the 
subpoena or court order shall make reasonable efforts to assure that 
notice of any disclosure is provided to the individual. Notice shall be 
provided within five working days of making the records available under 
compulsory legal process or, in the case of a Grand Jury subpoena or an 
ex parte order, within five days of its becoming a matter of public 
record. Notice shall be mailed to the last known address of the 
individual and shall contain the following information: the date and 
authority to which the subpoena is, or was returnable, or the date of 
and court issuing the ex parte order, the name and number of the case or 
proceeding, and the nature of the information sought and provided. 
Notice of the issuance of a subpoena or an ex parte order is not 
required if the system of records has been exempted from the notice 
requirement of 5 U.S.C. 552a (e)(8) and this section, pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 552a (j) and Sec. 1.23 (c)(1), by a Notice of Exemption 
published in the Federal Register. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (e)(8)).
    (g) Emergency disclosure. If information concerning an individual 
has been disclosed to any person under compelling circumstances 
affecting health or safety, the individual shall be notified at the last 
known address within 5 days of the disclosure (excluding Saturdays, 
Sundays, and legal public holidays).

[[Page 40]]

Notification shall include the following information: The nature of the 
information disclosed, the person or agency to whom it was disclosed, 
the date of disclosure, and the compelling circumstances justifying the 
disclosure. Notification shall be given by the officer who made or 
authorized the disclosure. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (b)(8)).

    (ii) Investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, 
other than material within the scope of subsection (j)(2) of 5 U.S.C. 
552a and paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If any individual is denied 
any right, privilege, or benefit that such individual would otherwise be 
entitled to by Federal law, or for which such individual would otherwise 
be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of this material, such 
material shall be provided to the individual, except to the extent that 
the disclosure of the material would reveal the identity of a source who

statistical records;
    (v) Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of 
determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal 
civilian employment, military service, Federal contracts, or access to

such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished 
information to the Government under an express promise that the identity 
of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to September 27, 
1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be 
held in confidence;
    (vi) Testing or examination material used solely to determine 
individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal 
service the disclosure of which would compromise the objectivity or 
fairness of the testing or examination process; or

from a provision of 5

[[Page 42]]

U.S.C. 552a and this part. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (j) and (k))
    (d) Review and report to OMB. The Department shall ensure that the 
following reviews are conducted as often as specified below by each of 
the components who shall be prepared to report to the Departmental 
Disclosure Branch upon request the results of such reviews and any 
corrective action taken to resolve problems uncovered. Each component 
shall:
    (1) Review every two years a random sample of the component's 
contracts that provide for the maintenance of a system of records on 
behalf of the component to accomplish a function of the component, in 
order to ensure that the working of each contract makes the provisions 
of the Act apply. (5 U.S.C. 552a(m)(1))
    (2) Review annually component's recordkeeping and disposal policies 
and practices in order to assure compliance with the Act.
    (3) Review routine use disclosures every 3 years, that are 
associated with each system of records in order to ensure that the 
recipient's use of such records continues to be compatible with the 
purpose for which the disclosing agency originally collected the 
information.
    (4) Review every three years each system of records for which the 
component has issued exemption rules pursuant to section (j) or (k) of 
the Privacy Act in order to determine whether the exemption is needed.
    (5) Review annually each ongoing matching program in which the 
component has participated during the year, either as a source or as a 
matching agency in order to assure that the requirements of the Act, the 
OMB Matching Guidelines, and the OMB Model Control System and checklist 
have been met.
    (6) Review component's training practices annually to ensure that 
all component personnel are familiar with the requirements of the Act, 
these regulations and Departmental directives.
    (7) Review annually the actions of component personnel that have 
resulted either in the agency being found civilly liable under section 
(g) of the Act, or an employee being found criminally liable under the 
provisions of section (i) of the Act, in order to determine the extent 
of the problem and to prevent future recurrences.
    (8) Review annually each system of records notice to ensure that it 
accurately describes the system. Where minor changes are needed, publish 
an amended notice in the Federal Register. Minor changes shall be 
consolidated in one annual comprehensive publication. The term ``minor 
change to a system of records'' means a change that does not 
significantly change the system. More specifically, a minor change does 
not affect the character or purpose of the system and does not affect 
the ability of an individual to gain access to a record about the 
individual or to any information pertaining to such individual which is 
contained in the system; for example, changing the title of the system 
manager or the location of the system.


<R05>
Sec. 1.24  Disclosure of records to person other than the individual to 
whom they pertain.

    (a) Conditions of disclosure. No component of Treasury shall 
disclose any record which is contained in a system of records maintained 
by it by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, 
except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written 
consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains, or the parent,

unless disclosure of the record would be:
    (1) To those offices and employees of the Department of the Treasury 
who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties;
    (2) Retired under 5 U.S.C. 552 (subpart A of this part);

1.23(a)(4);
    (4) To the Bureau of the Census for purposes of planning or carrying 
out a census or survey or related activity pursuant to the provisions of 
title 13 of the U.S. Code;
    (5) To a recipient who has provided the component with advance 
adequate written assurance that the record will be used solely as a 
statistical research

[[Page 43]]

or reporting record, and the record is to be transferred in a form that 
is not individually identifiable;
    (6) To the National Archives of the United States as a record which 
has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued 
preservation by the United States Government, or for evaluation by the 
Administrator of General Services or the designee of such official to 
determine whether the record has such value;
    (7) To another agency or to an instrumentality of any governmental 
jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a 
civil or criminal law enforcement activity.
    (i) If the activity is authorized by law; and

    (8) To a person pursuant to a showing of compelling circumstances 
affecting the health or safety of an individual, if upon such 
disclosure, notification is transmitted to the last known address of

(See 5 U.S.C. 552a(b))


<R05>
Sec. 1.25  Accounting of disclosures.

    (a) Accounting of certain disclosures. Each component, with respect 
to each system of records under its control, shall:
    (1) Keep an accurate accounting of: (i) The date, nature, and 
purpose of each disclosure of a record to any person or to an agency 
made under 5 U.S.C. 552a (b) and Sec. 1.24; and (ii) the name and 
address of the person or agency to whom the disclosure is made;
    (2) Retain the accounting made under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section for at least five years or the life of the record, whichever is 
longer, after the disclosure for which the accounting is made; and
    (3) Inform any person or other agency about any correction or 
notation of dispute made by the constitutent unit in accordance with 5 
U.S.C. 552a (d) and Sec. 1.28 of any record that has been disclosed to 
the person or agency if an accounting of the disclosure was made. (See 5 
U.S.C. 552(c).)
    (b) Accounting systems. To permit the accounting required by 
paragraph (a) of this section, system managers, with the approval of the 
head of their offices within a component, shall establish or implement, 
a system of accounting for all disclosures of records, either orally or 
in writing, made outside the Department of the Treasury. Accounting 
records shall:
    (1) Be established in the least expensive and most convenient form 
that will permit the system manager to advise individuals, promptly upon 
request, what records concerning them have been disclosed and to whom:
    (2) Provide, as a minimum, the identification of the particular 
record disclosed, the name and address of the person or agency to whom 
or to whom or to which disclosed, and the date, nature and purpose of 
the disclosure; and
    (3) Be maintained for 5 years or until the record is destroyed or 
transferred to the National Archives and Records Service for storage in 
records centers, in which event, the accounting pertaining to those 
records, unless maintained separately, shall be transferred with the 
records themselves.
    (c) Exemptions from accounting requirements. No accounting is 
required for disclosure of records:
    (1) To those officers and employees of the Department of the 
Treasury who have a need for the record in the performance of their 
duties; or
    (2) If disclosure would be required under 5 U.S.C. 552 and Subpart A 
of this part.
    (d) Access to accounting by individual. (1) Subject to paragraphs 
(c) and (d)(2) of this section, each component shall establish and set 
forth in the appendix

[[Page 44]]

to this subpart applicable to the component, procedures for making the 
accounting required under paragraph (a) of this section available to the 
individual to whom the record pertains and shall thereafter make such 
accounting available in accordance therewith at the request of the 
individual. The procedures may require the requester to provide 
reasonable identification.
    (2) Access accountings of disclosure may be withheld from the 
individual named in the record only if the disclosures were (i) made 
under 5 U.S.C. 552a (b)(7) and Sec. 1.24 (a)(7), or (ii) under a system 
of records exempted from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) in 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552 (j) or (k) and Sec. 1.23(c). (See 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c))


<R05>
Sec. 1.26  Procedures for notification and access to records pertaining 
to individuals--format and fees for request for access.

    (a) Procedures for notification and access. Each component shall 
establish, in accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553, and set 
forth in the appendix to this subpart applicable to such component 
procedures whereby an individual can be notified, in response to a 
request, if any system of records named by the individual contains a 
record pertaining to that individual. In addition, such procedures shall 
set forth the requirements for access to such records. As a minimum such 
procedures shall specify the times during, and the places at which 
access will be accorded, together with such identification as may be 
required of the individual before access. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a(f) (1), (2) 
and (3))
    (b) Access. Each component in accordance with the procedures 
prescribed under paragraph (a) of this section, shall allow an 
individual to gain access to records or to any information pertaining to 
such individual which is contained in the system of records upon 
request. The individual shall be permitted to review the record and have 
a copy made of all or any portion of the record in a form that is 
comprehensible. The individual will also be permitted to be accompanied 
by any person of the individual's choosing to review the record, except 
that the agency may require the individual to furnish a written 
statement authorizing discussion of that individual's record in the 
accompanying person's presence. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1))
    (c) Exceptions. Neither the procedures prescribed under paragraph 
(a) of this section nor the requirements for access under paragraph (b) 
of this section shall be applicable to--(1) systems of records exempted 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j) and (k) and Sec. 1.23(c); (2) information 
compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding (See 
5 U.S.C. 552(d)(5)); or (3) information pertaining to an individual 
which is contained in, and inseparable from, another individual's 
record.
    (d) Format of request. (1) A record for notification of whether a 
record exists shall:
    (i) Be made in writing and signed by the person making the request, 
who must be the individual about whom the record is maintained, or such 
individual's duly authorized representative (See Sec. 1.34);
    (ii) State that it is made pursuant to the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 
552a or these regulations, have marked ``Privacy Act Request'' on the 
request and on the envelope;
    (iii) Give the name of the system or subsystem or categories of 
records to which access is sought, as specified in ``Privacy Act 
Issuances'' published by the Office of the Federal Register and 
referenced in the appendices to this subpart;
    (iv) Describe the nature of the record(s) sought in sufficient 
detail to enable Department personnel to locate the system of records 
containing the record with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever 
possible, a request for access should describe the nature of the record 
sought, the date of the record or the period in which the record was 
compiled.
    (v) Provide such identification of the requester as may be specified 
in the appropriate appendix to this subpart; and
    (vi) Be addressed or delivered in person to the office or officer of 
the component indicated for the particular system or subsystem or 
categories of records the individual wishes access to, as specified in 
``Privacy Act Issuances'' published by the Office of the Federal

[[Page 45]]

Register and referenced in the appendices to this subpart. Assistance in 
ascertaining the appropriate component or in preparing a request for 
notification may be obtained by a written request to this effect 
addressed as specified in Appendix A of this part, as the address for 
the Departmental Offices for ``Request for notification and access to 
records and accountings of disclosures''.
    (2) A request for access to records shall, in addition to complying 
with paragraph (a)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section:
    (i) State whether the requester wishes to inspect the records or 
desires to have a copy made and furnished without first inspecting them;
    (ii) If the requester desires to have a copy made, state the firm 
agreement of the requester to pay the fees for duplication ultimately 
determined in accordance with (31 CFR 1.6) Subpart A of this title, 
unless such fees are waived pursuant to that section by the system 
manager or other appropriate official as indicated in the appropriate 
appendix to these regulations; and
    (iii) Comply with any other requirement set forth in the applicable 
appendix to this subpart or the ``Notice of Records Systems'' applicable 
to the system in question. Requesters are hereby advised that any 
request for access which does not comply with the foregoing requirements 
and those set forth elsewhere in this Subpart C, will not be deemed 
subject to the time constraints of this section, unless and until 
amended so as to comply. However, components shall advise the requester 
in what respect the request is deficient so that it may be processed. 
This section applies only to records which are contained in a system of 
records and which are in the possession or control of the component. 
(See 5 U.S.C. 552a (d) and (f))
    (e) Requests for records not in control of component. (1) Treasury 
employees shall make reasonable efforts to assist an oral requester to 
ascertain to which office or officer a written request should be sent. 
When the request is for a record which is not in the possession or 
control of any component of the Department of the Treasury, the 
requester shall be so advised.
    (2) Where the record requested was created by a Department or agency 
other than the Department of the Treasury or a component of the 
Department and has been classified (e.g. National Defense or 
Intelligence Information) or otherwise restrictively endorsed (e.g. 
Office of Personnel Management records of FBI reports) by such other 
Department or agency, and a copy is in the possession of a component of 
the Department of the Treasury, that portion of the request shall be 
referred to the originating agency for determination as to all issues in 
accordance with the Privacy Act. In the case of a referral to another 
agency under this paragraph, the requester shall be notified that such 
portion of the request has been so referred and that the requester may 
expect to hear from that agency.
    (3) When information sought from a system manager or other 
appropriate official in the Department of the Treasury includes 
information furnished by other Federal agencies not classified or 
otherwise restrictively endorsed, the system manager or other 
appropriate official receiving the request shall consult with the 
appropriate agency prior to making a decision to disclose or not to 
disclose the record. The decision as to whether the record shall be 
disclosed shall be made, in the first instance by the system manager or 
other appropriate official maintaining the record. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a 
(d) and (f))
    (f) Date of receipt of request. A request for notification or access 
to records shall be considered to have been received for purposes of 
this subpart on the date on which the requirements of paragraph (d) of 
this section have been satisfied. Requests for notification or access to 
records and any separate agreement to pay shall be stamped or endorsed 
with the date of receipt by the receiving office. The latest of such 
stamped dates will be deemed to be the date of receipt of the request 
for the purposes of this subpart. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (d) and (f))
    (g) Notification of determination--(1) In general. Notification of 
determinations as to notification of whether a record exists or as to 
whether to grant access to records requested will be made by

[[Page 46]]

the officers designated in the appendices to this subpart. The 
notification of the determination shall be mailed within 30 days 
(excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) after the date 
of receipt of the request, as determined in accordance with paragraph 
(f) of this section. If it is not possible to respond within 30 days, 
the designated officer shall inform the requester, stating the reason 
for the delay (e.g. volume of records requested, scattered location of 
the records, need to consult other agencies, or the difficulty of the 
legal issues involved) and when a response will be dispatched. (See 5 
U.S.C. 552a (d) and (f))
    (2) Granting of access. When it has been determined that the request 
for access will be granted--(i) and a copy requested; such copy in a 
form comprehensible to the requester shall be furnished promptly, 
together with a statement of the applicable fees for duplication; and 
(ii) and the right to inspect has been requested, the requester shall be 
promptly notified in writing of the determination, and when and where 
the requested records may be inspected. An individual seeking to inspect 
such records may be accompanied by another person of such individual's 
choosing. The individual seeking access shall be required to sign the 
required form indicating that the Department of the Treasury is 
authorized to discuss the contents of the subject record in the 
accompanying person's presence. If, after making the inspection, the 
individual making the request desires a copy of all or a portion of the 
requested records, such copy in a form comprehensible to the individual 
shall be furnished upon payment of the applicable fees for duplication. 
Fees to be charged are as prescribed by 31 CFR part 1, Subpart A, Sec. 
1.6 Fees shall not be charged where they would amount, in the aggregate, 
to less than $3.00. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (d) and (f))
    (3) Requirements for access to medical records. When access is 
requested to medical records, including psychological records, the 
responsible official may determine that such release could have an 
adverse effect on the individual and that release will be made only to a 
physician authorized in writing to have access to such records by the 
individual making the request. Upon receipt of the authorization the 
physician will be permitted to review the records or to receive copies 
of the records by mail, upon proper verification of identity. (See 5 
U.S.C. 552a (f) (3))
    (4) Denial of request. When it is determined that the request for 
notification of whether a record exists or access to records will be 
denied (whether in whole or part or subject to conditions or 
exceptions), the person making the request shall be so notified by mail 
in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this section. The letter of 
notification shall specify the city or other location where the 
requested records are situated (if known), contain a statement of the 
reasons for not granting the request as made, set forth the name and 
title or position of the responsible official and advise the individual 
making the request of the right to file suit in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 
552a (g)(1)(B).
    (5) Prohibition against the use of 5 U.S.C. 552 (b) exemptions. 
Exemptions from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552 (b) (31 CFR part 1, 
Subpart A, Sec. 1.2 (c)), may not be invoked for the purpose of 
withholding from an individual any record which is otherwise accessible 
to such individual under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a and this 
subpart. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (q))
    (6) Records exempt in whole or in part. (i) When an individual 
requests notification as to whether a record exists or access to records 
concerning the individual which have been exempted from individual 
access pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j) or which have been compiled in 
reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding in either a 
court or before an administrative tribunal and the assertion of the 
exemption is deemed necessary, the Department of the Treasury will 
neither confirm nor deny the existence of the record but shall advise 
the individual only that no record available to the individual pursuant 
to the Privacy Act of 1974 has been identified.
    (ii) Requests from individuals for access to records which have been 
exempted from access pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (k) shall be processed as 
follows:

[[Page 47]]

    (A) Requests for information classified pursuant to Executive Order 
11652 require the responsible component of the Department to review the 
information to determine whether it continues to warrant classification 
under the criteria of sections 1 and 5 (B), (C), (D) and (E) of the 
Executive order. Information which no longer warrants classification 
under these criteria shall be declassified and made available to the 
individual. If the information continues to warrant classification, the 
individual shall be advised that the information sought is classified, 
that it has been reviewed and continues to warrant classification, and 
that it has been exempted from access pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(1) 
and 5 U.S.C. 552a (k)(1). Information which has been exempted pursuant 
to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j) and which is also classified shall be reviewed as 
required by this paragraph but the response to the individual shall be 
in the form prescribed by paragraph (g)(6)(i) of this section.
    (B) Requests for information which has been exempted from disclosure 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (k)(2) shall be responded to in the manner 
provided in paragraph (g)(6)(i) of this section unless the requester 
shows that the information has been used or is being used to deny the 
individual any right, privilege or benefit for which he is eligible or 
to which he would otherwise be entitled under federal law. In that 
event, the individual shall be advised of the existence of the 
information but such information as would identify a confidential source 
shall be extracted or summarized in a manner which protects the source 
to the maximum degree possible and the summary extract shall be provided 
to the requesting individual.
    (C) Information compiled as part of an employee background 
investigation which has been exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (k)(5) 
shall be made available to an individual upon request except to the 
extent that it identifies the confidential source. Material identifying 
the confidential sources shall be extracted or summarized in a manner 
which protects the source to the maximum degree possible and the summary 
or extract shall be provided to the requesting individual.
    (D) Testing or examination material which has been exempted pursuant 
to 5 U.S.C. 552a (k)(6) shall not be made available to an individual if 
disclosure would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the testing 
or examination process; but may be made available if no such compromise 
possibility exists. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(5), (j) and (k)).

subpart. The receipt of the appeal shall be acknowledged within 10 days 
(excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date 
of the receipt (unless the determination on appeal is dispatched in 10 
days, in which case, no acknowledgement is required) by the responsible 
official and the requester advised of the date of receipt established by 
the foregoing and when a response is due in accordance with this 
paragraph. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (d) and (f))
    (4) Review of administrative appeals from denial of requests to 
amend records. Officials responsible for deciding administrative appeals 
from denials of requests to amend records pertaining to an individual, 
as specified in the appendices to this subpart shall: Complete the

days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) after 
the date of receipt of such appeal, unless the time is extended by the 
head of the

final agency decision is to refuse to amend the record, in whole or in 
part, the requester shall also be advised of the right--(i) to file a 
concise ``Statement of Disagreement'' setting forth the reasons for his 
disagreement with the decision which shall be filed within 35 days of 
the date of the notification of the final agency decision and (ii) to 
judicial review of the final agency decision under 5 U.S.C. 
552a(g)(1)(A). (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (d), (f) and (g)(1))
    (5) Notation on record and distribution of statements of 
disagreement. The system manager is responsible, in any disclosure 
containing information about which an individual has filed a ``Statement 
of Disagreement'', occurring after the filing of the statement under 
paragraph (e)(4) of this section, for clearly noting any portion of the 
record which is disputed and providing copies of the statement and, if 
deemed appropriate, a concise statement of the component's reasons for 
not making the amendments requested to persons or other agencies to whom 
the disputed record has been disclosed. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(4))

system of records, on a continuing basis with respect to the duties and 
responsibilities imposed on them and the rights conferred on individuals

for the purpose of eliminating any requirement for information that is 
not relevant and necessary to carry out an agency function and to 
accomplish the following objectives;
    (1) To insure that no information concerning religion, political 
beliefs or activities, association memberships (other than those 
required for a professional license), or the exercise of First Amendment 
rights is required to be disclosed unless such requirement of disclosure 
is expressly authorized by statute or is pertinent to, and within the 
scope of, any authorized law enforcement activity;
    (2) To insure that the form or a separate form that can be retained 
by the individual makes clear to the individual which information he is 
required by law to disclose and the authority for that requirement and 
which information is voluntary;
    (3) To insure that the form or a separate form that can be retained 
by the individual states clearly the principal purpose or purposes for 
which the information is being collected, and summarizes concisely the 
routine uses that will be made of the information;
    (4) To insure that the form or a separate form that can be retained 
by the individual clearly indicates to the individual the effect in 
terms of rights, benefits or privileges of not providing all or part of 
the requested information; and
    (5) To insure that any form requesting disclosure of a Social 
Security Number, or a separate form that can be retained by the 
individual, clearly advises the individual of the statute or regulation 
requiring disclosure of the number or clearly advises the individual 
that disclosure is voluntary and that no consequence will follow from 
the refusal to disclose it, and the uses that will be made of the number 
whether disclosed mandatorily and voluntarily.
    (c) Revision of forms. Any form which does not meet the objectives 
specified in the Privacy Act and in this section, shall be revised to 
conform thereto. A separate statement may be used in instances when a 
form does not conform. This statement will accompany a form and shall 
include all the information necessary to accomplish the objectives 
specified in the Privacy Act and this section.

identified below from the following provisions of the Privacy Act for 
the reasons indicated.
    (b) Authority. These rules are promulgated pursuant to the authority

Department of the Treasury have as their principal function activities 
pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws and protective service 
activities which are necessary to assure the safety of individuals

    (2) The Department hereby exempts the systems of records listed in 
paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (xiii) of this section from the following 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2): 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3) and (4), 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (2), (3), (4), 5 U.S.C. 
552a(e)(1), (2) and (3), 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), 5 U.S.C. 
552a(e)(5) and (8), 5 U.S.C. 552a(f), and 5 U.S.C. 552a(g).
    (d) Reasons for exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2). (1) 5 U.S.C. 
552a(e)(4)(G) and (f)(l) enable individuals to inquire whether a system 
of records contains records pertaining to them. Application of these 
provisions to the systems of records would give individuals an 
opportunity to learn whether they have been identified as suspects or 
subjects of investigation. As further described in the following 
paragraph, access to such knowledge would impair the Department's 
ability to carry out its mission, since individuals could:
    (i) Take steps to avoid detection;
    (ii) Inform associates that an investigation is in progress;
    (iii) Learn the nature of the investigation;
    (iv) Learn whether they are only suspects or identified as law 
violators;
    (v) Begin, continue, or resume illegal conduct upon learning that 
they are not identified in the system of records; or
    (vi) Destroy evidence needed to prove the violation.
    (2) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(2), (3) and (5) grant 
individuals access to records pertaining to them. The application of 
these provisions to the systems of records would compromise the 
Department's ability to provide useful tactical and strategic 
information to law enforcement agencies.
    (i) Permitting access to records contained in the systems of records 
would provide individuals with information concerning the nature of any 
current investigations and would enable them to avoid detection or 
apprehension by:
    (A) Discovering the facts that would form the basis for their 
arrest;
    (B) Enabling them to destroy or alter evidence of criminal conduct 
that would form the basis for their arrest; and
    (C) Using knowledge that criminal investigators had reason to 
believe that a crime was about to be committed, to delay the commission 
of the crime or commit it at a location that might not be under 
surveillance.
    (ii) Permitting access to either on-going or closed investigative 
files would also reveal investigative techniques and procedures, the 
knowledge of which could enable individuals planning crimes to structure 
their operations so as to avoid detection or apprehension.
    (iii) Permitting access to investigative files and records could, 
moreover, disclose the identity of confidential sources and informers 
and the nature of the information supplied and thereby endanger the 
physical safety of those sources by exposing them to possible reprisals 
for having provided the information. Confidential sources and informers 
might refuse to provide criminal investigators with valuable information 
unless they believed that their identities would not be revealed through 
disclosure of their names or the nature of the information they 
supplied. Loss of access to such sources would seriously impair the 
Department's ability to carry out its mandate.
    (iv) Furthermore, providing access to records contained in the 
systems of records could reveal the identities of undercover law 
enforcement officers who compiled information regarding the individual's 
criminal activities and thereby endanger the physical safety of those 
undercover officers or their families by exposing them to possible 
reprisals.
    (v) By compromising the law enforcement value of the systems of 
records for the reasons outlined in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iv) of 
this section, permitting access in keeping with these provisions would 
discourage other law enforcement and regulatory agencies, foreign and 
domestic, from

[[Page 55]]

freely sharing information with the Department and thus would restrict 
the Department's access to information necessary to accomplish its 
mission most effectively.
    (vi) Limitation on access to the material contained in the 
protective intelligence files is considered necessary to the 
preservation of the utility of intelligence files and in safeguarding 
those persons the Department is authorized to protect. Access to the 
protective intelligence files could adversely affect the quality of 
information available to the Department; compromise confidential 
sources, hinder the ability of the Department to keep track of persons 
of protective interest; and interfere with the Department's protective 
intelligence activities by individuals gaining access to protective 
intelligence files.
    (vii) Many of the persons on whom records are maintained in the 
protective intelligence suffer from mental aberrations. Knowledge of 
their condition and progress comes from authorities, family members and 
witnesses. Many times this information comes to the Department as a 
result of two party conversations where it would be impossible to hide 
the identity of informants. Sources of information must be developed, 
questions asked and answers recorded. Trust must be extended and 
guarantees of confidentiality and anonymity must be maintained. Allowing 
access to information of this kind to individuals who are the subjects 
of protective interest may well lead to violence directed against an 
informant by a mentally disturbed individual.
    (viii) Finally, the dissemination of certain information that the 
Department may maintain in the systems of records is restricted by law.
    (3) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2), (3) and (4), (e)(4)(H), and (f)(4) permit 
an individual to request amendment of a record pertaining to him or her 
and require the agency either to amend the record, or to note the 
disputed portion of the record and to provide a copy of the individual's 
statement of disagreement with the agency's refusal to amend a record to 
persons or other agencies to whom the record is thereafter disclosed. 
Since these provisions depend on the individual's having access to his 
or her records, and since these rules exempt the systems of records from 
the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a relating to access to records, for the 
reasons set out in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, these provisions 
should not apply to the systems of records.
    (4) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires an agency to make accountings of 
disclosures of a record available to the individual named in the record 
upon his or her request. The accountings must state the date, nature, 
and purpose of each disclosure of the record and the name and address of 
the recipient.
    (i) The application of this provision would impair the ability of 
law enforcement agencies outside the Department of the Treasury to make 
effective use of information provided by the Department. Making 
accountings of disclosures available to the subjects of an investigation 
would alert them to the fact that another agency is conducting an 
investigation into their criminal activities and could reveal the 
geographic location of the other agency's investigation, the nature and 
purpose of that investigation, and the dates on which that investigation 
was active. Violators possessing such knowledge would be able to take 
measures to avoid detection or apprehension by altering their 
operations, by transferring their criminal activities to other 
geographical areas, or by destroying or concealing evidence that would 
form the basis for arrest. In the case of a delinquent account, such 
release might enable the subject of the investigation to dissipate 
assets before levy.
    (ii) Moreover, providing accountings to the subjects of 
investigations would alert them to the fact that the Department has 
information regarding their criminal activities and could inform them of 
the general nature of that information. Access to such information could 
reveal the operation of the Department's information-gathering and 
analysis systems and permit violators to take steps to avoid detection 
or apprehension.
    (iii) The release of such information to the subject of a protective 
intelligence file would provide significant information concerning the 
nature of an investigation, and could result in impeding or compromising 
the efforts

[[Page 56]]

of Department personnel to detect persons suspected of criminal 
activities or to collect information necessary for the proper evaluation 
of persons considered to be of protective interest.
    (5) 5 U.S.C. 552(c)(4) requires an agency to inform any person or 
other agency about any correction or notation of dispute that the agency 
made in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) to any record that the agency 
disclosed to the person or agency if an accounting of the disclosure was 
made. Since this provision depends on an individual's having access to 
and an opportunity to request amendment of records pertaining to him or 
her, and since these rules exempt the systems of records from the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a relating to access to and amendment of 
records, for the reasons set out in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, 
this provision should not apply to the systems of records.
    (6) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(I) requires an agency to publish a general 
notice listing the categories of sources for information contained in a 
system of records. The application of this provision to the systems of 
records could compromise the Department's ability to provide useful 
information to law enforcement agencies, since revealing sources for the 
information could:
    (i) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures;
    (ii) Result in threats or reprisals against informers by the 
subjects of investigations; and
    (iii) Cause informers to refuse to give full information to criminal 
investigators for fear of having their identities as sources disclosed.
    (7) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires an agency to maintain in its 
records only such information about an individual as is relevant and 
necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be 
accomplished by statute or executive order. The term ``maintain,'' as 
defined in 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(3), includes ``collect'' and 
``disseminate.'' The application of this provision to the systems of 
records could impair the Department's ability to collect and disseminate 
valuable law enforcement information.
    (i) At the time that the Department collects information, it often 
lacks sufficient time to determine whether the information is relevant 
and necessary to accomplish a Treasury Department purpose.
    (ii) In many cases, especially in the early stages of investigation, 
it may be impossible to immediately determine whether information 
collected is relevant and necessary, and information that initially 
appears irrelevant and unnecessary often may, upon further evaluation or 
upon collation with information developed subsequently, prove 
particularly relevant to a law enforcement program.
    (iii) Compliance with the records maintenance criteria listed in the 
foregoing provision would require the periodic up-dating of the 
Department's protective intelligence files to insure that the records 
maintained in the system remain timely and complete.
    (iv) Not all violations of law discovered by the Department fall 
within the investigative jurisdiction of the Department of the Treasury. 
To promote effective law enforcement, the Department will have to 
disclose such violations to other law enforcement agencies, including 
State, local and foreign agencies, that have jurisdiction over the 
offenses to which the information relates. Otherwise, the Department 
might be placed in the position of having to ignore information relating 
to violations of law not within the jurisdiction of the Department of 
the Treasury when that information comes to the Department's attention 
during the collation and analysis of information in its records.
    (8) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(2) requires an agency to collect information to 
the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual 
when the information may result in adverse determinations about an 
individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs. 
The application of this provision to the systems of records would impair 
the Department's ability to collate, analyze, and disseminate 
investigative, intelligence, and enforcement information.
    (i) Most information collected about an individual under criminal 
investigation is obtained from third parties, such as witnesses and 
informants. It is usually not feasible to rely upon the

[[Page 57]]

subject of the investigation as a source for information regarding his 
criminal activities.
    (ii) An attempt to obtain information from the subject of a criminal 
investigation will often alert that individual to the existence of an 
investigation, thereby affording the individual an opportunity to 
attempt to conceal his criminal activities so as to avoid apprehension.
    (iii) In certain instances, the subject of a criminal investigation 
is not required to supply information to criminal investigators as a 
matter of legal duty.
    (iv) During criminal investigations it is often a matter of sound 
investigative procedure to obtain information from a variety of sources 
to verify information already obtained.
    (9) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3) requires an agency to inform each individual 
whom it asks to supply information, on the form that it uses to collect 
the information or on a separate form that the individual can retain, of 
the agency's authority for soliciting the information; whether 
disclosure of information is voluntary or mandatory; the principal 
purposes for which the agency will use the information; the routine uses 
that may be made of the information; and the effects on the individual 
of not providing all or part of the information. The systems of records 
should be exempted from this provision to avoid impairing the 
Department's ability to collect and collate investigative, intelligence, 
and enforcement data.
    (i) Confidential sources or undercover law enforcement officers 
often obtain information under circumstances in which it is necessary to 
keep the true purpose of their actions secret so as not to let the 
subject of the investigation or his or her associates know that a 
criminal investigation is in progress.
    (ii) If it became known that the undercover officer was assisting in 
a criminal investigation, that officer's physical safety could be 
endangered through reprisal, and that officer may not be able to 
continue working on the investigation.
    (iii) Individuals often feel inhibited in talking to a person 
representing a criminal law enforcement agency but are willing to talk 
to a confidential source or undercover officer whom they believe not to 
be involved in law enforcement activities.
    (iv) Providing a confidential source of information with written 
evidence that he or she was a source, as required by this provision, 
could increase the likelihood that the source of information would be 
subject to retaliation by the subject of the investigation.
    (v) Individuals may be contacted during preliminary information 
gathering, surveys, or compliance projects concerning the administration 
of the internal revenue laws before any individual is identified as the 
subject of an investigation. Informing the individual of the matters 
required by this provision would impede or compromise subsequent 
investigations.
    (vi) Finally, application of this provision could result in an 
unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the subject of the 
criminal investigation, particularly where further investigation reveals 
that the subject was not involved in any criminal activity.
    (10) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(5) requires an agency to maintain all records 
it uses in making any determination about any individual with such 
accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably 
necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination.
    (i) Since 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(3) defines ``maintain'' to include 
``collect'' and ``disseminate,'' application of this provision to the 
systems of records would hinder the initial collection of any 
information that could not, at the moment of collection, be determined 
to be accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. Similarly, application 
of this provision would seriously restrict the Department's ability to 
disseminate information pertaining to a possible violation of law to law 
enforcement and regulatory agencies. In collecting information during a 
criminal investigation, it is often impossible or unfeasible to 
determine accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness prior to 
collection of the information. In disseminating information to law 
enforcement and regulatory agencies,

[[Page 58]]

it is often impossible to determine accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or 
completeness prior to dissemination, because the Department may not have 
the expertise with which to make such determinations.
    (ii) Information that may initially appear inaccurate, irrelevant, 
untimely, or incomplete may, when collated and analyzed with other 
available information, become more pertinent as an investigation 
progresses. In addition, application of this provision could seriously 
impede criminal investigators and intelligence analysts in the exercise 
of their judgment in reporting results obtained during criminal 
investigations.
    (iii) Compliance with the records maintenance criteria listed in the 
foregoing provision would require the periodic up-dating of the 
Department's protective intelligence files to insure that the records 
maintained in the system remain timely and complete.
    (11) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(8) requires an agency to make reasonable 
efforts to serve notice on an individual when the agency makes any 
record on the individual available to any person under compulsory legal 
process, when such process becomes a matter of public record. The 
systems of records should be exempted from this provision to avoid 
revealing investigative techniques and procedures outlined in those 
records and to prevent revelation of the existence of an ongoing 
investigation where there is need to keep the existence of the 
investigation secret.
    (12) 5 U.S.C. 552a(g) provides for civil remedies to an individual 
when an agency wrongfully refuses to amend a record or to review a 
request for amendment, when an agency wrongfully refuses to grant access 
to a record, when an agency fails to maintain accurate, relevant, 
timely, and complete records which are used to make a determination 
adverse to the individual, and when an agency fails to comply with any 
other provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a so as to adversely affect the 
individual. The systems of records should be exempted from this 
provision to the extent that the civil remedies may relate to provisions 
of 5 U.S.C. 552a from which these rules exempt the systems of records, 
since there should be no civil remedies for failure to comply with 
provisions from which the Department is exempted. Exemption from this 
provision will also protect the Department from baseless civil court 
actions that might hamper its ability to collate, analyze, and 
disseminate investigative, intelligence, and law enforcement data.
    (e) Specific exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1). (1) Under 5 
U.S.C. 552a(k)(1), the head of any agency may promulgate rules to exempt 
any system of records within the agency from certain provisions of the 
Privacy Act of 1974 to the extent that the system contains information 
subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1). This paragraph applies 
to the following system of records maintained by the Department of the 
Treasury:
    Financial Crimes Enforcement Network:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The Department of the Treasury hereby exempts the system of 
records listed in paragraph (e)(1) of this section from the following 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1): 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3), 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (2), (3) and (4), 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1), 
5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and 5 U.S.C. 552a(f).
    (f) Reasons for exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1). The reason for 
invoking the exemption is to protect material required to be kept secret 
in the interest of national defense or foreign policy pursuant to 
Executive Order 12958 (or successor or prior Executive Order).
    (g) Specific exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). (1) Under 5 
U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the head of any agency may promulgate rules to exempt 
any system of records within the agency from certain provisions of the 
Privacy Act of 1974 if the system is investigatory material compiled for 
law enforcement purposes and for the purposes of assuring the safety of 
individuals protected by the Department pursuant to the provisions of 18 
U.S.C. 3056. This paragraph applies to the following systems of records 
maintained by the Department of the Treasury:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The Department hereby exempts the systems of records listed in 
paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (xiii) of this section from the following 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2): 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3), 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (2), (3), (4), 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1), 5 
U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and 5 U.S.C. 552a(f).
    (h) Reasons for exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). (1) 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3) requires an agency to make accountings of disclosures of a 
record available to the individual named in the record upon his or her 
request. The accountings must state the date, nature, and purpose of 
each disclosure of the record and the name and address of the recipient.
    (i) The application of this provision would impair the ability of 
the Department and of law enforcement agencies outside the Department of 
the Treasury to make effective use of information maintained by the 
Department. Making accountings of disclosures available to the subjects 
of an investigation would alert them to the fact that an agency is 
conducting an investigation into their illegal activities

[[Page 61]]

and could reveal the geographic location of the investigation, the 
nature and purpose of that investigation, and the dates on which that 
investigation was active. Violators possessing such knowledge would be 
able to take measures to avoid detection or apprehension by altering 
their operations, by transferring their illegal activities to other 
geographical areas, or by destroying or concealing evidence that would 
form the basis for detection or apprehension. In the case of a 
delinquent account, such release might enable the subject of the 
investigation to dissipate assets before levy.
    (ii) Providing accountings to the subjects of investigations would 
alert them to the fact that the Department has information regarding 
their illegal activities and could inform them of the general nature of 
that information.
    (2) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(2), (3) and (5) grant 
individuals access to records pertaining to them. The application of 
these provisions to the systems of records would compromise the 
Department's ability to utilize and provide useful tactical and 
strategic information to law enforcement agencies.
    (i) Permitting access to records contained in the systems of records 
would provide individuals with information concerning the nature of any 
current investigations and would enable them to avoid detection or 
apprehension by:
    (A) discovering the facts that would form the basis for their 
detection or apprehension;
    (B) enabling them to destroy or alter evidence of illegal conduct 
that would form the basis for their detection or apprehension, and
    (C) using knowledge that investigators had reason to believe that a 
violation of law was about to be committed, to delay the commission of 
the violation or commit it at a location that might not be under 
surveillance.
    (ii) Permitting access to either on-going or closed investigative 
files would also reveal investigative techniques and procedures, the 
knowledge of which could enable individuals planning non-criminal acts 
to structure their operations so as to avoid detection or apprehension.
    (iii) Permitting access to investigative files and records could, 
moreover, disclose the identity of confidential sources and informers 
and the nature of the information supplied and thereby endanger the 
physical safety of those sources by exposing them to possible reprisals 
for having provided the information. Confidential sources and informers 
might refuse to provide investigators with valuable information unless 
they believed that their identities would not be revealed through 
disclosure of their names or the nature of the information they 
supplied.Loss of access to such sources would seriously impair the 
Department's ability to carry out its mandate.
    (iv) Furthermore, providing access to records contained in the 
systems of records could reveal the identities of undercover law 
enforcement officers or other persons who compiled information regarding 
the individual's illegal activities and thereby endanger the physical 
safety of those undercover officers, persons, or their families by 
exposing them to possible reprisals.
    (v) By compromising the law enforcement value of the systems of 
records for the reasons outlined in paragraphs (h)(2)(i) through (iv) of 
this section, permitting access in keeping with these provisions would 
discourage other law enforcement and regulatory agencies, foreign and 
domestic, from freely sharing information with the Department and thus 
would restrict the Department's access to information necessary to 
accomplish its mission most effectively.
    (vi) Finally, the dissemination of certain information that the 
Department may maintain in the systems of records is restricted by law.
    (3) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2), (3) and (4), (e)(4)(H), and (f)(4) permit 
an individual to request amendment of a record pertaining to him or her 
and require the agency either to amend the record, or to note the 
disputed portion of the record and to provide a copy of the individual's 
statement of disagreement with the agency's refusal to amend a record to 
persons or other agencies to whom the record is thereafter disclosed. 
Since these provisions depend on the individual's having access to his

[[Page 62]]

or her records, and since these rules exempt the systems of records from 
the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a relating to access to records, for the 
reasons set out in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, these provisions 
should not apply to the systems of records.
    (4) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires an agency to maintain in its 
records only such information about an individual as is relevant and 
necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be 
accomplished by statute or executive order. The term ``maintain,'' as 
defined in 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(3), includes ``collect'' and 
``disseminate.'' The application of this provision to the system of 
records could impair the Department's ability to collect, utilize and 
disseminate valuable law enforcement information.
    (i) At the time that the Department collects information, it often 
lacks sufficient time to determine whether the information is relevant 
and necessary to accomplish a Department purpose.
    (ii) In many cases, especially in the early stages of investigation, 
it may be impossible immediately to determine whether information 
collected is relevant and necessary, and information that initially 
appears irrelevant and unnecessary often may, upon further evaluation or 
upon collation with information developed subsequently, prove 
particularly relevant to a law enforcement program.
    (iii) Not all violations of law discovered by the Department 
analysts fall within the investigative jurisdiction of the Department of 
the Treasury. To promote effective law enforcement, the Department will 
have to disclose such violations to other law enforcement agencies, 
including State, local and foreign agencies that have jurisdiction over 
the offenses to which the information relates. Otherwise, the Department 
might be placed in the position of having to ignore information relating 
to violations of law not within the jurisdiction of the Department of 
the Treasury when that information comes to the Department's attention 
during the collation and analysis of information in its records.
    (5) U.S.C. 552a (e)(4)(G) and (f)(1) enable individuals to inquire 
whether a system of records contains records pertaining to them. 
Application of these provisions to the systems of records would allow 
individuals to learn whether they have been identified as suspects or 
subjects of investigation. As further described in the following 
paragraph, access to such knowledge would impair the Department's 
ability to carry out its mission, since individuals could:
    (i) Take steps to avoid detection;
    (ii) Inform associates that an investigation is in progress;
    (iii) Learn the nature of the investigation;
    (iv) Learn whether they are only suspects or identified as law 
violators;
    (v) Begin, continue, or resume illegal conduct upon learning that 
they are not identified in the system of records; or
    (vi) Destroy evidence needed to prove the violation.
    (6) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(I) requires an agency to publish a general 
notice listing the categories of sources for information contained in a 
system of records. The application of this provision to the systems of 
records could compromise the Department's ability to complete or 
continue investigations or to provide useful information to law 
enforcement agencies, since revealing sources for the information could:
    (i) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures;
    (ii) Result in threats or reprisals against informers by the 
subjects of investigations; and
    (iii) Cause informers to refuse to give full information to 
investigators for fear of having their identities as sources disclosed.
    (i) Specific exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(3). (1) The head of 
any agency may promulgate rules to exempt any system of records within 
the agency from certain provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 if it is 
maintained in connection with providing protective intelligence to the 
President of the United States or other individuals pursuant to section 
3056 of Title 18. This paragraph applies to the following system of 
records maintained by the Department which contains material relating to 
criminal investigations concerned with the enforcement of criminal 
statutes involving the security of persons and property. Further, this

[[Page 63]]

system contains records described in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) including, but not 
limited to, classified material and investigatory material compiled for 
law enforcement purposes, for which exemption is claimed under 5 U.S.C. 
552a(k)(3):

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The Department hereby exempts the system of records listed in 
(i)(1) of this section from the following provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a, 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(3): 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), 5 U.S.C. 
552a(d)(1), (2), (3),and (4), 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1), 5 U.S.C. 
552a(e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and 5 U.S.C. 552a(f).
    (j) Reasons for exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(3). (1) 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3) requires an agency to make accountings of disclosures of a 
record available to the individual named in the record upon his or her 
request. The accountings must state the date, nature, and purpose of 
each disclosure of the record and the name and address of the recipient.
    (i) The application of this provision would impair the ability of 
law enforcement agencies outside the Department of the Treasury to make 
effective use of information provided by the Department. Making 
accountings of disclosures available to the subjects of an investigation 
would alert them to the fact that another agency is conducting an 
investigation into their criminal activities and could reveal the 
geographic location of the other agency's investigation, the nature and 
purpose of that investigation, and the dates on which the investigation 
was active. Violators possessing such knowledge would be able to take 
measures to avoid detection or apprehension by altering their 
operations, by transferring their criminal activities to other 
geographical areas, or by destroying or concealing evidence that would 
form the basis for arrest.
    (ii) Providing accountings to the subjects of investigations would 
alert them to the fact that the Department has information regarding 
their criminal activities and could inform them of the general nature of 
that information. Access to such information could reveal the operation 
of the Department's information-gathering and analysis systems and 
permit violators to take steps to avoid detection or apprehension.
    (iii) The release of such information to the subject of a protective 
intelligence file would provide significant information concerning the 
nature and scope of an investigation, and could result in impeding or 
compromising the efforts of Department personnel to detect persons 
suspected of criminal activities or to collect information necessary for 
the proper evaluation of persons considered to be of protective 
interest.
    (2) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(2), (3) and (5) grant 
individuals access to records pertaining to them. The application of 
these provisions to the systems of records would compromise the 
Department's ability to provide useful tactical and strategic 
information to law enforcement agencies.
    (i) Permitting access to records contained in the systems of records 
would provide individuals with information concerning the nature of any 
current investigations and would enable them to avoid detection or 
apprehension by:
    (A) Discovering the facts that would form the basis for their 
arrest;
    (B) Enabling them to destroy or alter evidence of criminal conduct 
that would form the basis for their arrest, and
    (C) Using knowledge that criminal investigators had reason to 
believe that a crime was about to be committed, to delay the commission 
of the crime or commit it at a location that might not be under 
surveillance.
    (ii) Permitting access to either on-going or closed investigative 
files would also reveal investigative techniques and procedures, the 
knowledge of which could enable individuals planning crimes to structure 
their operations so as to avoid detection or apprehension.
    (iii) Permitting access to investigative files and records could, 
moreover, disclose the identity of confidential sources, and informers 
and the nature of the information supplied and thereby endanger the 
physical safety of

[[Page 64]]

those sources by exposing them to possible reprisals for having provided 
the information. Confidential sources and informers might refuse to 
provide criminal investigators with valuable information unless they 
believed that their identities would not be revealed through disclosure 
of their names or the nature of the information they supplied. Loss of 
access to such sources would seriously impair the Department's ability 
to carry out its mandate.
    (iv) Furthermore, providing access to records contained in the 
systems of records could reveal the identities of undercover law 
enforcement officers who compiled information regarding the individual's 
criminal activities and thereby endanger the physical safety of those 
undercover officers or their families by exposing them to possible 
reprisals.
    (v) By compromising the law enforcement value of the systems of 
records for the reasons outlined in paragraphs (j)(2)(i) through (iv) of 
this section, permitting access in keeping with these provisions would 
discourage other law enforcement and regulatory agencies, foreign and 
domestic, from freely sharing information with the Department and thus 
would restrict the Department's access to information necessary to 
accomplish its mission most effectively.
    (vi) Limitation on access to the materials contained in the 
protective intelligence files is considered necessary to the 
preservation of the utility of intelligence files and in safeguarding 
those persons the Department is authorized to protect. Access to the 
protective intelligence files could adversely affect the quality of 
information available to the Department; compromise confidential 
sources; hinder the ability of the Department to keep track of persons 
of protective interest; and interfere with the Department's protective 
intelligence activities by individuals gaining access to protective 
intelligence files.
    (vii) Many of the persons on whom records are maintained in the 
protective intelligence files suffer from mental aberrations. Knowledge 
of their condition and progress comes from authorities, family members 
and witnesses. Many times this information comes to the Department as a 
result of two-party conversations where it would be impossible to hide 
the identity of informants. Sources of information must be developed, 
questions asked and answers recorded. Trust must be extended and 
guarantees of confidentiality and anonymity must be maintained. Allowing 
access of information of this kind to individuals who are the subjects 
of protective interest may well lead to violence directed against an 
informant by a mentally disturbed individual.
    (viii) Finally, the dissemination of certain information that the 
Department may maintain in the systems of records is restricted by law.
    (3) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2), (3) and (4), (e)(4)(H), and (f)(4) permit 
an individual to request amendment of a record pertaining to him or her 
and require the agency either to amend the record, or to note the 
disputed portion of the record and to provide a copy of the individual's 
statement of disagreement with the agency's refusal to amend a record to 
persons or other agencies to whom the record is thereafter disclosed. 
Since these provisions depend on the individual's having access to his 
or her records, and since these rules exempt the systems of records from 
the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a relating to access to records, for the 
reasons set out in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, these provisions 
should not apply to the systems of records.
    (4) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires an agency to maintain in its 
records only such information about an individual as is relevant and 
necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be 
accomplished by statute or executive order. The term ``maintain,'' as 
defined in 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(3), includes ``collect'' and 
``disseminate.'' The application of this provision to the systems of 
records could impair the Department's ability to collect and disseminate 
valuable law enforcement information.
    (i) At the time that the Department collects information, it often 
lacks sufficient time to determine whether the information is relevant 
and necessary to accomplish a Department purpose.

[[Page 65]]

    (ii) In many cases, especially in the early stages of investigation, 
it may be impossible immediately to determine whether information 
collected is relevant and necessary, and information that initially 
appears irrelevant and unnecessary often may, upon further evaluation or 
upon collation with information developed subsequently, prove 
particularly relevant to a law enforcement program.
    (iii) Not all violations of law discovered by the Department 
analysts fall within the scope of the protective intelligence 
jurisdiction of the Department of the Treasury. To promote effective law 
enforcement, the Department will have to disclose such violations to 
other law enforcement agencies, including State, local and foreign 
agencies, that have jurisdiction over the offenses to which the 
information relates. Otherwise, the Department might be placed in the 
position of having to ignore information relating to violations of law 
not within the jurisdiction of the Department of the Treasury when that 
information comes to the Department's attention during the collation and 
analysis of information in its records.
    (5) U.S.C. 552a (e)(4)(G) and (f)(1) enable individuals to inquire 
whether a system of records contains records pertaining to them. 
Application of these provisions to the systems of records would allow 
individuals to learn whether they have been identified as suspects or 
subjects of investigation. As further described in the following 
paragraph, access to such knowledge would impair the Department's 
ability to carry out its mission to safeguard those persons the 
Department is authorized to protect, since individuals could:
    (i) Take steps to avoid detection;
    (ii) Inform associates that an investigation is in progress;
    (iii) Learn the nature of the investigation;
    (iv) Learn whether they are only suspects or identified as law 
violators;
    (v) Begin, continue, or resume illegal conduct upon learning that 
they are not identified in the system of records; or
    (vi) Destroy evidence needed to prove the violation.
    (6) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(I) requires an agency to publish a general 
notice listing the categories of sources for information contained in a 
system of records. The application of this provision to the systems of 
records could compromise the Department's ability to provide useful 
information to law enforcement agencies, since revealing sources for the 
information could:
    (i) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures;
    (ii) Result in threats or reprisals against informers by the 
subject(s) of a protective intelligence file; and
    (iii) Cause informers to refuse to give full information to criminal 
investigators for fear of having their identities as sources disclosed.
    (k) Specific exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(4). (1) Under 5 
U.S.C. 552a(k)(4), the head of any agency may promulgate rules to exempt 
any system of records within the agency from certain provisions of the 
Privacy Act of 1974 if the system is required by statute to be 
maintained and used solely as statistical records. This paragraph 
applies to the following system of records maintained by the Department, 
for which exemption is claimed under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(4):

                                             Individual Tax Returns.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The Department hereby exempts the system of records listed in 
paragraph (k)(1) of this section from the following provisions of 5 
U.S.C. 552a, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(4): 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), 5 
U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (2), (3), and (4), 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1), 5 U.S.C. 
552a(e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and 5 U.S.C. 552a(f).
    (3) The system of records is maintained under section 6108 of the 
Internal Revenue Code, which provides that ``the Secretary or his 
delegate shall prepare and publish annually statistics reasonably 
available with respect to the operation of the income tax laws, 
including classifications of taxpayers and of income, the amounts 
allowed as deductions, exemptions, and credits, and any other facts 
deemed pertinent and valuable.''

[[Page 66]]

    (l) Reasons for exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(4). The reason for 
exempting the system of records is that disclosure of statistical 
records (including release of accounting for disclosures) would in most 
instances be of no benefit to a particular individual since the records 
do not have a direct effect on a given individual.
    (m) Specific exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5). (1) Under 5 
U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), the head of any agency may promulgate rules to exempt 
any system of records within the agency from certain provisions of the 
Privacy Act of 1974 if the system is investigatory material compiled 
solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, and 
qualifications for Federal civilian employment or access to classified 
information, but only to the extent that the disclosure of such material 
would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the 
Government under an express promise that the identity of the source 
would be held in confidence, or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an 
implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in 
confidence. Thus to the extent that the records in this system can be 
disclosed without revealing the identity of a confidential source, they

    (xii) Office of Thrift Supervision
    (xiii) Financial Crimes Enforcement Network:
    (2) The Department hereby exempts the systems of records listed in 
paragraph (m)(1)(i) through (xiii) of this section from the following 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5): 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3), 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (2), (3), and (4), 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1), 
5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and 5 U.S.C. 552a(f).
    (n) Reasons for exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5). (1) The 
sections of 5 U.S.C. 552a from which the systems of records are exempt 
include in general those providing for individuals' access to or 
amendment of records. When such access or amendment would cause the 
identity of a confidential source to be revealed, it would impair the 
future ability of the Department to compile investigatory material for 
the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications 
for Federal civilian employment, Federal contracts, or access to 
classified information. In addition, the systems shall be exempt from 5 
U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) which requires that an agency maintain in its records 
only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary 
to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be accomplished by 
statute or executive order. The Department believes that to fulfill the 
requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) would unduly restrict the agency in 
its information gathering inasmuch as it is often not until

[[Page 67]]

well after the investigation that it is possible to determine the 
relevance and necessity of particular information.
    (2) If any investigatory material contained in the above-named 
systems becomes involved in criminal or civil matters, exemptions of 
such material under 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2) or (k)(2) is hereby claimed.
    (o) Exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6). (1) Under 5 U.S.C. 
552a(k)(6), the head of any agency may promulgate rules to exempt any 
system of records that is testing or examination material used solely to 
determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the 
Federal service the disclosure of which would compromise the objectivity 
or fairness of the testing or examination process. This paragraph 
applies to the following system of records maintained by the Department, 
for which exemption is claimed under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6):
    Internal Revenue Service:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  Number                             System name
------------------------------------------------------------------------
IRS 36.008................................  Recruiting, Examining and
                                             Placement Records.
DO .306...................................  TIGTA Recruiting and
                                             Placement.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The Department hereby exempts the system of records listed in 
paragraph (o)(1) of this section from the following provisions of 5 
U.S.C. 552a, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6): 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), 5 
U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (2), (3), and (4), 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1), 5 U.S.C. 
552a(e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and 5 U.S.C. 552a(f).
    (p) Reasons for exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6). The reason for 
exempting the system of records is that disclosure of the material in 
the system would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the 
examination process.
    (q) Exempt information included in another system. Any information 
from a system of records for which an exemption is claimed under 5 
U.S.C. 552a(j) or (k) which is also included in another system of 
records retains the same exempt status such information has in the 
system for which such exemption is claimed.

    8. Verification of identity. An individual seeking notification or 
access to records, or seeking to amend a record, must satisfy one of the 
following identification requirements before action will be taken by the 
Departmental Offices on any such request:
    (i) An individual seeking notification or access to records in 
person, or seeking to amend a record in person, may establish identity 
by the presentation of a single official document bearing a photograph 
(such as a passport or identification badge) or by the presentation of 
two items of identification which do not bear a photograph but do bear 
both a name and signature (such as a driver's license or credit card).
    (ii) An individual seeking notification or access to records by 
mail, or seeking to amend a record by mail, may establish identity by a 
signature, address, and one other identifier such as a photocopy of a 
driver's license or other official document bearing the individual's 
signature.
    (iii) Notwithstanding subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this 
subparagraph, an individual seeking notification or access to records by 
mail or in person, or seeking to amend a record by mail or in person, 
who so desires, may establish identity by providing a notarized 
statement, swearing or affirming to such individual's identity and to

false pretenses.
Notwithstanding subdivision (i), (ii), or (iii) of this subparagraph, a 
designated official may require additional proof of an individual's 
identity before action will be taken on any request, if such official 
determines that it is necessary to protect against unauthorized 
disclosure of information in a particular case. In addition, a parent of 
any minor or a legal guardian of any individual will be required to 
provide adequate proof of legal relationship before such person may act 
on behalf of such minor or such individual.

       Appendix B to Subpart C of Part 1--Internal Revenue Service

    1. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to set forth the 
procedures that have been established by the Internal Revenue Service 
for individuals to exercise their rights under the Privacy Act of 1974 
(88 Stat. 1896) with respect to systems of records maintained by the 
Internal Revenue Service, including the Office of the Chief Counsel. The 
procedures contained in this section are to be promulgated under the 
authority of 5 U.S.C. 552a(f). The procedures contained in this section 
relate to the following:
    (a) The procedures whereby an individual can be notified in response 
to a request if a system of records named by the individual contains a 
record pertaining to such individual (5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(1)).
    (b) The procedures governing reasonable times, places, and 
requirements for identifying an individual who requests a record of 
information pertaining to such individual before the Internal Revenue 
Service will make the record or information available to the individual 
(5 U.S.C. 552a (f)(2)).
    (c) The procedures for the disclosure to an individual upon a 
request of a record of information pertaining to such individual, 
including special procedures for the disclosure

[[Page 69]]

to an individual of medical records, including psychological records. (5 
U.S.C. 552a (f)(3)).
    (d) The procedures for reviewing a request from an individual 
concerning the amendment of any record or information pertaining to the 
individual, for making a determination on the request, for an appeal 
within the Internal Revenue Service of an initial adverse agency 
determination, and for whatever additional means may be necessary for 
individuals to be able to exercise fully their right under 5 U.S.C. 552a 
(5 U.S.C. 552a (f)(4)).
    Any individual seeking to determine whether a system of records 
maintained by any office of the Internal Revenue Service contains a 
record or information pertaining to such individual, or seeking access 
to, or amendment of, such a record, must comply fully with the 
applicable procedure contained in paragraph (3) or (4) of this section 
before the Internal Revenue Service will act on the request. Neither the 
notification and access (or accounting of disclosures) procedures under 
paragraph (3) of this section nor the amendment procedures under 
paragraph (4) of this section are applicable to (i) systems of records 
exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j) and (k), (ii) information 
compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding (see 
5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(5)), or (iii) information pertaining to an individual 
which is contained in, and inseparable from, another individual's 
record.
    2. Access to and amendment of tax records. The provisions of the 
Privacy Act of 1974 may not be used by an individual to amend or correct 
any tax record. The determination of liability for taxes imposed by the 
Internal Revenue Service Code, the collection of such taxes, and the 
payment (including credits or refunds of overpayments) of such taxes are 
governed by the provisions of the Internal Revenue Service Code and by 
the procedural rules of the Internal Revenue Service. These provisions 
set forth the established procedures governing the determination of 
liability for tax, the collection of such taxes, and the payment 
(including credits or refunds of overpayments) of such taxes. In 
addition, these provisions set forth the procedures (including 
procedures for judicial review) for resolving disputes between taxpayers 
and the Internal Revenue Service involving the amount of tax owed, or 
the payment or collection of such tax. These procedures are the 
exclusive means available to an individual to contest the amount of any 
liability for tax or the payment or collection thereof. See, for 
example, 26 CFR 601.103 for summary of general tax procedures. 
Individuals are advised that Internal Revenue Service procedures permit 
the examination of tax records during the course of an investigation, 
audit, or collection activity. Accordingly, individuals should contact 
the Internal Revenue Service employee conducting an audit or effecting 
the collection of tax liabilities to gain access to such records, rather 
than seeking access under the provisions of the Privacy Act. Where, on 
the other hand, an individual desires information or records not in 
connection with an investigation, audit, or collection activity, the 
individual may follow these procedures.
    3. Procedures for access to records--(a) In general. This paragraph 
sets forth the procedure whereby an individual can be notified in 
response to a request if a system of records named by the individual 
which is maintained by the Internal Revenue Service contains a record 
pertaining to such individual. In addition, this paragraph sets forth 
the procedure for the disclosure to an individual upon a request of a 
record or information pertaining to such individual, including the 
procedures for verifying the identity of the individual before the 
Internal Revenue Service will make a record available, and the procedure 
for requesting an accounting of disclosures of such records. An 
individual seeking to determine whether a particular system of records 
contains a record or records pertaining to such individual and seeking 
access to such records (or seeking an accounting of disclosures of such 
records) shall make a request for notification and access (or a request 
for an accounting of disclosures) in accordance with the rules provided 
in paragraph 3(b) of this section.
    (b) Form of request for notification and access or request for an 
accounting of disclosures. (i) A request for notification and access (or 
request for an accounting of disclosures) shall be made in writing and 
shall be signed by the person making the request.
    (ii) Such request shall be clearly marked, ``Request for 
notification and access,'' or ``Request for accounting of disclosures.''
    (iii) Such a request shall contain a statement that it is being made 
under the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974.
    (iv) Such request shall contain the name and address of the 
individual making the request. In addition, if a particular system 
employs an individual's social security number as an essential means of 
accessing the system, the request must include the individual's social 
security number. In the case of a record maintained in the name of two 
or more individuals (e.g., husband and wife), the request shall contain 
the names, addresses, and social security numbers (if necessary) of both 
individuals.
    (v) Such request shall specify the name and location of the 
particular system of records (as set forth in the Notice of Systems) for 
which the individual is seeking notification and access (or an 
accounting of disclosures), and the title and business address of the 
official designated in the access section for the particular system (as 
set forth in the Notice of Systems). In the case of two or more systems 
of records which are under the control

[[Page 70]]

of the same designated official at the same systems location, a single 
request may be made for such systems. In the case of two or more systems 
of records which are not in the control of the same designated official 
at the same systems location, a separate request must be made for each 
such system.
    (vi) If an individual wishes to limit a request for notification and 
access to a particular record or records, the request should identify 
the particular record. In the absence of a statement to the contrary, a 
request for notification and access for a particular system of records 
shall be considered to be limited to records which are currently 
maintained by the designated official at the systems location specified 
in the request.
    (vii) If such request is seeking notification and access to material 
maintained in a system of records which is exempt from disclosure and 
access under 5 U.S.C. 552a (k)(2), the individual making the request 
must establish that such individual has been denied a right, privilege, 
or benefit that such individual would otherwise be entitled to under 
Federal law as a result of the maintenance of such material.
    (viii) Such request shall state whether the individual wishes to 
inspect the record in person, or desires to have a copy made and 
furnished without first inspecting it. If the individual desires to have 
a copy made, the request must include an agreement to pay the fee for 
duplication ultimately determined to be due. If the individual does not 
wish to inspect a record, but merely wishes to be notified whether a 
particular system or records contains a record pertaining to such 
individual, the request should so state.
    (c) Time and place for making a request. A request for notification 
and access to records under the Privacy Act (or a request for accounting 
of disclosures) shall be addressed to or delivered in person to the 
office of the official designated in the access section for the 
particular system of records for which the individual is seeking 
notification and access (or an accounting of disclosures). The title and 
office address of such official is set forth for each system of records 
in the Notice of Systems of Records. A request delivered to an office in 
person must be delivered during the regular office hours of that office.
    (d) Sample request for notification and access to records. The 
following are sample requests for notification and access to records 
which will satisfy the requirements of this paragraph:

         Request for Notification and Access to Records by Mail

    I, John Doe, of 100 Main Street, Boston, MA 02108 (soc. sec. num. 
000-00-0000) request under the Privacy Act of 1974 that the following 
system of records be examined and that I be furnished with a copy of any 
record (or a specified record) contained therein pertaining to me. I 
agree that I will pay the fees ultimately determined to be due for 
duplication of such record. I have enclosed the necessary information.

                                                                John Doe

        Request for Notification and Access to Records in Person

    I, John Doe, of 100 Main Street, Boston, MA 02108 (soc. sec. num. 
000-00-0000) request under the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, 
that the following system of records be examined and that I be granted 
access in person to inspect any record (or a specified record) contained 
therein pertaining to me. I have enclosed the necessary identification.

System Name:
System Location:
Designated Official:

________________________________________________________________________
                                                                John Doe

    (e) Processing a request for notification and access to records or a 
request for an accounting of disclosures. (i) If a request for 
notification and access (or request for an accounting of disclosures) 
omits any information which is essential to processing the request, the 
request will not be acted upon and the individual making the request 
will be promptly advised of the additional information which must be 
submitted before the request can be processed.
    (ii) Within 30 days (not including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal 
public holidays) after the receipt of a request for notification and 
access (or a request for an accounting of disclosures), to a particular 
system of records by the designated official for such system, a 
determination will be made as to whether the particular system of 
records is exempt from the notification and access provisions of the 
Privacy Act, and if such system is not exempt, whether it does or does 
not contain a record pertaining to the individual making the request. If 
a determination cannot be made within 30 days, the individual will be 
notified of the delay, the reasons therefor, and the approximate time 
required to make a determination. If it is determined by the designated 
official that the particular system of records is exempt from the 
notification and access provisions of the Privacy Act, the individual 
making the request will be notified of the provisions of the Privacy Act 
under which the exemption is claimed. On the other hand, if it is 
determined by the designated official that the particular system of 
records is not exempted from the notification and access provisions of 
the Privacy Act and that such system contains a record pertaining to the 
individual

[[Page 71]]

making the request, the individual will be notified of the time and 
place where inspection may be made. If an individual has not requested 
that access be granted to inspect the record in person, but merely 
requests that a copy of the record be furnished, or if it is determined 
by the designated official that the granting of access to inspect a 
record in person is not feasible in a particular case, then the 
designated official will furnish a copy of the record with the 
notification, or if a copy cannot be furnished at such time, a statement 
indicating the approximate time such copy will be furnished. If the 
request is for an accounting of disclosures from a system of records 
which is not exempt from the accounting of disclosure provisions of the 
Privacy Act, the individual will be furnished with an accounting of such 
disclosures.
    (f) Granting of access. Normally, an individual will be granted 
access to inspect a record in person within 30 days (excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt for a 
request for notification and access by the designated official. If 
access cannot be granted within 30 days, the notification will state the 
reasons for the delay and the approximate time such access will be 
granted. An individual wishing to inspect a record may be accompanied by 
another person of his choosing. Both the individual seeking access and 
the individual accompanying him may be required to sign a form supplied 
by the IRS indicating that the Service is authorized to disclose or 
discuss the contents of the record in the presence of both individuals. 
See 26 CFR 601.502 for requirements to be met by taxpayer's 
representatives in order to discuss the contents of any tax records.
    (g) Medical records. When access is requested to medical records 
(including psychological records), the designated official may determine 
that release of such records will be made only to a physician designated 
by the individual to have access to such records.
    (h) Verification of identity. An individual seeking notification or 
access to records, or seeking to amend a record, must satisfy one of the 
following identification requirements before action will be taken by the 
IRS on any such request:
    (i) An individual seeking notification or access to records in 
person, or seeking to amend a record in person, may establish identity 
by the presentation of a single document bearing a photograph (such as a 
passport or identification badge) or by the presentation of two items of 
identification which do not bear a photograph but do bear both a name 
and signature (such as a driver's license or credit card).
    (ii) An individual seeking notification or access to records by 
mail, or seeking to amend a record by mail, may establish identity by a 
signature, address, and one other identifier such as a photocopy of a 
driver's license or other document bearing the individual's signature.
    (iii) Notwithstanding subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this 
subparagraph, an individual seeking notification or access to records by 
mail or in person, or seeking to amend a record by mail or in person, 
who so desires, may establish identity by providing a notarized 
statement, swearing or affirming to such individual's identity and to 
the fact that the individual understands the penalties provided in 5 
U.S.C. 552a(i)(3) for requesting or obtaining access to records under 
false pretenses.
    (iv) Notwithstanding subdivisions (i), (ii), or (iii) of this 
subparagraph, a designated official may require additional proof of an 
individual's identity before action will be taken on any request if such 
official determines that it is necessary to protect unauthorized 
disclosure of information in a particular case. In addition, a parent of 
any minor or a legal guardian of any individual will be required to 
provide adequate proof of legal relationship before such person may act 
on behalf of such minor or such individual.
    (i) Fees. The fee for costs required of the IRS in copying records 
pursuant to this paragraph is $0.15 per page. However, no fee will be 
charged if the aggregate costs required of the IRS in copying records is 
less than $3.00. If an individual who has requested access to inspect a 
record in person is denied such access by the designated official 
because it would not be feasible in a particular case, copies of such 
record will be furnished to the individual without payment of the fees 
otherwise required under this subparagraph. If the IRS estimates that 
the total fees for costs incurred in complying with a request for copies 
of records will amount to $50 or more, the individual making the request 
may be required to enter into a contract for the payment of the actual 
fees with respect to the request before the Service will furnish the 
copies requested. Payment of fees for copies of records should be made 
by check or money order payable to the Internal Revenue Service.
    4. Procedures for amendment of records. (a) In general. This 
paragraph sets forth the procedures for reviewing a request from an 
individual concerning the amendment of any record or information 
pertaining to such individual, for making a determination on the 
request, for making an appeal within the IRS of an initial adverse 
determination, and for judicial review of a final determination.
    (b) Amendment of record. Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2), an individual 
who has been granted access to a record pertaining to such individual 
may, after inspecting the record, request that the record be amended to 
make any correction of any portion thereof which

[[Page 72]]

the individual believes is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. 
An individual may seek to amend a record in accordance with the rules 
provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. See paragraph (b) of this 
section for prohibition against amendment of tax records.
    (c) Form of request for amendment of record. (i) A request for 
amendment of a record shall be in writing and shall be signed by the 
individual making the request.
    (ii) Such request shall be clearly marked ``Request for amendment of 
record.''
    (iii) Such request shall contain a statement that it is being made 
under the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974.
    (iv) Such request shall contain the name and address of the 
individual making the request. In addition, if a particular system 
employs an individual's social security number as an essential means of 
accessing the system, the request must include the individual's social 
security number. In the case of a record maintained in the name of two 
or more individuals (e.g., husband and wife), the request shall contain 
the names, addresses, and social security numbers (if necessary) of both 
individuals.
    (v) Such request shall specify the name and location of the system 
of records (as set forth in the Notice of Systems) in which such record 
is maintained, and the title and business address of the official 
designated in the access section for such system (as set forth in the 
Notice of Systems).
    (vi) Such request shall specify the particular record in the system 
which the individual is seeking to amend.
    (vii) Such request shall clearly state the specific changes which 
the individual wishes to make in the record and a concise explanation of 
the reasons for the changes. If the individual wishes to correct or add 
any information, the request shall contain specific language making the 
desired correction or addition.
    (d) Time and place for making request. A request to amend a record 
under the Privacy Act shall be addressed to or delivered in person to 
the office of the official designated in the access section for the 
particular system of records. The title and office address of such 
official is set forth for each system of records in the Notice of 
Systems of Records. A request delivered to an office in person must be 
delivered during the regular office hours of that office.
    (e) Processing a request for amendment of a record. (i) Within 10 
days (not including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after 
the receipt of a request to amend a record by the designated official, 
the individual will be sent a written acknowledgement that will state 
that the request has been received, that action is being taken thereon, 
and that the individual will be notified within 30 days (not including 
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of the 
request whether the requested amendments will or will not be made. If a 
request for amendment of a record omits any information which is 
essential to processing the request, the request will not be acted upon 
and the individual making the request will be promptly advised on the 
additional information which must be submitted before the request can be 
processed.
    (ii) Within 30 days (not including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal 
public holidays) after the receipt of a request to amend a record by the 
designated official, a determination will be made as to whether to grant 
the request in whole or part. The individual will then be notified in 
writing of the determination. If a determination cannot be made within 
30 days, the individual will be notified in writing within such time of 
the reasons for the delay and the approximate time required to make a 
determination. If it is determined by the designated official that the 
request will be granted, the requested changes will be made in the 
record and the individual will be notified of the changes. In addition, 
to the extent an accounting was maintained, all prior recipients of such 
record will be notified of the changes. Upon request, an individual will 
be furnished with a copy of the record, as amended, subject to the 
payment of the appropriate fees. On the other hand, if it is determined 
by the designated official that the request, or any portion thereof, 
will not be granted, the individual will be notified in writing of the 
adverse determination. The notification of an adverse determination will 
set forth the reasons for refusal to amend the record. In addition, the 
notification will contain a statement informing the individual of such 
individual's right to request an independent review of the adverse 
determination by a reviewing officer in the national office of the IRS 
and the procedures for requesting such a review.
    (f) Administrative review of adverse determination. Under 5 U.S.C. 
552a (d)(3), an individual who disagrees with the refusal of the agency 
to amend a record may, within 35 days of being notified of the adverse 
determination, request an independent review of such refusal by a 
reviewing officer in the national office of the IRS. The reviewing 
officer for the IRS is the Commission of Internal Revenue, the Deputy 
Commissioner, or an Assistant Commissioner. In the case of an adverse 
determination relating to a system of records maintained by the Office 
of General Counsel for the IRS, the reviewing officer is the Chief 
Counsel or his delegate. An individual seeking a review of an adverse 
determination shall make a request for review in accordance with the 
rules provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this section.
    (g) Form of request for review. (i) A request for review of an 
adverse determination shall

[[Page 73]]

adverse determination''.
    (iii) Such request shall contain a statement that it is being made 
under the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974.
    (iv) Such request shall contain the name and address of the 
individual making the request. In addition, if a particular system 
employs an individual's social security number as an essential means of 
accessing the system, the request must include the individual's social 
security number. In the case of a record maintained in the name of two 
or more individuals (e.g. husband and wife), the request shall contain 
the names, addresses, and social security numbers (if necessary) of both 
individuals.
    (v) Such request shall specify the particular record which the 
individual is seeking to amend, the name and location of the system of 
records (as set forth in the Notice of Systems) in which such record is 
maintained, and the title and business address of the designated 
official for such system (as set forth in the Notice of Systems).
    (vi) Such request shall include the date of the initial request for 
amendment of the record, and the date of the letter notifying the 
individual of the initial adverse determination with respect to such 
request.
    (vii) such request shall clearly state the specific changes which 
the individual wishes to make in the record and a concise explanation of 
the reasons for the changes. If the individual wishes to correct or add 
any information, the request shall contain specific language making the

    (h) Time and place for making the request. A request for review of 
an adverse determination under the Privacy Act shall be addressed to or

OP:EX:D Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, 
Washington, DC 20224. A request for review of an adverse determination 
will be promptly referred by the Director, Office of Disclosure to the 
appropriate reviewing officer for his review and final determination.
    (i) Processing a request for review of adverse determination. Within 
30 days (not including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) 
after the receipt of a request for review of an adverse determination by 
the appropriate reviewing officer, the reviewing officer will review the 
initial adverse determination, make a final determination whether to 
grant the request to amend the record in whole or in part, and notify 
the individual in writing of the final determination. If a final 
determination cannot be made within 30 days, the Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue may extend such 30-day period. The individual will be 
notified in writing within the 30 day period of the cause for the delay 
and the approximate time required to make a final determination. If it 
is determined by the reviewing officer that the request to amend the 
record will be granted, the reviewing officer will cause the requested 
changes to be made and the individual will be so notified. Upon request, 
an individual will be furnished with a copy of the record as amended 
subject to the payment of appropriate fees. On the other hand, if it is 
determined by the reviewing officer that the request to amend the 
record, or any portion thereof, will not be granted, the individual will 
be notified in writing of the final adverse determination. The 
notification of a final adverse determination will set forth the reasons 
for the refusal of the reviewing officer to amend the record. The 
notification shall include a statement informing the individual of the 
right to submit a concise statement for insertion in the record setting 
forth the reasons for the disagreement with the refusal of the reviewing 
officer to amend the record. In addition, the notification will contain 
a statement informing the individual of the right to seek judicial 
review by a United States district court of a final adverse 
determination.
    (j) Statement of disagreement. Under 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(3), an 
individual who disagrees with a final adverse determination not to amend 
a record subject to amendment under the Privacy Act may submit a concise 
statement for insertion in the record setting forth the reasons for 
disagreement with the refusal of the reviewing officer to amend the 
record. A statement of disagreement should be addressed to or delivered 
in person to the Director, Office of Disclosure, Attention: OP:EX:D, 
Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 
20224. The Director, Office of Disclosure will foward the statement of 
disagreement to the appropriate designated official who will cause the 
statement to be inserted in the individual's record. Any such statement 
will be available to anyone to whom the record is subsequently disclosed 
and the prior recipients of the record will be provided with a copy of 
the statement of disagreement, to the extent an accounting of 
disclosures was maintained.
    (k) Judicial review. If, after a review and final determination on a 
request to amend a record by the appropriate reviewing officer, the 
individual is notified that the request will not be granted, or if, 
after the expiration of 30 days (not including Sundays, Saturdays, and 
legal public holidays) from the receipt of such request by the Director, 
Disclosure Operations Division, action is not taken thereon in 
accordance with the requirements of paragraph (d)(9) of this section, an 
individual may commence an action within the time prescribed by law in a 
U.S.

[[Page 74]]

District Court pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (g)(1). The statute authorizes 
an action only against the agency. With respect to records maintained by 
the IRS, the agency is the Internal Revenue Service, not an officer or 
employee thereof. Service of process in such an action shall be in 
accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C. App.) 
applicable to actions against an agency of the United States. Where 
provided in such Rules, delivery of process upon the IRS must be 
directed to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Attention: CC:GLS, 
1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20224. The district court 
will determine the matter de novo.
    5. Records transferred to Federal Records Centers. Records 
transferred to the Administrator of General Services for storage in a 
Federal Records Center are not used by the Internal Revenue Service in 
making any determination about any individual while stored at such 
location and therefore are not subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 
552a (e)(5) during such time.

    8. Verification of identity. An individual seeking notification or 
access to records, or seeking to amend a record, must satisfy one of the 
following identification requirements before action will be taken by the 
Office of Thrift Supervision on any such request:
    (i) An individual seeking notification or access to records in 
person, or seeking to amend a record in person, may establish identity 
by the presentation of a single official document bearing a photograph 
(such as a passport or identification badge) or by the presentation of 
two items of identification which do not bear a photograph but do bear 
both a name and signature (such as a driver's license or credit card).
    (ii) An individual seeking notification or access to records by

                    Subpart A_Original Classification


<R05>
Sec. 2.1  Classification levels [1.1(a)].\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Related references are related to sections of Executive Order 
12356, 47 FR 14874, April 6, 1982.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) National security information (hereinafter also referred to as 
``classified information'') shall be classified at one of the following 
three levels:
    (1) Top Secret shall be applied to information, the unauthorized 
disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally 
grave damage to the national security.
    (2) Secret shall be applied to information, the unauthorized 
disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage 
to the national security.
    (3) Confidential shall be applied to information, the unauthorized 
disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the 
national security.
    (b) Limitations [1.1(b)]. Markings other than ``Top Secret,'' 
``Secret,'' and ``Confidential,'' shall not be used to identify national 
security information. No other terms or phrases are to be used in 
conjunction with these markings to identify national security 
information, such as ``Secret/Sensitive'' or ``Agency Confidential''. 
The terms ``Top Secret,'' ``Secret,'' and ``Confidential'' are not to be 
used to identify non-classified Executive Branch information. The 
administrative control legend, ``Limited Official Use'', is authorized 
in Treasury Directive 71-02, ``Safeguarding Officially Limited 
Information,'' which requires that information so marked is to be 
handled, safeguarded and stored in a manner equivalent to national 
security information classified Confidential.
    (c) Reasonable Doubt [1.1(c)]. When there is reasonable doubt about 
the need to classify information, the information shall be safeguarded 
as if it were ``Confidential'' information in accordance with subpart D 
of this regulation, pending a determination about its classification. 
Upon a final determination of a need for classification, the information 
that is classified shall be marked as provided in Sec. 2.7. When there 
is reasonable doubt about the appropriate classification level, the 
information shall be safeguarded at the higher level in accordance with 
subpart D, pending a determination of its classification level. Upon a 
final determination of its classification level, the information shall 
be marked as provided in Sec. 2.7.


<R05>
Sec. 2.2  Classification Authority.

    Designations of original classification authority for national 
security information are contained in Treasury Order (TO) 102-19 (or 
successor order),

[[Page 86]]

which is published in the Federal Register. The authority to classify 
inheres within the office and may be exercised by a person acting in 
that capacity. There may be additional redelegations of original 
classification authority made pursuant to TO 102-19 (or successor 
order). Officials with original classification authority may 
derivatively classify at the same classification level.

[63 FR 14357, Mar. 25, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 2.3  Listing of original classification authorities.

    Delegations of original Top Secret, Secret and Confidential 
classification authority shall be in writing and be reported annually to 
the Departmental Director of Security, who shall maintain such 
information on behalf of the Assistant Secretary (Management). These 
delegations are to be limited to the minimum number absolutely required 
for efficient administration. Periodic reviews and evaluations of such 
delegations shall be made by the Departmental Director of Security to 
ensure that the officials so designated have demonstrated a continuing 
need to exercise such authority. If, after reviewing and evaluating the 
information, the Departmental Director of Security determines that such 
officials have not demonstrated a continuing need to exercise such 
authority, the Departmental Director of Security shall recommend to the 
Assistant Secretary (Management), as warranted, the reduction or 
elimination of such authority. The Assistant Secretary (Management) 
shall take appropriate action in consultation with the affected 
official(s) and the Departmental Director of Security. Such action may 
include relinquishment of this authority where the Assistant Secretary 
(Management) determines that a firm basis for retention does not exist.


<R05>
Sec. 2.4  Record requirements.

    The Departmental Director of Security shall maintain a listing by 
name, position title and delegated classification level, of all 
officials in the Departmental Offices who are authorized under this 
regulation to originally classify information as Top Secret, Secret or 
Confidential. Officials within the Departmental Offices with Top Secret 
classification authority shall report in writing on TD F 71-01.14 
(Report of Authorized Classifiers) to the Departmental Director of 
Security, the names, position titles and authorized classification 
levels of the officials designated by them in writing to have original 
Secret or Confidential classification authority. The head of each bureau 
shall maintain a similar listing of all officials in his or her bureau 
authorized to apply original Secret and Confidential classification and 
shall provide a copy of TD F 71-01.14, reflecting the list of officials 
so authorized, to the Departmental Director of Security. These listings 
shall be compiled and reported no less than annually each October 15th 
as required by Treasury Directive 71-01, ``Agency Information Security 
Program Data''.


<R05>
Sec. 2.5  Classification categories.

    (a) Classification in Context of Related Information [1.3(b)]. 
Certain information which would otherwise be unclassified may require 
classification when combined or associated with other unclassified or 
classified information. Such classification on an aggregate basis shall 
be supported by a written explanation that, at a minimum, shall be 
maintained with the file or referenced on the record copy of the 
information.
    (b) Unofficial Publication or Disclosure [1.3(d)]. Following an 
inadvertent or unauthorized publication or disclosure of information 
identical or similar to information that has been classified in 
accordance with the Order or predecessor Orders, the agency of primary 
interest shall determine the degree of damage to the national security, 
the need for continued classification, and, in coordination with the 
agency in which the disclosure occurred, what action must be taken to 
prevent similar occurrences under procedures contained in Sec. 2.32.


<R05>
Sec. 2.6  Duration of classification.

    (a) Information Not Marked for Declassification [1.4]. Information 
classified under predecessor orders that is not subject to automatic 
declassification shall remain classified until reviewed for possible 
declassification.

[[Page 87]]

    (b) Authority to Extend Automatic Declassification Determinations 
[1.4(b)]. The authority to extend classification of information subject 
to automatic declassification under any predecessor Executive Order to 
the Order is limited to those officials who have classification 
authority over the information and are designated in writing to have 
original classification authority at the level of the information to 
remain classified. Any decision to extend the classification on other 
than a document-by-document basis shall be reported to the Assistant 
Secretary (Management) who shall, in turn, report this fact to the 
Director of the Information Security Oversight Office.


<R05>
Sec. 2.7  Identification and markings [1.5(a), (b) and (c)].

    The information security system requires that standard markings be 
applied to classified information. Except in extraordinary circumstances 
as provided in section 1.5(a) of the Order, or as indicated herein, the 
marking of paper and electronically created documents shall not deviate 
from the following prescribed formats. These markings shall also be 
affixed to material other than paper and electronically created 
documents, including file folders, film, tape, etc., or the originator 
shall provide holders or recipients of the information with written 
instructions for protecting the information.
    (a) Classification Level. The markings ``Top Secret,'' ``Secret,'' 
and ``Confidential'' are used to indicate: information that requires 
protection as classified information under the Order; the highest level 
of classification contained in a document; the classification level of 
each page and, in abbreviated form, the classification of each portion 
of a document.
    (1) Overall Marking. The highest level of classification of 
information in a document shall be marked in such a way as to 
distinguish it clearly from the informational text. Markings shall 
appear at the top and bottom of the outside of the front cover (if any), 
on the title page (if any), on the first and last pages bearing text, 
and on the outside of the back cover (if any).
    (2) Page Marking. Each interior page of a classified document is to 
be marked at the top and bottom, either according to the highest 
classification of the content of the page, including the designation 
``UNCLASSIFIED'' when it is applicable, or with the highest overall 
classification of the document.
    (3) Portion Marking. Only the Secretary of the Treasury may waive 
the portion marking requirement for specified classes of documents or 
information upon a written determination that:
    (i) There will be minimal circulation of the specified documents or 
information and minimal potential usage of the documents or information 
as a source for derivative classification determinations; or
    (ii) There is some other basis to conclude that the potential 
benefits of portion marking are clearly outweighed by the increased 
administrative burdens.
    (b) Unless the portion marking requirement has been waived as 
authorized, each portion of a document, including subjects and titles, 
shall be marked by placing a parenthetical designation either 
immediately preceding or following the text to which it applies. The 
symbols, ``(TS)'' for Top Secret, ``(S)'' for Secret, ``(C)'' for 
Confidential, and ``(U)'' for Unclassified shall be used for this 
purpose. The symbol, ``(LOU)'' shall be used for Limited Official Use 
information. If the application of parenthetical designations is not 
practicable, the document shall contain a statement sufficient to 
identify the information that is classified and the level of such 
classification, as well as the information that is not classified. If 
all portions of a document are classified at the same level, this fact 
may be indicated by a statement to that effect, e.g. ``Entire Text is 
Classified Confidential.'' If a subject or title requires 
classification, an unclassified identifier may be applied to facilitate 
reference.
    (c) Classification Authority. If the original classifier is other 
than the signer or approver of the document, his or her indentity shall 
be shown at the bottom of the first and last pages as

[[Page 88]]

follows: ``CLASSIFIED BY (identification of original classification 
authority)''.
    (d) Bureau and Office of Origin. If the identity of the originating 
bureau or office is not apparent on the face of the document, it shall 
be clearly indicated below the ``CLASSIFIED BY'' line.
    (e) Downgrading and Declassification Instructions. Downgrading and, 
as applicable, declassification instructions shall be shown as follows:
    (1) For information to be declassified automatically on a specific 
date:

Classified by___________________________________________________________
Office__________________________________________________________________
Declassify on (date)____________________________________________________

    (2) For information to be declassified automatically upon the 
occurrence of a specific event:

Classified by___________________________________________________________
Office__________________________________________________________________
Declassify on (description of event)____________________________________

    (3) For information not to be declassified automatically:

Classified by___________________________________________________________
Office__________________________________________________________________
Declassify on Origination Agency's Determination Required or ``OADR''

    (4) For information to be downgraded automatically on a specific 
date or upon occurrence of a specific event:

Classified by___________________________________________________________
Office__________________________________________________________________
Downgrade to____________________________________________________________
on (date or description of event)_______________________________________

    (f) Special Markings--(1) Transmittal Documents [1.5(c)]. A 
transmittal document shall indicate on its first page and last page, if 
any, the highest classification of any information transmitted by it. It 
shall also include on the first and last pages the following or similar 
instruction:
    (i) For an unclassified transmittal document:

Unclassified When Classified
Enclosure(s) Detached.

    (ii) For a classified transmittal document:

Upon Removal of Attachment(s)
this Document is________________________________________________________


(classification level of the transmittal document alone), or:

This Document is Classified_____________________________________________
with Unclassified Attachment(s).

    (2) Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data [6.2(a)]. Restricted 
Data or Formerly Restricted Data shall be marked in accordance with 
regulations issued under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. 
Restricted Data is information dealing with the design, manufacture, or 
utilization of atomic weapons, production of special nuclear material or 
use of special nuclear material in the production of energy. Formerly 
Restricted Data is classified information that has been removed from the 
``restricted data'' category but still remains classified. It relates 
primarily to the military utilization of atomic weapons.
    (3) Intelligence Sources or Methods [1.5(c)]. Documents that contain 
information relating to intelligence sources or methods shall include 
the following marking unless otherwise prescribed by the Director of 
Central Intelligence: ``WARNING NOTICE--INTELLIGENCE SOURCES OR METHODS 
INVOLVED'' To avoid confusion as to the extent of dissemination and use 
restrictions governing the information involved, this marking may not be 
used in conjunction with special access or sensitive compartmented 
information controls.
    (4) Foreign Government Information (FGI) [1.5(c)]. Documents that 
contain FGI shall include either the marking ``FOREIGN GOVERNMENT 
INFORMATION,'' or a marking that otherwise indicates that the 
information is foreign government information. If the information is 
foreign government information that must be concealed, given the 
relationship or understanding with the foreign government providing the 
information, the marking shall not be used and the document shall be 
marked as if it were wholly of United States origin. However, such a 
marking must be supported by a written explanation that, at a minimum, 
shall be maintained with the file or referenced on the original or 
record copy of the document or information.
    (5) National Security Information [4.1(c)]. Classified information 
furnished outside the Executive Branch shall show the following marking:

NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION
Unauthorized Disclosure Subject to
Administrative and Criminal Sanctions


[[Page 89]]


    (6) Automated Data Processing (ADP) and Computer Output [1.5(c)]. 
(i) Documents that are generated via ADP or as computer output may be 
marked automatically by systems software. If automatic marking is not 
practicable, such documents must be marked manually.
    (ii) Removable information storage media, however, will bear 
external labels indicating the security classification of the 
information and associated security markings, as applicable, such as 
handling caveats and dissemination controls. Examples of such media 
include magnetic tape reels, cartridges, and cassettes; removable disks, 
disk cartridges, disk packs, and diskettes, including ``floppy'' or 
flexible disks; paper tape reels; and magnetic and punched cards. Two 
labels may be required on each medium: a color coded security 
classification label, i.e., orange Standard Form 706 (Top Secret label), 
red SF 707 (Secret label), blue SF 708 (Confidential label), purple SF 
709 (Classified label), green SF 710 (Unclassified label); and a white 
SF 711 (Data Descriptor label). National stock numbers of the labels, 
which are available through normal Federal Supply channels, are as 
follows: SF 706, 7540-01-207-5536; SF 707, 7450-01-207-5537; SF 708, 
7450-01-207-5538; SF 709, 7540-01-207-5540; SF 710, 7540-01-207-5539 and 
SF 711, 7540-01-207-5541. Treasury Directive 71-02 provides for the use 
of a green ``Officially Limited Information'' label, TD F 71-05.2, to 
identify information so marked.
    (iii) In a mixed environment in which classified and unclassified 
information in processed or stored, the ``Unclassified'' label must be 
used to identify the media containing unclassified information. In 
environments in which only unclassified information is processed or 
stored, the use of the ``Unclassified'' label is not required. 
Unclassified media, however, that are on loan from (and must be returned 
to) vendors do not require the ``Unclassified'' label, but each requires 
a Data Descriptor label with the words, ``Unclassified Vendor Medium'' 
entered on it.
    (iv) Each medium shall be appropriately affixed with a 
classification label and, as applicable, with a Data Descriptor label at 
the earliest practicable time as soon as the proper security 
classification or control has been established. Labels shall be 
conspicuously placed on media in a manner that will not adversely affect 
operation of the equipment in which the media is used. Once applied, the 
label is not to be removed. A label to identify a higher level of 
classification may, however, be applied on top of a lower classification 
level in the event that the content of the media changes, e.g., from 
Confidential to Secret. A lower classification label may not be applied 
to media already bearing a higher classification label. Personnel shall 
be responsible for appropriately labeling and controlling ADP and 
computer storage media within their possession.
    (g) Electronically Transmitted Information (Messages) [1.5(c)]. 
Classified information that is transmitted electronically shall be 
marked as follows:
    (1) The highest level of classification shall appear before the 
first line of text;
    (2) A ``CLASSIFIED BY'' line is not required;
    (3) The duration of classification shall appear as follows:
    (i) For information to be declassified automatically on a specific 
date: ``DECL: (date)'';
    (ii) For information to be declassified upon occurrence of a 
specific event: ``DECL: (description of event)'';
    (iii) For information not to be automatically declassified which 
requires the originating agency's determination (see also Sec. 
2.7(e)(3)): ``DECL: OADR'';
    (iv) For information to be automatically downgraded: ``DOWNGRADE TO 
(classification level to which the information is to be downgraded) ON 
(date or description of event on which downgrading is to occur)''.
    (4) Portion marking shall be as prescribed in Sec. 2.7(a)(3);
    (5) Specially designated markings as prescribed in Sec. 2.7(f) (2), 
(3), and (4) shall appear after the marking for the highest level of 
classification. These include:
    (i) Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data;
    (ii) Information concerning intelligence sources or methods:

[[Page 90]]

``WNINTEL,'' unless otherwise prescribed by the Director of Central 
Intelligence; and
    (iii) Foreign Government Information (FGI).
    (6) Paper copies of electronically transmitted messages shall be 
marked as provided in Sec. 2.7(a) (1), (2), and (3).
    (h) Changes in Classification Markings [4.1(b)]. When a change is 
made in the duration of classified information, all holders of record 
shall be promptly notified. If practicable, holders of record shall also 
be notified of a change in the level of classification. Holders shall 
alter the markings on their copy of the information to conform to the 
change, citing the authority for it. If the remarking of large 
quantities of information is unduly burdensome, the holder may attach a 
change of classification notice to the storage unit in lieu of the 
marking action otherwise required. Items withdrawn from the collection 
for purposes other than transfer for storage shall be marked promptly in 
accordance with the change notice.


<R05>
Sec. 2.8  Limitations on classification [1.6(c)].

    (a) Before reclassifying information as provided in section 1.6(c) 
of the Order, authorized officials, who must have original 
classification authority and jurisdiction over the information involved, 
shall consider the following factors which shall be addressed in a 
report to the Assistant Secretary (Management) who shall in turn forward 
a report to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office:
    (1) The elapsed time following disclosure;
    (2) The nature and extent of disclosure;
    (3) The ability to bring the fact of reclassification to the 
attention of persons to whom the information was disclosed;
    (4) The ability to prevent further disclosure; and
    (5) The ability to retrieve the information voluntarily from persons 
not authorized access in its reclassified state.
    (b) Information may be classified or reclassified after it has been 
requested under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the 
Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or the mandatory declassification 
review provisions of the Order if such classification meets the 
requirements of the Order and is accomplished personally and on a 
document-by-document basis by the Secretary of the Treasury, the Deputy 
Secretary, the Assistant Secretary (Management) or an official with 
original Top Secret classification authority. Such reclassification 
actions shall be reported in writing to the Departmental Director of 
Security.
    (c) In no case may information be classified or reclassified in 
order to conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative 
error; to prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency; to 
restrain competition; or to prevent or delay the release of information 
that does not require protection in the interest of national security.

                   Subpart B_Derivative Classification


<R05>
Sec. 2.9  Derivative Classification Authority.

    Designations of derivative classification authority for national 
security information are contained in Treasury Order 102-19 (or 
successor order). The authority to derivatively classify inheres within 
the office and may be exercised by a person acting in that capacity. 
There may be additional redelegations of derivative classification 
authority made pursuant to TO 102-19 (or successor order). Officials 
identified in Treasury Order 102-19 (or successor order) may also 
administratively control and decontrol sensitive but unclassified 
information using the legend ``Limited Official Use'' and may redelegate 
their authority to control and decontrol. Such redelegations shall be in 
writing on TD F 71-01.20 ``Designation of Controlling/Decontrolling 
Officials'' (or successor form).

[63 FR 14357, Mar. 25, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 2.10  Listing derivative classification authorities.

    Delegations of derivative classification authority to officials not 
otherwise identified in Sec. 2.9, shall be in writing and reported 
annually each October

[[Page 91]]

15th to the Departmental Director of Security on TD F 71-01.18 (Report 
of Authorized Derivative Classifiers). Such delegations shall be limited 
to the minimum number absolutely required for efficient administration. 
Periodic reviews and evaluations of such delegations shall be made by 
the Departmental Director of Security to ensure that officials so 
designated have demonstrated a continuing need to exercise such 
authority. If after reviewing and evaluating the information the 
Departmental Director of Security determines that such officials have 
not demonstrated a continuing need to exercise such authority, the 
Departmental Director of Security shall recommend to the Assistant 
Secretary (Management), as warranted, the reduction or elimination of 
such authority. The Assistant Secretary (Management) shall take 
appropriate action in consultation with the affected official(s) and the 
Departmental Director of Security. Such action may include 
relinquishment of this authority where the Assistant Secretary 
(Management) determines that a firm basis for retention does not exist.


<R05>
Sec. 2.11  Use of derivative classification [2.1].

    The application of derivative classification markings is a 
responsibility of those who incorporate, paraphrase, restate, or 
generate in new form information that is already classified, and of 
those who apply markings in accordance with instructions from an 
authorized original classifier or in accordance with an approved 
classification guide. If an individual who applies derivative 
classification markings believes that the paraphrasing, restating or 
summarizing of classified information has changed the level of or 
removed the basis for classification, that person must consult an 
appropriate official of the originating agency or office of origin who 
has the authority to upgrade, downgrade or declassify the information 
for a final determination. A sample marking of derivatively classified 
documents is set forth in Sec. 2.13.


<R05>
Sec. 2.12  Classification guides.

    (a) General [2.2(a)]. A classification guide is a reference manual 
which assists document drafters and document classifiers in determining 
what types or categories of material have already been classified. The 
classification guide shall, at a minimum:
    (1) Identify and categorize the elements of information to be 
protected;
    (2) State which classification level applies to each element or 
category of information; and
    (3) Prescribe declassification instructions for each element or 
category of information in terms of:
    (i) A period of time,
    (ii) The occurrence of an event, or
    (iii) A notation that the information shall not be declassified 
automatically without the approval of the originating agency i.e., 
``OADR''.
    (b) Review and Record Requirements [2.2(a)]. (1) Each classification 
guide shall be kept current and shall be reviewed at least once every 
two years and updated as necessary. Each office within the Departmental 
Offices and the respective offices of each Treasury bureau possessing 
original classification authority for national security information 
shall maintain a list of all classification guides in current use by 
them. A copy of each such classification guide in current use shall be 
furnished to the Departmental Director of Security who shall maintain 
them on behalf of the Assistant Secretary (Management).
    (2) Each office and bureau that prepares and maintains a 
classification guide shall also maintain a record of individuals 
authorized to apply derivative classification markings in accordance 
with a classification guide. This record shall be maintained on TD F 71-
01.18 (Report of Authorized Derivative Classifiers) which shall be 
reported annually each October 15th to the Departmental Director of 
Security.
    (c) Waivers [2.2(c)]. Any authorized official desiring a waiver of 
the requirement to issue a classification guide shall submit in writing 
to the Assistant Secretary (Management) a request for approval of such a 
waiver. Any request for a waiver shall contain, at a minimum, an 
evaluation of the following factors:
    (1) The ability to segregate and describe the elements of 
information;

[[Page 92]]

    (2) The practicality of producing or disseminating the guide because 
of the nature of the information;
    (3) The anticipated usage of the guide as a basis for derivative 
classification; and
    (4) The availability of alternative sources for derivatively 
classifying the information in a uniform manner.


<R05>
Sec. 2.13  Derivative identification and markings [1.5(c) and 2.1(b)].

    Information classified derivatively on the basis of source documents 
or classification guides shall bear all markings prescribed in Sec. 2.7 
(a) through (f), as are applicable. Information for these markings shall 
be taken from the source document or instructions in the appropriate 
classification guide.
    (a) Classification Authority. The authority for classification shall 
be shown as follows:

Derivatively Classified by______________________________________________
Office__________________________________________________________________
Derived from____________________________________________________________
Declassify on___________________________________________________________


If a document is classified on the basis of more than one source 
document or classification guide, the authority for classification shall 
be shown on the ``DERIVED FROM'' line as follows: ``MULTIPLE CLASSIFIED 
SOURCES''. In these cases, the derivative classifier must maintain the 
identification of each source with the file or record copy of the 
derivatively classified document. A document derivatively classified on 
the basis of a source document that is marked ``MULTIPLE CLASSIFIED 
SOURCES'' shall cite the source document on its ``DERIVED FROM'' line 
rather than the term: ``MULTIPLE CLASSIFIED SOURCES''. Preparers of such 
documentation shall ensure that the identification of the derivative 
classifier is indicated. Use of the term ``MULTIPLE CLASSIFIED 
SOURCES,'' is not to be a substitute for the identity of the derivative 
classification authority.
    (b) Downgrading and Declassification Instructions. Dates or events 
for automatic downgrading or declassification shall be carried forward 
from the source document. This includes the notation ``ORIGINATING 
AGENCY'S DETERMINATION REQUIRED'' to indicate that the document is not 
to be downgraded or declassified automatically, or instructions as 
directed by a classification guide, which shall be shown on a 
``DOWNGRADE TO'' or ``DECLASSIFY ON'' line as follows:

DOWNGRADE TO____________________________________________________________
ON (date, description of event, or OADR) or,
DECLASSIFY ON (date, description of event, or OADR)


<R04>
               Subpart C_Downgrading and Declassification


<R05>
Sec. 2.14  Listing downgrading and declassification authorities 3.1(b)].

    Downgrading and declassification authority may be exercised by the 
official authorizing the original classification, if that official is 
still serving in the same position; a successor in that capacity; a 
supervisory official of either; or officials delegated such authority in 
writing by the Secretary of the Treasury or the Assistant Secretary 
(Management). Such officials may not downgrade or declassify information 
which is classified at a level exceeding their own designated 
classification authority. A listing of officials delegated such 
authority, in writing, shall be identified on TD F 71-01.11 (Report of 
Authorized Downgrading and Declassification Officials) and reported 
annually each October 15th to the Departmental Director of Security who 
shall maintain them on behalf of the Assistant Secretary (Management). 
Current listings of officials so designated shall be maintained by 
Treasury bureaus and offices within the Departmental Offices.

<R05>
Sec. 2.15  Declassification policy [3.1].

    In making determinations under section 3.1(a) of the Order, 
officials shall respect the intent of the Order to protect foreign 
government information and confidential foreign sources.


<R05>
Sec. 2.16  Downgrading and declassification markings.

    Whenever a change is made in the original classification or in the 
dates of downgrading or declassification of any classified information, 
it shall be promptly and conspicuously marked to

[[Page 93]]

indicate the change, the authority for the action, the date of the 
action, and the identity of the person taking the action. Earlier 
classification markings shall be cancelled or otherwise obliterated when 
practicable. See also Sec. 2.7(h).


<R05>
Sec. 2.17  Systematic review for declassification [3.3].

    (a) Permanent Records. Systematic review is applicable only to those 
classified records and presidential papers or records that the Archivist 
of the United States, acting under the Federal Records Act, has 
determined to be of sufficient historical or other value to warrant 
permanent retention.
    (b) Non-Permanent Classified Records. Non-permanent classified 
records shall be disposed of in accordance with schedules approved by 
the Administrator of General Services under the Records Disposal Act. 
These schedules shall provide for the continued retention of records 
subject to an ongoing mandatory declassification review request.
    (c) Systematic Declassification Review Guidelines [3.3(a)]. As 
appropriate, guidelines for systematic declassification review shall be 
issued by the Assistant Secretary (Management) in consultation with the 
Archivist of the United States, the Director of the Information Security 
Oversight Office and Department officials, to assist the Archivist in 
the conduct of systematic reviews. Such guidelines shall be reviewed and 
updated at least every five years unless earlier review is requested by 
the Archivist.
    (d) Foreign Government Systematic Declassification Review Guidelines 
[3.3(a)]. As appropriate, guidelines for systematic declassification 
review of foreign government information shall be issued by the 
Assistant Secretary (Management) in consultation with the Archivist of 
the United States, the Director of the Information Security Oversight 
Office, Department officials and other agencies having declassification 
authority over the information. These guidelines shall be reviewed and 
updated every five years unless earlier review is requested by the 
Archivist.
    (e) Special Procedures. The Department shall be bound by the special 
procedures for systematic review of classified cryptologic records and 
classified records pertaining to intelligence activities (including 
special activities), or intelligence sources or methods issued by the 
Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence, 
respectively.


<R05>
Sec. 2.18  Mandatory declassification review [3.4].

    (a) Except as provided by section 3.4 (b) of the Order, all 
information classified by the Department under the Order or any 
predecessor Executive Order shall be subject to declassification review 
by the Department, if:
    (1) The request is made by a United States citizen or permanent 
resident alien, a Federal agency, or a state or local government;
    (2) The request describes the document or material containing the 
information with sufficient specificity to enable the Department to 
locate it with a reasonable amount of effort; and
    (3) The requester provides substantial proof as to his or her United 
States citizenship or status as a permanent resident alien, e.g., a copy 
of a birth certificate, a certificate of naturalization, official 
passport or some other means of identity which sufficiently describes 
the requester's status. A permanent resident alien is any individual, 
who is not a citizen or national of the United States, who has been 
lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United 
States as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws, such 
status not having changed. Permanent means a relationship of continuing 
or lasting nature, as distinguished from temporary, but a relationship 
may be permanent even though it is one that may be dissolved eventually 
at the instance either of the United States or of the individual, in 
accordance with law.
    (b) Processing--(1) Initial Requests for Classified Records 
Originated by the Department. Requests for mandatory declassification 
review shall be directed to the Departmental Office of Security, 1500 
Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20220. Upon receipt of each 
request for declassification, pursuant to section 3.4 of the Order, the 
following procedures shall apply:

[[Page 94]]

    (i) The Departmental Office of Security shall acknowledge the 
receipt of the request in writing.
    (ii) A valid mandatory declassification review request need not 
identify the requested information by date or title of the responsive 
records, but must be of sufficient particularity to allow Treasury 
personnel to locate the records containing the information sought with a 
reasonable amount of effort. Whenever a request does not reasonably 
describe the information sought, the requester shall be notified by the 
Departmental Office of Security that unless additional information is 
provided or the scope of the request is narrowed, no further action will 
be undertaken.
    (iii) The Departmental Office of Security shall determine the 
appropriate office or bureau to take action on the request and shall 
forward the request to that office or bureau.
    (iv) In responding to mandatory declassification review requests, 
the appropriate reviewing officials shall make a prompt declassification 
determination. The Departmental Office of Security shall notify the 
requester if additional time is needed to process the request. Reviewing 
officials shall also identify the amount of search and/or review time 
required to process the request. The Department shall make a final 
determination within one year from the date of receipt except in unusual 
circumstances. When information cannot be declassified in its entirety, 
reasonable efforts, consistent with other applicable laws, will be made 
to release those declassified portions of the requested information 
which constitute a coherent segment. Upon the denial or partial denial 
of an initial request, the Departmental Office of Security shall also 
notify the requester of the right of an administrative appeal which must 
be filed with the Assistant Secretary (Management) within 60 days of 
receipt of the denial.
    (v) When the Department receives a mandatory declassification review 
request for records in its possession that were originated by another 
agency, the Departmental Office of Security shall forward the request to 
that agency. The Departmental Office of Security shall include a copy of 
the records requested together with the Department's recommendations for 
action. Upon receipt, the originating agency shall process the request 
in accordance with the Directive 32 CFR 2001.32(a)(2)(i). The 
originating agency shall also be requested to communicate its 
declassification determination to Treasury.
    (vi) When another agency forwards to the Department a request for 
information in that agency's custody that has been classified by 
Treasury, the Departmental Office of Security shall:
    (A) Advise the other agency as to whether it can notify the 
requester of the referral;
    (B) Review the classified information in coordination with other 
agencies that have a direct interest in the subject matter; and
    (C) Respond to the requester in accordance with the procedures in 
Sec. 2.18(b)(1)(iv). If requested, Treasury's determination shall be 
communicated to the referring agency.
    (vii) Appeals of denials of a request for declassification shall be 
referred to the Assistant Secretary (Management) who shall normally make 
a determination within 30 working days following the receipt of an 
appeal. If additional time is required to make a determination, the 
Assistant Secretary (Management) shall notify the requester of the 
additional time needed and provide the requester with the reason for the 
extension. The Assistant Secretary (Management) shall notify the 
requester in writing of the final determination and, as applicable, the 
reasons for any denial.
    (viii) Except as provided in this paragraph, the Department shall 
process mandatory declassification review requests for classified 
records containing foreign government information in accordance with 
Sec. 2.18(a). The agency that initially received or classified the 
foreign government information shall be responsible for making a 
declassification determination after consultation with concerned 
agencies. If upon receipt of the request, the Department determines that 
Treasury is not the agency that received or classified the foreign 
government information, it shall refer the request to the appropriate 
agency for action. Consultation

[[Page 95]]

with the foreign originator through appropriate channels may be 
necessary prior to final action on the request.
    (ix) Mandatory declassification review requests for cryptologic 
information and/or information concerning intelligence activities 
(including special activities) or intelligence sources or methods shall 
be processed solely in accordance with special procedures issued by the 
Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence, 
respectively.
    (x) The fees to be charged for mandatory declassification review 
requests shall be for search and/or review and duplication. The fee 
charges for services of Treasury personnel involved in locating and/or 
reviewing records shall be at the rate of a GS-10, Step 1, for each hour 
or fraction thereof, except that no charge shall be imposed for search 
and/or review consuming less than one hour.
    (A) Photocopies per page up to 8\1/2\<gr-thn-eq> by 14<gr-thn-eq> 
shall be charged at the rate of 10 cents each except that no charge will 
be imposed for reproducing ten (10) pages or less when search and/or 
review time requires less than one hour.
    (B) When it is estimated that the costs associated with the 
mandatory declassification review request will exceed $100.00, the 
Departmental Office of Security shall notify the requester of the likely 
cost and obtain satisfactory written assurance of full payment or may 
require the requester to make an advance payment of the entire fee 
before continuing to process the request. The Department reserves the 
right to request prepayment after a mandatory declassification review 
request is processed and before documents are released. In the event the 
requester does not agree to pay the actual charges, he or she shall 
advise how to proceed with the mandatory declassification review 
request. Failure of a requester to pay charges after billing will result 
in future requests not being honored.
    (C) In order for a requester's initial request to be processed it 
shall be accompanied by a statement that he or she is agreeable to 
paying fees for search and/or review and copying. In the event the 
initial request does not include this statement, processing of the 
request will be held in abeyance until such time as the required 
statement is received. Failure to provide a response within a reasonable 
amount of time will serve as the basis for administratively terminating 
the mandatory declassification review request.
    (D) Payment of fees shall be made by check or money order payable to 
the Treasurer of the United States. Fees levied by the Department of the 
Treasury for mandatory declassification review requests are separate and 
distinct from any other fees which might be imposed by a Presidential 
Library, the National Archives and Records Administration or another 
agency or department.


<R05>
Sec. 2.19  Assistance to the Department of State [3.3(b)].

    The Secretary of the Treasury shall assist the Department of State 
in its preparation of the ``Foreign Relations of the United States'' 
series by facilitating access to appropriate classified material in 
Treasury custody and by expediting declassification review of documents 
proposed for inclusion in the series.


<R05>
Sec. 2.20  Freedom of Information/Privacy Act requests [3.4].

    The Department of the Treasury shall process requests for records 
containing classified national security information that are submitted 
under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, as amended, or 
the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, in accordance with the provisions 
of those Acts.


<R04>
                         Subpart D_Safeguarding


<R05>
Sec. 2.21  General [4.1].

    Information classified pursuant to this Order or predecessor Orders 
shall be afforded a level of protection against unauthorized disclosure 
commensurate with its level of classification.


<R05>
Sec. 2.22  General restrictions on access [4.1].

    (a) Determination of Need-To-Know. Classified information shall be 
made available to a person only when the possessor of the classified 
information establishes in each instance, except as

[[Page 96]]

provided in section 4.3 of the Order, that access is essential to the 
accomplishment of official United States Government duties or 
contractual obligations.
    (b) Determination of Trustworthiness. A person is eligible for 
access to classified information only after a showing of trustworthiness 
as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury based upon appropriate 
investigations in accordance with applicable standards and criteria.
    (c) Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement. Standard Form 
312 (Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement) or the prior SF 
189, bearing the same title, are nondisclosure agreements between the 
United States and an individual. The execution of either the SF 312 or 
SF 189 agreement by an individual is necessary before the United States 
Government may grant the individual access to classified information. 
Bureaus and the Departmental Offices must retain executed copies of the 
SF 312 or prior SF 189 in file systems from which the agreements can be 
expeditiously retrieved in the event the United States must seek their 
enforcement. Copies or legally enforceable facsimiles of the SF 312 or 
SF 189 must be retained for 50 years following their date of execution. 
The national stock number for the SF 312 is 7540-01-280-5499.


<R05>
Sec. 2.23  Access by historical researchers and former presidential 
appointees [4.3].

    (a) Access to classified information may be granted only as is 
essential to the accomplishment of authorized and lawful United States 
Government purposes. This requirement may be waived, however, for 
persons who:
    (1) Are engaged in historical research projects, or
    (2) Previously have occupied policymaking positions to which they 
were appointed by the President.
    (b) Access to classified information may be granted to historical 
researchers and to former Presidential appointees upon a determination 
of trustworthiness; a written determination that such access is 
consistent with the interests of national security; the requestor's 
written agreement to safeguard classified information; and the 
requestor's written consent to have his or her notes and manuscripts 
reviewed to ensure that no classified information is contained therein. 
The conferring of historial researcher status does not include 
authorization to release foreign government information or other 
agencies' classified information per Sec. 2.24 of this part. By the 
terms of section 4.3(b)(3) of the Order, former Presidential appointees 
not engaged in historical research may only be granted access to 
classified documents which they ``originated, reviewed, signed or 
received while serving as a Presidential appointee.'' Coordination shall 
be made with the Departmental Director of Security with respect to the 
required written agreements to be signed by the Department and such 
historical researchers or former Presidential appointees, as a condition 
of such access and to ensure the safeguarding of classified information.
    (c) If the access requested by historical researchers and former 
Presidential appointees requires the rendering of services for which 
fair and equitable fees may be charged pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 9701, the 
requestor shall be so notified and the fees may be imposed. Treasury's 
fee schedule identified in Sec. 2.18(b)(1)(x), applicable to mandatory 
declassification review, shall also apply to fees charged for services 
provided to historical researchers and former Presidential appointees 
for search and/or review and copying.


<R05>
Sec. 2.24  Dissemination [4.1(d)].

    Except as otherwise provided by section 102 of the National Security 
Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 495, 50 U.S.C. 403, classified information 
originating in another agency may not be disseminated outside the 
Department without the consent of the originating agency.


<R05>
Sec. 2.25  Standards for security equipment [4.1(b) and 5.1(b)].

    The Administrator of General Services issues (in coordination with 
agencies originating classified information), establishes and publishes 
uniform standards, specifications, and supply schedules for security 
equipment designed to provide for secure storage and to destroy 
classified information.

[[Page 97]]

Treasury bureaus and the Departmental Offices may establish more 
stringent standards for their own use. Whenever new security equipment 
is procured, it shall be in conformance with the standards and 
specifications referred to above and shall, to the maximum extent 
practicable, be of the type available through the Federal Supply System.


<R05>
Sec. 2.26  Accountability procedures [4.1(b)].

    (a) Top Secret Control Officers. Each Treasury bureau and the 
Departmental Offices shall designate a primary and alternate Top Secret 
Control Officer. Within the Departmental Offices, the Top Secret Control 
Officer function will be established in the Office of the Executive 
Secretary for collateral Top Secret information and in the Office of the 
Special Assistant to the Secretary (National Security) with respect to 
sensitive compartmented information. The term ``collateral'' refers to 
national security information classified Confidential, Secret, or Top 
Secret under the provisions of Executive Order 12356 or prior Orders, 
for which special intelligence community systems of compartmentation 
(such as sensitive compartmented information) or special access programs 
are not formally established. Top Secret Control Officers so designated 
must have a Top Secret security clearance and shall:
    (1) Initially receive all Top Secret information entering their 
respective bureau, including the Departmental Offices. Any Top Secret 
information received by a Treasury bureau or Departmental Offices 
employee shall be immediately hand carried to the designated Top Secret 
Control Officer for proper accountability.
    (2) Maintain current accountability records of Top Secret 
information received within their bureau or office.
    (3) Ensure that Top Secret information is properly stored and that 
Top Secret information under their control is personally destroyed, when 
required. Top Secret information must be destroyed in the presence of an 
appropriately cleared official who shall actually witness such 
destruction. Accordingly, the use of burnbags to store Top Secret 
information, pending final destruction at a later date, is not 
authorized.
    (4) Ensure that prohibitions against reproduction of Top Secret 
information are strictly followed.
    (5) Conduct annual physical inventories of Top Secret information. 
An inventory shall be conducted in the presence of an individual with an 
appropriate security clearance. The inventory shall be completed 
annually and signed by the Top Secret Control Officer and the witnessing 
individual.
    (6) Ensure that Top Secret documents are downgraded, declassified, 
retired or destroyed as required by regulations or other markings.
    (7) Attach a TD F 71-01.7 (Top Secret Document Record) to the first 
page or cover of each copy of Top Secret information. The Top Secret 
Document Record shall be completed by the Top Secret Control Officer and 
shall serve as a permanent record.
    (8) Ensure that all persons having access to Top Secret information 
sign the Top Secret Document Record. This also includes persons to whom 
oral disclosure of the contents is made.
    (9) Maintain receipts concerning the transfer and destruction of Top 
Secret information. Record all such actions on the Top Secret Document 
Record which shall be retained for a minimum of three years.
    (10) As received, number in sequence each Top Secret document in a 
calendar year series (e.g. TS 89-001). This number shall be posted on 
the face of the document and on all forms required for control of Top 
Secret information.
    (11) Attach a properly executed TD F 71-01.5 (Classified Document 
Record of Transmittal) when a Top Secret document is transmitted 
internally or externally.
    (12) Verify, prior to releasing Top Secret information, that the 
recipient has both a security clearance and is authorized access to such 
information.
    (13) Report, in writing, all Top Secret documents unaccounted for to 
the Assistant Secretary (Management) who shall take appropriate action 
in conjunction with the Departmental Director of Security.
    (14) Assure that no individual within his or her office or bureau 
transmits

[[Page 98]]

Top Secret information to another individual or office without the 
knowledge and consent of the Top Secret Control Officer.
    (15) Ensure upon receipt that a Standard Form 703 (Top Secret Cover 
Sheet) is affixed to such information.
    (16) Notify office and/or bureau employees annually in writing of 
the designated control point for all incoming and outgoing Top Secret 
information.
    (17) Be notified as to the transmission, per Sec. 2.28(b), whenever 
Top Secret information is sent outside of a Treasury bureau or office 
within the Departmental Offices.
    (b) Top Secret Control Officer Listings. In order for the 
Departmental Director of Security to maintain a current listing of Top 
Secret Control Officers within the Department, each Treasury bureau and 
the Departmental Offices shall annually report each October 15th in 
writing to the Departmental Office of Security, the identities of the 
office(s) and names of the officials designated as their primary and 
alternate Top Secret Control Officers. Any changes in these designations 
shall be reported to the Departmental Director of Security within thirty 
days.
    (c) Top Secret Document Record. Upon receipt in the Department a 
green, color coded, TD F 71-01.7 (Top Secret Document Record) shall be 
attached by the Top Secret Control Officer to the first page or cover of 
the original and each copy of Top Secret information. The Top Secret 
Document Record shall remain attached to the Top Secret information 
until it is either transferred to another United States Government 
agency, downgraded, declassified or destroyed. The Top Secret Document 
Record, which shall initially be completed by the Top Secret Control 
Officer, shall identify the Top Secret information attached, and shall 
serve as a permanent record of the information. All persons, including 
stenographic and clerical personnel, having access to the information 
attached to the Top Secret Document Record must list their name and the 
date on the TD F 71-01.7 prior to accepting responsibility for its 
custody. The TD F 71-01.7 shall also indicate those individuals to whom 
only oral disclosure of the contents is made. Whenever any Top Secret 
information is transferred to another United States Government agency, 
downgraded, declassified or destroyed, the Top Secret Control Officer 
shall record the action on the Top Secret Document Record and retain it 
for a minimum or three years after which time it may be destroyed. In 
order to maintain the integrity of the color coding process the 
photocopying and use of non-color coded Top Secret Document Record forms 
is prohibited.
    (d) Classified Document Record of Transmittal. TD F 71-01.5 
(Classified Document Record of Transmittal) shall be the exclusive 
classified document accountability record for use within the Department 
of the Treasury. No other logs or records shall be required except for 
the use of TD F 71-01.7 which is applicable to Top Secret information. 
TD F 71-01.5 shall be used for single or multiple document receipting 
and for internal and external routing. The inclusion of classified 
information on TD F 71-01.5 is to be avoided. In the event the subject 
title is classified, a recognizable short title shall be used, e.g., 
first letter of each word in the subject title. Several items may be 
transmitted to the same addressee with one TD F 71-01.5. TD F's 71-01.5 
shall be maintained for a three year period after which the form may be 
destroyed. No record of the actual destruction of the TD F 71-01.5 is 
necessary.
    (1) Top Secret Information. Top Secret information shall be subject 
to a continuous receipt system regardless of how brief the period of 
custody. TD F 71-01.5 shall be used for this purpose. Top Secret 
accountability records shall be maintained by Top Secret Control 
Officers separately from the accountability records of other classified 
information.
    (2) Secret Information. Receipt on TD F 71-01.5 shall be required 
for transmission of Secret information between bureaus, offices and 
separate agencies. Responsible office heads shall determine 
administrative procedures required for the internal control within their 
respective offices. The volume of classified information handled and 
personnel resources available must be considered in determining the 
level of adequate security measures while at the

[[Page 99]]

same time maintaining operational efficiency.
    (3) Confidential and Limited Official Use Information. Receipts for 
Confidential and Limited Official Use information shall not be required 
unless the originator indicates that receipting is necessary.

<R05>
Sec. 2.27  Storage [4.1(b)].

    Classified information shall be stored only in facilities or under 
conditions designed to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access 
to it.
    (a) Minimum Requirements for Physical Barriers--(1) Top Secret. Top 
Secret information shall be stored in a GSA-approved security container 
with an approved, built-in, three-position, dial-type, changeable, 
combination lock; in a vault protected by an alarm system and response 
force; or in other types of storage facilities that meet the standards 
for Top Secret information established under the provisions of Sec. 
2.25. Top Secret information stored outside the United States must be in 
a facility afforded diplomatic status. One or more of the following 
supplementary controls is required:
    (i) The area that houses the security container or vault shall be 
subject to the continuous protection of U.S. guard or duty personnel;
    (ii) U.S. Guard or duty personnel shall inspect the security 
container or vault at least once every two hours; or
    (iii) The security container or vault shall be controlled by an 
alarm system to which a force will respond in person within 15 minutes.

Within the United States, the designated security officer in each 
Treasury bureau and the Department Offices shall prescribe those 
supplementary controls deemed necessary to restrict unauthorized access 
to areas in which such information is stored. Any vault used for the 
storage of sensitive compartmented information shall be configured to 
the specifications of the Director of Central Intelligence. Prior to an 
office or bureau operating such a vault, formal written certification 
for its use must first be obtained from the Special Assistant to the 
Secretary (National Security) as the senior Treasury official of the 
Intelligence Community.
    (2) Secret and Confidential. Secret and Confidential information 
shall be stored in a manner and under the conditions prescribed for Top 
Secret information, or in a container, vault, or alarmed area that meets 
the standards for Secret or Confidential information established under 
the provisions of Sec. 2.25. Secret and Confidential information may 
also be stored in a safe-type filing cabinet having a built-in, three-
position, dial-type, changeable, combination lock, and may continue to 
be stored in a steel filing cabinet equipped with a steel lock-bar 
secured by a GSA-approved three-position, dial-type, changeable, 
combination padlock. The modification, however, of steel filing cabinets 
to barlock-type as storage equipment for classified information and 
material is prohibited and efforts are to be made to selectively phase 
out the use of such barlock cabinets for storage of Secret information. 
Exceptions may be authorized only by the Departmental Director of 
Security upon written request from the designated bureau security 
officer. The designated security officer in each Treasury bureau and the 
Departmental Offices shall prescribe those supplementary controls deemed 
necessary to restrict unauthorized access to areas in which such 
information is stored. Access to bulky Secret and Confidential material 
in weapons storage areas, strong rooms, evidence vaults, closed areas or 
similar facilities shall be controlled in accordance with requirements 
approved by the Department. At a minimum, such requirements shall 
prescribe the use of GSA-approved, key-operated, high-security padlocks. 
For Secret and Confidential information stored outside the United 
States, it shall be stored in the manner authorized for Top Secret, in a 
GSA-approved safe file, or in a barlick cabinet equipped with a 
security-approved combination padlock if the cabinet is located in a 
security-approved vault and/or in a restricted area to which access is 
controlled by United States citizen personnel on a 24-hour basis.
    (b) Combinations--(1) Equipment in Service. Combinations to dial-
type, changeable, combination locks shall be

[[Page 100]]

changed only by persons having an appropriate security clearance, and 
shall be changed,
    (i) Whenever such equipment is placed in use;
    (ii) Whenever a person knowing the combination no longer requires 
access to it;
    (iii) Whenever a combination has been subjected to possible 
compromise;
    (iv) Whenever the equipment is taken out of service: or
    (v) At least once each year.

Knowledge of combinations shall be limited to the minimum number of 
persons necessary for operating purposes. Records of combinations shall 
be classified no lower than the highest level of classified information 
that is protected by the combination lock. When securing a combination 
lock, the dial must be turned at least four (4) complete times in the 
same direction after closing. Defects in or malfunctioning of storage 
equipment protecting classified national security or officially limited 
information must be reported immediately to the designated office or 
bureau security official for appropriate action.
    (2) Equipment Out of Service. When security equipment, used for the 
storage of classified national security or officially limited 
information, is taken out of service, it shall be physically inspected 
to ensure that no classified information or officialy limited 
information remains therein. Built-in, three-position, dial-type, 
changeable, combination locks shall be reset to the standard combination 
50-25-50 and combination padlocks shall be reset to the standard 
combination 10-20-30. The designated security officer in each Treasury 
bureau and the Departmental Offices shall prescribe such supplementary 
controls deemed necessary to fulfill their individual needs to be 
consistent with Sec. 2.27.
    (3) Security Container Check Sheet. Each piece of security equipment 
used for the storage of classified information will have attached 
conspicuously to the outside a Standard Form 702 (Security Container 
Check Sheet) on which an authorized person will record the date and 
actual time each business day that they initially unlock and finally 
lock the security equipment, followed by their initials. Users of this 
form are to avoid citations which reflect the opening, locking and 
checking of the security equipment at standardized (non-actual) times, 
e.g., opened at 8:00 a.m. and closed/checked at 4:00 p.m. Bureaus and 
the Departmental Offices may continue to use Optional Form 62 (Safe or 
Cabinet Security Record) in lieu of the SF 702 until September 30, 1990, 
or such time as their supplies of Optional Form 62 are exhausted. The 
reprinting or photostatic reproduction and use of Optional Form 62 is 
not authorized. On each normal workday, regardless of whether the 
security equipment was opened on that particular day, the security 
equipment shall be checked by authorized personnel to assure that no 
surreptitious attempt has been made to penetrate the security equipment. 
Such examinations normally consist of a quick or casual visual check to 
note either any obvious marks or gashes, or defects or malfunction of 
the security equipment which are different from their prior observations 
or experience in operating the equipment concerned. Any such 
discrepancies in the appearance of or functioning of the security 
equipment, based upon this visual check, should be reported to 
appropriate security officials. The ``Checked By'' column of the SF 702 
or Optional Form 62 shall be annotated to reflect the date and time of 
this action followed by that person's initials. Security equipment used 
for the storage of classified information that has been opened on a 
particular day shall not be left unattended at the end of that day until 
it has been locked by an authorized person and checked by a second 
person. In the event a second person is not available within the office, 
the individual who locked the equipment shall also annotate the 
``Checked By'' column of the SF 702 or Optional Form 62. Reversible 
``OPEN-CLOSED'' or ``LOCKED-UNLOCKED'' signs, available through normal 
supply channels, shall also be used on such security equipment. The 
respective side of the sign shall be displayed to indicate when the 
container is open or closed. Except for the SF 702 or Optional Form 62, 
the top surface area of security equipment is not to be used for

[[Page 101]]

storage and must be kept free of extraneous material. SF 702 and/or 
Optional Form 62 shall be utilized on all security equipment used for 
storing information bearing the control legend ``Limited Official Use''. 
The designated security officer in each Treasury bureau and the 
Department Offices may, as warranted, prescribe supplementary use of the 
SF 702 or Optional Form 62 to apply to other authorized legends approved 
by the Department for officially limited information.
    (4) Safe Combination Records. Combinations to security equipment 
containing classified information shall be recorded on Standard Form 700 
(Security Container Information), national stock number 7540-01-214-
5372. Bureaus and the Departmental Offices may continue to use Treasury 
Form 4032 (Security Container Information) in lieu of the SF 700 until 
September 30, 1990, or such time as their supplies of Treasury Form 4032 
are exhausted. The reprinting of Treasury Form 4032 is not authorized. 
Each part of the SF 700 shall be completed in its entirety. The names, 
addresses and home telephone numbers of personnel responsible for the 
combination, and the classified information stored therein, must be 
indicated on part 1 of the SF 700. The completed part 1 shall be posted 
in the front interior of the top, control or locking drawer of the 
security equipment concerned. Part 2 shall be inserted in the envelop 
(part 2A) provided, and forwarded via appropriate secure means to the 
designated bureau or Departmental Offices central repository for 
security combinations. Part 2 shall have the highest level of classified 
information, stored in the security equipment concerned, annotated in 
both the top and bottom border areas of the completed SF 700. Part 2A 
shall have the highest level of classified information, stored in the 
security equipment concerned, annotated in the blank space immediately 
above the word, ``WARNING'' which appears on the SF 700. The completion 
of the SF 700 or Treasury Form 4032 does not constitute a classification 
action but serves as an administrative requirement to ensure the 
protection of classified information stored in such security equipment. 
SF 700 shall be utilized on all security equipment used for storing 
information bearing the control legend ``Limited Official Use''. The 
designated security officer in each Treasury bureau and the Departmental 
Offices may prescribe supplementary use of the SF 700 to apply to other 
authorized legends approved by the Department for officially limited 
information, as warranted.
    (c) Keys. The designated security officer in each Treasury bureau 
and the Departmental Offices shall establish administrative procedures 
for the control and accountability of keys and locks whenever key-
operated, high-security padlocks are utilized. The level of protection 
provided such keys shall be equivalent to that afforded the information 
being protected by the padlock.
    (d) Classified Document Cover Sheets. Classified document cover 
sheets alert personnel that documents or folders are classified and 
require protection from unauthorized scrutiny. Individuals who prepare 
or package classified documents are responsible for affixing the 
appropriate document cover sheet. Orange Standard Form 703 (Top Secret 
Cover Sheet), red SF 704 (Secret Cover Sheet) and blue SF 706 
(Confidential Cover Sheet) are the only authorized cover sheets for 
collateral classified information. The national stock numbers of these 
cover sheets are as follows: SF 703, 7540-01-213-7901; SF 704, 7540-01-
213-7902; and SF 705, 7540-01-213-7903. In order to maintain the 
integrity of the color coding process the photocopying and use of non-
color coded classified document cover sheets is prohibited. Bureaus and 
offices shall maintain a supply of classified document cover sheets 
appropriate for their needs. Classified document cover sheets are 
designed to be reused and will be removed before classified information 
is filed to conserve filing space and prior to the destruction of 
classified information. Document cover sheets are to be used to shield 
classified documents while in use and particularly when the transmission 
is made internally within a headquarters by courier, messenger or by 
personal contact. File folders containing classified information should 
be otherwise marked, e.g., at the top and bottom of the front and

[[Page 102]]

back covers, to indicate the overall classification of the contents 
rather than permanently affixing the respective classified document 
cover sheet. Treasury Directive 71-02 provides for the use of a green 
cover sheet, TD F 71-01.6 (Limited Official Use Document Cover Sheet) 
for information bearing the control legend ``Limited Official Use''. 
Bureaus or offices electing to create and use other cover sheets for 
officially limited information must obtain prior written approval from 
the Departmental Director of Security.
    (e) Activity Security Checklist. Standard Form 701 (Activity 
Security Checklist) provides a systematic means to make a thorough end-
of-day security inspection for a particular work area and to allow for 
employee accountability in the event that irregularities are discovered. 
Bureaus and the Departmental Offices may include additional information 
on the SF 701 to suit their unique needs. The SF 701, available through 
normal supply channels has a national stock number of 7540-01-213-7900. 
It shall be the only form used in situations that call for use of an 
activity security checklist. Completion, storage and disposition of SF 
701 will be determined by each bureau and the Departmental Offices.


<R05>
Sec. 2.28  Transmittal [4.1(b)].

    (a) Preparation. Classified information to be transmitted outside of 
a Treasury facility shall be enclosed in opaque inner and outer covers. 
The inner cover shall be a sealed wrapper or envelope plainly marked 
with the assigned security classification and addresses of both sender 
and addressee. The outer cover shall be sealed and addressed with no 
identification of the classification of its contents. Whenever 
classified material is to be transmitted and the size of the material is 
not suitable for use of envelopes or similar wrappings, it shall be 
enclosed in two opaque sealed containers, such as boxes or heavy 
wrappings. Material used for packaging such bulk classified information 
shall be of sufficient strength and durability as to provide security 
protection while in transit, to prevent items from breaking out of the 
container, and to facilitate detection of any tampering therewith.
    (b) Receipting. A receipt, Treasury Department Form 71-01.5 
(Classified Document Record of Transmittal), shall be enclosed in the 
inner cover, except that Confidential and Limited Official Use 
information shall require a receipt only if the sender deems it 
necessary. The receipt shall identify the sender, addressee and describe 
the document, but shall contain no classified information. It shall be 
immediately signed by the recipient and returned to the sender. Within a 
Treasury facility, such information may be transmitted between offices 
by direct contact of the officials concerned in a single sealed opaque 
envelope with no security classification category being shown on the 
outside of the envelope. Classified information shall never be delivered 
to unoccupied offices or rooms. Senders of classified information should 
maintain appropriate records of outstanding receipts for which return of 
the original signed copy is still pending. TD F's 71-01.5 shall be 
maintained for a three year period after which they may be destroyed. No 
record of the actual destruction of the TD F 71-01.5 is required.
    (c) Transmittal of Top Secret. The transmittal of Top Secret 
information outside of a Treasury facility shall be by specifically 
designated personnel, by State Department diplomatic pouch, by a 
messenger-courier system authorized for that purpose, e.g., Defense 
Courier Service, or over authorized secure communications circuits. Top 
Secret information may not be sent via registered mail.
    (d) Transmittal of Secret. The transmittal of Secret information 
shall be effected in the following manner:
    (1) The 50 States, District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Secret 
information may be transmitted within and between the 50 States, the 
District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico by one of the 
means authorized for Top Secret information, by the United States Postal 
Service registered mail or express mail service; or by protective 
services provided by United States air or surface commercial carriers 
under such conditions as may be prescribed by the Departmental Director 
of Security. United States Postal Service express mail service

[[Page 103]]

shall be used only when it is the most effective means to accomplish a 
mission within security, time, cost and accountability constraints. To 
ensure direct delivery to the addressee, the ``Waiver of Signature and 
Indemnity'' block on the United States Postal Service Express Mail Label 
11-B may not be executed under any circumstances. All Secret express 
mail shipments are to be processed through mail distribution centers or 
delivered directly to a United States Postal Service facility or 
representative. The use of external (street side) express mail 
collection boxes is prohibited. Only the express mail services of the 
United States Postal Service are authorized.
    (2) Other Areas. Secret information may be transmitted from, to, or 
within areas other than those specified in Sec. 2.28(d)(1) by one of 
the means established for Top Secret information, or by United States 
registered mail through Military Postal Service facilities provided that 
the information does not at any time pass out of United States citizen 
control and does not pass through a foreign postal system. Transmittal 
outside such areas may also be accomplished under escort of 
appropriately cleared personnel aboard United States Government owned 
and United States Government contract vehicles or aircraft, ships of the 
United States Navy, civil service manned United States Naval ships, and 
ships of United States Registry. Operators of vehicles, captains or 
masters of vessels, and pilots of aircraft who are United States 
citizens, and who are appropriately cleared, may be designated as 
escorts. Secret information may not be sent via certified mail.
    (e) Transmittal of Confidential and Limited Official Use 
Information. Confidential and Limited Official Use information shall be 
transmitted within and between the 50 States, the District of Columbia, 
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and United States territories or 
possessions by one of the means established for higher classifications, 
or by the United States Postal Service registered mail. Outside these 
areas, confidential and Limited Official Use information shall be 
transmitted only as is authorized for higher classifications. 
Confidential and Limited Official Use information may not be sent via 
certified mail.
    (f) Hand Carrying of Classified Information in Travel Status--(1) 
General Provisions. Personnel in travel status shall physically 
transport classified information across international boundaries only 
when absolutely essential. Whenever possible, and when time permits, the 
most desirable way to transmit classified information to the location 
being visited is by other authorized means identified in Sec. 2.28 (c), 
(d) and (e). The physical transportation of classified information on 
non-United States flag aircraft should be avoided if possible. Treaury 
Directive 71-03, ``Screening of Airline Passengers Carrying Classified 
Information or Material'' provides specifics on the requirements for 
transporting classified information.
    (2) Specific Safeguards. If it is determined that the transportation 
of classified information by an individual in travel status is in the 
best interest of the United States Government, the following specific 
safeguards shall be fulfilled:
    (i) Classified information shall be in the physical possession of 
the individual and shall have adequate safeguards at all times if proper 
storage at a United States Government facility is not available. Under 
no circumstances shall classified information be stored in a hotel safe 
or room, locked in automobiles, private residences, train compartments, 
or any vehicular detachable storage compartments.
    (ii) An inventory of all Top Secret classified information, 
including teletype messages, shall be made prior to departure and a copy 
of same shall be retained by the traveller's office until the 
traveller's return at which time all Top Secret classified information 
shall be accounted for. These same procedures are recommended for 
information classified Secret, Confidential or Limited Official Use.
    (iii) Classified information shall never be displayed or used in any 
manner in public conveyances or rooms. First class or business travel is 
not authorized when the justification for commercially available 
transportation

[[Page 104]]

is based on the need for reviewing classified materials while enroute. 
Travelers are responsible for reviewing and familiarizing themselves 
with required classified materials, under appropriately secure 
circumstances, in advance of their travel and not during such travel.
    (iv) In order to avoid unnecessary delays in the screening process 
prior to boarding commercial air carriers, the traveler shall have in 
his or her possession written authorization, on Treasury or bureau 
letterhead, to transport classified information and either an 
identification card or credential bearing both a photograph and 
descriptive data. Courier authorizations shall be signed by an 
appropriate security representative authorized to direct official 
travel. This courier authorization, along with official travel orders, 
shall, in most instances, permit the individual to exempt the classified 
information from inspection. If difficulty is encountered, the traveler 
should tactfully refuse to exhibit or disclose the classified 
information to inspection and should insist on the assistance of the 
local United States diplomatic representative at the port of entry or 
departure.
    (v) Upon completion of the visit, the traveler shall have the 
information returned to his or her office by approved means. All Top 
Secret and Secret classified information, including teletype messages 
transported for the purpose of the visit shall be accounted for. It is 
highly recommended that Confidential and Limited Official Use 
information also be accounted for. If any Top Secret or Secret 
classified items are left with the office being visited for its 
retention and use, the individual shall obtain a receipt.

Sec. 2.29  Telecommunications and computer transmissions.

    Classified information shall not be communicated by 
telecommunications or computer transmissions except as may be authorized 
with respect to the transmission of classified information over 
authorized secure communications circuits or systems.


<R05>
Sec. 2.30  Special access programs [1.2(a) and 4.2(a)].

    Only the Secretary of the Treasury may create or continue a special 
access program if:
    (a) Normal management and safeguarding procedures do not limit 
access sufficiently; and
    (b) The number of persons with access is limited to the minimum 
necessary to meet the objective of providing extra protection for the 
information.


<R05>
Sec. 2.31  Reproduction controls [4.1(b)].

    (a) Top Secret documents, except for the controlled initial 
distribution of information processed or received electronically, shall 
not be reproduced without the consent of the originator.
    (b) Unless restricted by the originating agency, Secret, 
Confidential and Limited Official Use documents may be reproduced to the 
extent required by operational needs.
    (c) Reproductions of classified documents shall be subject to the 
same accountability and controls as the original documents.
    (d) Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall not restrict the 
reproduction of documents to facilitate review for possible 
declassification.


<R05>
Sec. 2.32  Loss or possible compromise [4.1(b)].

    (a) Report of Loss or Possible Compromise. Any Treasury employee who 
has knowledge of the loss or possible compromise or classified 
information shall immediately report the circumstances to their 
designated office or bureau security officer who shall take appropriate 
action to assess the degree of damage. In turn, the Departmental 
Director of Security shall be immediately notified by the affected 
office or bureau security officer of such reported loss or possible 
compromise. The Departmental Director of Security shall also notify the 
department or agency which originated the information and any other 
interested department or agency so that a damage assessment may be 
conducted and appropriate measures taken to negate or minimize any 
adverse effect of the loss or possible compromise. Compromises

[[Page 105]]

may occur through espionage, unauthorized disclosures to the press or 
other members of the public, publication of books and treatises, the 
known loss of classified information or equipment to foreign powers, or 
through various other circumstances.
    (b) Inquiry. The Departmental Director of Security shall notify the 
Assistant Secretary (Management) who shall then direct an immediate 
inquiry to be conducted for the purpose of taking corrective measures 
and assessing damages. Based on the results of this inquiry, it may be 
deemed appropriate to notify the Inspector General who shall determine 
whether the Office of the Inspector General or a Treasury bureau will 
conduct any additional investigation. Upon completion of the 
investigation by the Inspector General, the Inspector General shall 
recommend to the Assistant Secretary (Management) and concurrently to 
the Departmental Director of Security, the appropriate administrative,

authority of the Treasury components involved.
    (c) Content of Damage Assessments. At a minimum, damage assessments 
shall be in writing and contain the following:
    (1) Identification of the source, date and circumstances of the 
compromise.
    (2) Classification and description of the specific information which 
has been lost.
    (3) An analysis and statement of the known or probable damage to the 
national security that has resulted or may result.
    (4) An assessment of the possible advantage to foreign powers 
resulting from the compromise.

    (i) The classification of the information involved should be 
continued without change;
    (ii) The specific information, or parts thereof, shall be modified 
to minimize or nullify the effects of the reported compromise and the 
classification retained;
    (iii) Downgrading, declassification, or upgrading is warranted, and

    (e) Cases Involving More Than One Agency. (1) Whenever a compromise 
involves the classified information or interests of more than one 
agency, the Departmental Director of Security shall advise the other 
affected agencies of the circumstances and findings that affect their

sensitive compartmented information has occurred.


<R05>
Sec. 2.33  Responsibilities of holders [4.1(b)].

    Any person having access to and possession of classified information 
is responsible for protecting it from persons not authorized access, 
i.e., persons who do not possess an appropriate security clearance, and 
who do not possess the required need-to-know. This includes keeping 
classified documents under constant observation and turned face-down or 
covered when not in use and securing such information in approved 
security equipment or facilities whenever it is not under the direct 
supervision of authorized persons. In all instances, such protective 
means must meet accountability requirements prescribed by the 
Department.


<R05>
Sec. 2.34  Inspections [4.1(b)].

    Individuals charged with the custody of classified information shall 
conduct the necessary inspections within their areas to ensure adherence 
to procedural safeguards prescribed to protect classified information. 
Security officers shall ensure that periodic inspections are made to 
determine whether procedural safeguards prescribed by this regulation 
and any bureau implementing regulation are in effect at all times. At a 
minimum such checks shall ensure that all classified information is 
stored in approved security containers, including removable storage 
media, e.g., floppy disks used by word processors that contain 
classified information; burn bags, if utilized, are either stored in 
approved security containers or destroyed; and classified shorthand 
notes, carbon paper, carbon and plastic typewriter ribbons, rough drafts 
and similar papers have been properly stored or destroyed.


<R05>
Sec. 2.35  Security violations.

    Any individual, at any level of employment, determined to have been 
responsible for the unauthorized release or disclosure or potential 
release or disclosure of classified national security information, 
whether it be knowingly, willfully or through negligence, shall be 
notified on TD F 71-21.1 (Record of Security Violation) that his or her 
action is in violation of this regulation, the Order, the Directive, and 
Executive Order 10450, as amended. Treasury Directive 71-04, entitled, 
``Administration of Security Violations'' sets forth provisions 
concerning security violations which shall apply to each Treasury 
employee and persons under contract or subcontract to the Department 
authorized access to Treasury classified national security information.
    (a) Repeated abuse of the classification process, either by 
unnecessary or over-classification, or repeated failure, neglect or 
disregard of established requirements for safeguarding classified 
information by any employee shall be grounds for appropriate adverse or 
disciplinary action. Such actions may include, but are not necessarily 
limited to, a letter of warning, a letter of reprimand, suspension 
without pay, or dismissal, as appropriate in the particular case, under 
applicable personnel rules, regulations and procedures. Where a 
violation of criminal statutes may be involved, any such case shall be 
promptly referred to the Department of Justice.
    (b) After an affirmative adjudication of a security violation, and 
as the occasion demands, reports of accountable security violations 
shall be placed in the employee's personnel security file, and as 
appropriate, in the employee's official personnel folder. The security 
official of the office or bureau concerned shall recommend to the 
respective management official or bureau head that disciplinary action 
be taken when such action is indicated.


<R05>
Sec. 2.36  Disposition and destruction [4.1(b)].

    Classified information no longer needed in current working files or 
for reference or record purposes shall be processed for appropriate 
disposition in accordance with the provisions of Title 44, United States 
Code, Chapters 21 and 33, which govern disposition of Federal

[[Page 107]]

records. Classified information approved for destruction shall be 
destroyed by either burning, melting, chemical decomposition, pulping, 
mulching, pulverizing, cross-cut shredding or other mutilation in the 
presence of appropriately cleared and authorized persons. The method of 
destruction must preclude recognition or reconstruction of the 
classified information. The residue from cross-cut shredding of Top 
Secret, Secret, and Confidential classified, non-Communications Security 
(COMSEC), information contained in paper media may not exceed \3/
32\<gr-thn-eq> by \1/2\<gr-thn-eq> with a \1/64\<gr-thn-eq> tolerance.
    (a) Diskettes or Floppy Disks. Diskettes or floppy disks containing 
information or data classified up to and including Top Secret may be 
destroyed by the use of an approved degausser, burning, pulverizing, and 
chemical decomposition, or by first reformatting or reinitializing the 
diskette then physically removing the magnetic disk from its protective 
sleeve and using an approved cross-cut shredder to destroy the magnetic 
media. Care must be exercised to ensure that the destruction of magnetic 
disks does not damage the cross-cut shredder. The residue from such 
destruction, however, may not exceed \1/32\<gr-thn-eq> by \1/
2\<gr-thn-eq> with a \1/64\<gr-thn-eq> tolerance. The destruction of 
classified COMSEC information on diskettes or floppy disks may only be 
effected by burning followed by crushing of the ash residue.
    (b) Hard Disks. Hard disks, including removable hard disks, disk 
packs, drums or single disk platters that contain classified information 
must first be degaussed prior to physical destruction. The media must be 
destroyed by incineration, chemical decomposition or the entire magnetic 
disk pack, drum, or platter recording surface must be obliterated by use 
of an emery wheel or disk sander.
    (c) Approval of Use of Mulching and Cross-cut Shredding Equipment. 
Prior to obtaining mulching or cross-cut shredding equipment, the 
Departmental Director of Security shall approve the use of such 
equipment.
    (d) Use of Burnbags. Any classified information to be destroyed by 
burning shall be torn and placed in opaque containers, commonly 
designated as burnbags, which shall be clearly and distinctly labeled 
``BURN'' or ``CLASSIFIED WASTE''. Burnbags awaiting destruction are to 
be protected by security safeguards commensurate with the classification 
or control designation of the information involved.
    (e) Records of Destruction. Appropriate accountability records shall 
be maintained on TD F 71-01.17 (Classified Document Certificate of 
Destruction) to reflect the destruction of all Top Secret and Secret 
information. As deemed necessary by the originator, or as required by 
special regulations, the TD F 71-01.17 shall be executed for the 
destruction of information classified Confidential or marked Limited 
Official Use. TD F's 71-01.17 shall be maintained for a three-year 
period after which the form may be destroyed. No record of the actual 
destruction of the TD F 71-01.17 is required.
    (f) Destruction of non-record Classified Information. Non-record 
classified information such as extra copies and duplicates, including 
shorthand notes, preliminary drafts, used carbon paper and other 
material of similar temporary nature, shall also be destroyed by 
burning, mulching, or cross-cut shredding as soon as it has served its 
purpose, but no records of such destruction need be maintained.

    The Act of December 28, 1922, 42 Stat. 1066, the Small Claims Act, 
authorized the head of each department and establishment to consider, 
ascertain, adjust, and determine claims of $1,000 or less for damage to, 
or loss of, privately owned property caused by the negligence of any 
officer or employee of the Government acting within the scope of his 
employment. The Federal Tort Claims Act superseded the Small Claims Act 
with respect to claims that are allowable under the former act. 
Therefore, claims that are not allowable under the Federal Tort Claims 
Act, for example, claims arising abroad, may be allowable under the 
Small Claims Act.


<R05>
Sec. 3.21  Action by claimant.

    Procedures and requirements for filing claims under this section 
shall be the same as required for filing claims under the Federal Tort 
Claims Act as set forth in Subpart A of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 3.22  Legal review.

    Claims filed under this subpart shall be forwarded to the legal 
division of the bureau or office out of whose activities the claim 
arose. The claim, together with the reports of the employee and the 
investigation, shall be reviewed in the legal division which shall 
thereupon make a recommendation that the claim be approved, disapproved 
or compromised.


<R05>
Sec. 3.23  Approval of claims.

    Claims shall be approved, disapproved, or compromised by the head of 
the bureau or office or his designee, taking into consideration the 
recommendation of the legal division.


<R05>
Sec. 3.24  Statute of limitations.

    No claim will be considered under this subpart unless filed within 1 
year from the date of the accrual of said claim.

<R05>
Sec. 3.30  Policy.

    (a) The Department of the Treasury may indemnify, in whole or in 
part, a Department employee (which for purposes of this regulation shall 
include a former employee) for any verdict, judgment or other monetary 
award rendered against such employee, provided the Secretary or his or 
her designee determines that (1) the conduct giving rise to such 
verdict, judgment or award was within the scope of his or her employment 
and (2) such indemnification is in the interest of the Department of the 
Treasury.
    (b) The Department of the Treasury may pay for the settlement or 
compromise of a claim against a Department employee at any time, 
provided the Secretary or his or her designee determines that (1) the 
alleged conduct giving rise to the claim was within the scope of the 
employee's employment and (2) such settlement or compromise is in the 
interest of the Department of the Treasury.
    (c) Absent exceptional circumstances, as determined by the Secretary 
or his or her designee, the Department will not entertain a request to 
indemnify or to pay for settlement of a claim before entry of an adverse 
judgment, verdict or other determination.
    (d) When a Department employee becomes aware that he or she has been 
named as a party in a proceeding in his or her individual capacity as a 
result of conduct within the scope of his or her employment, the 
employee should immediately notify his or her supervisor that such an 
action is pending. The supervisor shall promptly thereafter notify the 
chief legal officer of the employee's employing component. The

[[Page 114]]

employee shall immediately apprise the chief legal officer of his or her 
employing component of any offer to settle the proceeding.
    (e) A Department employee may request indemnification to satisfy a 
verdict, judgment or monetary award entered against the employee or to 
compromise a claim pending against the employee. The employee shall 
submit a written request, with appropriate documentation including a 
copy of the verdict, judgment, award or other order or settlement 
proposal, in a timely manner to the Secretary or his or her designee for 
decision.
    (f) Any payment under this section either to indemnify a Department 
employee or to settle a claim shall be contingent upon the availability 
of appropriated funds for the payment of salaries and expenses of the 
employing component.

                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 5.1  What definitions apply to the regulations in this part?

    As used in this part:
    Administrative offset or offset means withholding funds payable by 
the United States (including funds payable by the United States on 
behalf of a State Government) to, or held by the United States for, a 
person to satisfy a debt owed by the person. The term ``administrative 
offset'' includes, but is not limited to, the offset of Federal salary, 
vendor, retirement, and Social Security benefit payments. The terms 
``centralized administrative offset'' and ``centralized offset'' refer 
to the process by which the Treasury Department's Financial Management 
Service offsets Federal payments through the Treasury Offset Program.
    Administrative wage garnishment means the process by which a Federal 
agency orders a non-Federal employer to withhold amounts from a debtor's 
wages to satisfy a debt, as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3720D, 31 CFR 
285.11, and this part.
    Agency or Federal agency means a department, agency, court, court 
administrative office, or instrumentality in the executive, judicial, or 
legislative branch of the Federal Government, including government 
corporations.
    Creditor agency means any Federal agency that is owed a debt.
    Debt means any amount of money, funds or property that has been 
determined by an appropriate official of the Federal Government to be 
owed to the United States by a person. As used in this part, the term 
``debt'' does not include debts arising under the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).
    Debtor means a person who owes a debt to the United States.
    Delinquent debt means a debt that has not been paid by the date 
specified in the agency's initial written demand for payment or 
applicable agreement or instrument (including a post-delinquency payment 
agreement) unless other satisfactory payment arrangements have been 
made.
    Delinquent Treasury debt means a delinquent debt owed to a Treasury 
entity.
    Disposable pay has the same meaning as that term is defined in 5 CFR 
550.1103.
    Employee or Federal employee means a current employee of the 
Treasury Department or other Federal agency, including a current member 
of the Armed Forces, Reserve of the Armed Forces of the United States, 
or the National Guard.
    FCCS means the Federal Claims Collection Standards, which were 
jointly published by the Departments of the Treasury and Justice and 
codified at 31 CFR parts 900-904.
    Financial Management Service means the Financial Management Service, 
a bureau of the Treasury Department, which is responsible for the 
centralized collection of delinquent debts through the offset of Federal 
payments and other means.
    Payment agency or Federal payment agency means any Federal agency 
that transmits payment requests in the form of certified payment 
vouchers, or other similar forms, to a disbursing official for 
disbursement. The ``payment agency'' may be the agency that employs the 
debtor. In some cases, the Treasury Department may be both the creditor 
agency and payment agency.
    Person means an individual, corporation, partnership, association, 
organization, State or local government, or any other type of entity 
other than a Federal agency.
    Salary offset means a type of administrative offset to collect a 
debt owed by a Federal employee from the current pay account of the 
employee.
    Secretary means the Secretary of the Treasury.
    Tax refund offset is defined in 31 CFR 285.2(a).
    Treasury debt means a debt owed to a Treasury entity by a person.
    Treasury Department means the United States Department of the 
Treasury.
    Treasury entity means the Office of Inspector General, the Office of 
Inspector General for Tax Administration, or

[[Page 116]]

a bureau of the Treasury Department, including the Departmental Offices, 
responsible for the collection of the applicable Treasury debt. 
Departmental Offices include, but are not limited to, the Office of D.C. 
Pensions, the Community Development Financial Institution Fund, the 
Executive Office of Asset Forfeiture, and the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control. Other bureaus include, but are not limited to, the Bureau of 
Public Debt; Bureau of Engraving and Printing; U.S. Mint; U.S. Secret 
Service; Customs Service; Financial Management Service; Internal Revenue 
Service; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; Office of Comptroller 
of the Currency; the Office of Thrift Supervision; Federal Law 
Enforcement Training Center; and the Financial Crimes Enforcement 
Network.


<R05>
Sec. 5.2  Why is the Treasury Department issuing these regulations and 
what do they cover?

    (a) Scope. This part provides procedures for the collection of 
Treasury debts. This part also provides procedures for collection of 
other debts owed to the United States when a request for offset of a 
Treasury payment is received by the Treasury Department from another 
agency (for example, when a Treasury Department employee owes a debt to 
the United States Department of Education).
    (b) Applicability. (1) This part applies to the Treasury Department 
when collecting a Treasury debt, to persons who owe Treasury debts, and 
to Federal agencies requesting offset of a payment issued by the 
Treasury Department as a payment agency (including salary payments to 
Treasury Department employees).
    (2) This part does not apply to tax debts nor to any debt for which 
there is an indication of fraud or misrepresentation, as described in 
Sec. 900.3 of the FCCS, unless the debt is returned by the Department 
of Justice to the Treasury Department for handling.
    (3) This part does not apply to the Financial Management Service 
when acting on behalf of other Federal agencies and states to collect 
delinquent debt referred to the Financial Management Service for 
collection action as required or authorized by Federal law. See 31 CFR 
part 285.
    (4) Nothing in this part precludes collection or disposition of any 
debt under statutes and regulations other than those described in this 
part. See, for example, 5 U.S.C. 5705, Advancements and Deductions, 
which authorizes Treasury entities to recover travel advances by offset 
of up to 100% of a Federal employee's accrued pay. See, also, 5 U.S.C. 
4108, governing the collection of training expenses. To the extent that 
the provisions of laws, other regulations, and Treasury Department 
enforcement policies differ from the provisions of this part, those 
provisions of law, other regulations, and Treasury Department 
enforcement policies apply to the remission or mitigation of fines, 
penalties, and forfeitures, and debts arising under the tariff laws of 
the United States, rather than the provisions of this part.
    (c) Additional policies and procedures. Treasury entities may, but 
are not required to, promulgate additional policies and procedures 
consistent with this part, the FCCS, and other applicable Federal law, 
policies, and procedures.
    (d) Duplication not required. Nothing in this part requires a 
Treasury entity to duplicate notices or administrative proceedings 
required by contract, this part, or other laws or regulations.
    (e) Use of multiple collection remedies allowed. Treasury entities 
and other Federal agencies may simultaneously use multiple collection 
remedies to collect a debt, except as prohibited by law. This part is 
intended to promote aggressive debt collection, using for each debt all 
available collection remedies. These remedies are not listed in any 
prescribed order to provide Treasury entities with flexibility in 
determining which remedies will be most efficient in collecting the 
particular debt.


<R05>
Sec. 5.3  Do these regulations adopt the Federal Claims Collection 
Standards (FCCS)?

    This part adopts and incorporates all provisions of the FCCS. This 
part also supplements the FCCS by prescribing procedures consistent with 
the FCCS,

[[Page 117]]

as necessary and appropriate for Treasury Department operations.


<R04>
             Subpart B_Procedures To Collect Treasury Debts


<R05>
Sec. 5.4  What notice will Treasury entities send to a debtor when 
collecting a Treasury debt?

    (a) Notice requirements. Treasury entities shall aggressively 
collect Treasury debts. Treasury entities shall promptly send at least 
one written notice to a debtor informing the debtor of the consequences 
of failing to pay or otherwise resolve a Treasury debt. The notice(s) 
shall be sent to the debtor at the most current address of the debtor in 
the records of the Treasury entity collecting the debt. Generally, 
before starting the collection actions described in Sec. Sec. 5.5 and 
5.9 through 5.17 of this part, Treasury entities will send no more than 
two written notices to the debtor. The purpose of the notice(s) is to 
explain why the debt is owed, the amount of the debt, how a debtor may 
pay the debt or make alternate repayment arrangements, how a debtor may 
review documents related to the debt, how a debtor may dispute the debt, 
the collection remedies available to Treasury entities if the debtor 
refuses to pay the debt, and other consequences to the debtor if the 
debt is not paid. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, the written notice(s) shall explain to the debtor:
    (1) The nature and amount of the debt, and the facts giving rise to 
the debt;
    (2) How interest, penalties, and administrative costs are added to 
the debt, the date by which payment should be made to avoid such 
charges, and that such assessments must be made unless excused in 
accordance with 31 CFR 901.9 (see Sec. 5.5 of this part);
    (3) The date by which payment should be made to avoid the enforced 
collection actions described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section;
    (4) The Treasury entity's willingness to discuss alternative payment 
arrangements and how the debtor may enter into a written agreement to 
repay the debt under terms acceptable to the Treasury entity (see Sec. 
5.6 of this part);
    (5) The name, address, and telephone number of a contact person or 
office within the Treasury entity;
    (6) The Treasury entity's intention to enforce collection if the 
debtor fails to pay or otherwise resolve the debt, by taking one or more 
of the following actions:
    (i) Offset. Offset the debtor's Federal payments, including income 
tax refunds, salary, certain benefit payments (such as Social Security), 
retirement, vendor, travel reimbursements and advances, and other 
Federal payments (see Sec. Sec. 5.10 through 5.12 of this part);
    (ii) Private collection agency. Refer the debt to a private 
collection agency (see Sec. 5.15 of this part);
    (iii) Credit bureau reporting. Report the debt to a credit bureau 
(see Sec. 5.14 of this part);
    (iv) Administrative wage garnishment. Garnish the debtor's wages 
through administrative wage garnishment (see Sec. 5.13 of this part);
    (v) Litigation. Refer the debt to the Department of Justice to 
initiate litigation to collect the debt (see Sec. 5.16 of this part);
    (vi) Treasury Department's Financial Management Service. Refer the 
debt to the Financial Management Service for collection (see Sec. 5.9 
of this part);
    (7) That Treasury debts over 180 days delinquent must be referred to 
the Financial Management Service for the collection actions described in 
paragraph (a)(6) of this section (see Sec. 5.9 of this part);
    (8) How the debtor may inspect and copy records related to the debt;
    (9) How the debtor may request a review of the Treasury entity's 
determination that the debtor owes a debt and present evidence that the 
debt is not delinquent or legally enforceable (see Sec. Sec. 5.10(c) 
and 5.11(c) of this part);
    (10) How a debtor may request a hearing if the Treasury entity 
intends to garnish the debtor's private sector (i.e., non-Federal) wages 
(see Sec. 5.13(a) of this part), including:
    (i) The method and time period for requesting a hearing;
    (ii) That the timely filing of a request for a hearing on or before 
the 15th business day following the date of

[[Page 118]]

the notice will stay the commencement of administrative wage 
garnishment, but not necessarily other collection procedures; and
    (iii) The name and address of the office to which the request for a 
hearing should be sent.
    (11) How a debtor who is a Federal employee subject to Federal 
salary offset may request a hearing (see Sec. 5.12(e) of this part), 
including:
    (i) The method and time period for requesting a hearing;
    (ii) That the timely filing of a request for a hearing on or before 
the 15th calendar day following receipt of the notice will stay the 
commencement of salary offset, but not necessarily other collection 
procedures;
    (iii) The name and address of the office to which the request for a 
hearing should be sent;
    (iv) That the Treasury entity will refer the debt to the debtor's 
employing agency or to the Financial Management Service to implement 
salary offset, unless the employee files a timely request for a hearing;
    (v) That a final decision on the hearing, if requested, will be 
issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 days after 
the filing of the request for a hearing, unless the employee requests 
and the hearing official grants a delay in the proceedings;
    (vi) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, 
representations, or evidence may subject the Federal employee to 
penalties under the False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3731) or other 
applicable statutory authority, and criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. 
286, 287, 1001, and 1002, or other applicable statutory authority;
    (vii) That unless prohibited by contract or statute, amounts paid on 
or deducted for the debt which are later waived or found not owed to the 
United States will be promptly refunded to the employee; and
    (viii) That proceedings with respect to such debt are governed by 5 
U.S.C. 5514 and 31 U.S.C. 3716;
    (12) How the debtor may request a waiver of the debt, if applicable 
(see, for example, Treasury Directive 34-01 (Waiving Claims Against 
Treasury Employees for Erroneous Payments), set forth at Appendix A of 
this part and at http://www.treas.gov/regs);
    (13) How the debtor's spouse may claim his or her share of a joint 
income tax refund by filing Form 8379 with the Internal Revenue Service 
(see http://www.irs.gov)
    (14) How the debtor may exercise other statutory or regulatory 
rights and remedies available to the debtor;
    (15) That certain debtors may be ineligible for Federal Government 
loans, guaranties and insurance (see 31 U.S.C. 3720B, 31 CFR 285.13, and 
Sec. 5.17(a) of this part);
    (16) If applicable, the Treasury entity's intention to suspend or 
revoke licenses, permits or privileges (see Sec. 5.17(b) of this part); 
and
    (17) That the debtor should advise the Treasury entity of a 
bankruptcy proceeding of the debtor or another person liable for the 
debt being collected.
    (b) Exceptions to notice requirements. A Treasury entity may omit 
from a notice to a debtor one or more of the provisions contained in 
paragraphs (a)(6) through (a)(17) of this section if the Treasury 
entity, in consultation with its legal counsel, determines that any 
provision is not legally required given the collection remedies to be 
applied to a particular debt.
    (c) Respond to debtors; comply with FCCS. Treasury entities should 
respond promptly to communications from debtors and comply with other 
FCCS provisions applicable to the administrative collection of debts. 
See 31 CFR part 901.


<R05>
Sec. 5.5  How will Treasury entities add interest, penalty charges, 
and administrative costs to a Treasury debt?

    (a) Assessment and notice. Treasury entities shall assess interest, 
penalties and administrative costs on Treasury debts in accordance with 
the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3717 and 31 CFR 901.9, on Treasury debts. 
Interest shall be charged in accordance with the requirements of 31 
U.S.C. 3717(a). Penalties shall accrue at the rate of 6% per year, or 
such other higher rate as authorized by law. Administrative costs,

[[Page 119]]

that is the costs of processing and handling a delinquent debt, shall be 
determined by the Treasury entity collecting the Treasury debt. Treasury 
entities may have additional policies regarding how interest, penalties, 
and administrative costs are assessed on particular types of debts. 
Treasury entities are required to explain in the notice to the debtor 
described in Sec. 5.4 of this part how interest, penalties, costs, and 
other charges are assessed, unless the requirements are included in a 
contract or repayment agreement.
    (b) Waiver of interest, penalties, and administrative costs. Unless 
otherwise required by law, Treasury entities may not charge interest if 
the amount due on the debt is paid within 30 days after the date from 
which the interest accrues. See 31 U.S.C. 3717(d). Treasury entities may 
waive interest, penalties, and administrative costs, or any portion 
thereof, when it would be against equity and good conscience or not in 
the Treasury entity's best interest to collect such charges, in 
accordance with Treasury guidelines for waiving claims against Treasury 
employees for erroneous overpayments. See Treasury Directive 34-01 
(Waiving Claims Against Treasury Employees for Erroneous Payments) set 
forth at Appendix A of this part and at http://www.treas.gov/regs. Legal 
counsel approval is not required to waive such charges. Cf., Sec. Sec. 
5.7 and 5.8 of this part, which require legal counsel approval when 
compromising a debt or terminating debt collection activity on a debt.
    (c) Accrual during suspension of debt collection. In most cases, 
interest, penalties and administrative costs will continue to accrue 
during any period when collection has been suspended for any reason (for 
example, when the debtor has requested a hearing). Treasury entities may 
suspend accrual of any or all of these charges when accrual would be 
against equity and good conscience or not in the Treasury entity's best 
interest, in accordance with Treasury guidelines for waiving claims 
against Treasury employees for erroneous overpayments. See Treasury 
Directive 34-01 (Waiving Claims Against Treasury Employees for Erroneous 
Payments), set forth at Appendix A of this part and http://
www.treas.gov/regs.


<R05>
Sec. 5.6  When will Treasury entities allow a debtor to pay a Treasury 
debt in installments instead of one lump sum?

    If a debtor is financially unable to pay the debt in one lump sum, a 
Treasury entity may accept payment of a Treasury debt in regular 
installments, in accordance with the provisions of 31 CFR 901.8 and the 
Treasury entity's policies and procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 5.7  When will Treasury entities compromise a Treasury debt?

    If a Treasury entity cannot collect the full amount of a Treasury 
debt, the Treasury entity may compromise the debt in accordance with the 
provisions of 31 CFR part 902 and the Treasury entity's policies and 
procedures. Legal counsel approval to compromise a Treasury debt is 
required as described in Treasury Directive 34-02 (Credit Management and 
Debt Collection), which may be found at http://www.treas.gov/regs.


<R05>
Sec. 5.8  When will Treasury entities suspend or terminate debt 
collection on a Treasury debt?

    If, after pursuing all appropriate means of collection, a Treasury 
entity determines that a Treasury debt is uncollectible, the Treasury 
entity may suspend or terminate debt collection activity in accordance 
with the provisions of 31 CFR part 903 and the Treasury entity's 
policies and procedures. Legal counsel approval to terminate debt 
collection activity is required as described in Treasury Directive 34-02 
(Credit Management and Debt Collection), which may be found at http://
www.treas.gov/regs.


<R05>
Sec. 5.9  When will Treasury entities transfer a Treasury debt to 
the Treasury Department's Financial Management Service for collection?

    (a) Treasury entities will transfer any eligible debt that is more 
than 180 days delinquent to the Financial Management Service for debt 
collection services, a process known as ``cross-servicing.'' See 31 
U.S.C. 3711(g) and 31 CFR 285.12. Treasury entities may transfer debts 
delinquent 180 days or

[[Page 120]]

less to the Financial Management Service in accordance with the 
procedures described in 31 CFR 285.12. The Financial Management Service 
takes appropriate action to collect or compromise the transferred debt, 
or to suspend or terminate collection action thereon, in accordance with 
the statutory and regulatory requirements and authorities applicable to 
the debt and the collection action to be taken. See 31 CFR 285.12(b)(2). 
Appropriate action includes, but is not limited to, contact with the 
debtor, referral of the debt to the Treasury Offset Program, private 
collection agencies or the Department of Justice, reporting of the debt 
to credit bureaus, and administrative wage garnishment.
    (b) At least sixty (60) days prior to transferring a Treasury debt 
to the Financial Management Service, Treasury entities will send notice 
to the debtor as required by Sec. 5.4 of this part. Treasury entities 
will certify to the Financial Management Service, in writing, that the 
debt is valid, delinquent, legally enforceable, and that there are no 
legal bars to collection. In addition, Treasury entities will certify 
their compliance with all applicable due process and other requirements 
as described in this part and other Federal laws. See 31 CFR 285.12(i) 
regarding the certification requirement.
    (c) As part of its debt collection process, the Financial Management 
Service uses the Treasury Offset Program to collect Treasury debts by 
administrative and tax refund offset. See 31 CFR 285.12(g). The Treasury 
Offset Program is a centralized offset program administered by the 
Financial Management Service to collect delinquent debts owed to Federal 
agencies and states (including past-due child support). Under the 
Treasury Offset Program, before a Federal payment is disbursed, the 
Financial Management Service compares the name and taxpayer 
identification number (TIN) of the payee with the names and TINs of 
debtors that have been submitted by Federal agencies and states to the 
Treasury Offset Program database. If there is a match, the Financial 
Management Service (or, in some cases, another Federal disbursing 
agency) offsets all or a portion of the Federal payment, disburses any 
remaining payment to the payee, and pays the offset amount to the 
creditor agency. Federal payments eligible for offset include, but are 
not limited to, income tax refunds, salary, travel advances and 
reimbursements, retirement and vendor payments, and Social Security and 
other benefit payments.


<R05>
Sec. 5.10  How will Treasury entities use administrative offset (offset 
of non-tax Federal payments) to collect a Treasury debt?

    (a) Centralized administrative offset through the Treasury Offset 
Program. (1) In most cases, the Financial Management Service uses the 
Treasury Offset Program to collect Treasury debts by the offset of 
Federal payments. See Sec. 5.9(c) of this part. If not already 
transferred to the Financial Management Service under Sec. 5.9 of this 
part, Treasury entities will refer any eligible debt over 180 days 
delinquent to the Treasury Offset Program for collection by centralized 
administrative offset. See 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(6); 31 CFR part 285, 
subpart A; and 31 CFR 901.3(b). Treasury entities may refer any eligible 
debt less than 180 days delinquent to the Treasury Offset Program for 
offset.
    (2) At least sixty (60) days prior to referring a debt to the 
Treasury Offset Program, in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, Treasury entities will send notice to the debtor in accordance 
with the requirements of Sec. 5.4 of this part. Treasury entities will 
certify to the Financial Management Service, in writing, that the debt 
is valid, delinquent, legally enforceable, and that there are no legal 
bars to collection by offset. In addition, Treasury entities will 
certify their compliance with the requirements described in this part.
    (b) Non-centralized administrative offset for Treasury debts. (1) 
When centralized administrative offset through the Treasury Offset 
Program is not available or appropriate, Treasury entities may collect 
past-due, legally enforceable Treasury debts through non-centralized 
administrative offset. See 31 CFR 901.3(c). In these cases, Treasury 
entities may offset a payment internally or make an offset request 
directly to a Federal payment agency. If

[[Page 121]]

the Federal payment agency is another Treasury entity, the Treasury 
entity making the request shall do so through the Deputy Chief Financial 
Officer as described in Sec. 5.20(c) of this part.
    (2) At least thirty (30) days prior to offsetting a payment 
internally or requesting a Federal payment agency to offset a payment, 
Treasury entities will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 5.4 of this part. When referring a debt for offset 
under this paragraph (b), Treasury entities making the request will 
certify, in writing, that the debt is valid, delinquent, legally 
enforceable, and that there are no legal bars to collection by offset. 
In addition, Treasury entities will certify their compliance with these 
regulations concerning administrative offset. See 31 CFR 
901.3(c)(2)(ii).
    (c) Administrative review. The notice described in Sec. 5.4 of this 
part shall explain to the debtor how to request an administrative review 
of a Treasury entity's determination that the debtor owes a Treasury 
debt and how to present evidence that the debt is not delinquent or 
legally enforceable. In addition to challenging the existence and amount 
of the debt, the debtor may seek a review of the terms of repayment. In 
most cases, Treasury entities will provide the debtor with a ``paper 
hearing'' based upon a review of the written record, including 
documentation provided by the debtor. Treasury entities shall provide 
the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the 
debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the Treasury entity 
determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by 
review of the documentary evidence, for example, when the validity of 
the debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity. Unless otherwise 
required by law, an oral hearing under this section is not required to 
be a formal evidentiary hearing, although Treasury entities should 
carefully document all significant matters discussed at the hearing. 
Treasury entities may suspend collection through administrative offset 
and/or other collection actions pending the resolution of a debtor's 
dispute. Each Treasury entity will have its own policies and procedures 
concerning the administrative review process consistent with the FCCS 
and the regulations in this section.
    (d) Procedures for expedited offset. Under the circumstances 
described in 31 CFR 901.3(b)(4)(iii), Treasury entities may effect an 
offset against a payment to be made to the debtor prior to sending a 
notice to the debtor, as described in Sec. 5.4 of this part, or 
completing the procedures described in paragraph (b)(2) and (c) of this 
section. Treasury entities shall give the debtor notice and an 
opportunity for review as soon as practicable and promptly refund any 
money ultimately found not to have been owed to the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 5.11  How will Treasury entities use tax refund offset to collect 
a Treasury debt?

    (a) Tax refund offset. In most cases, the Financial Management 
Service uses the Treasury Offset Program to collect Treasury debts by 
the offset of tax refunds and other Federal payments. See Sec. 5.9(c) 
of this part. If not already transferred to the Financial Management 
Service under Sec. 5.9 of this part, Treasury entities will refer to 
the Treasury Offset Program any past-due, legally enforceable debt for 
collection by tax refund offset. See 26 U.S.C. 6402(d), 31 U.S.C. 3720A 
and 31 CFR 285.2.
    (b) Notice. At least sixty (60) days prior to referring a debt to 
the Treasury Offset Program, Treasury entities will send notice to the 
debtor in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 5.4 of this part. 
Treasury entities will certify to the Financial Management Service's 
Treasury Offset Program, in writing, that the debt is past-due and 
legally enforceable in the amount submitted and that the Treasury 
entities have made reasonable efforts to obtain payment of the debt as 
described in 31 CFR 285.2(d). In addition, Treasury entities will 
certify their compliance with all applicable due process and other 
requirements described in this part and other Federal laws. See 31 
U.S.C. 3720A(b) and 31 CFR 285.2.
    (c) Administrative review. The notice described in Sec. 5.4 of this 
part shall provide the debtor with at least 60 days

[[Page 122]]

prior to the initiation of tax refund offset to request an 
administrative review as described in Sec. 5.10(c) of this part. 
Treasury entities may suspend collection through tax refund offset and/
or other collection actions pending the resolution of the debtor's 
dispute.


<R05>
Sec. 5.12  How will Treasury entities offset a Federal employee's salary 
to collect a Treasury debt?

    (a) Federal salary offset. (1) Salary offset is used to collect 
debts owed to the United States by Treasury Department and other Federal 
employees. If a Federal employee owes a Treasury debt, Treasury entities 
may offset the employee's Federal salary to collect the debt in the 
manner described in this section. For information on how a Federal 
agency other than a Treasury entity may collect debt from the salary of 
a Treasury Department employee, see Sec. Sec. 5.20 and 5.21, subpart C, 
of this part.
    (2) Nothing in this part requires a Treasury entity to collect a 
Treasury debt in accordance with the provisions of this section if 
Federal law allows otherwise. See, for example, 5 U.S.C. 5705 (travel 
advances not used for allowable travel expenses are recoverable from the 
employee or his estate by setoff against accrued pay and other means) 
and 5 U.S.C. 4108 (recovery of training expenses).
    (3) Treasury entities may use the administrative wage garnishment 
procedure described in Sec. 5.13 of this part to collect a debt from an 
individual's non-Federal wages.
    (b) Centralized salary offset through the Treasury Offset Program. 
As described in Sec. 5.9(a) of this part, Treasury entities will refer 
Treasury debts to the Financial Management Service for collection by 
administrative offset, including salary offset, through the Treasury 
Offset Program. When possible, Treasury entities should attempt salary 
offset through the Treasury Offset Program before applying the 
procedures in paragraph (c) of this section. See 5 CFR 550.1109.
    (c) Non-centralized salary offset for Treasury debts. When 
centralized salary offset through the Treasury Offset Program is not 
available or appropriate, Treasury entities may collect delinquent 
Treasury debts through non-centralized salary offset. See 5 CFR 
550.1109. In these cases, Treasury entities may offset a payment 
internally or make a request directly to a Federal payment agency to 
offset a salary payment to collect a delinquent debt owed by a Federal 
employee. If the Federal payment agency is another Treasury entity, the 
Treasury entity making the request shall do so through the Deputy Chief 
Financial Officer as described in Sec. 5.20(c) of this part. At least 
thirty (30) days prior to offsetting internally or requesting a Federal 
agency to offset a salary payment, Treasury entities will send notice to 
the debtor in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 5.4 of this 
part. When referring a debt for offset, Treasury entities will certify 
to the payment agency, in writing, that the debt is valid, delinquent 
and legally enforceable in the amount stated, and there are no legal 
bars to collection by salary offset. In addition, Treasury entities will 
certify that all due process and other prerequisites to salary offset 
have been met. See 5 U.S.C. 5514, 31 U.S.C. 3716(a), and this section 
for a description of the due process and other prerequisites for salary 
offset.
    (d) When prior notice not required. Treasury entities are not 
required to provide prior notice to an employee when the following 
adjustments are made by a Treasury entity to a Treasury employee's pay:
    (1) Any adjustment to pay arising out of any employee's election of 
coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program 
requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered 
was accumulated over four pay periods or less;
    (2) A routine intra-agency adjustment of pay that is made to correct 
an overpayment of pay attributable to clerical or administrative errors 
or delays in processing pay documents, if the overpayment occurred 
within the four pay periods preceding the adjustment, and, at the time 
of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual 
is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the 
adjustment and point of contact for contesting such adjustment; or
    (3) Any adjustment to collect a debt amounting to $50 or less, if, 
at the time

[[Page 123]]

of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual 
is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the 
adjustment and a point of contact for contesting such adjustment.
    (e) Hearing procedures--(1) Request for a hearing. A Federal 
employee who has received a notice that his or her Treasury debt will be 
collected by means of salary offset may request a hearing concerning the 
existence or amount of the debt. The Federal employee also may request a 
hearing concerning the amount proposed to be deducted from the 
employee's pay each pay period. The employee must send any request for 
hearing, in writing, to the office designated in the notice described in 
Sec. 5.4. See Sec.  5.4(a)(11). The request must be received by the 
designated office on or before the 15th calendar day following the 
employee's receipt of the notice. The employee must sign the request and 
specify whether an oral or paper hearing is requested. If an oral 
hearing is requested, the employee must explain why the matter cannot be 
resolved by review of the documentary evidence alone. All travel 
expenses incurred by the Federal employee in connection with an in-
person hearing will be borne by the employee.
    (2) Failure to submit timely request for hearing. If the employee 
fails to submit a request for hearing within the time period described 
in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the employee will have waived the 
right to a hearing, and salary offset may be initiated. However, 
Treasury entities should accept a late request for hearing if the 
employee can show that the late request was the result of circumstances 
beyond the employee's control or because of a failure to receive actual 
notice of the filing deadline.
    (3) Hearing official. Treasury entities must obtain the services of 
a hearing official who is not under the supervision or control of the 
Secretary. Treasury entities may contact the Deputy Chief Financial 
Officer as described in Sec. 5.20(c) of this part or an agent of any 
agency designated in Appendix A to 5 CFR part 581 (List of Agents 
Designated to Accept Legal Process) to request a hearing official.
    (4) Notice of hearing. After the employee requests a hearing, the 
designated hearing official shall inform the employee of the form of the 
hearing to be provided. For oral hearings, the notice shall set forth 
the date, time and location of the hearing. For paper hearings, the 
notice shall notify the employee of the date by which he or she should 
submit written arguments to the designated hearing official. The hearing 
official shall give the employee reasonable time to submit documentation 
in support of the employee's position. The hearing official shall 
schedule a new hearing date if requested by both parties. The hearing 
official shall give both parties reasonable notice of the time and place 
of a rescheduled hearing.
    (5) Oral hearing. The hearing official will conduct an oral hearing 
if he or she determines that the matter cannot be resolved by review of 
documentary evidence alone (for example, when an issue of credibility or 
veracity is involved). The hearing need not take the form of an 
evidentiary hearing, but may be conducted in a manner determined by the 
hearing official, including but not limited to:
    (i) Informal conferences with the hearing official, in which the 
employee and agency representative will be given full opportunity to 
present evidence, witnesses and argument;
    (ii) Informal meetings with an interview of the employee by the 
hearing official; or
    (iii) Formal written submissions, with an opportunity for oral 
presentation.
    (6) Paper hearing. If the hearing official determines that an oral 
hearing is not necessary, he or she will make the determination based 
upon a review of the available written record, including any 
documentation submitted by the employee in support of his or her 
position.
    (7) Failure to appear or submit documentary evidence. In the absence 
of good cause shown (for example, excused illness), if the employee 
fails to appear at an oral hearing or fails to submit documentary 
evidence as required for a paper hearing, the employee will have waived 
the right to a hearing, and salary offset may be initiated. Further,

[[Page 124]]

the employee will have been deemed to admit the existence and amount of 
the debt as described in the notice of intent to offset. If the Treasury 
entity representative fails to appear at an oral hearing, the hearing 
official shall proceed with the hearing as scheduled, and make his or 
her determination based upon the oral testimony presented and the 
documentary evidence submitted by both parties.
    (8) Burden of proof. Treasury entities will have the initial burden 
to prove the existence and amount of the debt. Thereafter, if the 
employee disputes the existence or amount of the debt, the employee must 
prove by a preponderance of the evidence that no debt exists or that the 
amount of the debt is incorrect. In addition, the employee may present 
evidence that the proposed terms of the repayment schedule are unlawful, 
would cause a financial hardship to the employee, or that collection of 
the debt may not be pursued due to operation of law.
    (9) Record. The hearing official shall maintain a summary record of 
any hearing provided by this part. Witnesses will testify under oath or 
affirmation in oral hearings.
    (10) Date of decision. The hearing official shall issue a written 
opinion stating his or her decision, based upon documentary evidence and 
information developed at the hearing, as soon as practicable after the 
hearing, but not later than 60 days after the date on which the request 
for hearing was received by the Treasury entity. If the employee 
requests a delay in the proceedings, the deadline for the decision may 
be postponed by the number of days by which the hearing was postponed. 
When a decision is not timely rendered, the Treasury entity shall waive 
penalties applied to the debt for the period beginning with the date the 
decision is due and ending on the date the decision is issued.
    (11) Content of decision. The written decision shall include:
    (i) A statement of the facts presented to support the origin, 
nature, and amount of the debt;
    (ii) The hearing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and
    (iii) The terms of any repayment schedules, if applicable.
    (12) Final agency action. The hearing official's decision shall be 
final.
    (f) Waiver not precluded. Nothing in this part precludes an employee 
from requesting waiver of an overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584 or 8346(b), 
10 U.S.C. 2774, 32 U.S.C. 716, or other statutory authority.
    (g) Salary offset process--(1) Determination of disposable pay. The 
office of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer will consult with the 
appropriate Treasury entity payroll office to determine the amount of a 
Treasury Department employee's disposable pay (as defined in Sec. 5.1 
of this part) and will implement salary offset when requested to do so 
by a Treasury entity, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, or 
another agency, as described in Sec. 5.20 of this part. If the debtor 
is not employed by the Treasury Department, the agency employing the 
debtor will determine the amount of the employee's disposable pay and 
will implement salary offset upon request.
    (2) When salary offset begins. Deductions shall begin within three 
official pay periods following receipt of the creditor agency's request 
for offset.
    (3) Amount of salary offset. The amount to be offset from each 
salary payment will be up to 15 percent of a debtor's disposable pay, as 
follows:
    (i) If the amount of the debt is equal to or less than 15 percent of 
the disposable pay, such debt generally will be collected in one lump 
sum payment;
    (ii) Installment deductions will be made over a period of no greater 
than the anticipated period of employment. An installment deduction will 
not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is 
made unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a 
greater amount or the creditor agency has determined that smaller 
deductions are appropriate based on the employee's ability to pay.
    (4) Final salary payment. After the employee has separated either 
voluntarily or involuntarily from the payment agency, the payment agency 
may make a lump sum deduction exceeding 15 percent of disposable pay 
from any final salary or other payments pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 in 
order to satisfy a debt.

[[Page 125]]

    (h) Payment agency's responsibilities. (1) As required by 5 CFR 
550.1109, if the employee separates from the payment agency from which a 
Treasury entity has requested salary offset, the payment agency must 
certify the total amount of its collection and notify the Treasury 
entity and the employee of the amounts collected. If the payment agency 
is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil 
Service Retirement Fund and Disability Fund, the Federal Employee 
Retirement System, or other similar payments, it must provide written 
notification to the payment agency responsible for making such payments 
that the debtor owes a debt, the amount of the debt, and that the 
Treasury entity has complied with the provisions of this section. 
Treasury entities must submit a properly certified claim to the new 
payment agency before the collection can be made.
    (2) If the employee is already separated from employment and all 
payments due from his or her former payment agency have been made, 
Treasury entities may request that money due and payable to the employee 
from the Civil Service Retirement Fund and Disability Fund, the Federal 
Employee Retirement System, or other similar funds, be administratively 
offset to collect the debt. Generally, Treasury entities will collect 
such monies through the Treasury Offset Program as described in Sec. 
5.9(c) of this part.
    (3) When an employee transfers to another agency, Treasury entities 
should resume collection with the employee's new payment agency in order 
to continue salary offset.


<R05>
Sec. 5.13  How will Treasury entities use administrative wage garnishment 
to collect a Treasury debt from a debtor's wages?

    (a) Treasury entities are authorized to collect debts from a 
debtor's wages by means of administrative wage garnishment in accordance 
with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720D and 31 CFR 285.11. This part 
adopts and incorporates all of the provisions of 31 CFR 285.11 
concerning administrative wage garnishment, including the hearing 
procedures described in 31 CFR 285.11(f). Treasury entities may use 
administrative wage garnishment to collect a delinquent Treasury debt 
unless the debtor is making timely payments under an agreement to pay 
the debt in installments (see Sec. 5.6 of this part). At least thirty 
(30) days prior to initiating an administrative wage garnishment, 
Treasury entities will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 5.4 of this part, including the requirements of 
Sec. 5.4(a)(10) of this part. For Treasury debts referred to the 
Financial Management Service under Sec. 5.9 of this part, Treasury 
entities may authorize the Financial Management Service to send a notice 
informing the debtor that administrative wage garnishment will be 
initiated and how the debtor may request a hearing as described in Sec. 
5.4(a)(10) of this part. If a debtor makes a timely request for a 
hearing, administrative wage garnishment will not begin until a hearing 
is held and a decision is sent to the debtor. See 31 CFR 285.11(f)(4). 
If a debtor's hearing request is not timely, Treasury entities may 
suspend collection by administrative wage garnishment in accordance with 
the provisions of 31 CFR 285.11(f)(5). All travel expenses incurred by 
the debtor in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the 
debtor.
    (b) This section does not apply to Federal salary offset, the 
process by which Treasury entities collect debts from the salaries of 
Federal employees (see Sec. 5.12 of this part).


<R05>
Sec. 5.14  How will Treasury entities report Treasury debts to credit 
bureaus?

    Treasury entities shall report delinquent Treasury debts to credit 
bureaus in accordance with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3711(e), 31 CFR 
901.4, and the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-129, 
``Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Nontax Receivables.'' For 
additional information, see Financial Management Service's ``Guide to 
the Federal Credit Bureau Program,'' which may be found at http://
www.fms.treas.gov/debt. At least sixty (60) days prior to reporting a 
delinquent debt to a consumer reporting agency, Treasury entities will 
send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 
5.4 of this part.

[[Page 126]]

Treasury entities may authorize the Financial Management Service to 
report to credit bureaus those delinquent Treasury debts that have been 
transferred to the Financial Management Service under Sec. 5.9 of this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 5.15  How will Treasury entities refer Treasury debts to private 
collection agencies?

    Treasury entities will transfer delinquent Treasury debts to the 
Financial Management Service to obtain debt collection services provided 
by private collection agencies. See Sec. 5.9 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 5.16  When will Treasury entities refer Treasury debts to the 
Department of Justice?

    (a) Compromise or suspension or termination of collection activity. 
Treasury entities shall refer Treasury debts having a principal balance 
over $100,000, or such higher amount as authorized by the Attorney 
General, to the Department of Justice for approval of any compromise of 
a debt or suspension or termination of collection activity. See 
Sec. Sec. 5.7 and 5.8 of this part; 31 CFR 902.1; 31 CFR 903.1.
    (b) Litigation. Treasury entities shall promptly refer to the 
Department of Justice for litigation delinquent Treasury debts on which 
aggressive collection activity has been taken in accordance with this 
part and that should not be compromised, and on which collection 
activity should not be suspended or terminated. See 31 CFR part 904. 
Treasury entities may authorize the Financial Management Service to 
refer to the Department of Justice for litigation those delinquent 
Treasury debts that have been transferred to the Financial Management 
Service under Sec. 5.9 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 5.17  Will a debtor who owes a Treasury debt be ineligible for 
Federal loan assistance or Federal licenses, permits or privileges?

    (a) Delinquent debtors barred from obtaining Federal loans or loan 
insurance or guaranties. As required by 31 U.S.C. 3720B and 31 CFR 
901.6, Treasury entities will not extend financial assistance in the 
form of a loan, loan guarantee, or loan insurance to any person 
delinquent on a debt owed to a Federal agency. This prohibition does not 
apply to disaster loans. Treasury entities may extend credit after the 
delinquency has been resolved. See 31 CFR 285.13 for standards defining 
when a ``delinquency'' is ``resolved'' for purposes of this prohibition.
    (b) Suspension or revocation of eligibility for licenses, permits, 
or privileges. Unless prohibited by law, Treasury entities should 
suspend or revoke licenses, permits, or other privileges for any 
inexcusable or willful failure of a debtor to pay a debt. The Treasury 
entity responsible for distributing the licenses, permits, or other 
privileges will establish policies and procedures governing suspension 
and revocation for delinquent debtors. If applicable, Treasury entities 
will advise the debtor in the notice required by Sec. 5.4 of this part 
of the Treasury entities' ability to suspend or revoke licenses, permits 
or privileges. See Sec. 5.4(a)(16) of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 5.18  How does a debtor request a special review based on a change 
in circumstances such as catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability?

    (a) Material change in circumstances. A debtor who owes a Treasury 
debt may, at any time, request a special review by the applicable 
Treasury entity of the amount of any offset, administrative wage 
garnishment, or voluntary payment, based on materially changed 
circumstances beyond the control of the debtor such as, but not limited 
to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability.
    (b) Inability to pay. For purposes of this section, in determining 
whether an involuntary or voluntary payment would prevent the debtor 
from meeting essential subsistence expenses (costs incurred for food, 
housing, clothing, transportation, and medical care), the debtor shall 
submit a detailed statement and supporting documents for the debtor, his 
or her spouse, and dependents, indicating:
    (1) Income from all sources;
    (2) Assets;
    (3) Liabilities;
    (4) Number of dependents;
    (5) Expenses for food, housing, clothing, and transportation;
    (6) Medical expenses; and
    (7) Exceptional expenses, if any.

[[Page 127]]

    (c) Alternative payment arrangement. If the debtor requests a 
special review under this section, the debtor shall submit an 
alternative proposed payment schedule and a statement to the Treasury 
entity collecting the debt, with supporting documents, showing why the 
current offset, garnishment or repayment schedule imposes an extreme 
financial hardship on the debtor. The Treasury entity will evaluate the 
statement and documentation and determine whether the current offset, 
garnishment, or repayment schedule imposes extreme financial hardship on 
the debtor. The Treasury entity shall notify the debtor in writing of 
such determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset, 
garnishment, or payment schedule. If the special review results in a 
revised offset, garnishment, or repayment schedule, the Treasury entity 
will notify the appropriate agency or other persons about the new terms.


<R05>
Sec. 5.19  Will Treasury entities issue a refund if money is erroneously 
collected on a debt?

    Treasury entities shall promptly refund to a debtor any amount 
collected on a Treasury debt when the debt is waived or otherwise found 
not to be owed to the United States, or as otherwise required by law. 
Refunds under this part shall not bear interest unless required by law.


<R04>
   Subpart C_Procedures for Offset of Treasury Department Payments To 
              Collect Debts Owed to Other Federal Agencies


<R05>
Sec. 5.20  How do other Federal agencies use the offset process to 
collect debts from payments issued by a Treasury entity?

    (a) Offset of Treasury entity payments to collect debts owed to 
other Federal agencies. (1) In most cases, Federal agencies submit 
eligible debts to the Treasury Offset Program to collect delinquent 
debts from payments issued by Treasury entities and other Federal 
agencies, a process known as ``centralized offset.'' When centralized 
offset is not available or appropriate, any Federal agency may ask a 
Treasury entity (when acting as a ``payment agency'') to collect a debt 
owed to such agency by offsetting funds payable to a debtor by the 
Treasury entity, including salary payments issued to Treasury entity 
employees. This section and Sec. 5.21 of this subpart C apply when a 
Federal agency asks a Treasury entity to offset a payment issued by the 
Treasury entity to a person who owes a debt to the United States.
    (2) This subpart C does not apply to Treasury debts. See Sec. Sec. 
5.10 through 5.12 of this part for offset procedures applicable to 
Treasury debts.
    (3) This subpart C does not apply to the collection of non-Treasury 
debts through tax refund offset. See 31 CFR 285.2 for tax refund offset 
procedures.
    (b) Administrative offset (including salary offset); certification. 
A Treasury entity will initiate a requested offset only upon receipt of 
written certification from the creditor agency that the debtor owes the 
past-due, legally enforceable debt in the amount stated, and that the 
creditor agency has fully complied with all applicable due process and 
other requirements contained in 31 U.S.C. 3716, 5 U.S.C. 5514, and the 
creditor agency's regulations, as applicable. Offsets will continue 
until the debt is paid in full or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction 
of the creditor agency.
    (c) Where a creditor agency makes requests for offset. Requests for 
offset under this section shall be sent to the U.S. Department of the 
Treasury, ATTN: Deputy Chief Financial Officer, 1500 Pennsylvania 
Avenue, NW., Attention: Metropolitan Square, Room 6228, Washington, DC 
20220. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer will forward the request to 
the appropriate Treasury entity for processing in accordance with this 
subpart C.
    (d) Incomplete certification. A Treasury entity will return an 
incomplete debt certification to the creditor agency with notice that 
the creditor agency must comply with paragraph (b) of this section 
before action will be taken to collect a debt from a payment issued by a 
Treasury entity.
    (e) Review. A Treasury entity is not authorized to review the merits 
of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or 
validity of

[[Page 128]]

the debt certified by the creditor agency.
    (f) When Treasury entities will not comply with offset request. A 
Treasury entity will comply with the offset request of another agency 
unless the Treasury entity determines that the offset would not be in 
the best interests of the United States, or would otherwise be contrary 
to law.
    (g) Multiple debts. When two or more creditor agencies are seeking 
offsets from payments made to the same person, or when two or more debts 
are owed to a single creditor agency, the Treasury entity that has been 
asked to offset the payments may determine the order in which the debts 
will be collected or whether one or more debts should be collected by 
offset simultaneously.
    (h) Priority of debts owed to Treasury entity. For purposes of this 
section, debts owed to a Treasury entity generally take precedence over 
debts owed to other agencies. The Treasury entity that has been asked to 
offset the payments may determine whether to pay debts owed to other 
agencies before paying a debt owed to a Treasury entity. The Treasury 
entity that has been asked to offset the payments will determine the 
order in which the debts will be collected based on the best interests 
of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 5.21  What does a Treasury entity do upon receipt of a request to 
offset the salary of a Treasury entity employee to collect a debt owed 
by the employee to another Federal agency?

    (a) Notice to the Treasury employee. When a Treasury entity receives 
proper certification of a debt owed by one of its employees, the 
Treasury entity will begin deductions from the employee's pay at the 
next officially established pay interval. The Treasury entity will send 
a written notice to the employee indicating that a certified debt claim 
has been received from the creditor agency, the amount of the debt 
claimed to be owed by the creditor agency, the date deductions from 
salary will begin, and the amount of such deductions.
    (b) Amount of deductions from Treasury employee's salary. The amount 
deducted under Sec. 5.20(b) of this part will be the lesser of the 
amount of the debt certified by the creditor agency or an amount up to 
15% of the debtor's disposable pay. Deductions shall continue until the 
Treasury entity knows that the debt is paid in full or until otherwise 
instructed by the creditor agency. Alternatively, the amount offset may 
be an amount agreed upon, in writing, by the debtor and the creditor 
agency. See Sec. 5.12(g) (salary offset process).
    (c) When the debtor is no longer employed by the Treasury entity--
(1) Offset of final and subsequent payments. If a Treasury entity 
employee retires or resigns or if his or her employment ends before 
collection of the debt is complete, the Treasury entity will continue to 
offset, under 31 U.S.C. 3716, up to 100% of an employee's subsequent 
payments until the debt is paid or otherwise resolved. Such payments 
include a debtor's final salary payment, lump-sum leave payment, and 
other payments payable to the debtor by the Treasury entity. See 31 
U.S.C. 3716 and 5 CFR 550.1104(l) and 550.1104(m).
    (2) Notice to the creditor agency. If the employee is separated from 
the Treasury entity before the debt is paid in full, the Treasury entity 
will certify to the creditor agency the total amount of its collection. 
If the Treasury entity is aware that the employee is entitled to 
payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, Federal 
Employee Retirement System, or other similar payments, the Treasury 
entity will provide written notice to the agency making such payments 
that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount) and that the 
provisions of 5 CFR 550.1109 have been fully complied with. The creditor 
agency is responsible for submitting a certified claim to the agency 
responsible for making such payments before collection may begin. 
Generally, creditor agencies will collect such monies through the 
Treasury Offset Program as described in Sec. 5.9(c) of this part.
    (3) Notice to the debtor. The Treasury entity will provide to the 
debtor a copy of any notices sent to the creditor agency under paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section.
    (d) When the debtor transfers to another Federal agency--(1) Notice 
to the creditor agency. If the debtor transfers to another Federal 
agency before the

[[Page 129]]

debt is paid in full, the Treasury entity will notify the creditor 
agency and will certify the total amount of its collection on the debt. 
The Treasury entity will provide a copy of the certification to the 
creditor agency. The creditor agency is responsible for submitting a 
certified claim to the debtor's new employing agency before collection 
may begin.
    (2) Notice to the debtor. The Treasury entity will provide to the 
debtor a copy of any notices and certifications sent to the creditor 
agency under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (e) Request for hearing official. A Treasury entity will provide a 
hearing official upon the creditor agency's request with respect to a 
Treasury entity employee. See 5 CFR 550.1107(a).

 Appendix A to Part 5--Treasury Directive 34-01--Waiving Claims Against 
                Treasury Employees for Erroneous Payments

                        Treasury Directive 34-01

    Date: July 12, 2000.
    Sunset Review: July 12, 2004.
    Subject: Waiving Claims Against Treasury Employees for Erroneous 
Payments.

                               1. Purpose

    This Directive establishes the Department of the Treasury's policies 
and procedures for waiving claims by the Government against an employee 
for erroneous payments of: (1) Pay and allowances (e.g., health and life 
insurance) and (2) travel, transportation, and relocation expenses and 
allowances.

                              2. Background

    a. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 5584 authorizes the waiver of claims by the United 
States in whole or in part against an employee arising out of erroneous 
payments of pay and allowances, travel, transportation, and relocation 
expenses and allowances. A waiver may be considered when collection of 
the claim would be against equity and good conscience and not in the 
best interest of the United States provided that there does not exist, 
in connection with the claim, an indication of fraud, misrepresentation, 
fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the employee or any other 
person having an interest in obtaining a waiver of the claim.
    b. The General Accounting Office Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-316), 
Title I, Sec. 103(d), enacted October 19, 1996, amended 5 U.S.C. Sec.  
5584 by transferring the authority to waive claims for erroneous 
payments exceeding $1,500 from the Comptroller General of the United 
States to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). OMB subsequently 
redelegated this waiver authority to the executive agency that made the 
erroneous payment. The authority to waive claims not exceeding $1,500, 
which was vested in the head of each agency prior to the enactment of 
Pub. L. 104-316, was unaffected by the Act.
    c. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 5514 authorizes the head of each agency, upon a 
determination that an employee is indebted to the United States for 
debts to which the United States is entitled to be repaid at the time of 
the determination, to deduct up to 15%, or a greater amount if agreed to 
by the employee, from the employee's pay at officially established pay 
intervals in order to repay the debt.

                              3. Delegation

    a. The Deputy Assistant Secretary (Administration), the heads of 
bureaus, the Inspector General, and the Inspector General for Tax 
Administration are delegated the authority to waive, in whole or in 
part, a claim of the United States against an employee for an erroneous 
payment of pay and allowances, travel, transportation, and relocation 
expenses and allowances, aggregating less than $5,000 per claim, in 
accordance with the limitations and standards in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 5584.
    b. Treasury's Deputy Chief Financial Officer is delegated the 
authority to waive, in whole or in part, a claim of the United States 
against an employee for an erroneous payment of pay and allowances, 
travel, transportation, and relocation expenses and allowances, 
aggregating $5,000 or more per claim, in accordance with the limitations 
and standards in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 5584.

                               4. Appeals

    a. Requests for waiver of claims aggregating less than $5,000 per 
claim which are denied in whole or in part may be appealed to the Deputy 
Chief Financial Officer for the Department of the Treasury.
    b. Requests for waiver of claims aggregating $5,000 or more per 
claim which are denied in whole or in part may be appealed to the 
Assistant Secretary (Management)/Chief Financial Officer.

                             5. Redelegation

    The Deputy Assistant Secretary (Administration), the heads of 
bureaus, the Inspector General, and the Inspector General for Tax 
Administration may redelegate their respective authority and 
responsibility in writing no lower than the bureau deputy chief 
financial officer unless authorized by Treasury's Deputy Chief Financial 
Officer. Copies of each redelegation shall be submitted to the 
Department's Deputy Chief Financial Officer.

[[Page 130]]

                           6. Responsibilities

established debt collection policies and procedures;
    (3) Establish time frames for employees to request a waiver in 
writing and for the bureau to review the waiver request. These time 
frames must take into consideration the responsibilities of the United 
States to take prompt action to pursue enforced collection on overdue 
debts, which may arise from erroneous payments.
    (4) Notify employees whose requests for waiver of claims aggregating 
less than $5,000 per claim are denied in whole or in part of the basis

shall:
    (a) Be made in writing;
    (b) Specify the basis for the appeal;
    (c) Include a chronology of the events surrounding the erroneous 
payments;
    (d) Include a statement regarding any mitigating factors; and
    (e) Be submitted to the official who denied the waiver request no 
later than 60 days from receipt by the employee of written notice of the 
denial of the waiver; and
    (f) Attach at least the following documents: the employee's original 
request for a waiver; the bureau's denial of the request; any personnel 
actions, e.g., promotions, demotions, step increases, etc. that relate 
to the overpayment.
    (5) Forward to Treasury's Deputy Chief Financial Officer the appeal 
and supporting documentation, the bureau's recommendation as to why the 
appeal should be approved or denied; and a statement as to the action 
taken by the bureau to avoid a recurrence of the error.
    (6) Pay a refund when appropriate if a waiver is granted;
    (7) Fulfill all labor relations responsibilities when implementing 
this directive; and
    (8) Fulfill any other responsibility of the agency imposed by 5 
U.S.C. Sec. 5584, or other applicable laws and regulations.
    b. Treasury's Deputy Chief Financial Officer shall advise employees 
whose requests for waiver of claims aggregating $5,000 or more per claim 
are denied in whole or in part of the basis for the denial and the right 
to appeal the denial to the Assistant Secretary (Management)/Chief 
Financial Officer. All such appeals shall be in the format and contain 
the information and documentation described in subsection 6.a.(4), 
above. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer shall forward to Assistant 
Secretary (Management)/Chief Financial Officer the appeal and supporting 
documentation, his/her recommendation as to why the appeal should be 
approved or denied, and a statement obtained from the bureau from which 
the claim arose as to the action taken by the bureau to avoid a 
recurrence of the error.

                        7. Reporting Requirements

    a. Each bureau, the Deputy Assistant Secretary (Administration) for 
Departmental Offices, the Inspector General, and the Inspector General 
for Tax Administration shall maintain a register of waiver actions 
subject to Departmental review. The register shall cover each fiscal 
year and be prepared by December 31 of each year for the preceding 
fiscal year. The register shall contain the following information:
    (1) The total amount waived by the bureau;
    (2) The number and dollar amount of waiver applications granted in 
full;
    (3) The number and dollar amount of waiver applications granted in 
part and denied in part, and the dollar amount of each;
    (4) The number and dollar amount of waiver applications denied in 
their entirety;
    (5) The number of waiver applications referred to the Deputy Chief 
Financial Officer for initial action or for appeal;
    (6) The dollar amount refunded as a result of waiver action by the 
bureau; and
    (7) The dollar amount refunded as a result of waiver action by the 
Deputy Chief Financial Officer or the Assistant Secretary (Management)/
Chief Financial Officer.
    b. Each bureau, the Deputy Assistant Secretary (Administration) for 
Departmental Offices, the Inspector General, and the Inspector General 
for Tax Administration shall retain a written record of each waiver 
action for 6 years and 3 months. At a minimum, the written record shall 
contain:
    (1) The bureau's summary of the events surrounding the erroneous 
payment;
    (2) Any written comments submitted by the employee from whom 
collection is sought;
    (3) An account of the waiver action taken and the reasons for such 
action; and
    (4) Other pertinent information such as any action taken to refund 
amounts repaid.

                     8. Effect of Request for Waiver

    A request for a waiver of a claim shall not affect an employee's 
opportunity under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 5514(a)(2)(D) for a hearing on the 
determination of the agency concerning the existence or the amount of 
the debt, or the terms of the repayment schedule. A request by an 
employee for a hearing under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 5514(a)(2)(D) shall not 
affect an employee's right to request a waiver of the claim. The 
determination whether to waive a claim may

[[Page 131]]

be made at the discretion of the deciding official either before or 
after a final decision is rendered pursuant to 5 U.S.C. Sec. 
5514(a)(2)(D) concerning the existence or the amount of the debt, or the 
terms of the repayment schedule.

                 9. Guidelines for Determining Requests

    a. A request for a waiver shall not be granted if the deciding 
official determines there exists, in connection with the claim, an 
indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on 
the part of the employee or any other person having an interest in 
obtaining a waiver of the claim. There are no exceptions to this rule 
for financial hardship or otherwise.
    (1) ``Fault'' exists if, in light of all the circumstances, it is 
determined that the employee knew or should have known that an error 
existed, but failed to take action to have it corrected. Fault can 
derive from an act or a failure to act. Unlike fraud, fault does not 
require a deliberate intent to deceive. Whether an employee should have 
known about an error in pay is determined from the perspective of a 
reasonable person. Pertinent considerations in finding fault include 
whether:
    (a) The payment resulted from the employee's incorrect, but not 
fraudulent, statement that the employee should have known was incorrect;
    (b) The payment resulted from the employee's failure to disclose 
material facts in the employee's possession which the employee should 
have known to be material; or
    (c) The employee accepted a payment, which the employee knew or 
should have known to be erroneous.
    (2) Every case must be examined in light of its particular facts. 
For example, where an employee is promoted to a higher grade but the 
step level for the employee's new grade is miscalculated, it may be 
appropriate to conclude that there is no fault on the employee's part 
because employees are not typically expected to be aware of and 
understand the rules regarding determination of step level upon 
promotion. On the other hand, a different conclusion as to fault 
potentially may be reached if the employee in question is a personnel 
specialist or an attorney who concentrates on personnel law.
    b. If the deciding official finds an indication of fraud, 
misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the 
employee or any other person having an interest in obtaining a waiver of 
the claim, then the request for a waiver must be denied.
    c. If the deciding official finds no indication of fraud, 
misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the 
employee or any other person having an interest in obtaining a waiver of 
the claim, the employee is not automatically entitled to a waiver. 
Before a waiver can be granted, the deciding official must also 
determine that collection of the claim against an employee would be 
against equity and good conscience and not in the best interests of the 
United States. Factors to consider when determining if collection of a 
claim against an employee would be against equity and good conscience 
and not in the best interests of the United States include, but are not 
limited to:
    (1) Whether collection of the claim would cause serious financial 
hardship to the employee from whom collection is sought.
    (2) Whether, because of the erroneous payment, the employee either 
has relinquished a valuable right or changed positions for the worse, 
regardless of the employee's financial circumstances.
    (a) To establish that a valuable right has been relinquished, it 
must be shown that the right was, in fact, valuable; that it cannot be 
regained; and that the action was based chiefly or solely on reliance on 
the overpayment.
    (b) To establish that the employee's position has changed for the 
worse, it must be shown that the decision would not have been made but 
for the overpayment, and that the decision resulted in a loss.
    (c) An example of a ``detrimental reliance'' would be a decision to 
sign a lease for a more expensive apartment based chiefly or solely upon 
reliance on an erroneous calculation of salary, and the funds spent for 
rent cannot be recovered.
    (3) The cost of collecting the claim equals or exceeds the amount of 
the claim;
    (4) The time elapsed between the erroneous payment and discovery of 
the error and notification of the employee;
    (5) Whether failure to make restitution would result in unfair gain 
to the employee;
    (6) Whether recovery of the claim would be unconscionable under the 
circumstances.
    d. The burden is on the employee to demonstrate that collection of 
the claim would be against equity and good conscience and not in the 
best interest of the United States.

<R04>
                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 6.1  Purpose of these rules.

    The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called ``the Act'' in 
this part), provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses 
to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain 
administrative proceedings (called ``adversary adjudications'') before 
agencies of the Government of the United States. An eligible party may 
receive an award when it prevails over an agency, unless the agency's 
position in the proceeding was substantially justified or special 
circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this part describe the 
parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They 
also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards 
that the Treasury Department will use to make them.


<R05>
Sec. 6.2  When the Act applies.

    The Act applies to any adversary adjudication pending before an 
agency at any time between October 1, 1981 and September 30, 1984. This 
includes proceedings begun before October 1, 1981, if final agency 
action has not been taken before that date, and proceedings pending on 
September 30, 1984, regardless of when they were initiated or when final 
agency action occurs.


<R05>
Sec. 6.3  Proceedings covered.

    The Act applies to adversary adjudications required to be conducted 
by the Treasury Department under 5 U.S.C. 554. Within the Treasury 
Department, these proceedings are:
    (a) Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms: (1) Permit proceedings 
under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (27 U.S.C. 204); (2) Permit 
proceedings under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 5171, 
5271, 5713); (3) License and permit proceedings under the Federal 
Explosives Laws (18 U.S.C. 843).
    (b) Comptroller of the Currency:

All proceedings conducted under 12 CFR part 19, subpart A.


<R05>
Sec. 6.4  Eligibility of applicants.

    (a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses 
under the Act, the applicant must be a party to the adversary 
adjudication for which it seeks an award. The term ``party'' is defined 
in 5 U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant must show that it meets all conditions 
of eligibility set out in this subpart and has complied with the 
requirements in Subpart B of this part.
    (b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:
    (1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $1 million;
    (2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth 
of not more than $5 million, including both personal and business 
interests, and not more than 500 employees;

[[Page 133]]

    (3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in 
section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) 
with not more than 500 employees;
    (4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the 
Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141(a)) with not more than 500 
employees, or
    (5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, or public or 
private organization with a net worth of not more than $5 million and 
not more than 500 employees.
    (c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of 
employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the 
proceeding was initiated.
    (d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be 
considered as an ``individual'' rather than a ``sole owner of an 
unincorporated business'' if the matter in controversy is primarily 
related to personal interests rather than to business interests.
    (e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly 
perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the 
applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be 
included.
    (f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all 
of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any 
individual or group of individuals, corporation or other entity that 
directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares 
of another business, or controls in any manner the election of a 
majority of that business's board of directors, trustees, or other 
persons exercising similar functions, will be considered an affiliate of 
that business for purposes of this part, unless the adjudicative officer 
determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the 
purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the 
afffiliated entities. In addition, the adjudicative officer may 
determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those 
described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances that would 
make an award unjust.
    (g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on 
behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible 
is not itself eligible for an award.


<R05>
Sec. 6.5  Standards for awards.

    (a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and 
expenses incurred in connection with the final disposition of a 
proceeding, unless (1) the position of the agency was substantially 
justified, or (2) special circumstances make the award unjust. No 
presumption arises that the agency's position was not substantially 
justified simply because the agency did not prevail.
    (b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly 
or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if special circumstances 
make the award sought unjust.

number or tax identification number, signature, and the date.
    (b) Fee. The application for enrollment must be accompanied by a

    (c) Additional information; examination. The Director of Practice, 
as a condition to consideration of an application for enrollment, may

circumstances and it will not be granted, in any circumstance, if the 
application is not regular on its face, if the information stated in the 
application, if true, is not sufficient to warrant enrollment to 
practice, or if there is any information before the Director of Practice 
indicating that the statements in the application are untrue or that the 
applicant would not otherwise qualify for enrollment. Issuance of 
temporary recognition does not constitute enrollment to practice or a 
finding of eligibility for enrollment, and the temporary recognition may 
be withdrawn at any time by the Director of Practice.
    (e) Appeal from denial of application. The Director of Practice must 
inform the applicant as to the reason(s) for any denial of an

partnership may represent the partnership.
    (iv) A bona fide officer or a regular full-time employee of a 
corporation (including a parent, subsidiary, or other affiliated 
corporation), association, or organized group may represent the 
corporation, association, or organized group.
    (v) A regular full-time employee of a trust, receivership, 
guardianship, or estate may represent the trust, receivership, 
guardianship, or estate.
    (vi) An officer or a regular employee of a governmental unit, 
agency, or authority may represent the governmental unit, agency, or 
authority in the course of his or her official duties.
    (vii) An individual may represent any individual or entity, who is

Service when such representation takes place outside the United States.
    (viii) An individual who prepares and signs a taxpayer's tax return 
as the preparer, or who prepares a tax return but is not required (by 
the instructions to the tax return or regulations) to sign the tax 
return, may represent the taxpayer before revenue agents, customer 
service representatives or similar officers and employees of the 
Internal Revenue Service during an examination of the taxable year or 
period covered by that tax return, but, unless otherwise prescribed by 
regulation or notice, this right does not permit such individual to 
represent the taxpayer, regardless of the circumstances requiring 
representation, before appeals officers, revenue officers, Counsel or 
similar officers or employees of the Internal Revenue Service or the 
Department of Treasury.
    (2) Limitations. (i) An individual who is under suspension or

Service under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (ii) The Director, after notice and opportunity for a conference, 
may deny eligibility to engage in limited practice before the Internal 
Revenue Service under paragraph (c)(1) of this section to any individual 
who has engaged in conduct that would justify censuring, suspending, or 
disbarring a practitioner from practice before the Internal Revenue 
Service.
    (iii) An individual who represents a taxpayer under the authority of 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section is subject, to the extent of his or her 
authority, to such rules of general applicability regarding standards of 
conduct and other matters as the Director of Practice prescribes.

may prepare a tax return, appear as a witness for the taxpayer before 
the Internal Revenue Service, or furnish information at the request of 
the Internal Revenue Service or any of its officers or employees.
    (f) Fiduciaries. For purposes of this part, a fiduciary (i.e., a 
trustee, receiver, guardian, personal representative, administrator, or 
executor) is considered to be the taxpayer and not a representative of 
the taxpayer.

Sec. 10.20  Information to be furnished.

    (a) To the Internal Revenue Service. (1) A practitioner must, on a 
proper and lawful request by a duly authorized officer or employee of 
the Internal Revenue Service, promptly submit records or information in 
any matter before the Internal Revenue Service unless the practitioner 
believes in good faith and on reasonable grounds that the records or 
information are privileged.
    (2) Where the requested records or information are not in the 
possession of, or subject to the control of, the practitioner or the 
practitioner's client, the practitioner must promptly notify the 
requesting Internal Revenue Service officer or employee and the 
practitioner must provide any information that the practitioner has 
regarding the identity of any person who the practitioner believes may 
have possession or control of the requested records or information. The 
practitioner must make reasonable inquiry of his or her client regarding 
the identity of any person who may have possession or control of the 
requested records or information, but the practitioner is not required 
to make inquiry of any other person or independently verify any 
information provided by the practitioner's client regarding the identity 
of such persons.
    (b) To the Director of Practice. When a proper and lawful request is 
made by the Director of Practice, a practitioner must provide the 
Director of Practice with any information the practitioner has 
concerning an inquiry by the Director of Practice into an alleged 
violation of the regulations in this part by any person, and to testify 
regarding this information in any proceeding instituted under this part, 
unless the practitioner believes in good faith and on reasonable grounds 
that the information is privileged.
    (c) Interference with a proper and lawful request for records or 
information. A

[[Page 165]]

practitioner may not interfere, or attempt to interfere, with any proper 
and lawful effort by the Internal Revenue Service, its officers or 
employees, or the Director of Practice, or his or her employees, to 
obtain any record or information unless the practitioner believes in 
good faith and on reasonable grounds that the record or information is 
privileged.


<R05>
Sec. 10.21  Knowledge of client's omission.

    A practitioner who, having been retained by a client with respect to 
a matter administered by the Internal Revenue Service, knows that the 
client has not complied with the revenue laws of the United States or 
has made an error in or omission from any return, document, affidavit, 
or other paper which the client submitted or executed under the revenue 
laws of the United States, must advise the client promptly of the fact 
of such noncompliance, error, or omission. The practitioner must advise 
the client of the consequences as provided under the Code and 
regulations of such noncompliance, error, or omission.


<R05>
Sec. 10.22  Diligence as to accuracy.

    (a) In general. A practitioner must exercise due diligence--
    (1) In preparing or assisting in the preparation of, approving, and 
filing tax returns, documents, affidavits, and other papers relating to 
Internal Revenue Service matters;
    (2) In determining the correctness of oral or written 
representations made by the practitioner to the Department of the 
Treasury; and
    (3) In determining the correctness of oral or written 
representations made by the practitioner to clients with reference to 
any matter administered by the Internal Revenue Service.
    (b) Reliance on others. Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 10.33 and 
10.34, a practitioner will be presumed to have exercised due diligence 
for purposes of this section if the practitioner relies on the work 
product of another person and the practitioner used reasonable care in 
engaging, supervising, training, and evaluating the person, taking 
proper account of the nature of the relationship between the 
practitioner and the person.


<R05>
Sec. 10.23  Prompt disposition of pending matters.

    A practitioner may not unreasonably delay the prompt disposition of 
any matter before the Internal Revenue Service.


<R05>
Sec. 10.24  Assistance from or to disbarred or suspended persons and 
former Internal Revenue Service employees.

    A practitioner may not, knowingly and directly or indirectly:
    (a) Accept assistance from or assist any person who is under 
disbarment or suspension from practice before the Internal Revenue 
Service if the assistance relates to a matter or matters constituting 
practice before the Internal Revenue Service.
    (b) Accept assistance from any former government employee where the 
provisions of Sec. 10.25 or any Federal law would be violated.


<R05>
Sec. 10.25  Practice by former Government employees, their partners 
and their associates.

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section--
    (1) Assist means to act in such a way as to advise, furnish 
information to, or otherwise aid another person, directly or indirectly.
    (2) Government employee is an officer or employee of the United 
States or any agency of the United States, including a special 
government employee as defined in 18 U.S.C. 202(a), or of the District 
of Columbia, or of any State, or a member of Congress or of any State 
legislature.
    (3) Member of a firm is a sole practitioner or an employee or 
associate thereof, or a partner, stockholder, associate, affiliate or 
employee of a partnership, joint venture, corporation, professional 
association or other affiliation of two or more practitioners who 
represent nongovernmental parties.
    (4) Practitioner includes any individual described in paragraph (f) 
of Sec. 10.2.
    (5) Official responsibility means the direct administrative or 
operating authority, whether intermediate or final, and either 
exercisable alone or with others, and either personally or

[[Page 166]]

through subordinates, to approve, disapprove, or otherwise direct 
Government action, with or without knowledge of the action.
    (6) Participate or participation means substantial involvement as a 
Government employee by making decisions, or preparing or reviewing 
documents with or without the right to exercise a judgment of approval 
or disapproval, or participating in conferences or investigations, or 
rendering advice of a substantial nature.
    (7) Rule includes Treasury Regulations, whether issued or under 
preparation for issuance as Notices of Proposed Rule Making or as 
Treasury Decisions; revenue rulings; and revenue procedures published in 
the Internal Revenue Bulletin. Rule does not include a transaction as 
defined in paragraph (a)(8) of this section.
    (8) Transaction means any decision, determination, finding, letter 
ruling, technical advice, Chief Counsel advice, or contract or the 
approval or disapproval thereof, relating to a particular factual 
situation or situations involving a specific party or parties whose 
rights, privileges, or liabilities under laws or regulations 
administered by the Internal Revenue Service, or other legal rights, are 
determined or immediately affected therein and to which the United 
States is a party or in which it has a direct and substantial interest, 
whether or not the same taxable periods are involved. Transaction does 
not include rule as defined in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
    (b) General rules. (1) No former Government employee may, subsequent 
to his or her Government employment, represent anyone in any matter 
administered by the Internal Revenue Service if the representation would 
violate 18 U.S.C. 207 or any other laws of the United States.
    (2) No former Government employee who participated in a transaction 
may, subsequent to his or her Government employment, represent or 
knowingly assist, in that transaction, any person who is or was a 
specific party to that transaction.
    (3) A former Government employee who within a period of one year 
prior to the termination of Government employment had official 
responsibility for a transaction may not, within two years after his or 
her Government employment is ended, represent or knowingly assist in 
that transaction any person who is or was a specific party to that 
transaction.
    (4) No former Government employee may, within one year after his or 
her Government employment is ended, appear before any employee of the 
Treasury Department in connection with the publication, withdrawal, 
amendment, modification, or interpretation of a rule in the development 
of which the former Government employee participated or for which, 
within a period of one year prior to the termination of his or her 
Government employment, he or she had official responsibility. This 
paragraph (b)(4) does not, however, preclude such former employee from 
appearing on his or her own behalf or from representing a taxpayer 
before the Internal Revenue Service in connection with a transaction 
involving the application or interpretation of such a rule with respect 
to that transaction, provided that such former employee does not utilize 
or disclose any confidential information acquired by the former employee 
in the development of the rule.
    (c) Firm representation. (1) No member of a firm of which a former 
Government employee is a member may represent or knowingly assist a 
person who was or is a specific party in any transaction with respect to 
which the restrictions of paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section apply 
to the former Government employee, in that transaction, unless the firm 
isolates the former Government employee in such a way to ensure that the 
former Government employee cannot assist in the representation.
    (2) When isolation of a former Government employee is required under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a statement affirming the fact of such 
isolation must be executed under oath by the former Government employee 
and by another member of the firm acting on behalf of the firm. The 
statement must clearly identify the firm, the former Government 
employee, and the transaction(s) requiring isolation and it must be 
filed with the Director of

[[Page 167]]

Practice (and at such other place(s) directed by the Director of 
Practice) and in such other place and in the manner prescribed by rule 
or regulation.
    (d) Pending representation. Practice by former Government employees, 
their partners and associates with respect to representation in pecific 
matters where actual representation commenced before July 26, 2002 is 
governed by the regulations set forth at 31 CFR part 10 revised as of 
July 1, 2002. The burden of showing that representation commenced before 
July 26, 2002 lies with the former Government employees, and their 
partners and associates.


<R05>
Sec. 10.26  Notaries.

    A practitioner may not take acknowledgments, administer oaths, 
certify papers, or perform any official act as a notary public with 
respect to any matter administered by the Internal Revenue Service and 
for which he or she is employed as counsel, attorney, or agent, or in 
which he or she may be in any way interested.


<R05>
Sec. 10.27  Fees.

    (a) Generally. A practitioner may not charge an unconscionable fee 
for representing a client in a matter before the Internal Revenue 
Service.
    (b) Contingent fees. (1) For purposes of this section, a contingent 
fee is any fee that is based, in whole or in part, on whether or not a 
position taken on a tax return or other filing avoids challenge by the 
Internal Revenue Service or is sustained either by the Internal Revenue 
Service or in litigation. A contingent fee includes any fee arrangement 
in which the practitioner will reimburse the client for all or a portion 
of the client's fee in the event that a position taken on a tax return 
or other filing is challenged by the Internal Revenue Service or is not 
sustained, whether pursuant to an indemnity agreement, a guarantee, 
rescission rights, or any other arrangement with a similar effect.
    (2) A practitioner may not charge a contingent fee for preparing an 
original tax return or for any advice rendered in connection with a 
position taken or to be taken on an original tax return.
    (3) A contingent fee may be charged for preparation of or advice in 
connection with an amended tax return or a claim for refund (other than 
a claim for refund made on an original tax return), but only if the 
practitioner reasonably anticipates at the time the fee arrangement is 
entered into that the amended tax return or refund claim will receive 
substantive review by the Internal Revenue Service.


<R05>
Sec. 10.28  Return of client's records.

    (a) In general, a practitioner must, at the request of a client, 
promptly return any and all records of the client that are necessary for 
the client to comply with his or her Federal tax obligations. The 
practitioner may retain copies of the records returned to a client. The 
existence of a dispute over fees generally does not relieve the 
practitioner of his or her responsibility under this section. 
Nevertheless, if applicable state law allows or permits the retention of 
a client's records by a practitioner in the case of a dispute over fees 
for services rendered, the practitioner need only return those records 
that must be attached to the taxpayer's return. The practitioner, 
however, must provide the client with reasonable access to review and 
copy any additional records of the client retained by the practitioner 
under state law that are necessary for the client to comply with his or 
her Federal tax obligations.
    (b) For purposes of this section, Records of the client include all 
documents or written or electronic materials provided to the 
practitioner, or obtained by the practitioner in the course of the 
practitioner's representation of the client, that preexisted the 
retention of the practitioner by the client. The term also includes 
materials that were prepared by the client or a third party (not 
including an employee or agent of the practitioner) at any time and 
provided to the practitioner with respect to the subject matter of the 
representation. The term also includes any return, claim for refund, 
schedule, affidavit, appraisal or any other document prepared by the 
practitioner, or his or her employee or agent, that was presented to the 
client with respect to a prior representation if such document is 
necessary for the taxpayer to comply with his or her current Federal tax 
obligations. The term

[[Page 168]]

does not include any return, claim for refund, schedule, affidavit, 
appraisal or any other document prepared by the practitioner or the 
practitioner's firm, employees or agents if the practitioner is 
withholding such document pending the client's performance of its 
contractual obligation to pay fees with respect to such document.


<R05>
Sec. 10.29  Conflicting interests.

    (a) Except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section, a 
practitioner shall not represent a client in his or her practice before 
the Internal Revenue Service if the representation involves a conflict 
of interest. A conflict of interest exists if:
    (1) The representation of one client will be directly adverse to 
another client; or
    (2) There is a significant risk that the representation of one or 
more clients will be materially limited by the practitioner's 
responsibilities to another client, a former client or a third person or 
by a personal interest of the practitioner.
    (b) Notwithstanding the existence of a conflict of interest under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the practitioner may represent a client 
if:
    (1) The practitioner reasonably believes that the practitioner will 
be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each 
affected client;
    (2) The representation is not prohibited by law;
    (3) Each affected client gives informed consent, confirmed in 
writing.
    (c) Copies of the written consents must be retained by the 
practitioner for at least 36 months from the date of the conclusion of 
the representation of the affected clients and the written consents must 
be provided to any officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service 
on request.

1726)


<R05>
Sec. 10.30  Solicitation.

    (a) Advertising and solicitation restrictions. (1) A practitioner 
may not, with respect to any Internal Revenue Service matter, in any way 
use or participate in the use of any form of public communication or 
private solicitation containing a false, fraudulent, or coercive 
statement or claim; or a misleading or deceptive statement or claim. 
Enrolled agents, in describing their professional designation, may not 
utilize the term of art ``certified'' or imply an employer/employee 
relationship with the Internal Revenue Service. Examples of acceptable 
descriptions are ``enrolled to represent taxpayers before the Internal 
Revenue Service,'' ``enrolled to practice before the Internal Revenue 
Service,'' and ``admitted to practice before the Internal Revenue 
Service.''
    (2) A practitioner may not make, directly or indirectly, an 
uninvited written or oral solicitation of employment in matters related 
to the Internal Revenue Service if the solicitation violates Federal or 
State law or other applicable rule, e.g., attorneys are precluded from 
making a solicitation that is prohibited by conduct rules applicable to 
all attorneys in their State(s) of licensure. Any lawful solicitation 
made by or on behalf of a practitioner eligible to practice before the 
Internal Revenue Service must, nevertheless, clearly identify the 
solicitation as such and, if applicable, identify the source of the 
information used in choosing the recipient.
    (b) Fee information. (1)(i) A practitioner may publish the 
availability of a written schedule of fees and disseminate the following 
fee information--
    (A) Fixed fees for specific routine services.
    (B) Hourly rates.
    (C) Range of fees for particular services.
    (D) Fee charged for an initial consultation.
    (ii) Any statement of fee information concerning matters in which 
costs may be incurred must include a statement disclosing whether 
clients will be responsible for such costs.
    (2) A practitioner may charge no more than the rate(s) published 
under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for at least 30 calendar days 
after the last date on which the schedule of fees was published.
    (c) Communication of fee information. Fee information may be 
communicated in professional lists, telephone directories, print media, 
mailings, electronic mail, facsimile, hand delivered

[[Page 169]]

flyers, radio, television, and any other method. The method chosen, 
however, must not cause the communication to become untruthful, 
deceptive, or otherwise in violation of this part. A practitioner may 
not persist in attempting to contact a prospective client if the 
prospective client has made it known to the practitioner that he or she 
does not desire to be solicited. In the case of radio and television 
broadcasting, the broadcast must be recorded and the practitioner must 
retain a recording of the actual transmission. In the case of direct 
mail and e-commerce communications, the practitioner must retain a copy 
of the actual communication, along with a list or other description of 
persons to whom the communication was mailed or otherwise distributed. 
The copy must be retained by the practitioner for a period of at least 
36 months from the date of the last transmission or use.
    (d) Improper associations. A practitioner may not, in matters 
related to the Internal Revenue Service, assist, or accept assistance 
from, any person or entity who, to the knowledge of the practitioner, 
obtains clients or otherwise practices in a manner forbidden under this 
section.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under Control No. 1545-

<R05>
Sec. 10.31  Negotiation of taxpayer checks.

    A practitioner who prepares tax returns may not endorse or otherwise 
negotiate any check issued to a client by the government in respect of a 
Federal tax liability.


<R05>
Sec. 10.32  Practice of law.

    Nothing in the regulations in this part may be construed as 
authorizing persons not members of the bar to practice law.


<R05>
Sec. 10.33  Best practices for tax advisors.

    (a) Best practices. Tax advisors should provide clients with the 
highest quality representation concerning Federal tax issues by adhering 
to best practices in providing advice and in preparing or assisting in 
the preparation of a submission to the Internal Revenue Service. In 
addition to compliance with the standards of practice provided elsewhere 
in this part, best practices include the following:
    (1) Communicating clearly with the client regarding the terms of the 
engagement. For example, the advisor should determine the client's 
expected purpose for and use of the advice and should have a clear 
understanding with the client regarding the form and scope of the advice 
or assistance to be rendered.
    (2) Establishing the facts, determining which facts are relevant, 
evaluating the reasonableness of any assumptions or representations, 
relating the applicable law (including potentially applicable judicial 
doctrines) to the relevant facts, and arriving at a conclusion supported 
by the law and the facts.
    (3) Advising the client regarding the import of the conclusions 
reached, including, for example, whether a taxpayer may avoid accuracy-
related penalties under the Internal Revenue Code if a taxpayer acts in 
reliance on the advice.
    (4) Acting fairly and with integrity in practice before the Internal 
Revenue Service.
    (b) Procedures to ensure best practices for tax advisors. Tax 
advisors with responsibility for overseeing a firm's practice of 
providing advice concerning Federal tax issues or of preparing or 
assisting in the preparation of submissions to the Internal Revenue 
Service should take reasonable steps to ensure that the firm's 
procedures for all members, associates, and employees are consistent 
with the best practices set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Applicability date. This section is effective after June 20, 
2005.

[T.D. 9011, 67 FR 48771, July 26, 2002, as amended by T.D. 9165, 69 FR 
75841, Dec. 20, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 10.34  Standards for advising with respect to tax return positions 
and for preparing or signing returns.

    (a) Realistic possibility standard. A practitioner may not sign a 
tax return as a preparer if the practitioner determines that the tax 
return contains a position that does not have a realistic possibility of 
being sustained on its merits (the realistic possibility standard) 
unless the position is not frivolous

[[Page 170]]

and is adequately disclosed to the Internal Revenue Service. A 
practitioner may not advise a client to take a position on a tax return, 
or prepare the portion of a tax return on which a position is taken, 
unless--
    (1) The practitioner determines that the position satisfies the 
realistic possibility standard; or
    (2) The position is not frivolous and the practitioner advises the 
client of any opportunity to avoid the accuracy-related penalty in 
section 6662 of the Internal Revenue Code by adequately disclosing the 
position and of the requirements for adequate disclosure.
    (b) Advising clients on potential penalties. A practitioner advising 
a client to take a position on a tax return, or preparing or signing a 
tax return as a preparer, must inform the client of the penalties 
reasonably likely to apply to the client with respect to the position 
advised, prepared, or reported. The practitioner also must inform the 
client of any opportunity to avoid any such penalty by disclosure, if 
relevant, and of the requirements for adequate disclosure. This 
paragraph (b) applies even if the practitioner is not subject to a 
penalty with respect to the position.
    (c) Relying on information furnished by clients. A practitioner 
advising a client to take a position on a tax return, or preparing or 
signing a tax return as a preparer, generally may rely in good faith 
without verification upon information furnished by the client. The 
practitioner may not, however, ignore the implications of information 
furnished to, or actually known by, the practitioner, and must make 
reasonable inquiries if the information as furnished appears to be 
incorrect, inconsistent with an important fact or another factual 
assumption, or incomplete.
    (d) Definitions. For purposes of this section--
    (1) Realistic possibility. A position is considered to have a 
realistic possibility of being sustained on its merits if a reasonable 
and well informed analysis of the law and the facts by a person 
knowledgeable in the tax law would lead such a person to conclude that 
the position has approximately a one in three, or greater, likelihood of 
being sustained on its merits. The authorities described in 26 CFR 
1.6662-4(d)(3)(iii), or any successor provision, of the substantial 
understatement penalty regulations may be taken into account for 
purposes of this analysis. The possibility that a tax return will not be 
audited, that an issue will not be raised on audit, or that an issue 
will be settled may not be taken into account.
    (2) Frivolous. A position is frivolous if it is patently improper.


<R05>
Sec. 10.35  Requirements for covered opinions.

    (a) A practitioner who provides a covered opinion shall comply with 
the standards of practice in this section.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this subpart--
    (1) A practitioner includes any individual described in Sec. 
10.2(e).
    (2) Covered opinion--(i) In general. A covered opinion is written 
advice (including electronic communications) by a practitioner 
concerning one or more Federal tax issues arising from--
    (A) A transaction that is the same as or substantially similar to a 
transaction that, at the time the advice is rendered, the Internal 
Revenue Service has determined to be a tax avoidance transaction and 
identified by published guidance as a listed transaction under 26 CFR 
1.6011-4(b)(2);
    (B) Any partnership or other entity, any investment plan or 
arrangement, or any other plan or arrangement, the principal purpose of 
which is the avoidance or evasion of any tax imposed by the Internal 
Revenue Code; or
    (C) Any partnership or other entity, any investment plan or 
arrangement, or any other plan or arrangement, a significant purpose of 
which is the avoidance or evasion of any tax imposed by the Internal 
Revenue Code if the written advice--
    (1) Is a reliance opinion;
    (2) Is a marketed opinion;
    (3) Is subject to conditions of confidentiality; or
    (4) Is subject to contractual protection.
    (ii) Excluded advice. A covered opinion does not include--
    (A) Written advice provided to a client during the course of an 
engagement if a practitioner is reasonably expected to provide 
subsequent written advice to

[[Page 171]]

the client that satisfies the requirements of this section;
    (B) Written advice, other than advice described in paragraph 
(b)(2)(i)(A) of this section (concerning listed transactions) or 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section (concerning the principal 
purpose of avoidance or evasion) that--
    (1) Concerns the qualification of a qualified plan;
    (2) Is a State or local bond opinion; or
    (3) Is included in documents required to be filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission;
    (C) Written advice prepared for and provided to a taxpayer, solely 
for use by that taxpayer, after the taxpayer has filed a tax return with 
the Internal Revenue Service reflecting the tax benefits of the 
transaction. The preceding sentence does not apply if the practitioner 
knows or has reason to know that the written advice will be relied upon 
by the taxpayer to take a position on a tax return (including for these 
purposes an amended return that claims tax benefits not reported on a 
previously filed return) filed after the date on which the advice is 
provided to the taxpayer;
    (D) Written advice provided to an employer by a practitioner in that 
practitioner's capacity as an employee of that employer solely for 
purposes of determining the tax liability of the employer; or
    (E) Written advice that does not resolve a Federal tax issue in the 
taxpayer's favor, unless the advice reaches a conclusion favorable to 
the taxpayer at any confidence level (e.g., not frivolous, realistic 
possibility of success, reasonable basis or substantial authority) with 
respect to that issue. If written advice concerns more than one Federal 
tax issue, the advice must comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) 
of this section with respect to any Federal tax issue not described in 
the preceding sentence.
    (3) A Federal tax issue is a question concerning the Federal tax 
treatment of an item of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit, the 
existence or absence of a taxable transfer of property, or the value of 
property for Federal tax purposes. For purposes of this subpart, a 
Federal tax issue is significant if the Internal Revenue Service has a 
reasonable basis for a successful challenge and its resolution could 
have a significant impact, whether beneficial or adverse and under any 
reasonably foreseeable circumstance, on the overall Federal tax 
treatment of the transaction(s) or matter(s) addressed in the opinion.
    (4) Reliance opinion--(i) Written advice is a reliance opinion if 
the advice concludes at a confidence level of at least more likely than 
not (a greater than 50 percent likelihood) that one or more significant 
Federal tax issues would be resolved in the taxpayer's favor.
    (ii) For purposes of this section, written advice, other than advice 
described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section (concerning listed 
transactions) or paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section (concerning the 
principal purpose of avoidance or evasion), is not treated as a reliance 
opinion if the practitioner prominently discloses in the written advice 
that it was not intended or written by the practitioner to be used, and 
that it cannot be used by the taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding 
penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer.
    (5) Marketed opinion--(i) Written advice is a marketed opinion if 
the practitioner knows or has reason to know that the written advice 
will be used or referred to by a person other than the practitioner (or 
a person who is a member of, associated with, or employed by the 
practitioner's firm) in promoting, marketing or recommending a 
partnership or other entity, investment plan or arrangement to one or 
more taxpayer(s).
    (ii) For purposes of this section, written advice, other than advice 
described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section (concerning listed 
transactions) or paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section (concerning the 
principal purpose of avoidance or evasion), is not treated as a marketed 
opinion if the practitioner prominently discloses in the written advice 
that--
    (A) The advice was not intended or written by the practitioner to be 
used, and that it cannot be used by any taxpayer, for the purpose of 
avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer;

[[Page 172]]

    (B) The advice was written to support the promotion or marketing of 
the transaction(s) or matter(s) addressed by the written advice; and
    (C) The taxpayer should seek advice based on the taxpayer's 
particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor.
    (6) Conditions of confidentiality. Written advice is subject to 
conditions of confidentiality if the practitioner imposes on one or more 
recipients of the written advice a limitation on disclosure of the tax 
treatment or tax structure of the transaction and the limitation on 
disclosure protects the confidentiality of that practitioner's tax 
strategies, regardless of whether the limitation on disclosure is 
legally binding. A claim that a transaction is proprietary or exclusive 
is not a limitation on disclosure if the practitioner confirms to all 
recipients of the written advice that there is no limitation on 
disclosure of the tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction that 
is the subject of the written advice.
    (7) Contractual protection. Written advice is subject to contractual 
protection if the taxpayer has the right to a full or partial refund of 
fees paid to the practitioner (or a person who is a member of, 
associated with, or employed by the practitioner's firm) if all or a 
part of the intended tax consequences from the matters addressed in the 
written advice are not sustained, or if the fees paid to the 
practitioner (or a person who is a member of, associated with, or 
employed by the practitioner's firm) are contingent on the taxpayer's 
realization of tax benefits from the transaction. All the facts and 
circumstances relating to the matters addressed in the written advice 
will be considered when determining whether a fee is refundable or 
contingent, including the right to reimbursements of amounts that the 
parties to a transaction have not designated as fees or any agreement to 
provide services without reasonable compensation.
    (8) Prominently disclosed. An item is prominently disclosed if it is 
readily apparent to a reader of the written advice. Whether an item is 
readily apparent will depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding 
the written advice including, but not limited to, the sophistication of 
the taxpayer and the length of the written advice. At a minimum, to be 
prominently disclosed an item must be set forth in a separate section 
(and not in a footnote) in a typeface that is the same size or larger 
than the typeface of any discussion of the facts or law in the written 
advice.
    (9) State or local bond opinion. A State or local bond opinion is 
written advice with respect to a Federal tax issue included in any 
materials delivered to a purchaser of a State or local bond in 
connection with the issuance of the bond in a public or private 
offering, including an official statement (if one is prepared), that 
concerns only the excludability of interest on a State or local bond 
from gross income under section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code, the 
application of section 55 of the Internal Revenue Code to a State or 
local bond, the status of a State or local bond as a qualified tax-
exempt obligation under section 265(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, 
the status of a State or local bond as a qualified zone academy bond 
under section 1397E of the Internal Revenue Code, or any combination of 
the above.
    (10) The principal purpose. For purposes of this section, the 
principal purpose of a partnership or other entity, investment plan or 
arrangement, or other plan or arrangement is the avoidance or evasion of 
any tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code if that purpose exceeds any 
other purpose. The principal purpose of a partnership or other entity, 
investment plan or arrangement, or other plan or arrangement is not to 
avoid or evade Federal tax if that partnership, entity, plan or 
arrangement has as its purpose the claiming of tax benefits in a manner 
consistent with the statute and Congressional purpose. A partnership, 
entity, plan or arrangement may have a significant purpose of avoidance 
or evasion even though it does not have the principal purpose of 
avoidance or evasion under this paragraph (b)(10).
    (c) Requirements for covered opinions. A practitioner providing a 
covered opinion must comply with each of the following requirements.
    (1) Factual matters. (i) The practitioner must use reasonable 
efforts to identify and ascertain the facts, which

[[Page 173]]

may relate to future events if a transaction is prospective or proposed, 
and to determine which facts are relevant. The opinion must identify and 
consider all facts that the practitioner determines to be relevant.
    (ii) The practitioner must not base the opinion on any unreasonable 
factual assumptions (including assumptions as to future events). An 
unreasonable factual assumption includes a factual assumption that the 
practitioner knows or should know is incorrect or incomplete. For 
example, it is unreasonable to assume that a transaction has a business 
purpose or that a transaction is potentially profitable apart from tax 
benefits. A factual assumption includes reliance on a projection, 
financial forecast or appraisal. It is unreasonable for a practitioner 
to rely on a projection, financial forecast or appraisal if the 
practitioner knows or should know that the projection, financial 
forecast or appraisal is incorrect or incomplete or was prepared by a 
person lacking the skills or qualifications necessary to prepare such 
projection, financial forecast or appraisal. The opinion must identify 
in a separate section all factual assumptions relied upon by the 
practitioner.
    (iii) The practitioner must not base the opinion on any unreasonable 
factual representations, statements or findings of the taxpayer or any 
other person. An unreasonable factual representation includes a factual 
representation that the practitioner knows or should know is incorrect 
or incomplete. For example, a practitioner may not rely on a factual 
representation that a transaction has a business purpose if the 
representation does not include a specific description of the business 
purpose or the practitioner knows or should know that the representation 
is incorrect or incomplete. The opinion must identify in a separate 
section all factual representations, statements or findings of the 
taxpayer relied upon by the practitioner.
    (2) Relate law to facts. (i) The opinion must relate the applicable 
law (including potentially applicable judicial doctrines) to the 
relevant facts.
    (ii) The practitioner must not assume the favorable resolution of 
any significant Federal tax issue except as provided in paragraphs 
(c)(3)(v) and (d) of this section, or otherwise base an opinion on any 
unreasonable legal assumptions, representations, or conclusions.
    (iii) The opinion must not contain internally inconsistent legal 
analyses or conclusions.
    (3) Evaluation of significant Federal tax issues--(i) In general. 
The opinion must consider all significant Federal tax issues except as 
provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(v) and (d) of this section.
    (ii) Conclusion as to each significant Federal tax issue. The 
opinion must provide the practitioner's conclusion as to the likelihood 
that the taxpayer will prevail on the merits with respect to each 
significant Federal tax issue considered in the opinion. If the 
practitioner is unable to reach a conclusion with respect to one or more 
of those issues, the opinion must state that the practitioner is unable 
to reach a conclusion with respect to those issues. The opinion must 
describe the reasons for the conclusions, including the facts and 
analysis supporting the conclusions, or describe the reasons that the 
practitioner is unable to reach a conclusion as to one or more issues. 
If the practitioner fails to reach a conclusion at a confidence level of 
at least more likely than not with respect to one or more significant 
Federal tax issues considered, the opinion must include the appropriate 
disclosure(s) required under paragraph (e) of this section.
    (iii) Evaluation based on chances of success on the merits. In 
evaluating the significant Federal tax issues addressed in the opinion, 
the practitioner must not take into account the possibility that a tax 
return will not be audited, that an issue will not be raised on audit, 
or that an issue will be resolved through settlement if raised.
    (iv) Marketed opinions. In the case of a marketed opinion, the 
opinion must provide the practitioner's conclusion that the taxpayer 
will prevail on the merits at a confidence level of at least more likely 
than not with respect to each significant Federal tax issue. If the 
practitioner is unable to reach a more likely than not conclusion with 
respect to each significant Federal tax issue, the practitioner must not 
provide the marketed opinion, but may provide written advice that 
satisfies

[[Page 174]]

the requirements in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section.
    (v) Limited scope opinions. (A) The practitioner may provide an 
opinion that considers less than all of the significant Federal tax 
issues if--
    (1) The practitioner and the taxpayer agree that the scope of the 
opinion and the taxpayer's potential reliance on the opinion for 
purposes of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer are 
limited to the Federal tax issue(s) addressed in the opinion;
    (2) The opinion is not advice described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of 
this section (concerning listed transactions), paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of 
this section (concerning the principal purpose of avoidance or evasion) 
or paragraph (b)(5) of this section (a marketed opinion); and
    (3) The opinion includes the appropriate disclosure(s) required 
under paragraph (e) of this section.
    (B) A practitioner may make reasonable assumptions regarding the 
favorable resolution of a Federal tax issue (an assumed issue) for 
purposes of providing an opinion on less than all of the significant 
Federal tax issues as provided in this paragraph (c)(3)(v). The opinion 
must identify in a separate section all issues for which the 
practitioner assumed a favorable resolution.
    (4) Overall conclusion. (i) The opinion must provide the 
practitioner's overall conclusion as to the likelihood that the Federal 
tax treatment of the transaction or matter that is the subject of the 
opinion is the proper treatment and the reasons for that conclusion. If 
the practitioner is unable to reach an overall conclusion, the opinion 
must state that the practitioner is unable to reach an overall 
conclusion and describe the reasons for the practitioner's inability to 
reach a conclusion.
    (ii) In the case of a marketed opinion, the opinion must provide the 
practitioner's overall conclusion that the Federal tax treatment of the 
transaction or matter that is the subject of the opinion is the proper 
treatment at a confidence level of at least more likely than not.
    (d) Competence to provide opinion; reliance on opinions of others. 
(1) The practitioner must be knowledgeable in all of the aspects of 
Federal tax law relevant to the opinion being rendered, except that the 
practitioner may rely on the opinion of another practitioner with 
respect to one or more significant Federal tax issues, unless the 
practitioner knows or should know that the opinion of the other 
practitioner should not be relied on. If a practitioner relies on the 
opinion of another practitioner, the relying practitioner's opinion must 
identify the other opinion and set forth the conclusions reached in the 
other opinion.
    (2) The practitioner must be satisfied that the combined analysis of 
the opinions, taken as a whole, and the overall conclusion, if any, 
satisfy the requirements of this section.
    (e) Required disclosures. A covered opinion must contain all of the 
following disclosures that apply--
    (1) Relationship between promoter and practitioner. An opinion must 
prominently disclose the existence of--
    (i) Any compensation arrangement, such as a referral fee or a fee-
sharing arrangement, between the practitioner (or the practitioner's 
firm or any person who is a member of, associated with, or employed by 
the practitioner's firm) and any person (other than the client for whom 
the opinion is prepared) with respect to promoting, marketing or 
recommending the entity, plan, or arrangement (or a substantially 
similar arrangement) that is the subject of the opinion; or
    (ii) Any referral agreement between the practitioner (or the 
practitioner's firm or any person who is a member of, associated with, 
or employed by the practitioner's firm) and a person (other than the 
client for whom the opinion is prepared) engaged in promoting, marketing 
or recommending the entity, plan, or arrangement (or a substantially 
similar arrangement) that is the subject of the opinion.
    (2) Marketed opinions. A marketed opinion must prominently disclose 
that--
    (i) The opinion was written to support the promotion or marketing of 
the transaction(s) or matter(s) addressed in the opinion; and
    (ii) The taxpayer should seek advice based on the taxpayer's 
particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor.

[[Page 175]]

    (3) Limited scope opinions. A limited scope opinion must prominently 
disclose that--
    (i) The opinion is limited to the one or more Federal tax issues 
addressed in the opinion;
    (ii) Additional issues may exist that could affect the Federal tax 
treatment of the transaction or matter that is the subject of the 
opinion and the opinion does not consider or provide a conclusion with 
respect to any additional issues; and
    (iii) With respect to any significant Federal tax issues outside the 
limited scope of the opinion, the opinion was not written, and cannot be 
used by the taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be 
imposed on the taxpayer.
    (4) Opinions that fail to reach a more likely than not conclusion. 
An opinion that does not reach a conclusion at a confidence level of at 
least more likely than not with respect to a significant Federal tax 
issue must prominently disclose that--
    (i) The opinion does not reach a conclusion at a confidence level of 
at least more likely than not with respect to one or more significant 
Federal tax issues addressed by the opinion; and
    (ii) With respect to those significant Federal tax issues, the 
opinion was not written, and cannot be used by the taxpayer, for the 
purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer.
    (5) Advice regarding required disclosures. In the case of any 
disclosure required under this section, the practitioner may not provide 
advice to any person that is contrary to or inconsistent with the 
required disclosure.
    (f) Effect of opinion that meets these standards--(1) In general. An 
opinion that meets the requirements of this section satisfies the 
practitioner's responsibilities under this section, but the 
persuasiveness of the opinion with regard to the tax issues in question 
and the taxpayer's good faith reliance on the opinion will be determined 
separately under applicable provisions of the law and regulations.
    (2) Standards for other written advice. A practitioner who provides 
written advice that is not a covered opinion for purposes of this 
section is subject to the requirements of Sec. 10.37.
    (g) Effective date. This section applies to written advice that is 
rendered after June 20, 2005.

Sec. 10.36  Procedures to ensure compliance.

    (a) Requirements for covered opinions. Any practitioner who has (or 
practitioners who have or share) principal authority and responsibility 
for overseeing a firm's practice of providing advice concerning Federal 
tax issues must take reasonable steps to ensure that the firm has 
adequate procedures in effect for all members, associates, and employees 
for purposes of complying with Sec. 10.35. Any such practitioner will 
be subject to discipline for failing to comply with the requirements of 
this paragraph if--
    (1) The practitioner through willfulness, recklessness, or gross 
incompetence does not take reasonable steps to ensure that the firm has 
adequate procedures to comply with Sec. 10.35, and one or more 
individuals who are members of, associated with, or employed by, the 
firm are, or have, engaged in a pattern or practice, in connection with 
their practice with the firm, of failing to comply with Sec. 10.35; or
    (2) The practitioner knows or should know that one or more 
individuals who are members of, associated with, or employed by, the 
firm are, or have, engaged in a pattern or practice, in connection with 
their practice with the firm, that does not comply with Sec. 10.35 and 
the practitioner, through willfulness, recklessness, or gross 
incompetence, fails to take prompt action to correct the noncompliance.
    (b) Effective date. This section is applicable after June 20, 2005.

[T.D. 9011, 67 FR 48771, July 26, 2002, as amended by T.D. 9165, 69 FR 
75842, Dec. 20, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 10.37  Requirements for other written advice.

    (a) Requirements. A practitioner must not give written advice 
(including electronic communications) concerning

[[Page 176]]

one or more Federal tax issues if the practitioner bases the written 
advice on unreasonable factual or legal assumptions (including 
assumptions as to future events), unreasonably relies upon 
representations, statements, findings or agreements of the taxpayer or 
any other person, does not consider all relevant facts that the 
practitioner knows or should know, or, in evaluating a Federal tax 
issue, takes into account the possibility that a tax return will not be 
audited, that an issue will not be raised on audit, or that an issue 
will be resolved through settlement if raised. All facts and 
circumstances, including the scope of the engagement and the type and 
specificity of the advice sought by the client will be considered in 
determining whether a practitioner has failed to comply with this 
section. In the case of an opinion the practitioner knows or has reason 
to know will be used or referred to by a person other than the 
practitioner (or a person who is a member of, associated with, or 
employed by the practitioner's firm) in promoting, marketing or 
recommending to one or more taxpayers a partnership or other entity, 
investment plan or arrangement a significant purpose of which is the 
avoidance or evasion of any tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, 
the determination of whether a practitioner has failed to comply with 
this section will be made on the basis of a heightened standard of care 
because of the greater risk caused by the practitioner's lack of 
knowledge of the taxpayer's particular circumstances.
    (b) Effective date. This section applies to written advice that is 
rendered after June 20, 2005.

[T.D. 9011, 67 FR 48771, July 26, 2002, as amended by T.D. 9165, 69 FR

<R05>
Sec. 10.38  Establishment of advisory committees.

    (a) Advisory committees. To promote and maintain the public's 
confidence in tax advisors, the Director of the Office of Professional 
Responsibility is authorized to establish one or more advisory 
committees composed of at least five individuals authorized to practice 
before the Internal Revenue Service. The Director should ensure that 
membership of an advisory committee is balanced among those who practice 
as attorneys, accountants, and enrolled agents. Under procedures 
prescribed by the Director, an advisory committee may review and make 
general recommendations regarding professional standards or best 
practices for tax advisors, including whether hypothetical conduct would 
give rise to a violation of Sec. Sec. 10.35 or 10.36.
    (b) Effective date. This section applies after December 20, 2004.

[T.D. 9011, 67 FR 48771, July 26, 2002, as amended by T.D. 9165, 69 FR

noted.


<R05>
Sec. 10.50  Sanctions.

    (a) Authority to censure, suspend, or disbar. The Secretary of the 
Treasury, or his or her delegate, after notice and an opportunity for a 
proceeding, may censure, suspend or disbar any practitioner from 
practice before the Internal Revenue Service if the practitioner is 
shown to be incompetent or disreputable, fails to comply with any 
regulation in this part, or with intent to defraud, willfully and 
knowingly misleads or threatens a client or prospective client. Censure 
is a public reprimand.
    (b) Authority to disqualify. The Secretary of the Treasury, or his 
or her delegate, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, may 
disqualify any appraiser with respect to whom a penalty has been 
assessed under section 6701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (1) If any appraiser is disqualified pursuant to this subpart C, 
such appraiser is barred from presenting evidence or testimony in any 
administrative proceeding before the Department of Treasury or the 
Internal Revenue Service, unless and until authorized to do so by the 
Director of Practice pursuant to Sec. 10.81, regardless of whether such 
evidence or testimony would pertain to an appraisal made prior to or 
after such date.

[[Page 177]]

    (2) Any appraisal made by a disqualified appraiser after the 
effective date of disqualification will not have any probative effect in 
any administrative proceeding before the Department of the Treasury or 
the Internal Revenue Service. An appraisal otherwise barred from 
admission into evidence pursuant to this section may be admitted into 
evidence solely for the purpose of determining the taxpayer's reliance 
in good faith on such appraisal.


<R05>
Sec. 10.51  Incompetence and disreputable conduct.

    Incompetence and disreputable conduct for which a practitioner may 
be censured, suspended or disbarred from practice before the Internal 
Revenue Service includes, but is not limited to--
    (a) Conviction of any criminal offense under the revenue laws of the 
United States;
    (b) Conviction of any criminal offense involving dishonesty or 
breach of trust;
    (c) Conviction of any felony under Federal or State law for which 
the conduct involved renders the practitioner unfit to practice before 
the Internal Revenue Service;
    (d) Giving false or misleading information, or participating in any 
way in the giving of false or misleading information to the Department 
of the Treasury or any officer or employee thereof, or to any tribunal 
authorized to pass upon Federal tax matters, in connection with any 
matter pending or likely to be pending before them, knowing such 
information to be false or misleading. Facts or other matters contained 
in testimony, Federal tax returns, financial statements, applications 
for enrollment, affidavits, declarations, or any other document or 
statement, written or oral, are included in the term information.
    (e) Solicitation of employment as prohibited under Sec. 10.30, the 
use of false or misleading representations with intent to deceive a 
client or prospective client in order to procure employment, or 
intimating that the practitioner is able improperly to obtain special 
consideration or action from the Internal Revenue Service or officer or 
employee thereof.
    (f) Willfully failing to make a Federal tax return in violation of 
the revenue laws of the United States, willfully evading, attempting to 
evade, or participating in any way in evading or attempting to evade any 
assessment or payment of any Federal tax, or knowingly counseling or 
suggesting to a client or prospective client an illegal plan to evade 
Federal taxes or payment thereof.
    (g) Misappropriation of, or failure properly and promptly to remit 
funds received from a client for the purpose of payment of taxes or 
other obligations due the United States.
    (h) Directly or indirectly attempting to influence, or offering or 
agreeing to attempt to influence, the official action of any officer or 
employee of the Internal Revenue Service by the use of threats, false 
accusations, duress or coercion, by the offer of any special inducement 
or promise of advantage or by the bestowing of any gift, favor or thing 
of value.
    (i) Disbarment or suspension from practice as an attorney, certified 
public accountant, public accountant, or actuary by any duly constituted 
authority of any State, territory, possession of the United States, 
including a Commonwealth, or the District of Columbia, any Federal court 
of record or any Federal agency, body or board.
    (j) Knowingly aiding and abetting another person to practice before 
the Internal Revenue Service during a period of suspension, disbarment, 
or ineligibility of such other person.
    (k) Contemptuous conduct in connection with practice before the 
Internal Revenue Service, including the use of abusive language, making 
false accusations and statements, knowing them to be false, or 
circulating or publishing malicious or libelous matter.
    (l) Giving a false opinion, knowingly, recklessly, or through gross 
incompetence, including an opinion which is intentionally or recklessly 
misleading, or engaging in a pattern of providing incompetent opinions 
on questions arising under the Federal tax laws. False opinions 
described in this paragraph (l) include those which reflect or result 
from a knowing misstatement of fact or law, from an assertion of a 
position known to be unwarranted under

[[Page 178]]

existing law, from counseling or assisting in conduct known to be 
illegal or fraudulent, from concealing matters required by law to be 
revealed, or from consciously disregarding information indicating that 
material facts expressed in the tax opinion or offering material are 
false or misleading. For purposes of this paragraph (l), reckless 
conduct is a highly unreasonable omission or misrepresentation involving 
an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care that a 
practitioner should observe under the circumstances. A pattern of 
conduct is a factor that will be taken into account in determining 
whether a practitioner acted knowingly, recklessly, or through gross 
incompetence. Gross incompetence includes conduct that reflects gross 
indifference, preparation which is grossly inadequate under the 
circumstances, and a consistent failure to perform obligations to the 
client.


<R05>
Sec. 10.52  Violation of regulations.

    (a) Prohibited conduct. A practitioner may be censured, suspended or 
disbarred from practice before the Internal Revenue Service for any of 
the following:
    (1) Willfully violating any of the regulations (other than Sec. 
10.33) contained in this part; or
    (2) Recklessly or through gross incompetence (within the meaning of 
Sec. 10.51(l)) violating Sec. Sec.  10.34, 10.35, 10.36 or 10.37.
    (b) Effective date. This section applies after June 20, 2005.

<R05>
Sec. 10.53  Receipt of information concerning practitioner.

    (a) Officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service. If an 
officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service has reason to 
believe that a practitioner has violated any provision of this part, the 
officer or employee will promptly make a written report to the Director 
of Practice of the suspected violation. The report will explain the 
facts and reasons upon which the officer's or employee's belief rests.
    (b) Other persons. Any person other than an officer or employee of 
the Internal Revenue Service having information of a violation of any 
provision of this part may make an oral or written report of the alleged 
violation to the Director of Practice or any officer or employee of the 
Internal Revenue Service. If the report is made to an officer or 
employee of the Internal Revenue Service, the officer or employee will 
make a written report of the suspected violation to the Director of 
Practice.
    (c) Destruction of report. No report made under paragraph (a) or (b) 
of this section shall be maintained by the Director of Practice unless 
retention of such record is permissible under the applicable records 
control schedule as approved by the National Archives and Records 
Administration and designated in the Internal Revenue Manual. The 
Director of Practice must destroy such reports as soon as permissible 
under the applicable records control schedule.
    (d) Effect on proceedings under subpart D. The destruction of any 
report will not bar any proceeding under subpart D of this part, but 
precludes the Director of Practice's use of a copy of such report in a 
proceeding under subpart D of this part.

Internal Revenue Service or the regulations in this part, the Director 
of Practice may reprimand the practitioner or, in accordance with Sec. 
10.62, institute a proceeding for censure, suspension, or disbarment of

[[Page 179]]

a proceeding for disqualification of the appraiser. A proceeding for 
disqualification of an appraiser is instituted by the filing of a 
complaint, the contents of which are more fully described in Sec. 
10.62.
    (c) Except as provided in Sec. 10.82, a proceeding will not be 
instituted under this section unless the proposed respondent previously 
has been advised in writing of the law, facts and conduct warranting 
such action and has been accorded an opportunity to dispute facts, 
assert additional facts, and make arguments (including an explanation or 
description of mitigating circumstances).


<R05>
Sec. 10.61  Conferences.

    (a) In general. The Director of Practice may confer with a 
practitioner or an appraiser concerning allegations of misconduct 
irrespective of whether a proceeding for censure, suspension, 
disbarment, or disqualification has been instituted against the 
practitioner or appraiser. If the conference results in a stipulation in 
connection with an ongoing proceeding in which the practitioner or 
appraiser is the respondent, the stipulation may be entered in the 
record by either party to the proceeding.
    (b) Resignation or voluntary censure, suspension or disbarment. In 
lieu of a proceeding being instituted or continued under paragraph (a) 
of Sec. 10.60, a practitioner may offer his or her consent to the 
issuance of a censure, suspension or disbarment, or, if the practitioner 
is an enrolled agent, may offer to resign. The Director of Practice may, 
in his or her discretion, accept or decline the offered censure, 
suspension, disbarment, or offer of resignation by an enrolled agent, in 
accordance with the consent offered. In any declination, the Director of 
Practice may state that he or she would accept an offer of censure, 
suspension, or disbarment, or, if the practitioner is an enrolled agent, 
offer of resignation, containing different terms; the Director of 
Practice may, in his or her discretion, accept or reject a revised offer 
of censure, suspension, disbarment, or offer of resignation by an 
enrolled agent, submitted in response to the declination or may 
counteroffer and act upon any accepted counteroffer.
    (c) Voluntary disqualification. In lieu of a proceeding being 
instituted or continued under paragraph (b) of Sec. 10.60, an appraiser 
may offer his or her consent to disqualification. The Director of 
Practice may, in his or her discretion, accept or decline the offered 
disqualification, in accordance with the consent offered. In any 
declination, the Director of Practice may state that he or she would 
accept an offer of disqualification containing different terms; the 
Director of Practice may, in his or her discretion, accept or reject a 
revised offer of censure, suspension or disbarment submitted in response 
to the declination or may counteroffer and act upon any accepted 
counteroffer.

Sec. 10.62  Contents of complaint.

    (a) Charges. A complaint must name the respondent, provide a clear 
and concise description of the facts and law that constitute the basis 
for the proceeding, and be signed by the Director of Practice or a 
person representing the Director of Practice under Sec. 10.69(a)(1). A 
complaint is sufficient if it fairly informs the respondent of the 
charges brought so that he or she is able to prepare a defense. In the 
case of a complaint filed against an appraiser, the complaint is 
sufficient if it refers to a penalty imposed previously on the 
respondent under section 6701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (b) Specification of sanction. The complaint must specify the 
sanction sought by the Director of Practice against the practitioner or 
appraiser. If the sanction sought is a suspension, the duration of the 
suspension sought must be specified.

the name and address of the Administrative Law Judge with whom the 
answer must be filed, the name and address of the person representing

paper, plus one additional copy, must be filed with the Administrative 
Law Judge at the address specified in the complaint or at an address 
otherwise specified by the Administrative Law Judge. All papers filed in 
connection with a proceeding under this part must be served on the other 
party, unless the Administrative Law Judge directs otherwise. A 
certificate evidencing such must be attached to the original paper filed

<R05>
Sec. 10.64  Answer; default.

    (a) Filing. The respondent's answer must be filed with the 
Administrative Law Judge, and served on the Director of Practice, within 
the time specified in the complaint unless, on request or application of 
the respondent, the time is extended by the Administrative Law Judge.
    (b) Contents. The answer must be written and contain a statement of 
facts that constitute the respondent's grounds of defense. General 
denials are not permitted. The respondent must specifically admit or 
deny each allegation set forth in the complaint, except that the 
respondent may state that the respondent is without sufficient 
information to admit or deny a specific allegation. The respondent, 
nevertheless, may not deny a material allegation in the complaint that 
the respondent knows to be true, or state that the respondent is without 
sufficient information to form a belief, when the respondent possesses 
the required information. The respondent also must state affirmatively 
any special matters of defense on which he or she relies.
    (c) Failure to deny or answer allegations in the complaint. Every 
allegation in the complaint that is not denied in the answer is deemed 
admitted and will be considered proved; no further evidence in respect 
of such allegation need be adduced at a hearing.
    (d) Default. Failure to file an answer within the time prescribed 
(or within the time for answer as extended by the Administrative Law 
Judge), constitutes an admission of the allegations of the complaint and 
a waiver of hearing, and the Administrative Law Judge may make the 
decision by default without a hearing or further procedure. A decision 
by default constitutes a decision under Sec. 10.76.
    (e) Signature. The answer must be signed by the respondent or the 
respondent's authorized representative under Sec. 10.69(a)(2) and must 
include a statement directly above the signature acknowledging that the 
statements made in the answer are true and correct and that knowing and 
willful false statements may be punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001.


<R05>
Sec. 10.65  Supplemental charges.

    If it appears that the respondent, in his or her answer, falsely and 
in bad faith, denies a material allegation of fact in the complaint or 
states that the respondent has insufficient knowledge to form a belief, 
when the respondent in fact possesses such information, or if it appears 
that the respondent has knowingly introduced false testimony during 
proceedings for his or her censure, suspension, disbarment, or 
disqualification, the Director of Practice may file supplemental charges 
against the respondent. The supplemental charges may be heard with other 
charges in the case, provided the respondent is given due notice of the 
charges and is afforded an opportunity to prepare a defense to such 
charges.


<R05>
Sec. 10.66  Reply to answer.

    The Director of Practice may file a reply to the respondent's 
answer, but unless otherwise ordered by the Administrative Law Judge, no 
reply to the respondent's answer is required. If a reply is not filed, 
new matter in the answer is deemed denied.


<R05>
Sec. 10.67  Proof; variance; amendment of pleadings.

    In the case of a variance between the allegations in pleadings and 
the evidence adduced in support of the pleadings, the Administrative Law 
Judge, at any time before decision, may order or authorize amendment of 
the pleadings to conform to the evidence. The party who would otherwise 
be prejudiced by the amendment must be given a reasonable opportunity to 
address the allegations of the pleadings as amended

[[Page 182]]

and the Administrative Law Judge must make findings on any issue 
presented by the pleadings as amended.


<R05>
Sec. 10.68  Motions and requests.

    (a) Motions. At any time after the filing of the complaint, any 
party may file a motion with the Administrative Law Judge. Unless 
otherwise ordered by the Administrative Law Judge, motions must be in 
writing and must be served on the opposing party as provided in Sec. 
10.63(b). A motion must concisely specify its grounds and the relief 
sought, and, if appropriate, must contain a memorandum of facts and law 
in support. Before moving, a party must make a good faith effort to 
resolve with the other party any dispute that gives rise to, or is a 
concern of, the motion. The movant must certify such an attempt was made 
and state, if it is known, whether the opposing party opposes the 
motion.
    (b) Response. Unless otherwise ordered by the Administrative Law 
Judge, the nonmoving party is not required to file a response to a 
motion. If the Administrative Law Judge does not order the nonmoving 
party to file a response, the nonmoving party is deemed to oppose the 
motion.
    (c) Oral motions and arguments. The Administrative Law Judge may, 
for good cause and with notice to the parties, permit oral motions and 
oral opposition to motions. The Administrative Law Judge may, within his 
or her discretion, permit oral argument on any motion.


<R05>
Sec. 10.69  Representation; ex parte communication.

    (a) Representation. (1) The Director of Practice may be represented 
in proceedings under this part by an attorney or other employee of the 
Internal Revenue Service. An attorney or an employee of the Internal 
Revenue Service representing the Director of Practice in a proceeding 
under this part may sign the complaint or any document required to be 
filed in the proceeding on behalf of the Director of Practice.
    (2) A respondent may appear in person, be represented by a 
practitioner, or be represented by an attorney who has not filed a 
declaration with the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Sec. 10.3. A 
practitioner or an attorney representing a respondent or proposed 
respondent may sign the answer or any document required to be filed in 
the proceeding on behalf of the respondent.
    (b) Ex parte communication. The Director of Practice, the 
respondent, and any representatives of either party, may not attempt to 
initiate or participate in ex parte discussions concerning a proceeding 
or potential proceeding with the Administrative Law Judge (or any person 
who is likely to advise the Administrative Law Judge on a ruling or 
decision) in the proceeding before or during the pendency of the 
proceeding. Any memorandum, letter or other communication concerning the 
merits of the proceeding, addressed to the Administrative Law Judge, by 
or on behalf of any party shall be regarded as an argument in the 
proceeding and shall be served on the other party.


<R05>
Sec. 10.70  Administrative Law Judge.

    (a) Appointment. Proceedings on complaints for the censure,

[[Page 183]]

    (7) Receive and consider oral or written argument on facts or law;
    (8) Hold or provide for the holding of conferences for the 
settlement or simplification of the issues with the consent of the

    (9) Perform such acts and take such measures as are necessary or 
appropriate to the efficient conduct of any proceeding; and
    (10) Make decisions.


<R05>
Sec. 10.71  Hearings.

    (a) In general. An Administrative Law Judge will preside at the 
hearing on a complaint filed under paragraph (c) of Sec. 10.60 for the 
censure, suspension, or disbarment of a practitioner or disqualification 
of an appraiser. Hearings will be stenographically recorded and 
transcribed and the testimony of witnesses will be taken under oath or 
affirmation. Hearings will be conducted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 556. A 
hearing in a proceeding requested under paragraph (g) of Sec. 10.82 
will be conducted de novo. An evidentiary hearing must be held in all 
proceedings prior to the issuance of a decision by the Administrative 
Law Judge unless: the Director of Practice withdraws the complaint; the 
practitioner consents to a sanction pursuant to Sec. 10.61(b); a 
decision is issued by default pursuant to Sec. 10.64(d), a decision is 
issued under Sec. 10.82(e); the respondent requests a decision on the 
record without a hearing; or the Administrative Law Judge issues a 
decision on a motion that disposes of the case prior to the hearing.
    (b) Publicity of proceedings. A request by a practitioner or 
appraiser that a hearing in a disciplinary proceeding concerning him or 
her be public, and that the record of such disciplinary proceeding be 
made available for inspection by interested persons may be granted by 
the Administrative Law Judge where the parties stipulate in advance to 
protect from disclosure confidential tax information in accordance with 
all applicable statutes and regulations.
    (c) Location. The location of the hearing will be determined by the 
agreement of the parties with the approval of the Administrative Law 
Judge, but, in the absence of such agreement and approval, the hearing 
will be held in Washington, D.C.
    (d) Failure to appear. If either party to the proceeding fails to 
appear at the hearing, after notice of the proceeding has been sent to 
him or her, the party will be deemed to have waived the right to a 
hearing and the Administrative Law Judge may make his or her decision 
against the absent party by default.


<R05>
Sec. 10.72  Evidence.

    (a) In general. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law 
and equity are not controlling in hearings or proceedings conducted 
under this part. The Administrative Law Judge may, however, exclude 
evidence that is irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious,
    (b) Depositions. The deposition of any witness taken pursuant to 
Sec. 10.73 may be admitted into evidence in any proceeding instituted 
under Sec. 10.60.
    (c) Proof of documents. Official documents, records, and papers of 
the Internal Revenue Service and the Office of Director of Practice are 
admissible in evidence without the production of an officer or employee 
to authenticate them. Any such documents, records, and papers may be 
evidenced by a copy attested or identified by an officer or employee of 
the Internal Revenue Service or the Treasury Department, as the case may 
be.
    (d) Withdrawal of exhibits. If any document, record, or other paper 
is introduced in evidence as an exhibit, the Administrative Law Judge 
may authorize the withdrawal of the exhibit subject to any conditions 
that he or she deems proper.
    (e) Objections. Objections to evidence are to be made in short form, 
stating the grounds for the objection. Except as ordered by the 
Administrative Law Judge, argument on objections will not be recorded or 
transcribed. Rulings on objections are to be a part of the record, but 
no exception to a ruling is necessary to preserve the rights of the 
parties.


<R05>
Sec. 10.73  Depositions.

    (a) Depositions for use at a hearing may be taken, with the written 
approval of the Administrative Law

[[Page 184]]

Judge, by either the Director of Practice or the respondent or their 
duly authorized representatives. Depositions may be taken before any 
officer duly authorized to administer an oath for general purposes or 
before an officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service who is 
authorized to administer an oath in internal revenue matters.
    (b) The party taking the deposition must provide the deponent and 
the other party with 10 days written notice of the deposition, unless 
the deponent and the parties agree otherwise. The notice must specify 
the name of the deponent, the time and place where the deposition is to 
be taken, and whether the deposition will be taken by oral or written 
interrogatories. When a deposition is taken by written interrogatories, 
any cross-examination also will be by written interrogatories. Copies of 
the written interrogatories must be served on the other party with the 
notice of deposition, and copies of any written cross-interrogation must 
be mailed or delivered to the opposing party at least 5 days before the 
date that the deposition will be taken, unless the parties mutually 
agree otherwise. A party on whose behalf a deposition is taken must file 
the responses to the written interrogatories or a transcript of the oral 
deposition with the Administrative Law Judge and serve copies on the 
opposing party and the deponent. Expenses in the reporting of 
depositions will be borne by the party that requested the deposition.


<R05>
Sec. 10.74  Transcript.

    In cases where the hearing is stenographically reported by a 
Government contract reporter, copies of the transcript may be obtained 
from the reporter at rates not to exceed the maximum rates fixed by 
contract between the Government and the reporter. Where the hearing is 
stenographically reported by a regular employee of the Internal Revenue 
Service, a copy will be supplied to the respondent either without charge 
or upon the payment of a reasonable fee. Copies of exhibits introduced 
at the hearing or at the taking of depositions will be supplied to the 
parties upon the payment of a reasonable fee (Sec. 501, Public Law 82-
137)(65 Stat. 290)(31 U.S.C. 483a).


<R05>
Sec. 10.75  Proposed findings and conclusions.

    Except in cases where the respondent has failed to answer the 
complaint or where a party has failed to appear at the hearing, the 
parties must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to submit proposed 
findings and conclusions and their supporting reasons to the 
Administrative Law Judge.


<R05>
Sec. 10.76  Decision of Administrative Law Judge.

    (a) As soon as practicable after the conclusion of a hearing and the 
receipt of any proposed findings and conclusions timely submitted by the 
parties, the Administrative Law Judge will enter a decision in the case. 
The decision must include a statement of findings and conclusions, as 
well as the reasons or basis for making such findings and conclusions, 
and an order of censure, suspension, disbarment, disqualification, or 
dismissal of the complaint. If the sanction is censure or a suspension 
of less than six month's duration, the Administrative Law Judge, in 
rendering findings and conclusions, will consider an allegation of fact 
to be proven if it is established by the party who is alleging the fact 
by a preponderance of evidence in the record. In the event that the 
sanction is disbarment or a suspension of a duration of six months or 
longer, an allegation of fact that is necessary for a finding against 
the practitioner must be proven by clear and convincing evidence in the 
record. An allegation of fact that is necessary for a finding of 
disqualification against an appraiser must be proven by clear and 
convincing evidence in the record. The Administrative Law Judge will 
provide the decision to the Director of Practice and a copy of the 
decision to the respondent or the respondent's authorized 
representative.
    (b) In the absence of an appeal to the Secretary of the Treasury or 
his or her designee, or review of the decision on motion of the 
Secretary or his or her designee, the decision of the Administrative Law 
Judge will, without further proceedings, become the decision of the 
agency 30 days after the date of

[[Page 185]]

the Administrative Law Judge's decision.


<R05>
Sec. 10.77  Appeal of decision of Administrative Law Judge.

    Within 30 days from the date of the Administrative Law Judge's 
decision, either party may appeal to the Secretary of the Treasury, or 
his or her delegate. The respondent must file his or her appeal with the 
Director of Practice in duplicate and a notice of appeal must include 
exceptions to the decision of the Administrative Law Judge and 
supporting reasons for such exceptions. If the Director of Practice 
files an appeal, he or she must provide a copy to the respondent. Within 
30 days after receipt of an appeal or copy thereof, the other party may 
file a reply brief in duplicate with the Director of Practice. If the 
reply brief is filed by the Director of Practice, he or she must provide 
a copy of it to the respondent. The Director of Practice must provide 
the entire record to the Secretary of the Treasury, or his or her 
delegate, after the appeal and any reply brief has been filed.


<R05>
Sec. 10.78  Decision on appeal.

    On appeal from or review of the decision of the Administrative Law 
Judge, the Secretary of the Treasury, or his or her delegate, will make 
the agency decision. The Secretary of the Treasury, or his or delegate, 
will provide a copy of the agency decision to the Director of Practice 
and the respondent or the respondent's authorized representative. The 
decision of the Administrative Law Judge will not be reversed unless the 
appellant establishes that the decision is clearly erroneous in light of 
the evidence in the record and applicable law. Issues that are 
exclusively matters of law will be reviewed de novo. In the event that 
the Secretary of the Treasury, or his or her delegate, determines that 
there are unresolved issues raised by the record, the case may be 
remanded to the Administrative Law Judge to elicit additional testimony 
or evidence. A copy of the agency decision or that of his or her 
delegate will be provided to the Director of Practice and the respondent 
contemporaneously.


<R05>
Sec. 10.79  Effect of disbarment, suspension, or censure.

    (a) Disbarment. When the final decision in a case is against the 
respondent (or the respondent has offered his or her consent and such 
consent has been accepted by the Director of Practice) and such decision 
is for disbarment, the respondent will not be permitted to practice 
before the Internal Revenue Service unless and until authorized to do so 
by the Director of Practice pursuant to Sec. 10.81.
    (b) Suspension. When the final decision in a case is against the 
respondent (or the respondent has offered his or her consent and such 
consent has been accepted by the Director of Practice) and such decision 
is for suspension, the respondent will not be permitted to practice 
before the Internal Revenue Service during the period of suspension. For 
periods after the suspension, the practitioner's future representations 
may be subject to conditions as authorized by paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (c) Censure. When the final decision in the case is against the 
respondent (or the respondent has offered his or her consent and such 
consent has been accepted by the Director of Practice) and such decision 
is for censure, the respondent will be permitted to practice before the 
Internal Revenue Service, but the respondent's future representations 
may be subject to conditions as authorized by paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (d) Conditions. After being subject to the sanction of either 
suspension or censure, the future representations of a practitioner so 
sanctioned shall be subject to conditions prescribed by the Director of 
Practice designed to promote high standards of conduct. These conditions 
can be imposed for a reasonable period in light of the gravity of the 
practitioner's violations. For example, where a practitioner is censured 
because he or she failed to advise his or her clients about a potential 
conflict of interest or failed to obtain the clients' written consents, 
the Director of Practice may require the practitioner to provide the 
Director of Practice or another Internal Revenue Service official with a 
copy of all consents obtained by

[[Page 186]]

the practitioner for an appropriate period following censure, whether or 
not such consents are specifically requested.


<R05>
Sec. 10.80  Notice of disbarment, suspension, censure, or 
disqualification.

    On the issuance of a final order censuring, suspending, or 
disbarring a practitioner or a final order disqualifying an appraiser, 
the Director of Practice may give notice of the censure, suspension, 
disbarment, or disqualification to appropriate officers and employees of 
the Internal Revenue Service and to interested departments and agencies 
of the Federal government. The Director of Practice may determine the 
manner of giving notice to the proper authorities of the State by which 
the censured, suspended, or disbarred person was licensed to practice.


<R05>
Sec. 10.81  Petition for reinstatement.

    The Director of Practice may entertain a petition for reinstatement 
from any person disbarred from practice before the Internal Revenue 
Service or any disqualified appraiser after the expiration of 5 years 
following such disbarment or disqualification. Reinstatement may not be 
granted unless the Director of Practice is satisfied that the 
petitioner, thereafter, is not likely to conduct himself contrary to the 
regulations in this part, and that granting such reinstatement would not 
be contrary to the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 10.82  Expedited suspension upon criminal conviction or loss of 
license for cause.

    (a) When applicable. Whenever the Director of Practice determines 
that a practitioner is described in paragraph (b) of this section, the 
Director of Practice may institute a proceeding under this section to 
suspend the practitioner from practice before the Internal Revenue 
Service.
    (b) To whom applicable. This section applies to any practitioner 
who, within 5 years of the date a complaint instituting a proceeding 
under this section is served:
    (1) Has had his or her license to practice as an attorney, certified 
public accountant, or actuary suspended or revoked for cause (not 
including a failure to pay a professional licensing fee) by any 
authority or court, agency, body, or board described in Sec. 10.51(i); 
or
    (2) Has, irrespective of whether an appeal has been taken, been 
convicted of any crime under title 26 of the United States Code, any 
crime involving dishonesty or breach of trust, or any felony for which 
the conduct involved renders the practitioner unfit to practice before 
the Internal Revenue Service.
    (3) Has violated conditions designed to promote high standards of 
conduct established pursuant to Sec. 10.79(d).
    (c) Instituting a proceeding. A proceeding under this section will 
be instituted by a complaint that names the respondent, is signed by the 
Director of Practice or a person representing the Director of Practice 
under Sec. 10.69(a)(1), is filed in the Director of Practice's office, 
and is served according to the rules set forth in paragraph (a) of Sec. 
10.63. The complaint must give a plain and concise description of the 
allegations that constitute the basis for the proceeding. The complaint 
must notify the respondent--
    (1) Of the place and due date for filing an answer;
    (2) That a decision by default may be rendered if the respondent 
fails to file an answer as required;
    (3) That the respondent may request a conference with the Director 
of Practice to address the merits of the complaint and that any such 
request must be made in the answer; and
    (4) That the respondent may be suspended either immediately 
following the expiration of the period within which an answer must be 
filed or, if a conference is requested, immediately following the 
conference.

be filed no later than 30 calendar days following the date the complaint 
is served, unless the Director of Practice extends the time for filing. 
The answer must be filed in accordance with the rules set forth in Sec. 
10.64, except as otherwise provided in this section. A respondent is 
entitled to a conference with the Director of Practice only if the 
conference is requested in a timely filed answer. If a request for a 
conference is not made in the answer or

[[Page 187]]

the answer is not timely filed, the respondent will be deemed to have 
waived his or her right to a conference and the Director of Practice may 
suspend such respondent at any time following the date on which the 
answer was due.
    (e) Conference. The Director of Practice or his or her designee will 
preside at a conference described in this section. The conference will 
be held at a place and time selected by the Director of Practice, but no 
sooner than 14 calendar days after the date by which the answer must be 
filed with the Director of Practice, unless the respondent agrees to an 
earlier date. An authorized representative may represent the respondent 
at the conference. Following the conference, upon a finding that the 
respondent is described in paragraph (b) of this section, or upon the 
respondent's failure to appear at the conference either personally or 
through an authorized representative, the Director of Practice may 
immediately suspend the respondent from practice before the Internal 
Revenue Service.
    (f) Duration of suspension. A suspension under this section will 
commence on the date that written notice of the suspension is issued. A 
practitioner's suspension will remain effective until the earlier of the 
following--

that the practitioner is no longer described in paragraph (b) of this 
section or for any other reason; or
    (2) The suspension is lifted by an Administrative Law Judge or the 
Secretary of the Treasury in a proceeding referred to in paragraph (g) 
of this section and instituted under Sec. 10.60.
    (g) Proceeding instituted under Sec. 10.60. If the Director of 
Practice suspends a practitioner under this section, the practitioner 
may ask the Director of Practice to issue a complaint under Sec. 10.60. 
The request must be made in writing within 2 years from the date on 
which the practitioner's suspension commences. The Director of Practice 
must issue a complaint requested under this paragraph within 30 calendar 
days of receiving the request.

the installation, maintenance, repair, replacement, servicing, and 
removal of vending facility equipment shall be without cost to the 
Department of the Treasury; and
    (3) Articles sold at vending facilities operated by blind licensees 
may consist of newspapers, periodicals, publications, confections, 
tobacco products, foods, beverages, chances for any lottery authorized 
by State law and conducted by an agency of a State within such State, 
and other articles or services as are determined by the State licensing 
agency, in consultation with the appropriate Treasury bureau, to be 
suitable for a particular location. Such articles and services may be

temporary domicile in connection with a visit under paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (d) Where an extraordinary protective need exists, protection (or 
reimbursement) may be extended to missions as described in Sec. Sec. 
13.3(b)(3) (i) and (ii) whether or not associated with a visit by a

[45 FR 30621, May 9, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 13.4  Requests for protection and advance notices of reimbursement 
requests.

    (a) In cases where they believe that an extraordinary protective 
need exists, the State or local governments may request that protection 
be provided by the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division; or 
they may

[[Page 192]]

give advance notice of their intention to provide, on a reimbursable 
basis, all or part of the protection themselves.
    (1) Requests for protection or advance notices of reimbursement 
requests shall be made to: Assistant Secretary (Enforcement and 
Operations), Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20220. Each 
government requesting the protection authorized pursuant to section 202 
of Title 3, U.S. Code, as amended by Pub. L. 94-196, or which intends to 
seek reimbursement pursuant to section 208(a) of Title 3, U.S. Code and 
Sec. Sec. 13.6 and 13.7 of this part, shall submit an application 
describing the extraordinary protective need. Applications made pursuant 
to this section shall be submitted to the Assistant Secretary 14 days 
before the extraordinary protective need arises. In association with a 
visit, the application shall include the name and title of the visiting 
foreign official or dignitary, the country he represents, and the name 
and location of the international organization or mission he will be 
visting. The application shall also include, if available, the temporary 
domicile of the visiting official or dignitary and his schedule, 
including dates and times of arrival and departure from the United 
States. If the extraordinary protective need occurs at a permanent 
mission to an international organization of which the United States is a 
member or an observer mission invited to participate in the work of such 
organization, or if another foreign diplomatic mission of the country 
qualifies under Sec. 13.3 (b) or (d), the application shall include the 
name and location of the mission.
    (b) State and local governments shall also indicate on the 
application whether they are requesting the use of the United States 
Secret Service Uniformed Division or whether they are giving advance 
notice of their intention to provide, on a reimbursable basis, all or 
part of the protection themselves. In order to assist the Assistant 
Secretary in determining whether to utilize the United States Secret 
Service Uniformed Division to meet all or part of the extraordinary 
protective need, or to utilize, with their consent, the services, 
personnel, equipment, and facilities of the State or local government, 
or both, the application must include an estimate of the approximate 
number of personnel by grade and rank, the services, equipment, and 
facilities required, along with an estimate of the cost of such 
personnel, services, equipment and facilities. This application must be 
submitted in a format consistent with that illustrated in Appendix I of 
this part.
    (1) Upon receipt of a request for protection pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section and for the purposes of reimbursement pursuant to 
Sec. Sec. 13.6 and 13.7, the Assistant Secretary will determine whether 
an extraordinary protective need exists and whether the United States 
Secret Service Uniformed Division will be used for all, part or none of 
the protection. In making determinations, the Assistant Secretary may 
consult with appropriate Federal, State and local government agencies.

<R05>
Sec. 13.5  Utilization of the services, personnel, equipment, and 
facilities of State and local governments.

    The Assistant Secretary may decide to utilize, on a reimbursable 
basis, the services, personnel, equipment, and facilities of State and 
local governments of the affected metropolitan area desiring to provide 
protection, or he may utilize the United States Secret Service Uniformed 
Division, or both. If the United States Secret Service Uniformed 
Division is utilized to meet all the extraordinary protective need, the 
governments of the affected metropolitan area will not be reimbursed. If 
the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division is utilized to meet 
part of the extraordinary protective needs, the governments of the 
affected metropolitan area will be reimbursed for that qualifying 
portion of the protection which is provided by State and local police 
authorities. If the Assistant Secretary decides to utilize, with their 
consent, the services, personnel, equipment, and facilities of such 
State and local governments to meet the extraordinary protective need, 
he will so

[[Page 193]]

notify the government as soon as possible after receipt of a request for 
protection or an advance notice of a reimbursement request made pursuant 
to Sec. 13.4.

[45 FR 30622, May 9, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 13.6  Reimbursement of State and local governments.

    (a) State and local governments providing services, personnel, 
equipment, or facilities to the affected metropolitan area pursuant to 
Sec. 13.5 may forward to the Assistant Secretary a bill for 
reimbursement for the personel, equipment, facilities, and services 
utilized in meeting the extraordinary protective need. The bill shall be 
in accordance with the format in Appendix II of this part. The Assistant 
Secretary will reimburse only those costs directly related to the 
extraordinary protective need including personnel and equipment costs 
resulting from assignments made to assist in providing security at an 
otherwise qualified location in connection with the arrival, departure, 
or during the visit of a foreign dignitary. Reimbursable costs will also 
include the costs for establishing both fixed posts at a qualified 
location and protective perimeters outside of a qualified location when 
it is clearly established to the satisfaction of the Assistant Secretary 
that such assignments were necessary to assure the safety of the 
qualified location. Overhead and administrative costs associated with an 
extraordinary protective need are reimbursable as either a flat 18 
percent of the total extraordinary protective need costs, or, if such 
costs can be clearly segregated from routine police costs, on a dollar-
for-dollar basis. The jurisdiction seeking such reimbursement may select 
either method but may not use both. For the purposes of reimbursement 
the Assistant Secretary will, in all cases, determine when the 
extraordinary protective need began and terminated.

<R05>
Sec. 13.7  Reimbursement when the Assistant Secretary makes no 
determination to utilize State and local government services, personnel, 
equipment and facilities.

    (a) Where events require the State or local governments of the

undelivered, complete service may be made upon the respondent by mailing 
the complaint to him/her by first-class mail, addressed to him/her at

[[Page 199]]

making service, setting forth the manner of service, shall be proof of

information to form a belief when in fact he/she possesses such 
information. The respondent may also state affirmatively special matters 
of defense.
    (c) Failure to deny or answer allegations in the complaint. Every 
allegation in the complaint which is not denied in the answer shall be

evidence in respect of such allegation need be adduced at a hearing. 
Failure to file an answer within the time prescribed in the notice to 
the respondent, except as the time for answer is extended by the 
Director or the Administrative Law Judge, shall constitute an admission 
of the allegations of the complaint and a waiver of hearing, and the 
Administrative Law Judge may make his/her decision by default without a 
hearing or further procedure.

conclusions, as well as the reasons or basis therefor, upon all the 
material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record, and

action, or an order of dismissal of the complaint. The Administrative 
Law Judge shall file the decision with the Director and shall transmit a 
copy thereof to the respondent or his/her attorney of record. In the 
absence of an appeal to the General Counsel or review of the decision

supporting reasons for such exceptions. If an appeal is filed by the 
Director, he/she shall transmit a copy thereof to the respondent. Within 
30 days after receipt of an appeal or copy thereof, the other party may 
file a reply brief in duplicate with the Director. If the reply brief is 
filed by the Director, he/she shall transmit a copy of it to the 
respondent. Upon the filing of an appeal and a reply brief, if any, the

excuse the defendant's failure to file a timely answer, the authority 
head shall remand the case to the ALJ with instructions to grant the 
defendant an opportunity to file an answer.
    (l) If the authority head decides that the defendant's failure to 
file a timely answer is not excused, the authority head shall reinstate

assessements, the ALJ and upon appeal, the authority head, should 
evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and 
should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the 
penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs 
of fraud, the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to 
deter others who might be similarly tempted, double damages and a 
significant civil penalty ordinarily should be imposed.
    (b) Although not exhaustive, the following factors are among those 
that may influence the ALJ and the authority head in determining the 
amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the 
misconduct (i.e., the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or 
statements) charged in the complaint:

statements;

benefit falsely claimed;

misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of 
investigation;
    (6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the 
amount of the Government's loss;
    (7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon national 
defense, public health or safety, or public confidence in the management 
of Government programs and operations;
    (8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or 
similar misconduct;
    (9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct;
    (10) The degree to which the defendant has involved others in the 
misconduct or in concealing it;
    (11) Where the misconduct of employees or agents is imputed to the 
defendant, the extent to which the defendant's practices fostered or 
attempted to preclude such misconduct;
    (12) Whether the defendant cooperated in or obstructed an 
investigation of the misconduct;
    (13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting 
other wrongdoers;
    (14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of 
the defendant's sophistication with respect to it, including the extent 
of the defendant's prior participation in the program or in similar 
transactions;
    (15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, 
or administrative proceeding to have engaged in similar misconduct or to 
have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a 
State, directly or indirectly; and
    (16) The need to deter the defendant and others from engaging in the 
same or similar misconduct.
    (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ALJ or 
the authority head from considering any other factors that in any given 
case may mitigate or aggravate the offense for which penalties and 
assessments are imposed.

    (c) The ALJ shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and

employee of the party designated by the party's representative; or

evidence.
    (d) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative 
value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, 
confusion of the issues, or by considerations of undue delay or needless 
presentation of cumulative evidence.
    (e) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if it is privileged 
under Federal law.

to discrimination on the basis of handicap, nor may the agency establish 
requirements for the programs or activities of licensees or certified 
entities that subject qualified individuals with handicaps to 
discrimination on the basis of handicap. However, the programs or 
activities of entities that are licensed or certified by the agency are

<R05>
Sec. 17.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 17.150, no qualified 
individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 17.150  Program accessibility; Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not require the agency--
    (1) To make structural alterations in each of its existing 
facilities in order to make them accessible to and usable by individuals 
with handicaps where

[[Page 222]]

other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section; 
or
    (2) To take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a 
fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in 
undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where 
agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally 
alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and 
administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that 
compliance with the Sec. 17.150(a) would result in such alteration or 
burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or 
burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after 
considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and 
operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied 
by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If 
an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with 
handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
    (b) Methods. The agency may comply with the requirements of this 
section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of 
services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, 
home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, 
alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, 
use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in 
making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The agency, in making alterations to 
existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent 
compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 
U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing 
among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, 
the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and 
activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to effectively 
communicate with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature 
to applicants or participants in programs.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, the agency shall use telecommunication devices for deaf 
persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems to

    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens.
    In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 17.160 would result 
in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result 
in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or 
her designee after considering all resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would 
result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any 
other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens 
but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maxium extent possible, 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.

file, with a copy of the agreement provided to the complainant. The 
written agreement shall describe the subject matter of the complaint and

12549 and Executive Order 12689), or other authorities. 
Disqualifications frequently are not subject to the discretion of an 
agency official, may have a different scope than exclusions, or have 
special conditions that apply to the disqualification; and
    (c) Ineligibility or ineligible, which generally refers to a person 
who is either excluded or disqualified.


<R04>
                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 19.100  What does this part do?

    This part adopts a governmentwide system of debarment and suspension 
for Department of the Treasury nonprocurement activities. It also 
provides for reciprocal exclusion of persons who have been excluded 
under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and provides for the 
consolidated listing of all persons who are excluded, or disqualified by 
statute, executive order, or other legal authority. This part satisfies 
the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment and 
Suspension'' (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, 
``Debarment and Suspension'' (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 
6101 note (Section 2455, Public Law 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).


<R05>
Sec. 19.105  Does this part apply to me?

    Portions of this part (see table at Sec. 19.25(b)) apply to you if 
you are a(n)--
    (a) Person who has been, is, or may reasonably be expected to be, a 
participant or principal in a covered transaction;
    (b) Respondent (a person against whom the Department of the Treasury 
has initiated a debarment or suspension action);
    (c) Department of the Treasury debarring or suspending official; or
    (d) Department of the Treasury official who is authorized to enter 
into covered transactions with non-Federal parties.


<R05>
Sec. 19.110  What is the purpose of the nonprocurement debarment and 
suspension system?

    (a) To protect the public interest, the Federal Government ensures 
the integrity of Federal programs by conducting business only with 
responsible persons.
    (b) A Federal agency uses the nonprocurement debarment and 
suspension system to exclude from Federal programs persons who are not 
presently responsible.
    (c) An exclusion is a serious action that a Federal agency may take 
only to protect the public interest. A Federal agency may not exclude a 
person or commodity for the purposes of punishment.

[[Page 229]]


<R05>
Sec. 19.115  How does an exclusion restrict a person's involvement in 
covered transactions?

    With the exceptions stated in Sec. Sec. 19.120, 19.315, and 19.420, 
a person who is excluded by the Department of the Treasury or any other 
Federal agency may not:
    (a) Be a participant in a(n) Department of the Treasury transaction 
that is a covered transaction under subpart B of this part;
    (b) Be a participant in a transaction of any other Federal agency 
that is a covered transaction under that agency's regulation for 
debarment and suspension; or
    (c) Act as a principal of a person participating in one of those 
covered transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 19.120  May we grant an exception to let an excluded person 
participate in a covered transaction?

    (a) The Secretary of the Treasury may grant an exception permitting 
an excluded person to participate in a particular covered transaction. 
If the Secretary of the Treasury grants an exception, the exception must 
be in writing and state the reason(s) for deviating from the 
governmentwide policy in Executive Order 12549.
    (b) An exception granted by one agency for an excluded person does 
not extend to the covered transactions of another agency.


<R05>
Sec. 19.125  Does an exclusion under the nonprocurement system affect 
a person's eligibility for Federal procurement contracts?

    If any Federal agency excludes a person under its nonprocurement 
common rule on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also 
ineligible to participate in Federal procurement transactions under the 
FAR. Therefore, an exclusion under this part has reciprocal effect in 
Federal procurement transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 19.130  Does exclusion under the Federal procurement system affect 
a person's eligibility to participate in nonprocurement transactions?

    If any Federal agency excludes a person under the FAR on or after 
August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible to participate 
in nonprocurement covered transactions under this part. Therefore, an 
exclusion under the FAR has reciprocal effect in Federal nonprocurement 
transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 19.135  May the Department of the Treasury exclude a person who 
is not currently participating in a nonprocurement transaction?

    Given a cause that justifies an exclusion under this part, we may 
exclude any person who has been involved, is currently involved, or may 
reasonably be expected to be involved in a covered transaction.


<R05>
Sec. 19.140  How do I know if a person is excluded?

    Check the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) to determine whether a 
person is excluded. The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains 
the EPLS and makes it available, as detailed in subpart E of this part. 
When a Federal agency takes an action to exclude a person under the 
nonprocurement or procurement debarment and suspension system, the 
agency enters the information about the excluded person into the EPLS.


<R05>
Sec. 19.145  Does this part address persons who are disqualified, as 
well as those who are excluded from nonprocurement transactions?

    Except if provided for in Subpart J of this part, this part--
    (a) Addresses disqualified persons only to--
    (1) Provide for their inclusion in the EPLS; and
    (2) State responsibilities of Federal agencies and participants to 
check for disqualified persons before entering into covered 
transactions.
    (b) Does not specify the--
    (1) Department of the Treasury transactions for which a disqualified 
person is ineligible. Those transactions vary on a case-by-case basis, 
because they depend on the language of the specific statute, Executive 
order, or regulation that caused the disqualification;
    (2) Entities to which the disqualification applies; or
    (3) Process that the agency uses to disqualify a person. Unlike 
exclusion, disqualification is frequently not a discretionary action 
that a Federal agency takes.

[[Page 230]]


<R04>
                     Subpart B_Covered Transactions


<R05>
Sec. 19.200  What is a covered transaction?

    A covered transaction is a nonprocurement or procurement transaction 
that is subject to the prohibitions of this part. It may be a 
transaction at--
    (a) The primary tier, between a Federal agency and a person (see 
appendix to this part); or
    (b) A lower tier, between a participant in a covered transaction and 
another person.


<R05>
Sec. 19.205  Why is it important if a particular transaction is a 
covered transaction?

    The importance of a covered transaction depends upon who you are.
    (a) As a participant in the transaction, you have the 
responsibilities laid out in Subpart C of this part. Those include 
responsibilities to the person or Federal agency at the next higher tier 
from whom you received the transaction, if any. They also include 
responsibilities if you subsequently enter into other covered 
transactions with persons at the next lower tier.
    (b) As a Federal official who enters into a primary tier 
transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in subpart D of this 
part.
    (c) As an excluded person, you may not be a participant or principal 
in the transaction unless--
    (1) The person who entered into the transaction with you allows you 
to continue your involvement in a transaction that predates your 
exclusion, as permitted under Sec. 19.310 or Sec.  19.415; or
    (2) A(n) Department of the Treasury official obtains an exception 
from the Secretary of the Treasury to allow you to be involved in the 
transaction, as permitted under Sec. 19.120.


<R05>
Sec. 19.210  Which nonprocurement transactions are covered transactions?

    All nonprocurement transactions, as defined in Sec. 19.970, are 
covered transactions unless listed in Sec. 19.215. (See appendix to 
this part.)


<R05>
Sec. 19.215  Which nonprocurement transactions are not covered 
transactions?

    The following types of nonprocurement transactions are not covered 
transactions:
    (a) A direct award to--
    (1) A foreign government or foreign governmental entity;
    (2) A public international organization;
    (3) An entity owned (in whole or in part) or controlled by a foreign 
government; or
    (4) Any other entity consisting wholly or partially of one or more 
foreign governments or foreign governmental entities.
    (b) A benefit to an individual as a personal entitlement without 
regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received 
in an individual's business capacity are not excepted). For example, if 
a person receives social security benefits under the Supplemental 
Security Income provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1301 et 
seq., those benefits are not covered transactions and, therefore, are 
not affected if the person is excluded.
    (c) Federal employment.
    (d) A transaction that the Department of the Treasury needs to 
respond to a national or agency-recognized emergency or disaster.
    (e) A permit, license, certificate, or similar instrument issued as 
a means to regulate public health, safety, or the environment, unless 
the Department of the Treasury specifically designates it to be a 
covered transaction.
    (f) An incidental benefit that results from ordinary governmental 
operations.
    (g) Any other transaction if the application of an exclusion to the 
transaction is prohibited by law.


<R05>
Sec. 19.220  Are any procurement contracts included as covered 
transactions?

    (a) Covered transactions under this part--
    (1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a 
Federal agency; but
    (2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal 
participants in nonprocurement covered

[[Page 231]]

transactions (see appendix to this part).
    (b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered 
transaction if any of the following applies:
    (1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement 
transaction that is covered under Sec. 19.210, and the amount of the 
contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.
    (2) The contract requires the consent of a(n) Department of the 
Treasury official. In that case, the contract, regardless of the amount, 
always is a covered transaction, and it does not matter who awarded it. 
For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier 
below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the appendix to this 
part.
    (3) The contract is for federally-required audit services.


<R05>
Sec. 19.225  How do I know if a transaction in which I may participate 
is a covered transaction?

    As a participant in a transaction, you will know that it is a 
covered transaction because the agency regulations governing the 
transaction, the appropriate agency official, or participant at the next 
higher tier who enters into the transaction with you, will tell you that 
you must comply with applicable portions of this part.


<R04>
    Subpart C_Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions

                    Doing Business With Other Persons


<R05>
Sec. 19.300  What must I do before I enter into a covered transaction 
with another person at the next lower tier?

    When you enter into a covered transaction with another person at the 
next lower tier, you must verify that the person with whom you intend to 
do business is not excluded or disqualified. You do this by:
    (a) Checking the EPLS; or
    (b) Collecting a certification from that person if allowed by this 
rule; or
    (c) Adding a clause or condition to the covered transaction with 
that person.


<R05>
Sec. 19.305  May I enter into a covered transaction with an excluded or 
disqualified person?

    (a) You as a participant may not enter into a covered transaction 
with an excluded person, unless the Department of the Treasury grants an 
exception under Sec. 19.120.
    (b) You may not enter into any transaction with a person who is 
disqualified from that transaction, unless you have obtained an 
exception under the disqualifying statute, Executive order, or 
regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 19.310  What must I do if a Federal agency excludes a person with 
whom I am already doing business in a covered transaction?

    (a) You as a participant may continue covered transactions with an 
excluded person if the transactions were in existence when the agency 
excluded the person. However, you are not required to continue the 
transactions, and you may consider termination. You should make a 
decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, 
if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper 
and appropriate.
    (b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-
cost time extensions) with any excluded person, unless the Department of 
the Treasury grants an exception under Sec. 19.120.


<R05>
Sec. 19.315  May I use the services of an excluded person as a principal 
under a covered transaction?

    (a) You as a participant may continue to use the services of an 
excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction if you were 
using the services of that person in the transaction before the person 
was excluded. However, you are not required to continue using that 
person's services as a principal. You should make a decision about 
whether to discontinue that person's services only after a thorough 
review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.
    (b) You may not begin to use the services of an excluded person as a 
principal under a covered transaction unless the Department of the 
Treasury grants an exception under Sec. 19.120.

[[Page 232]]


<R05>
Sec. 19.320  Must I verify that principals of my covered transactions 
are eligible to participate?

    Yes, you as a participant are responsible for determining whether 
any of your principals of your covered transactions is excluded or 
disqualified from participating in the transaction. You may decide the 
method and frequency by which you do so. You may, but you are not 
required to, check the EPLS.


<R05>
Sec. 19.325  What happens if I do business with an excluded person in 
a covered transaction?

    If as a participant you knowingly do business with an excluded 
person, we may disallow costs, annul or terminate the transaction, issue 
a stop work order, debar or suspend you, or take other remedies as 
appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 19.330  What requirements must I pass down to persons at lower 
tiers with whom I intend to do business?

    Before entering into a covered transaction with a participant at the 
next lower tier, you must require that participant to--
    (a) Comply with this subpart as a condition of participation in the 
transaction. You may do so using any method(s), unless Sec. 19.440 
requires you to use specific methods.
    (b) Pass the requirement to comply with this subpart to each person 
with whom the participant enters into a covered transaction at the next 
lower tier.

            Disclosing Information--Primary Tier Participants


<R05>
Sec. 19.335  What information must I provide before entering into a 
covered transaction with the Department of the Treasury?

    Before you enter into a covered transaction at the primary tier, you 
as the participant must notify the Department of the Treasury office 
that is entering into the transaction with you, if you know that you or 
any of the principals for that covered transaction:
    (a) Are presently excluded or disqualified;
    (b) Have been convicted within the preceding three years of any of 
the offenses listed in Sec. 19.800(a) or had a civil judgment rendered 
against you for one of those offenses within that time period;
    (c) Are presently indicted for or otherwise criminally or civilly 
charged by a governmental entity (Federal, State or local) with 
commission of any of the offenses listed in Sec. 19.800(a); or
    (d) Have had one or more public transactions (Federal, State, or 
local) terminated within the preceding three years for cause or default.


<R05>
Sec. 19.340  If I disclose unfavorable information required under 
Sec. 19.335, will I be prevented from participating in the transaction?

    As a primary tier participant, your disclosure of unfavorable 
information about yourself or a principal under Sec. 19.335 will not 
necessarily cause us to deny your participation in the covered 
transaction. We will consider the information when we determine whether 
to enter into the covered transaction. We also will consider any 
additional information or explanation that you elect to submit with the 
disclosed information.


<R05>
Sec. 19.345  What happens if I fail to disclose information required 
under Sec. 19.335?

    If we later determine that you failed to disclose information under 
Sec. 19.335 that you knew at the time you entered into the covered 
transaction, we may--
    (a) Terminate the transaction for material failure to comply with 
the terms and conditions of the transaction; or
    (b) Pursue any other available remedies, including suspension and 
debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 19.350  What must I do if I learn of information required under 
Sec. 19.335 after entering into a covered transaction with the 
Department of the Treasury?

    At any time after you enter into a covered transaction, you must 
give immediate written notice to the Department of the Treasury office 
with which you entered into the transaction if you learn either that--
    (a) You failed to disclose information earlier, as required by Sec. 
19.335; or
    (b) Due to changed circumstances, you or any of the principals for 
the

[[Page 233]]

transaction now meet any of the criteria in Sec. 19.335.

             Disclosing Information--Lower Tier Participants


<R05>
Sec. 19.355  What information must I provide to a higher tier 
participant before entering into a covered transaction with that 
participant?

    Before you enter into a covered transaction with a person at the 
next higher tier, you as a lower tier participant must notify that 
person if you know that you or any of the principals are presently 
excluded or disqualified.


<R05>
Sec. 19.360  What happens if I fail to disclose the information required 
under Sec. 19.355?

    If we later determine that you failed to tell the person at the 
higher tier that you were excluded or disqualified at the time you 
entered into the covered transaction with that person, we may pursue any 
available remedies, including suspension and debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 19.365  What must I do if I learn of information required under 
Sec. 19.355 after entering into a covered transaction with a higher 
tier participant?

    At any time after you enter into a lower tier covered transaction 
with a person at a higher tier, you must provide immediate written 
notice to that person if you learn either that--
    (a) You failed to disclose information earlier, as required by Sec. 
19.355; or
    (b) Due to changed circumstances, you or any of the principals for 
the transaction now meet any of the criteria in Sec. 19.355.


<R04>
   Subpart D_Responsibilities of Department of the Treasury Officials 
                         Regarding Transactions


<R05>
Sec. 19.400  May I enter into a transaction with an excluded or 
disqualified person?

    (a) You as an agency official may not enter into a covered 
transaction with an excluded person unless you obtain an exception under 
Sec. 19.120.
    (b) You may not enter into any transaction with a person who is 
disqualified from that transaction, unless you obtain a waiver or 
exception under the statute, Executive order, or regulation that is the 
basis for the person's disqualification.


<R05>
Sec. 19.405  May I enter into a covered transaction with a participant 
if a principal of the transaction is excluded?

    As an agency official, you may not enter into a covered transaction 
with a participant if you know that a principal of the transaction is 
excluded, unless you obtain an exception under Sec. 19.120.


<R05>
Sec. 19.410  May I approve a participant's use of the services of an 
excluded person?

    After entering into a covered transaction with a participant, you as 
an agency official may not approve a participant's use of an excluded 
person as a principal under that transaction, unless you obtain an 
exception under Sec. 19.120.


<R05>
Sec. 19.415  What must I do if a Federal agency excludes the participant 
or a principal after I enter into a covered transaction?

    (a) You as an agency official may continue covered transactions with 
an excluded person, or under which an excluded person is a principal, if 
the transactions were in existence when the person was excluded. You are 
not required to continue the transactions, however, and you may consider 
termination. You should make a decision about whether to terminate and 
the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to 
ensure that the action is proper.
    (b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-
cost time extensions) with any excluded person, or under which an 
excluded person is a principal, unless you obtain an exception under 
Sec. 19.120.


<R05>
Sec. 19.420  May I approve a transaction with an excluded or 
disqualified person at a lower tier?

    If a transaction at a lower tier is subject to your approval, you as 
an agency official may not approve--
    (a) A covered transaction with a person who is currently excluded, 
unless you obtain an exception under Sec. 19.120; or

[[Page 234]]

    (b) A transaction with a person who is disqualified from that 
transaction, unless you obtain a waiver or exception under the statute, 
Executive order, or regulation that is the basis for the person's 
disqualification.


<R05>
Sec. 19.425  When do I check to see if a person is excluded or 
disqualified?

    As an agency official, you must check to see if a person is excluded 
or disqualified before you--
    (a) Enter into a primary tier covered transaction;
    (b) Approve a principal in a primary tier covered transaction;
    (c) Approve a lower tier participant if agency approval of the lower 
tier participant is required; or
    (d) Approve a principal in connection with a lower tier transaction 
if agency approval of the principal is required.


<R05>
Sec. 19.430  How do I check to see if a person is excluded or 
disqualified?

    You check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified in two 
ways:
    (a) You as an agency official must check the EPLS when you take any 
action listed in Sec. 19.425.
    (b) You must review information that a participant gives you, as 
required by Sec. 19.335, about its status or the status of the 
principals of a transaction.


<R05>
Sec. 19.435  What must I require of a primary tier participant?

    You as an agency official must require each participant in a primary 
tier covered transaction to--
    (a) Comply with subpart C of this part as a condition of 
participation in the transaction; and
    (b) Communicate the requirement to comply with Subpart C of this 
part to persons at the next lower tier with whom the primary tier 
participant enters into covered transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 19.440  What method do I use to communicate those requirements 
to participants?

    To communicate the requirements, you must include a term or 
condition in the transaction requiring the participants' compliance with 
subpart C of this part and requiring them to include a similar term or 
condition in lower-tier covered transactions.

[68 FR 66607, Nov. 26, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 19.445  What action may I take if a primary tier participant 
knowingly does business with an excluded or disqualified person?

    If a participant knowingly does business with an excluded or 
disqualified person, you as an agency official may refer the matter for 
suspension and debarment consideration. You may also disallow costs, 
annul or terminate the transaction, issue a stop work order, or take any 
other appropriate remedy.


<R05>
Sec. 19.450  What action may I take if a primary tier participant fails 
to disclose the information required under Sec. 19.335?

    If you as an agency official determine that a participant failed to 
disclose information, as required by Sec. 19.335, at the time it 
entered into a covered transaction with you, you may--
    (a) Terminate the transaction for material failure to comply with 
the terms and conditions of the transaction; or
    (b) Pursue any other available remedies, including suspension and 
debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 19.455  What may I do if a lower tier participant fails to disclose 
the information required under Sec. 19.355 to the next higher tier?

    If you as an agency official determine that a lower tier participant 
failed to disclose information, as required by Sec. 19.355, at the time 
it entered into a covered transaction with a participant at the next 
higher tier, you may pursue any remedies available to you, including the 
initiation of a suspension or debarment action.


<R04>
                 Subpart E_Excluded Parties List System


<R05>
Sec. 19.500  What is the purpose of the Excluded Parties List System 
(EPLS)?

    The EPLS is a widely available source of the most current 
information about persons who are excluded or disqualified from covered 
transactions.

[[Page 235]]


<R05>
Sec. 19.505  Who uses the EPLS?

    (a) Federal agency officials use the EPLS to determine whether to 
enter into a transaction with a person, as required under Sec. 19.430.
    (b) Participants also may, but are not required to, use the EPLS to 
determine if--
    (1) Principals of their transactions are excluded or disqualified, 
as required under Sec. 19.320; or
    (2) Persons with whom they are entering into covered transactions at 
the next lower tier are excluded or disqualified.
    (c) The EPLS is available to the general public.


<R05>
Sec. 19.510  Who maintains the EPLS?

    In accordance with the OMB guidelines, the General Services 
Administration (GSA) maintains the EPLS. When a Federal agency takes an 
action to exclude a person under the nonprocurement or procurement 
debarment and suspension system, the agency enters the information about 
the excluded person into the EPLS.


<R05>
Sec. 19.515  What specific information is in the EPLS?

    (a) At a minimum, the EPLS indicates--
    (1) The full name (where available) and address of each excluded or 
disqualified person, in alphabetical order, with cross references if 
more than one name is involved in a single action;
    (2) The type of action;
    (3) The cause for the action;
    (4) The scope of the action;
    (5) Any termination date for the action;
    (6) The agency and name and telephone number of the agency point of 
contact for the action; and
    (7) The Dun and Bradstreet Number (DUNS), or other similar code 
approved by the GSA, of the excluded or disqualified person, if 
available.
    (b)(1) The database for the EPLS includes a field for the Taxpayer 
Identification Number (TIN) (the social security number (SSN) for an 
individual) of an excluded or disqualified person.
    (2) Agencies disclose the SSN of an individual to verify the 
identity of an individual, only if permitted under the Privacy Act of 
1974 and, if appropriate, the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection 
Act of 1988, as codified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a).


<R05>
Sec. 19.520  Who places the information into the EPLS?

    Federal officials who take actions to exclude persons under this 
part or officials who are responsible for identifying disqualified 
persons must enter the following information about those persons into

   Subpart F_General Principles Relating to Suspension and Debarment 
                                 Actions


<R05>
Sec. 19.600  How do suspension and debarment actions start?

    When we receive information from any source concerning a cause for 
suspension or debarment, we will promptly report and investigate it. We 
refer the question of whether to suspend or debar you to our suspending 
or debarring official for consideration, if appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 19.605  How does suspension differ from debarment?

<R05>
Sec. 19.610  What procedures does the Department of the Treasury use in 
suspension and debarment actions?

    In deciding whether to suspend or debar you, we handle the actions 
as informally as practicable, consistent with principles of fundamental 
fairness.
    (a) For suspension actions, we use the procedures in this subpart 
and subpart G of this part.
    (b) For debarment actions, we use the procedures in this subpart and 
subpart H of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 19.615  How does the Department of the Treasury notify a person 
of a suspension or debarment action?

    (a) The suspending or debarring official sends a written notice to 
the last known street address, facsimile number, or e-mail address of--
    (1) You or your identified counsel; or
    (2) Your agent for service of process, or any of your partners, 
officers, directors, owners, or joint venturers.
    (b) The notice is effective if sent to any of these persons.


<R05>
Sec. 19.620  Do Federal agencies coordinate suspension and debarment 
actions?

    Yes, when more than one Federal agency has an interest in a 
suspension or debarment, the agencies may consider designating one 
agency as the lead agency for making the decision. Agencies are 
encouraged to establish methods and procedures for coordinating their 
suspension and debarment actions.


<R05>
Sec. 19.625  What is the scope of a suspension or debarment?

    If you are suspended or debarred, the suspension or debarment is 
effective as follows:
    (a) Your suspension or debarment constitutes suspension or debarment 
of all of your divisions and other organizational elements from all 
covered transactions, unless the suspension or debarment decision is 
limited--
    (1) By its terms to one or more specifically identified individuals, 
divisions, or other organizational elements; or
    (2) To specific types of transactions.
    (b) Any affiliate of a participant may be included in a suspension 
or debarment action if the suspending or debarring official--
    (1) Officially names the affiliate in the notice; and
    (2) Gives the affiliate an opportunity to contest the action.

[[Page 237]]


<R05>
Sec. 19.630  May the Department of the Treasury impute conduct of one 
person to another?

    For purposes of actions taken under this rule, we may impute conduct 
as follows:
    (a) Conduct imputed from an individual to an organization. We may 
impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any 
officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual 
associated with an organization, to that organization when the improper 
conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of 
duties for or on behalf of that organization, or with the organization's 
knowledge, approval or acquiescence. The organization's acceptance of 
the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval 
or acquiescence.
    (b) Conduct imputed from an organization to an individual, or 
between individuals. We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other 
improper conduct of any organization to an individual, or from one 
individual to another individual, if the individual to whom the improper 
conduct is imputed either participated in, had knowledge of, or reason 
to know of the improper conduct.
    (c) Conduct imputed from one organization to another organization. 
We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of one 
organization to another organization when the improper conduct occurred 
in connection with a partnership, joint venture, joint application, 
association or similar arrangement, or when the organization to whom the 
improper conduct is imputed has the power to direct, manage, control or 
influence the activities of the organization responsible for the 
improper conduct. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is 
evidence of knowledge, approval or acquiescence.


<R05>
Sec. 19.635  May the Department of the Treasury settle a debarment or 
suspension action?

    Yes, we may settle a debarment or suspension action at any time if 
it is in the best interest of the Federal Government.


<R05>
Sec. 19.640  May a settlement include a voluntary exclusion?

    Yes, if we enter into a settlement with you in which you agree to be 
excluded, it is called a voluntary exclusion and has governmentwide 
effect.


<R05>
Sec. 19.645  Do other Federal agencies know if the Department of the 
Treasury agrees to a voluntary exclusion?

    (a) Yes, we enter information regarding a voluntary exclusion into 
the EPLS.
    (b) Also, any agency or person may contact us to find out the 
details of a voluntary exclusion.


<R04>
                          Subpart G_Suspension


<R05>
Sec. 19.700  When may the suspending official issue a suspension?

    Suspension is a serious action. Using the procedures of this subpart 
and subpart F of this part, the suspending official may impose 
suspension only when that official determines that--
    (a) There exists an indictment for, or other adequate evidence to 
suspect, an offense listed under Sec. 19.800(a), or
    (b) There exists adequate evidence to suspect any other cause for 
debarment listed under Sec. 19.800(b) through (d); and
    (c) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 19.705  What does the suspending official consider in issuing a 
suspension?

    (a) In determining the adequacy of the evidence to support the 
suspension, the suspending official considers how much information is 
available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not 
important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can 
reasonably be drawn as a result. During this assessment, the suspending 
official may examine the basic documents, including grants, cooperative 
agreements, loan authorizations, contracts, and other relevant 
documents.
    (b) An indictment, conviction, civil judgment, or other official 
findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that determine factual and/
or legal matters, constitutes adequate evidence for purposes of 
suspension actions.

[[Page 238]]

    (c) In deciding whether immediate action is needed to protect the 
public interest, the suspending official has wide discretion. For 
example, the suspending official may infer the necessity for immediate 
action to protect the public interest either from the nature of the 
circumstances giving rise to a cause for suspension or from potential 
business relationships or involvement with a program of the Federal 
Government.


<R05>
Sec. 19.710  When does a suspension take effect?

    A suspension is effective when the suspending official signs the 
decision to suspend.


<R05>
Sec. 19.715  What notice does the suspending official give me if I 
am suspended?

    After deciding to suspend you, the suspending official promptly 
sends you a Notice of Suspension advising you--
    (a) That you have been suspended;
    (b) That your suspension is based on--
    (1) An indictment;
    (2) A conviction;
    (3) Other adequate evidence that you have committed irregularities 
which seriously reflect on the propriety of further Federal Government 
dealings with you; or
    (4) Conduct of another person that has been imputed to you, or your 
affiliation with a suspended or debarred person;
    (c) Of any other irregularities in terms sufficient to put you on 
notice without disclosing the Federal Government's evidence;
    (d) Of the cause(s) upon which we relied under Sec. 19.700 for 
imposing suspension;
    (e) That your suspension is for a temporary period pending the 
completion of an investigation or resulting legal or debarment 
proceedings;
    (f) Of the applicable provisions of this subpart, Subpart F of this 
part, and any other Department of the Treasury procedures governing 
suspension decision making; and
    (g) Of the governmentwide effect of your suspension from procurement 
and nonprocurement programs and activities.


<R05>
Sec. 19.720  How may I contest a suspension?

    If you as a respondent wish to contest a suspension, you or your 
representative must provide the suspending official with information in 
opposition to the suspension. You may do this orally or in writing, but 
any information provided orally that you consider important must also be 
submitted in writing for the official record.


<R05>
Sec. 19.725  How much time do I have to contest a suspension?

    (a) As a respondent you or your representative must either send, or 
make rrangements to appear and present, the information and argument to 
the suspending official within 30 days after you receive the Notice of 
Suspension.
    (b) We consider the notice to be received by you--
    (1) When delivered, if we mail the notice to the last known street 
address, or five days after we send it if the letter is undeliverable;
    (2) When sent, if we send the notice by facsimile or five days after 
we send it if the facsimile is undeliverable; or
    (3) When delivered, if we send the notice by e-mail or five days 
after we send it if the e-mail is undeliverable.


<R05>
Sec. 19.730  What information must I provide to the suspending official 
if I contest a suspension?

    (a) In addition to any information and argument in opposition, as a 
respondent your submission to the suspending official must identify--
    (1) Specific facts that contradict the statements contained in the 
Notice of Suspension. A general denial is insufficient to raise a 
genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension;
    (2) All existing, proposed, or prior exclusions under regulations 
implementing E.O. 12549 and all similar actions taken by Federal, state, 
or local agencies, including administrative agreements that affect only 
those agencies;
    (3) All criminal and civil proceedings not included in the Notice of 
Suspension that grew out of facts relevant to the cause(s) stated in the 
notice; and
    (4) All of your affiliates.

[[Page 239]]

    (b) If you fail to disclose this information, or provide false 
information, the Department of the Treasury may seek further criminal, 
civil or administrative action against you, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 19.735  Under what conditions do I get an additional opportunity 
to challenge the facts on which the suspension is based?

    (a) You as a respondent will not have an additional opportunity to 
challenge the facts if the suspending official determines that--
    (1) Your suspension is based upon an indictment, conviction, civil 
judgment, or other finding by a Federal, State, or local body for which 
an opportunity to contest the facts was provided;
    (2) Your presentation in opposition contains only general denials to 
information contained in the Notice of Suspension;
    (3) The issues raised in your presentation in opposition to the 
suspension are not factual in nature, or are not material to the 
suspending official's initial decision to suspend, or the official's 
decision whether to continue the suspension; or
    (4) On the basis of advice from the Department of Justice, an office 
of the United States Attorney, a State attorney general's office, or a 
State or local prosecutor's office, that substantial interests of the 
government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the 
same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced by conducting fact-
finding.
    (b) You will have an opportunity to challenge the facts if the 
suspending official determines that--
    (1) The conditions in paragraph (a) of this section do not exist; 
and
    (2) Your presentation in opposition raises a genuine dispute over 
facts material to the suspension.
    (c) If you have an opportunity to challenge disputed material facts 
under this section, the suspending official or designee must conduct 
additional proceedings to resolve those facts.


<R05>
Sec. 19.740  Are suspension proceedings formal?

    (a) Suspension proceedings are conducted in a fair and informal 
manner. The suspending official may use flexible procedures to allow you 
to present matters in opposition. In so doing, the suspending official 
is not required to follow formal rules of evidence or procedure in 
creating an official record upon which the official will base a final 
suspension decision.
    (b) You as a respondent or your representative must submit any 
documentary evidence you want the suspending official to consider.


<R05>
Sec. 19.745  How is fact-finding conducted?

    (1) You may present witnesses and other evidence, and confront any 
witness presented; and

record.
    (b) A transcribed record of fact-finding proceedings must be made, 
unless you as a respondent and the Department of the Treasury agree to 
waive it in advance. If you want a copy of the transcribed record, you 
may purchase it.


<R05>
Sec. 19.750  What does the suspending official consider in deciding 
whether to continue or terminate my suspension?

    (a) The suspending official bases the decision on all information 
contained in the official record. The record includes--
    (1) All information in support of the suspending official's initial 
decision to suspend you;
    (2) Any further information and argument presented in support of, or 
opposition to, the suspension; and
    (3) Any transcribed record of fact-finding proceedings.
    (b) The suspending official may refer disputed material facts to 
another official for findings of fact. The suspending official may 
reject any resulting findings, in whole or in part, only after 
specifically determining them to be arbitrary, capricious, or clearly 
erroneous.

[[Page 240]]


<R05>
Sec. 19.755  When will I know whether the suspension is continued or 
terminated?

    The suspending official must make a written decision whether to 
continue, modify, or terminate your suspension within 45 days of closing 
the official record. The official record closes upon the suspending 
official's receipt of final submissions, information and findings of 
fact, if any. The suspending official may extend that period for good 
cause.


<R05>
Sec. 19.760  How long may my suspension last?

    (a) If legal or debarment proceedings are initiated at the time of, 
or during your suspension, the suspension may continue until the 
conclusion of those proceedings. However, if proceedings are not 
initiated, a suspension may not exceed 12 months.

paragraph (a) of this section for an additional 6 months if an office of 
a U.S. Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Attorney, or other responsible 
prosecuting official requests an extension in writing. In no event may a 
suspension exceed 18 months without initiating proceedings under 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) The suspending official must notify the appropriate officials 
under paragraph (b) of this section of an impending termination of a 
suspension at least 30 days before the 12 month period expires to allow 
the officials an opportunity to request an extension.

your debarment period. The debarring official may consider other factors 
if appropriate in light of the circumstances of a particular case. The 
existence or nonexistence of any factor, such as one of those set forth 
in this section, is not necessarily determinative of your present 
responsibility. In making a debarment decision, the debarring official 
may consider the following factors:
    (a) The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may 
result from the wrongdoing.
    (b) The frequency of incidents and/or duration of the wrongdoing.
    (c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. For 
example, if you have been found by another Federal agency or a State 
agency to have engaged in wrongdoing similar to that found in the 
debarment action, the existence of this fact may be used by the 
debarring official in determining that you have a pattern or prior 
history of wrongdoing.
    (d) Whether you are or have been excluded or disqualified by an 
agency of the Federal Government or have not been allowed to participate 
in State or local contracts or assistance agreements on a basis of 
conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in 
this part.
    (e) Whether you have entered into an administrative agreement with a 
Federal agency or a State or local government that is not governmentwide 
but is based on conduct similar to one or more of the causes for 
debarment specified in this part.
    (f) Whether and to what extent you planned, initiated, or carried 
out the wrongdoing.
    (g) Whether you have accepted responsibility for the wrongdoing and 
recognize the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for 
debarment.
    (h) Whether you have paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil and 
administrative liabilities for the improper activity, including any 
investigative or administrative costs incurred by the government, and 
have made or agreed to make full restitution.
    (i) Whether you have cooperated fully with the government agencies 
during the investigation and any court or administrative action. In 
determining the extent of cooperation, the debarring official may 
consider when the cooperation began and whether you disclosed all 
pertinent information known to you.
    (j) Whether the wrongdoing was pervasive within your organization.
    (k) The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the 
wrongdoing.
    (l) Whether your organization took appropriate corrective action or 
remedial measures, such as establishing ethics training and implementing 
programs to prevent recurrence.
    (m) Whether your principals tolerated the offense.
    (n) Whether you brought the activity cited as a basis for the 
debarment to the attention of the appropriate government agency in a 
timely manner.
    (o) Whether you have fully investigated the circumstances 
surrounding the cause for debarment and, if so, made the result of the 
investigation available to the debarring official.
    (p) Whether you had effective standards of conduct and internal 
control systems in place at the time the questioned conduct occurred.
    (q) Whether you have taken appropriate disciplinary action against 
the individuals responsible for the activity which constitutes the cause 
for debarment.
    (r) Whether you have had adequate time to eliminate the 
circumstances within your organization that led to the cause for the 
debarment.
    (s) Other factors that are appropriate to the circumstances of a 
particular case.


<R05>
Sec. 19.865  How long may my debarment last?

    (a) If the debarring official decides to debar you, your period of 
debarment will be based on the seriousness of the cause(s) upon which 
your debarment is based. Generally, debarment should not exceed three 
years. However, if circumstances warrant, the debarring official may 
impose a longer period of debarment.
    (b) In determining the period of debarment, the debarring official 
may consider the factors in Sec. 19.860. If a suspension has preceded 
your debarment,

[[Page 244]]

the debarring official must consider the time you were suspended.
    (c) If the debarment is for a violation of the provisions of the 
Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, your period of debarment may not exceed 
five years.


<R05>
Sec. 19.870  When do I know if the debarring official debars me?

    (a) The debarring official must make a written decision whether to 
debar within 45 days of closing the official record. The official record 
closes upon the debarring official's receipt of final submissions, 
information and findings of fact, if any. The debarring official may 
extend that period for good cause.
    (b) The debarring official sends you written notice, pursuant to 
Sec. 19.615 that the official decided, either--
    (1) Not to debar you; or
    (2) To debar you. In this event, the notice:
    (i) Refers to the Notice of Proposed Debarment;
    (ii) Specifies the reasons for your debarment;
    (iii) States the period of your debarment, including the effective 
dates; and

transactions and contracts that are subject to the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (48 CFR chapter 1), throughout the executive branch of the 
Federal Government unless an agency head or an authorized designee 
grants an exception.


<R05>
Sec. 19.875  May I ask the debarring official to reconsider a decision 
to debar me?

    Yes, as a debarred person you may ask the debarring official to 
reconsider the debarment decision or to reduce the time period or scope 
of the debarment. However, you must put your request in writing and 
support it with documentation.


<R05>
Sec. 19.880  What factors may influence the debarring official during 
reconsideration?

    The debarring official may reduce or terminate your debarment based 
on--
    (a) Newly discovered material evidence;
    (b) A reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which your 
debarment was based;
    (c) A bona fide change in ownership or management;
    (d) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; 
or
    (e) Other reasons the debarring official finds appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 19.885  May the debarring official extend a debarment?

    (a) Yes, the debarring official may extend a debarment for an 
additional period, if that official determines that an extension is 
necessary to protect the public interest.
    (b) However, the debarring official may not extend a debarment 
solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon which the 
initial debarment action was based.
    (c) If the debarring official decides that a debarment for an 
additional period is necessary, the debarring official must follow the 
applicable procedures in this subpart, and subpart F of this part, to 
extend the debarment.

                     Subpart A_Purpose and Coverage


<R05>
Sec. 20.100  What does this part do?

    This part carries out the portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 
1988 (41 U.S.C. 701 et seq., as amended) that applies to grants. It also 
applies the provisions of the Act to cooperative agreements and other 
financial assistance awards, as a matter of Federal Government policy.


<R05>
Sec. 20.105  Does this part apply to me?

    (a) Portions of this part apply to you if you are either--
    (1) A recipient of an assistance award from the Department of the 
Treasury; or
    (2) A(n) Department of the Treasury awarding official. (See 
definitions of award and recipient in Sec. Sec. 20.605 and 20.660, 
respectively.)
    (b) The following table shows the subparts that apply to you:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
            If you are . . .                    see subparts . . .

<R05>
Sec. 20.110  Are any of my Federal assistance awards exempt from this 
part?

    This part does not apply to any award that the Secretary of the 
Treasury determines that the application of this part would be 
inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States or 
the laws or regulations of a foreign government.


<R05>
Sec. 20.115  Does this part affect the Federal contracts that I receive?

    It will affect future contract awards indirectly if you are debarred 
or suspended for a violation of the requirements of this part, as 
described in Sec. 20. 510(c). However, this part does not apply 
directly to procurement contracts. The portion of the Drug-Free 
Workplace Act of 1988 that applies to Federal procurement contracts is

Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (the drug-free workplace 
coverage currently is in 48 CFR part 23, subpart 23.5).

<R05>
Sec. 20.200  What must I do to comply with this part?

    There are two general requirements if you are a recipient other than 
an individual.
    (a) First, you must make a good faith effort, on a continuing basis, 
to maintain a drug-free workplace. You must agree to do so as a 
condition for receiving any award covered by this part. The specific 
measures that you must take in this regard are described in more detail 
in subsequent sections of this subpart. Briefly, those measures are to--
    (1) Publish a drug-free workplace statement and establish a drug-

drug statutes in the workplace (see Sec. 20.225).
    (b) Second, you must identify all known workplaces under your 
Federal awards (see Sec. 20.230).


<R05>
Sec. 20.205  What must I include in my drug-free workplace statement?

    (a) Tells your employees that the unlawful manufacture, 
distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance 
is prohibited in your workplace;

any award, he or she:
    (1) Will abide by the terms of the statement; and
    (2) Must notify you in writing if he or she is convicted for a 
violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace and must 
do so no more than five calendar days after the conviction.

Sec. 20.210  To whom must I distribute my drug-free workplace statement?

    You must require that a copy of the statement described in Sec.

employees about--
    (a) The dangers of drug abuse in the workplace;
    (b) Your policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace;
    (c) Any available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee 
assistance programs; and
    (d) The penalties that you may impose upon them for drug abuse 
violations occurring in the workplace.


<R05>

    If you are a new recipient that does not already have a policy 
statement as described in Sec. 20.205 and an ongoing awareness program 
as described in Sec. 20.215, you must publish the statement and 
establish the program by the time given in the following table:

                                          official.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 20.225  What actions must I take concerning employees who are 
convicted of drug violations in the workplace?

    There are two actions you must take if an employee is convicted of a 
drug violation in the workplace:
    (a) First, you must notify Federal agencies if an employee who is 
engaged in the performance of an award informs you about a conviction,

conviction. Your notification to the Federal agencies must--
    (1) Be in writing;
    (2) Include the employee's position title;
    (3) Include the identification number(s) of each affected award;
    (4) Be sent within ten calendar days after you learn of the 
conviction; and
    (5) Be sent to every Federal agency on whose award the convicted 
employee was working. It must be sent to every awarding official or his 
or her official designee, unless the Federal agency has specified a 
central point for the receipt of the notices.
    (b) Second, within 30 calendar days of learning about an employee's 
conviction, you must either--
    (1) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to 
and including termination, consistent with the requirements of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), as amended; or

<R04>
                  Subpart B_Activities by Own Employees


<R05>
Sec. 21.200  Agency and legislative liaison.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in Sec. 
21.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable 
compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if 
the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not 
directly related to a covered Federal action.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any 
information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable 
at any time.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following 
agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only 
where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered 
Federal action:

[[Page 257]]

    (1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) 
the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, 
conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,
    (2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the 
application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an 
agency's use.
    (d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following 
agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where 
they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:
    (1) Providing any information not specifically requested but 
necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of 
a covered Federal action;
    (2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an 
unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,
    (3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an 
agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended 
by Pub. L. 95-507 and other subsequent amendments.
    (e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are 
allowable under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 21.205  Professional and technical services.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in Sec. 
21.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable 
compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or 
an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a 
Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is 
for professional or technical services rendered directly in the 
preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or 
application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative 
agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a 
condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or 
cooperative agreement.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, ``professional 
and technical services'' shall be limited to advice and analysis 
directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, 
drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer 
is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the 
performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered 
directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, 
communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such 
as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed 
accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide 
advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical 
expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and 
solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered 
Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to 
influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis 
directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's 
proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not 
allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing 
professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent 
to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior 
to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable 
under this section since the engineer is providing technical services 
but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a 
covered Federal action.
    (c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for 
receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or 
regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation,

Sec. 21.210  Reporting.

    No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable 
compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a 
person.


<R04>
            Subpart C_Activities by Other Than Own Employees


<R05>
Sec. 21.300  Professional and technical services.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in Sec. 
21.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a 
person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional 
or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, 
or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal 
contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting 
requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving 
that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.
    (b) The reporting requirements in Sec. 21.110 (a) and (b) regarding 
filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply 
with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in 
the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing 
for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, ``professional 
and technical services'' shall be limited to advice and analysis 
directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, 
drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer 
is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the 
performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered 
directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, 
communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such 
as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed 
accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide 
advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical 
expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and 
solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered 
Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to 
influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis 
directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's 
proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not 
allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing 
professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent 
to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior 
to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable 
under this section since the engineer is providing technical services 
but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a 
covered Federal action.
    (d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for 
receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or 
regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, 
and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
    (e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting 
or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade 
associations.
    (f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are 
allowable under this section.


<R04>
                   Subpart D_Penalties and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 21.400  Penalties.

    (a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be 
subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than 
$100,000 for each such expenditure.
    (b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see 
Appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject 
to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 
for each such failure.
    (c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an 
administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced 
does not prevent

[[Page 259]]

the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that 
date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure 
when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an 
investigation of an allegation of such failure.
    (d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount 
of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency 
shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the 
violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in 
business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability 
of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such 
other matters as may be appropriate.
    (e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section 
shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating 
circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be 
subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as 
determined by the agency head or his or her designee.
    (f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not 
prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply 
to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil 
penalty.


<R05>
Sec. 21.405  Penalty procedures.

    Agencies shall impose and collect civil penalties pursuant to the 
provisions of the Program Fraud and Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. 
sections 3803 (except subsection (c)), 3804, 3805, 3806, 3807, 3808, and 
3812, insofar as these provisions are not inconsistent with the 
requirements herein.


<R05>
Sec. 21.410  Enforcement.

    The head of each agency shall take such actions as are necessary to 
ensure that the provisions herein are vigorously implemented and 
enforced in that agency.


<R04>
                          Subpart E_Exemptions


<R05>
Sec. 21.500  Secretary of Defense.

    (a) The Secretary of Defense may exempt, on a case-by-case basis, a 
covered Federal action from the prohibition whenever the Secretary 
determines, in writing, that such an exemption is in the national 
interest. The Secretary shall transmit a copy of each such written 
exemption to Congress immediately after making such a determination.
    (b) The Department of Defense may issue supplemental regulations to 
implement paragraph (a) of this section.

Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of 
Representatives, and the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and 
the House of Representatives in accordance with procedures agreed to by 
such committees. Such information shall not be available for public 
inspection.
    (d) Information that is classified under Executive Order 12356 or 
any successor order shall be reported only to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the 
House of Representatives or the Committees on Armed Services of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives (whichever such committees have 
jurisdiction of matters involving such information) and to the 
Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of 
Representatives in accordance with procedures agreed to by such 
committees. Such information shall not be available for public

Sec. 21.605  Inspector General report.

    (a) The Inspector General, or other official as specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section, of each agency shall prepare and submit

include any recommended changes that may be necessary to strengthen or 
improve the requirements.
    (b) In the case of an agency that does not have an Inspector 
General, the agency official comparable to an Inspector General shall 
prepare and submit the annual report, or, if there is no such comparable 
official, the head of the agency shall prepare and submit the annual 
report.
    (c) The annual report shall be submitted at the same time the agency

Borrower has selected to prepay with the proceeds of the Private Loan.
    (b) Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, an Eligible Private 
Lender that proposes to make a Private Loan, the proceeds of which will 
be used to prepay Eligible FMS Loans or Eligible FMS Advances, as the

principal that is scheduled to be paid in such year on account of the 
respective Eligible FMS Loans or Eligible FMS Advances; or
    (2) Consolidate the differing payment structures and maturities of 
the Eligible FMS Loans or the Eligible FMS Advances, as the case may be, 
into a single payment structure and maturity complying with the 
following criteria:
    (i) The final maturity date of the Private Loan shall be the

    (ii) The initial principal payment date of the Private Loan shall

Sec. 25.401  Fees.

    The interest rate on the Private Loan may include compensation for

    Each Private Loan Note, with the Guaranty attached, shall be fully 
and freely transferable to any Permitted Guaranty Holder.


<R05>
Sec. 25.403  Registration.

    The Guaranty shall cease to be effective with respect to the Private 
Loan or any Private Loan Portion or any Derivative to the extent that 
the Private Loan or the respective Private Loan Portion or the 
respective Derivative, as the case may be, is used to provide 
significant support for a Non-Registered Obligation.


<R05>
Sec. 25.404  Non-separability.

    (a) The Guaranty shall cease to be effective with respect to any 
Guaranteed Loan Amount or any Guaranteed Loan Portion Amount or any 
Guaranteed-Amount Equivalent to the extent that:
    (1) The Guaranteed Amount or the respective Guaranteed Loan Portion 
Amount or the respective Guaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may 
be, is separated at any time from the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the 
respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective 
Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, in any way, directly 
or through the issuance of any Guaranteed-Amount Equity Derivative or 
any Guaranteed-Amount Debt Derivative; or
    (2) Any holder of the Private Loan Note or any Private Loan Portion 
Note or any Derivative, as the case may be, having a claim to payments 
on the Private Loan receives more than 90 percent of any payment due to 
such holder from payments made under the Guaranty at any time during the 
term of the Private Loan.
    (b) Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if any Guaranteed-
Amount Debt Derivative is issued, the Guaranty shall not cease to be 
effective with respect to any Guaranteed Loan Amount or any Guaranteed 
Loan Portion Amount or any Guaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may 
be, if both of the circumstances described in paragraphs (b)(1) and 
(b)(2) of this section.
    (1) A Borrower shall have delivered to the Secretary of the treasury 
evidence, in form and substance satisfactory to the Secretary of the 
Treasury, that the Interest Rate Difference will be substantial.
    (i) To be considered, the evidence must meet the following 
requirements:
    (A) The Borrower must show that the Interest Rate Difference is 
directly attributable to paragraph (a) of this section being applied to 
the Private Loan, that is, that the Interest Rate Difference will exist 
even when all other financing terms of the Private Loan, including any 
collateralization of the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective 
Unguaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount 
Equivalent, as the case may be, are identical;
    (B) When calculating the Interest Rate Difference, the Borrower must 
assume that the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed 
Loan Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as 
the case may be, will be collateralized by securities backed by the full 
faith and credit of the United States, unless the Borrower is legally 
prohibited from so collateralizing the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the 
respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective 
Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, or the Borrower has 
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury that 
the Borrower is unable to so collateralize the Unguaranteed Loan Amount 
or the respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective 
Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent;
    (C) If the Borrower is legally prohibited from collateralizing the 
Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Loan Guaranteed Portion

[[Page 273]]

Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may 
be, with securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United 
States or has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the 
Treasury that the Borrower is unable to so collateralize the 
Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion 
Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may 
be, then the Borrower may calculate the Interest Rate Difference using 
whatever collateralization assumptions the Borrower elects;
    (D) If the Borrower delivers evidence to the Secretary of the 
Treasury respecting the Interest Rate Difference, which evidence assumes 
either that the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed 
Loan Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as 
the case may be, will not be collateralized at all or that the 
Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion 
Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may 
be, will be collateralized, but not by securities backed by the full 
faith and credit of the United States, then the Borrower must also 
deliver to the Secretary of the Treasury the written agreement of the 
Borrower, which agreement shall be in form and substance satisfactory to 
the Secretary of the Treasury, that the Borrower will not collateralize 
the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion 
Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may 
be, at any time during the term of the Private Loan in any way different 
from the assumptions used in calculating the Interest Rate Difference; 
and
    (E) The Borrower must deliver to the Secretary of the Treasury the 
evidence pertaining to the Interest Rate Difference at the time that the 
Borrower submits to DSAA its plan for prepayment, if any, if no plan of 
prepayment is submitted, then no later than 10 days prior to the time 
that the Borrower submits to DSAA its prepayment application.
    (ii) If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the evidence 
submitted by the Borrower pertaining to the Interest Rate Difference is 
satisfactory in form and in substance, and that the Interest Rate 
Difference is substantial, a modified version of the Guaranty (deleting 
therefrom the provision that the Guaranty shall cease to be effective if 
any Guaranteed-Amount Debt Derivative is issued) will be attached to the 
Private Loan Note or the Private Loan Portion Notes, as the case may be.
    (2) The Secretary of the Treasury shall have determined, in the sole 
discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, that the respective 
Borrower's loan prepayment at par pursuant to subsection (a) of the Act 
through the issuance of any Guaranteed-Amount Debt Derivative is 
necessary to achieve the international economic policy interests of the 
United States.


<R05>
Sec. 25.405  Form of guaranty.

    (a) The Guaranty that will be attached to the Private Loan Note on 
the Closing Date shall be in the following form (except that the 
bracketed words shall be deleted if the conditions specified in Sec. 
25.404(b) shall have occurred):

    For Value Received, the Defense Security Assistance Agency of the 
Department of Defense (``DSAA''), hereby guarantees to (Name of Lender) 
(``Lender''), incorporated under the laws of (U.S. State or other U.S. 
jurisdiction) or if not so incorporated or organized, then the principal 
place of doing business is (U.S. location, address, and zip code), under 
the authority of Section 24 of the Arms Export Control Act, as amended 
(``Act''), the due and punctual payment of ninety percent (90%) of 
amounts due: (1) on the promissory note (``Note'') in the principal 
amount of up to $------ dated ------ issued to the Lender by the 
Government of (Name of Borrower) (``Borrower'') pursuant to the Loan 
Agreement between the Lender and the Borrower dated the ----th day of --
---- (``Agreement''); and (2) the Lender from the Borrower pursuant to 
the Agreement.
    This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment covering all political and 
credit risks of nonpayment, including any nonpayment arising out of any 
claim which the Borrower may now or hereafter have against any person, 
corporation, or other entity (including without limitation, the United 
States, the Lender, and any supplier of defense items) in connection 
with any transaction, for any reason whatsoever. This Guaranty shall 
inure to the

[[Page 274]]

benefit of and shall be enforceable by the Lender and any Permitted 
Guaranty Holder (as hereinafter defined). This Guaranty shall not be 
impaired by any law, regulation or decree of the Borrower now or 
hereafter in effect which might in any manner change any of the terms of 
the Note or Agreement. The obligation of DSAA hereunder shall be binding 
irrespective of the irregularity, invalidity or unenforceability under 
any laws, regulations or decrees of the Borrower of the Note, the 
Agreement or other instruments related thereto.
    DSAA hereby waives diligence, demand, protest, presentment and any 
requirement that the Lender exhaust any right or power to take any 
action against the Borrower and any notice of any kind whatsoever other 
than the demand for payment required to be given to DSAA hereunder in 
the event of default on a payment due under the Note.
    In the event of failure of the Borrower to make payment, when and as 
due, of any installment of principal or interest under the Note, the 
DSAA shall make payment immediately to the Lender upon demand to the 
DSAA after the Borrower's failure to pay has continued for 10 calendar 
days. The amount payable under this Guaranty shall be ninety percent 
(90%) of the amount of the overdue installment of principal and 
interest, plus ninety percent (90%) of any and all late charges and 
interest thereon as provided in the Agreement. Upon payment by DSAA to 
the Lender, the Lender will assign to DSAA, without recourse or 
warranty, ninety percent (90%) of all of its rights in the Note and the 
Agreement with respect to such payment.
    In the event of a default under the Agreement or the Note by the 
Borrower and so long as this Guaranty is in effect and the DSAA is not 
in default hereunder:
    (i) The Lender or other Permitted Guaranty Holder shall not 
accelerate or reschedule payment of the principal or interest on the 
Note or any other note of the Borrower guaranteed by DSAA except with 
the written approval of DSAA; and
    (ii) The Lender or other Permitted Guaranty Holder shall, if so 
directed by DSAA, invoke the default provisions of the Agreement.
    Subject to the limitations set forth below, the Lender's rights 
under this Guaranty may be assigned to any ``Permitted Guaranty 
Holder,'' that is: (1) An individual domiciled in the United States; (2) 
a corporation incorporated, chartered or otherwise organized in the 
United States; or (3) a partnership or other juridical entity doing 
business in the United States. In the event of such assignment DSAA 
shall be promptly notified. The Lender will not agree to any material 
amendment of the Agreement or Note or consent to any material deviation 
from the provisions thereof without the prior written consent of DSAA.
    Permitted Guaranty Holders shall be severally bound by, and shall be 
severally entitled to, the rights and obligations of the Lender under 
the Note, the Agreement, and this Guaranty. The Lender shall maintain a 
current, accurate written record of the names, addresses, amount of 
financial interest in the Note and Agreement, and date of acquisition of 
such interest of each Permitted Guaranty Holder and shall furnish DSAA a 
copy of such record on its demand without charge. No assignment by the 
Lender or by any Permitted Guaranty Holder shall be effective for 
purposes of this Guaranty unless and until so recorded by the Lender.
    The total amount of this Guaranty shall not at any time exceed 
ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding principal, unpaid accrued 
interest and arrearages, if any, under the Agreement and the Note, 
including any portion of the Note, or any derivative of the Note or any 
portion of the Note.
    This Guaranty shall cease to be effective with respect to the 
guaranteed amount of the total amount of the Note (the ``Guaranteed Loan 
Amount'') or with respect to the guaranteed amount of any portion of the 
Note (the ``Guaranteed Loan Portion Amount'') [or with respect to the 
amount of any derivative or derivatives of the Note or any portion of 
the Note equal, or in the aggregate equal, in principal amount to the 
total amount of the Note or such portion of the Note, as the case may 
be, which amount of such derivative or derivatives is equal to the 
respective Guaranteed Loan Amount or Guaranteed Loan Portion Amount, as 
the case may be (the ``Guaranteed-Amount Equivalent'')] to the extent 
that (1) the Guaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Guaranteed Loan 
Portion Amount [or the respective Guaranteed-Amount Equivalent], as the 
case may be, is at any time separated from the unguaranteed amount of 
the total amount of the Note or the unguaranteed amount of the 
respective portion of the Note [or the amount of such derivative or 
derivatives of the Note which is not the amount which is equal to the 
Guaranteed Loan Amount or Guaranteed Loan Portion Amount, as the case 
may be], in any way, (a) directly, or (b) through the issuance of 
participation shares of, or undivided ownership or other equity 
interests in, the Note, or any portion of the Note, or any derivative of 
the Note or any portion of the Note, which have an exclusive or 
preferred claim to the Guaranteed Loan Amount or the respective 
Guaranteed Loan Portion Amount [or the respective Guaranteed-Amount 
Equivalent], as the case may be [or (c) through the issuance of

[[Page 275]]

notes, bonds or other debt instruments or obligations which are 
collateralized or otherwise secured by a pledge of, or security interest 
in, the Note, or any portion of the Note or any derivative of the Note 
or any portion of the Note, which has an exclusive or preferred claim to 
the Guaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Guaranteed Loan Portion 
Amount or the respective Guaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may 
be]; or (2) any holder of the Note, or any portion of the Note, or any 
derivative of the Note or any portion of the Note, as the case may be, 
having claim to payment made on the Note, receives more than ninety 
percent of any payment due to such holder from payments made under this 
Guaranty at any time during the term of the Note or the Agreement.
    This Guaranty is fully and freely transferable to any Permitted 
Guaranty Holder, except that it shall cease to be effective with respect 
to the Agreement or the Note, or any portion of the Note, or any 
derivative of the Note or any portion of the Note, to the extent that 
the Agreement or the Note, or the respective portion of the Note, or the 
respective derivative of the Note or any portion of the Note, as the 
case may be, is used to provide significant support for any non-
registered obligation.
    The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the 
performance of this Guaranty. No claim which the United States may now 
or hereafter have against the Lender or any Permitted Guaranty Holder 
for any reason whatsoever shall affect in any way the right of the 
Lender or any Permitted Guaranty Holder to receive full and prompt 
payment of any amount otherwise due under this Guaranty. The United 
States represents and warrants that (a) it has full power, authority and 
legal right to execute, deliver and perform this Guaranty, (b) this 
Guaranty has been executed in accordance with and pursuant to the terms 
and provisions of section 24 of the Act, the provisions of the Foreign 
Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act,

title 31, part 25, of the Code of Federal Regulations, (c) this Guaranty 
has been duly executed and delivered by a duly authorized representative 
of DSAA, and (d) this Guaranty constitutes the valid and legally binding 
obligations of the United States, enforceable in accordance with the 
terms hereof.
    Any notice, demand, or other communication hereunder shall be deemed 
to have been given if in writing and actually delivered to the 
Comptroller, DSAA, the Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-2800, or the 
successor, or such other place as may be designated in writing by the 
Comptroller, DSAA or the successor thereof.
    By acceptance of the Note, the Lender agrees to the terms and 
conditions of this Guaranty.

Dated:__________________________________________________________________

    Director, DSAA.

    (b) The obligations of DSAA under the Guaranty are expressly limited 
to those obligations contained in the form of Guaranty set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section. Any provisions of any agreement relating 
to the Private Loan purporting to create obligations on the part of DSAA 
which are inconsistent with the terms of the Guaranty or any other 
provision of this part be unenforceable against DSAA.

<R05>
Sec. 26.4  Comments on MDB projects.

    (a) Public comments--(1) Written comments (i) A member of the public 
wishing to provide written comments on a MDB project must provide 2 
copies of the comments to the Office of Multilateral Development Banks, 
U.S. Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., room 
5400, Washington, DC 20220. Written comments should be submitted not 
later than two weeks after the member of the public has access to the 
particular document on which it wishes to offer comments--either the 
project listing, the EIA Summary, or the EIA for a particular project. 
Written public comments will be provided by the MDB Office to the U.S. 
Government agencies participating in meetings of the Working Group for 
Multilateral Assistance (WGMA), which meetings are described in Sec. 
26.4(c). The WGMA is an intergovernmental subcommittee of the 
Development Coordination Committee whose functions are set forth in the 
Presidential announcement of May 19, 1978, Vol. 14, No. 20, p. 932 of 
the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents. The WGMA meets to 
discuss the U.S. position on upcoming MDB projects.
    (ii) All written comments will be available for inspection and 
copying in their entirety in the Department of the Treasury Library, 
1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC ((202) 622-0990). Members 
of the public are advised that they must make an appointment with the 
Treasury Library before they visit, and that a charge (currently 15 
cents per page) is imposed for the use of the library photocopier.
    (2) Oral comments. Oral comments from a member of the public may be 
made in periodic meetings convened by the BIC. Information concerning 
these meetings may be obtained by contacting the BIC or the MDB Office. 
The MDB Office will summarize and present such comments in the WGMA 
meetings described in Sec. 26.4(c).
    (b) U.S. agency comments. Comments from U.S. agencies shall be 
provided through the WGMA.
    (c) Consideration of comments. The WGMA will consider all comments 
made by the public and U.S. agencies. The WGMA may review a project up 
to three times. The first review will consider whether the project has 
been assigned the appropriate environmental category by the MDB. This 
review will take place as far in advance as possible of Board 
consideration of the project. The second review will consider the EIA 
Summary or the EIA (or information discussed in Sec. 26.5(b)(1)), and 
comments received from the public on such documentation. The third WGMA 
review, which will take place shortly before Board consideration of the 
project, will consider the position of the U.S. Government on the 
project.


<R05>
Sec. 26.5  Upgrades and additional environmental information.

    (a) Environmental category upgrades. If the WGMA and the Department 
of the Treasury determine that a project would have a significant impact 
on the human environment, but that the level of environmental analysis 
planned by the MDB is insufficient, the Department of the Treasury will 
instruct the United States Executive Director of the concerned MDB to 
request that the MDB upgrade the project to an environmental category 
requiring additional environmental analysis. Members of the public may 
call the MDB Office to inquire about upgrade requests for specific 
projects.
    (b) Additional environmental information. (1) If the WGMA and the 
Department of the Treasury determine on the basis of the first WGMA 
review that:
    (i) A MDB project would have a significant impact on the human 
environment, and
    (ii) The MDB appears to have made an appropriate decision that such 
project merits environmental analysis, but less than a full-fledged 
environmental impact assessment as defined by that MDB's own procedures, 
the Department of the Treasury will obtain, through the United States 
Executive Director of the concerned MDB, such environmental information 
from the MDB (e.g., environmental chapters from project feasibility 
studies or environmental data sheets) which contains this environmental 
analysis. The MDB Office will provide this environmental information to 
the entities described in Sec. 26.2(a).

[[Page 278]]

    (2) If such environmental information is insufficient to provide an 
adequate basis for analyzing the environmental impact of the proposed 
project and alternatives to the proposed project, the Department of the 
Treasury will instruct the United States Executive Director of the 
concerned MDB not to vote in favor of the project.

Sunday or Federal holiday, the response will be due on the next weekday 
after that date.
    (ii) If a response is transmitted by United States mail, it will be 
deemed timely filed if postmarked on or before the due date.
    (4) The assessing official may extend the period for making a 
written response under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) for good cause 
shown. Generally, failure to obtain representation in a timely manner

    (c) Filing. A written response will be considered filed on the date 
received at the address specified in the Initial Notice of Assessment. 
The response may be sent by personal delivery, United States mail or 
commercial delivery. At the discretion of the assessing official, filing

by the person to so comply will make the civil monetary penalty payable 
on demand;
    (E) If a civil monetary penalty is not paid within 30 days of the 
date of the Final Notice of Assessment (or on demand under paragraph 
(C)(3)(ii)(D) of this sectiion), or if a civil or equitable remedy is

Sec. 28.110  Remedial and affirmative action and self-evaluation.

    (a) Remedial action. If the designated agency official finds that a 
recipient has discriminated against persons on the basis of sex in an 
education program or activity, such recipient shall take such remedial 
action as the designated agency official deems necessary to overcome the 
effects of such discrimination.
    (b) Affirmative action. In the absence of a finding of 
discrimination on the basis of sex in an education program or activity, 
a recipient may take affirmative action consistent with law to overcome 
the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation therein 
by persons of a particular sex. Nothing in these Title IX regulations

recipient may have under Executive Order 11246, 3 CFR, 1964-1965 Comp., 
p. 339; as amended by Executive Order 11375, 3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p.

regulations, its current policies and practices and the effects thereof 
concerning admission of students, treatment of students, and employment 
of both academic and non-academic personnel working in connection with 
the recipient's education program or activity;
    (2) Modify any of these policies and practices that do not or may 
not meet the requirements of these Title IX regulations; and
    (3) Take appropriate remedial steps to eliminate the effects of any 
discrimination that resulted or may have resulted from adherence to 
these policies and practices.
    (d) Availability of self-evaluation and related materials. 
Recipients shall maintain on file for at least three years following 
completion of the evaluation required under paragraph (c) of this 
section, and shall provide to the designated agency official upon 
request, a description of any modifications made pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section and of any remedial steps taken pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 28.115  Assurance required.

    (a) General. Either at the application stage or the award stage, 
Federal agencies must ensure that applications for Federal financial 
assistance or awards of Federal financial assistance contain, be 
accompanied by, or be covered by a specifically identified assurance 
from the applicant or recipient, satisfactory to the designated agency 
official, that each education program or activity operated by the 
applicant or recipient and to which these Title IX regulations apply 
will be operated in compliance with these Title IX regulations. An 
assurance of compliance with these Title IX regulations shall not be 
satisfactory to the designated agency official if the applicant or 
recipient to whom such assurance applies fails to commit itself to take 
whatever remedial action is

[[Page 286]]

necessary in accordance with Sec. 28.110(a) to eliminate existing 
discrimination on the basis of sex or to eliminate the effects of past 
discrimination whether occurring prior to or subsequent to the 
submission to the designated agency official of such assurance.
    (b) Duration of obligation. (1) In the case of Federal financial 
assistance extended to provide real property or structures thereon, such 
assurance shall obligate the recipient or, in the case of a subsequent 
transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property 
or structures are used to provide an education program or activity.
    (2) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide 
personal property, such assurance shall obligate the recipient for the 
period during which it retains ownership or possession of the property.
    (3) In all other cases such assurance shall obligate the recipient 
for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.
    (c) Form. (1) The assurances required by paragraph (a) of this 
section, which may be included as part of a document that addresses 
other assurances or obligations, shall include that the applicant or 
recipient will comply with all applicable Federal statutes relating to 
nondiscrimination. These include but are not limited to: Title IX of the 
Education Amendments of 1972, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1681-1683, 1685-
1688).
    (2) The designated agency official will specify the extent to which 
such assurances will be required of the applicant's or recipient's 
subgrantees, contractors, subcontractors, transferees, or successors in 
interest.


<R05>
Sec. 28.120  Transfers of property.

    If a recipient sells or otherwise transfers property financed in 
whole or in part with Federal financial assistance to a transferee that 
operates any education program or activity, and the Federal share of the 
fair market value of the property is not upon such sale or transfer 
properly accounted for to the Federal Government, both the transferor 
and the transferee shall be deemed to be recipients, subject to the 
provisions of Sec. Sec. 28.205 through 28.235(a).


<R05>
Sec. 28.125  Effect of other requirements.

    (a) Effect of other Federal provisions. The obligations imposed by 
these Title IX regulations are independent of, and do not alter, 
obligations not to discriminate on the basis of sex imposed by Executive 
Order 11246, 3 CFR, 1964-1965 Comp., p. 339; as amended by Executive 
Order 11375, 3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 684; as amended by Executive 
Order 11478, 3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 803; as amended by Executive 
Order 12087, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 230; as amended by Executive Order 
12107, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 264; sections 704 and 855 of the Public 
Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 295m, 298b-2); Title VII of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.); the Equal Pay Act of 1963 
(29 U.S.C. 206); and any other Act of Congress or Federal regulation.
    (b) Effect of State or local law or other requirements. The 
obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or 
alleviated by any State or local law or other requirement that would 
render any applicant or student ineligible, or limit the eligibility of 
any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, to practice any 
occupation or profession.
    (c) Effect of rules or regulations of private organizations. The 
obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or 
alleviated by any rule or regulation of any organization, club, athletic 
or other league, or association that would render any applicant or 
student ineligible to participate or limit the eligibility or 
participation of any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, in any 
education program or activity operated by a recipient and that receives 
Federal financial assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 28.130  Effect of employment opportunities.

    The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not 
obviated or alleviated because employment opportunities in any 
occupation or profession are or may be more limited for members of one 
sex than for members of the other sex.

[[Page 287]]


<R05>
Sec. 28.135  Designation of responsible employee and adoption of 
grievance procedures.

designate at least one employee to coordinate its efforts to comply with 
and carry out its responsibilities under these Title IX regulations, 
including any investigation of any complaint communicated to such 
recipient alleging its noncompliance with these Title IX regulations or 
alleging any actions that would be prohibited by these Title IX 
regulations. The recipient shall notify all its students and employees 
of the name, office address, and telephone number of the employee or 
employees appointed pursuant to this paragraph.
    (b) Complaint procedure of recipient. A recipient shall adopt and 
publish grievance procedures providing for prompt and equitable 
resolution of student and employee complaints alleging any action that 
would be prohibited by these Title IX regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 28.140  Dissemination of policy.

    (a) Notification of policy. (1) Each recipient shall implement 
specific and continuing steps to notify applicants for admission and 
employment, students and parents of elementary and secondary school 
students, employees, sources of referral of applicants for admission and 
employment, and all unions or professional organizations holding 
collective bargaining or professional agreements with the recipient, 
that it does not discriminate on the basis of sex in the educational 
programs or activities that it operates, and that it is required by 
Title IX and these Title IX regulations not to discriminate in such a 
manner. Such notification shall contain such information, and be made in 
such manner, as the designated agency official finds necessary to 
apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured 
them by Title IX and these Title IX regulations, but shall state at 
least that the requirement not to discriminate in education programs or 
activities extends to employment therein, and to admission thereto 
unless Sec. Sec. 28.300 through 28.310 do not apply to the recipient, 
and that inquiries concerning the application of Title IX and these 
Title IX regulations to such recipient may be referred to the employee 
designated pursuant to Sec. 28.135, or to the designated agency 
official.
    (2) Each recipient shall make the initial notification required by 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section within 90 days of September 29, 2000 or 
of the date these Title IX regulations first apply to such recipient, 
whichever comes later, which notification shall include publication in:
    (i) Newspapers and magazines operated by such recipient or by 
student, alumnae, or alumni groups for or in connection with such 
recipient; and
    (ii) Memoranda or other written communications distributed to every 
student and employee of such recipient.
    (b) Publications. (1) Each recipient shall prominently include a 
statement of the policy described in paragraph (a) of this section in 
each announcement, bulletin, catalog, or application form that it makes 
available to any person of a type, described in paragraph (a) of this 
section, or which is otherwise used in connection with the recruitment 
of students or employees.
    (2) A recipient shall not use or distribute a publication of the 
type described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that suggests, by 
text or illustration, that such recipient treats applicants, students, 
or employees differently on the basis of sex except as such treatment is 
permitted by these Title IX regulations.
    (c) Distribution. Each recipient shall distribute without 
discrimination on the basis of sex each publication described in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and shall apprise each of its 
admission and employment recruitment representatives of the policy of 
nondiscrimination described in paragraph (a) of this section, and shall 
require such representatives to adhere to such policy.

reasonably comparable activities shall be provided to students of the 
other sex;
    (4) Any scholarship or other financial assistance awarded by an 
institution of higher education to an individual because such individual 
has received such award in a single-sex pageant based upon a combination

talent. The pageant, however, must comply with other nondiscrimination 
provisions of Federal law.

[[Page 290]]

admission, or be subjected to discrimination in admission, by any 
recipient to which Sec. Sec. 28.300 through Sec. Sec.  28.310 apply, 
except as provided in Sec. Sec. 28.225 and Sec. Sec.  28.230.
    (b) Specific prohibitions. (1) In determining whether a person 
satisfies any policy or criterion for admission, or in making any offer 
of admission, a recipient to which Sec. Sec. 28.300 through 28.310 
apply shall not:

by ranking

[[Page 291]]

applicants separately on such basis, or otherwise;
    (ii) Apply numerical limitations upon the number or proportion of 
persons of either sex who may be admitted; or

basis of sex.
    (2) A recipient shall not administer or operate any test or other 
criterion for admission that has a disproportionately adverse effect on 
persons on the basis of sex unless the use of such test or criterion is 
shown to predict validly success in the education program or activity in 
question and alternative tests or criteria that do not have such a 
disproportionately adverse effect are shown to be unavailable.
    (c) Prohibitions relating to marital or parental status. In 
determining whether a person satisfies any policy or criterion for 
admission, or in making any offer of admission, a recipient to which 
Sec. Sec. 28.300 through 28.310 apply:
    (1) Shall not apply any rule concerning the actual or potential 
parental, family, or marital status of a student or applicant that 
treats persons differently on the basis of sex;

basis of pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or recovery 
therefrom, or establish or follow any rule or practice that so 
discriminates or excludes;

pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom 
in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary

    A recipient to which Sec. Sec. 28.300 through 28.310 apply shall 
not give preference to applicants for admission, on the basis of

Sec. Sec. 28.300 through 28.310 apply shall not recruit primarily or 
exclusively at educational institutions, schools, or entities that admit

such aid, benefit, or service;
    (2) Provide different aid, benefits, or services or provide aid, 
benefits, or services in a different manner;
    (3) Deny any person any such aid, benefit, or service;

trusts, or similar legal instruments, or by acts of foreign governments 
and restricted to members of one sex, that are designed to provide 
opportunities to study abroad, and that are awarded to students who are 
already matriculating at or who are graduates of the recipient 
institution; Provided, that a recipient educational institution that 
administers or assists in the administration of such scholarships, 
fellowships, or other awards that are restricted to members of one sex

program or activity operated by such recipient, including participation 
in educational consortia and cooperative employment and student-teaching 
assignments.
    (2) Such recipient:
    (i) Shall develop and implement a procedure designed to assure

activity takes no action affecting any applicant, student, or employee 
of such recipient that these Title IX regulations would prohibit such 
recipient from taking; and
    (ii) Shall not facilitate, require, permit, or consider such 
participation if such action occurs.


<R05>
Sec. 28.405  Housing.

    (a) Generally. A recipient shall not, on the basis of sex, apply

administer different policies or practices concerning occupancy by its 
students of housing other than that provided by such recipient.

housing, or otherwise, assists any agency, organization, or person in 
making housing available to any of its students, shall

[[Page 293]]

take such reasonable action as may be necessary to assure itself that 
such housing as is provided to students of one sex, when compared to 
that provided to students of the other sex, is as a whole:
    (A) Proportionate in quantity; and
    (B) Comparable in quality and cost to the student.
    (ii) A recipient may render such assistance to any agency, 
organization, or person that provides all or part of such housing to 
students of only one sex.


<R05>
Sec. 28.410  Comparable facilities.

    A recipient may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower 
facilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities provided for 
students of one sex shall be comparable to such facilities provided for 
students of the other sex.


<R05>
Sec. 28.415  Access to course offerings.

    (a) A recipient shall not provide any course or otherwise carry out 
any of its education program or activity separately on the basis of sex, 
or require or refuse participation therein by any of its students on 
such basis, including health, physical education, industrial, business, 
vocational, technical, home economics, music, and adult education 
courses.
    (b)(1) With respect to classes and activities in physical education 
at the elementary school level, the recipient shall comply fully with 
this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one 
year from September 29, 2000. With respect to physical education classes 
and activities at the secondary and post-secondary levels, the recipient

no event later than three years from September 29, 2000.
    (2) This section does not prohibit grouping of students in physical 
education classes and activities by ability as assessed by objective 
standards of individual performance developed and applied without regard 
to sex.
    (3) This section does not prohibit separation of students by sex 
within physical education classes or activities during participation in 
wrestling, boxing, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and other 
sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.

a physical education class has an adverse effect on members of one sex, 
the recipient shall use appropriate standards that do not have such 
effect.
    (5) Portions of classes in elementary and secondary schools, or 
portions of education programs or activities, that deal exclusively with 
human sexuality may be conducted in separate sessions for boys and

unless such recipient otherwise makes available to such person, pursuant 
to the same policies and criteria of admission, courses, services, and

or through such schools.


<R05>

    (a) Counseling. A recipient shall not discriminate against any 
person on the basis of sex in the counseling or guidance of students or 
applicants for admission.

testing or other materials for appraising or counseling students shall 
not use different materials for students on the basis of their sex or 
use materials that permit or require different treatment of students on 
such basis unless such different materials cover the same occupations 
and interest areas and the use of such different materials is shown to 
be essential to eliminate sex bias. Recipients shall develop and use 
internal procedures for ensuring that such materials do not discriminate 
on the basis

[[Page 294]]

of sex. Where the use of a counseling test or other instrument results 
in a substantially disproportionate number of members of one sex in any 
particular course of study or classification, the recipient shall take 
such action as is necessary to assure itself that such disproportion is 
not the result of discrimination in the instrument or its application.
    (c) Disproportion in classes. Where a recipient finds that a 
particular class contains a substantially disproportionate number of 
individuals of one sex, the recipient shall take such action as is

particular type or source, apply different criteria, or otherwise 
discriminate;
    (2) Through solicitation, listing, approval, provision of 
facilities, or other services, assist any foundation, trust, agency, 
organization, or person that provides assistance to any of such 
recipient's students in a manner that discriminates on the basis of sex; 
or
    (3) Apply any rule or assist in application of any rule concerning 
eligibility for such assistance that treats persons of one sex 
differently from persons of the other sex with regard to marital or 
parental status.
    (b) Financial aid established by certain legal instruments. (1) A 
recipient may administer or assist in the administration of 
scholarships, fellowships, or other forms of financial assistance 
established pursuant to domestic or foreign wills, trusts, bequests, or 
similar legal instruments or by acts of a foreign government that 
require that awards be made to members of a particular sex specified 
therein; Provided, that the overall effect of the award of such sex-
restricted scholarships, fellowships, and other forms of financial 
assistance does not discriminate on the basis of sex.
    (2) To ensure nondiscriminatory awards of assistance as required in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, recipients shall develop and use 
procedures under which:
    (i) Students are selected for award of financial assistance on the 
basis of nondiscriminatory criteria and not on the basis of availability 
of funds restricted to members of a particular sex;
    (ii) An appropriate sex-restricted scholarship, fellowship, or other 
form of financial assistance is allocated to each student selected under 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section; and
    (iii) No student is denied the award for which he or she was

absence of a scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial 
assistance designated for a member of that student's sex.
    (c) Athletic scholarships. (1) To the extent that a recipient awards 
athletic scholarships or grants-in-aid, it must provide reasonable 
opportunities for such awards for members of each sex in proportion to 
the number of students of each sex participating in interscholastic or 
intercollegiate athletics.
    (2) A recipient may provide separate athletic scholarships or 
grants-in-aid for members of each sex as part of separate athletic teams 
for members of each sex to the extent consistent with this paragraph (c)

without discrimination on the basis of sex; and
    (2) Shall not render such services to any agency, organization, or 
person that discriminates on the basis of sex in its employment 
practices.

any of its students shall not do so in a manner that violates Sec. Sec. 
28.500 through 28.550.

[[Page 295]]

Sec. 28.440  Health and insurance benefits and services.

    Subject to Sec. 28.235(d), in providing a medical, hospital, 
accident, or life insurance benefit, service, policy, or plan to any of 
its students, a recipient shall not discriminate on the basis of sex, or 
provide such benefit, service, policy, or plan in a manner that would 
violate Sec. Sec. 28.500 through 28.550 if it were provided to 
employees of the recipient. This section shall not prohibit a recipient 
from providing any benefit or service that may be used by a different 
proportion of students of one sex than of the other, including family 
planning services. However, any recipient that provides full coverage 
health service shall provide gynecological care.


<R05>
Sec. 28.445  Marital or parental status.

    (a) Status generally. A recipient shall not apply any rule 
concerning a student's actual or potential parental, family, or marital 
status that treats students differently on the basis of sex.
    (b) Pregnancy and related conditions. (1) A recipient shall not 
discriminate against any student, or exclude any student from its 
education program or activity, including any class or extracurricular 
activity, on the basis of such student's pregnancy, childbirth, false 
pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom, unless the 
student requests voluntarily to participate in a separate portion of the 
program or activity of the recipient.
    (2) A recipient may require such a student to obtain the 
certification of a physician that the student is physically and 
emotionally able to continue participation as long as such a 
certification is required of all students for other physical or 
emotional conditions requiring the attention of a physician.
    (3) A recipient that operates a portion of its education program or 
activity separately for pregnant students, admittance to which is 
completely voluntary on the part of the student as provided in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, shall ensure that the separate portion is 
comparable to that offered to non-pregnant students.
    (4) Subject to Sec. 28.235(d), a recipient shall treat pregnancy, 
childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery 
therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other 
temporary disability with respect to any medical or hospital benefit, 
service, plan, or policy that such recipient administers, operates, 
offers, or participates in with respect to students admitted to the 
recipient's educational program or activity.
    (5) In the case of a recipient that does not maintain a leave policy 
for its students, or in the case of a student who does not otherwise 
qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat 
pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and 
recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence for as long 
a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student's 
physician, at the conclusion of which the student shall be reinstated to 
the status that she held when the leave began.


<R05>
Sec. 28.450  Athletics.

    (a) General. No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from 
participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from 
another person, or otherwise be discriminated against in any 
interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics offered 
by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics 
separately on such basis.
    (b) Separate teams. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph 
(a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams 
for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon 
competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. However, 
where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for 
members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of 
the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have 
previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to 
try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact 
sport. For the purposes of these Title IX regulations, contact sports 
include boxing, wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and 
other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily 
contact.

[[Page 296]]

    (c) Equal opportunity. (1) A recipient that operates or sponsors 
interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics shall 
provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes. In 
determining whether equal opportunities are available, the designated 
agency official will consider, among other factors:
    (i) Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition 
effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both 
sexes;
    (ii) The provision of equipment and supplies;
    (iii) Scheduling of games and practice time;
    (iv) Travel and per diem allowance;
    (v) Opportunity to receive coaching and academic tutoring;
    (vi) Assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors;
    (vii) Provision of locker rooms, practice, and competitive 
facilities;
    (viii) Provision of medical and training facilities and services;
    (ix) Provision of housing and dining facilities and services;
    (x) Publicity.
    (2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unequal 
aggregate expenditures for members of each sex or unequal expenditures 
for male and female teams if a recipient operates or sponsors separate 
teams will not constitute noncompliance with this section, but the 
designated agency official may consider the failure to provide necessary 
funds for teams for one sex in assessing equality of opportunity for 
members of each sex.
    (d) Adjustment period. A recipient that operates or sponsors 
interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the 
elementary school level shall comply fully with this section as 
expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from 
September 29, 2000. A recipient that operates or sponsors 
interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the 
secondary or postsecondary school level shall comply fully with this 
section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than three 
years from September 29, 2000.


<R05>
Sec. 28.455  Textbooks and curricular material.

    Nothing in these Title IX regulations shall be interpreted as 
requiring or prohibiting or abridging in any way the use of particular 
textbooks or curricular materials.

agencies, with labor unions, and with organizations providing or 
administering fringe benefits to employees of the recipient.
    (4) A recipient shall not grant preferences to applicants for 
employment on the basis of attendance at any educational institution or 
entity that admits as students only or predominantly members of one sex,

Sec. 28.505  Employment criteria.

    A recipient shall not administer or operate any test or other 
criterion for any employment opportunity that has a disproportionately 
adverse effect on persons on the basis of sex unless:
    (a) Use of such test or other criterion is shown to predict validly 
successful performance in the position in question; and

have such disproportionately adverse effect, are shown to be 
unavailable.


<R05>
Sec. 28.510  Recruitment.

employees, or has been found to have so discriminated in the past, the 
recipient shall recruit members of the sex so discriminated against so 
as to overcome the effects of such past or present discrimination.
    (b) Recruitment patterns. A recipient shall not recruit primarily or 
exclusively at entities that furnish as applicants only or predominantly 
members of one sex if such actions have the effect of discriminating on 
the basis of sex in violation of Sec. Sec. 28.500 through 28.550.

    (c) Maintain or establish separate lines of progression, seniority 
systems, career ladders, or tenure systems for similar jobs, position 
descriptions, or job requirements that classify persons on the basis of 
sex, unless sex is a bona fide occupational qualification for the 
positions in question as set forth in Sec. 28.550.


<R05>

    (a) General. A recipient shall not apply any policy or take any 
employment action:
    (1) Concerning the potential marital, parental, or family status of

on the basis of sex; or
    (2) Which is based upon whether an employee or applicant for 
employment is the head of household or principal wage earner in such 
employee's or applicant's family unit.
    (b) Pregnancy. A recipient shall not discriminate against or exclude 
from employment any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of 
pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or 
recovery therefrom.
    (c) Pregnancy as a temporary disability. Subject to Sec. 28.235(d), 
a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, 
termination of pregnancy, recovery therefrom, and any temporary 
disability resulting therefrom as any other temporary disability for all

of leave, payment of disability income, accrual of seniority and any 
other benefit or service, and reinstatement, and under any fringe 
benefit offered to employees by virtue of employment.
    (d) Pregnancy leave. In the case of a recipient that does not 
maintain a leave policy for its employees, or in the case of an employee 
with insufficient leave or accrued employment time to qualify for leave 
under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, 
false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom as a 
justification for a leave of absence without pay for a reasonable period 
of time, at the conclusion of which the employee shall be reinstated to 
the status that she held when the leave began or to a comparable 
position, without decrease in rate of compensation or loss of 
promotional opportunities, or any other right or privilege of

Sec. 28.535  Effect of state or local law or other requirements.

    (a) Prohibitory requirements. The obligation to comply with

not imposed upon members of the other sex.
    (b) Benefits. A recipient that provides any compensation, service, 
or benefit to members of one sex pursuant to a State or local law or 
other requirement shall provide the same compensation, service, or 
benefit to members of the other sex.


<R05>
Sec. 28.540  Advertising.

    A recipient shall not in any advertising related to employment 
indicate preference, limitation, specification, or discrimination based

particular job in question.


<R05>

inquiry as to the marital status of an applicant for employment, 
including whether such applicant is ``Miss'' or ``Mrs.''

not used in connection with discrimination prohibited by these Title IX 
regulations.

[[Page 299]]


<R05>
Sec. 28.550  Sex as a bona fide occupational qualification.

    A recipient may take action otherwise prohibited by Sec. Sec. 28.500 
through 28.550 provided it is shown that sex is a bona fide occupational 
qualification for that action, such that consideration of sex with 
regard to such action is essential to successful operation of the 
employment function concerned. A recipient shall not take action 
pursuant to this section that is based upon alleged comparative 
employment characteristics or stereotyped characterizations of one or 
the other sex, or upon preference based on sex of the recipient, 
employees, students, or other persons, but nothing contained in this 
section shall prevent a recipient from considering an employee's sex in 
relation to employment in a locker room or toilet facility used only by 
members of one sex.

Sec. 28.600  Notice of covered programs.

    Within 60 days of September 29, 2000, each Federal agency that 
awards Federal financial assistance shall publish in the Federal 
Register a notice of the programs covered by these Title IX regulations. 
Each such Federal agency shall periodically republish the notice of 
covered programs to reflect changes in covered programs. Copies of this 
notice also shall be made available upon request to the Federal agency's 
office that enforces Title IX.


<R05>
Sec. 28.605  Compliance information.

    (a) Cooperation and assistance. The designated agency official shall 
to the fullest extent practicable seek the cooperation of recipients in 
obtaining compliance with these Title IX regulations and shall provide 
assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily 
with these Title IX regulations.
    (b) Compliance reports. Each recipient shall keep such records and 
submit to the designated agency official (or designee) timely, complete, 
and accurate compliance reports at such times, and in such form and 
containing such information, as the designated agency official (or 
designee) may determine to be necessary to enable the official to 
ascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying with these 
Title IX regulations. In the case of any program under which a primary 
recipient extends Federal financial assistance to any other recipient, 
such other recipient shall also submit such compliance reports to the 
primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary recipient to 
carry out its obligations under these Title IX regulations.
    (c) Access to sources of information. Each recipient shall permit 
access by the designated agency official (or designee) during normal 
business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other 
sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to 
ascertain compliance with these Title IX regulations. Where any 
information required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of 
any other agency, institution or person and this agency, institution or 
person shall fail or refuse to furnish this information the recipient 
shall so certify in its report and shall set forth what efforts it has 
made to obtain the information. Asserted considerations of privacy or 
confidentiality may not operate to bar the Department from evaluating or 
seeking to enforce compliance with these Title IX regulations. 
Information of a confidential nature obtained in connection with 
compliance evaluation or enforcement shall not be disclosed except where 
necessary in formal enforcement proceedings or where otherwise required 
by law.
    (d) Information to beneficiaries and participants. Each recipient 
shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other 
interested persons such information regarding the provisions of these 
Title IX regulations and their applicability to the program for which 
the recipient receives Federal financial assistance, and make such 
information available to them in such manner, as the designated agency 
official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections 
against discrimination assured them by Title IX and these Title IX 
regulations.

Sec. 28.610  Conduct of investigations.

    (a) Periodic compliance reviews. The designated agency official (or 
designee) shall from time to time review the practices of recipients to 
determine whether they are complying with these Title IX regulations.
    (b) Complaints. Any person who believes himself or herself or any 
specific class of individuals to be subjected to discrimination 
prohibited by these Title IX regulations may by himself or herself or by 
a representative file with the designated agency official (or designee) 
a written complaint. A complaint must be filed not later than 180 days 
from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing 
is extended by the designated agency official (or designee).
    (c) Investigations. The designated agency official (or designee) 
will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, report, 
complaint, or any other information indicates a possible failure to 
comply with these Title IX regulations. The investigation should 
include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and 
policies of the recipient, the circumstances under which the possible 
noncompliance with these Title IX regulations occurred, and other 
factors relevant to a determination as to whether the recipient has 
failed to comply with these Title IX regulations.
    (d) Resolution of matters. (1) If an investigation pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with these 
Title IX regulations, the designated agency official (or designee) will 
so inform the recipient and the matter will be resolved by informal 
means whenever possible. If it has been determined that the matter 
cannot be resolved by informal means, action will be taken as provided 
for in Sec. 28.615.
    (2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section the designated agency official (or 
designee) will so inform the recipient and the complainant, if any, in 
writing.
    (e) Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited. No recipient or 
other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against 
any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or 
privilege secured by Title IX or these Title IX regulations, or because 
he or she has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in 
any manner in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under these Title 
IX regulations. The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential 
except to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of these Title 
IX regulations, including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or 
judicial proceeding arising under these Title IX regulations.

Sec. 28.615  Procedure for effecting compliance.

    (a) General. If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure 
to comply with these Title IX regulations, and if the noncompliance or 
threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, 
compliance with these Title IX regulations may be effected by the 
suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal 
financial assistance or by any other means authorized by law. Such other 
means may include, but are not limited to:
    (1) A reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation 
that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the 
United States under any law of the United States, or any assurance or 
other contractual undertaking; and
    (2) Any applicable proceeding under State or local law.
    (b) Noncompliance with Sec. 28.115. If an applicant fails or 
refuses to furnish an assurance or otherwise fails or refuses to comply 
with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to Sec. 28.115, Federal 
financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of 
paragraph (c) of this section. The Department shall not be required to 
provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the 
administrative proceedings under paragraph (c) of this section except 
that the Department shall continue assistance during the pendency of 
such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an 
application therefor approved prior to September 29, 2000.
    (c) Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal 
financial assistance.

[[Page 301]]

(1) No order suspending, terminating or refusing to grant or continue 
Federal financial assistance shall become effective until:
    (i) The designated agency official has advised the applicant or 
recipient of its failure to comply and has determined that compliance 
cannot be secured by voluntary means;
    (ii) There has been an express finding on the record, after 
opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to 
comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to these Title IX 
regulations; and
    (iii) The expiration of 30 days after the Secretary has filed with 
the committee of the House, and the committee of the Senate having 
legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written 
report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action.
    (2) Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to 
continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular 
political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to 
whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to 
the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has 
been so found.
    (d) Other means authorized by law. (1) No action to effect 
compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until:
    (i) The designated agency official has determined that compliance 
cannot be secured by voluntary means;
    (ii) The recipient has been notified of its failure to comply and of 
the action to be taken to effect compliance; and
    (iii) The expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such 
notice to the recipient.
    (2) During this period of at least 10 days additional efforts shall 
be made to persuade the recipient to comply with these Title IX 
regulations and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 28.620  Hearings.

    (a) Opportunity for hearing. Whenever an opportunity for a hearing 
is required by Sec. 28.615(c), reasonable notice shall be given by 
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected 
applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or 
recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision 
under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the 
matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and 
either:
    (1) Fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice 
within which the applicant or recipient may request of the designated 
agency official that the matter be scheduled for hearing; or
    (2) Advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question 
has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and 
place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for 
cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place 
of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit 
written information and argument for the record. The failure of an 
applicant or recipient to request a hearing for which a date has been 
set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under 20 
U.S.C. 1682 and Sec. 28.615(c) and consent to the making of a decision 
on the basis of such information as may be filed as the record.
    (b) Time and place of hearing. Hearings shall be held at the offices 
of the Department in Washington, DC, at a time fixed by the designated 
agency official unless the official determines that the convenience of 
the applicant or recipient or of the Department requires that another 
place be selected. Hearings shall be held before a hearing officer 
designated in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 556(b).
    (c) Right to counsel. In all proceedings under this section, the 
applicant or recipient and the Department shall have the right to be 
represented by counsel.
    (d) Procedures, evidence, and record. (1) The hearing, decision, and 
any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with 
5 U.S.C. 554-557 (sections 5-8 of the Administrative Procedure Act), and 
in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not 
inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, 
giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of 
this

[[Page 302]]

section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests 
for findings, and other related matters. Both the Department and the 
applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant 
evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as 
determined by the hearing officer at the outset of or during the 
hearing. Any person (other than a Government employee considered to be 
on official business) who, having been invited or requested to appear 
and testify as a witness on the Government's behalf, attends at a time 
and place scheduled for a hearing provided for by these Title IX 
regulations, may be reimbursed for his or her travel and actual expenses 
of attendance in an amount not to exceed the amount payable under the 
standardized travel regulations to a Government employee traveling on 
official business.
    (2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings 
conducted pursuant to these Title IX regulations, but rules or 
principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence 
available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be 
applied where reasonably necessary by the hearing officer. The hearing 
officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious 
evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the 
record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall 
be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the 
issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the 
extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions 
shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be 
made.
    (e) Consolidated or Joint Hearings. In cases in which the same or 
related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with these Title 
IX regulations with respect to two or more programs to which these Title 
IX regulations apply, or noncompliance with these Title IX regulations 
and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies 
issued under Title IX, the designated agency official may, by agreement 
with such other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for 
the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application 
to such hearings of rules of procedures not inconsistent with these 
Title IX regulations. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as these 
Title IX regulations are concerned, shall be made in accordance with 
Sec. 28.625.

[65 FR 52883, Aug. 30, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 28.625  Decisions and notices.

    (a) Decisions by hearing officers. After a hearing is held by a 
hearing officer such hearing officer shall either make an initial 
decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including 
recommended findings and proposed decision to the reviewing authority 
for a final decision, and a copy of such initial decision or 
certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient and to the 
complainant, if any. Where the initial decision referred to in this 
paragraph or in paragraph (c) of this section is made by the hearing 
officer, the applicant or recipient or the counsel for the Department 
may, within the period provided for in the rules of procedure issued by 
the designated agency official, file with the reviewing authority 
exceptions to the initial decision, with the reasons therefor. Upon the 
filing of such exceptions the reviewing authority shall review the 
initial decision and issue its own decision thereof including the 
reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions the initial decision 
shall constitute the final decision, subject to the provisions of 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (b) Decisions on record or review by the reviewing authority. 
Whenever a record is certified to the reviewing authority for decision 
or it reviews the decision of a hearing officer pursuant to paragraph 
(a) or (c) of this section, the applicant or recipient shall be given 
reasonable opportunity to file with it briefs or other written 
statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the 
reviewing authority shall be given in writing to the applicant or 
recipient and to the complainant, if any.
    (c) Decisions on record where a hearing is waived. Whenever a 
hearing is waived pursuant to Sec. 28.620, the reviewing authority 
shall make its final decision on the record or refer the matter to a

[[Page 303]]

hearing officer for an initial decision to be made on the record. A copy 
of such decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or 
recipient, and to the complainant, if any.
    (d) Rulings required. Each decision of a hearing officer or 
reviewing authority shall set forth a ruling on each finding, 
conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement 
or requirements imposed by or pursuant to these Title IX regulations 
with which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to 
comply.
    (e) Review in certain cases by the Secretary of the Treasury. If the 
Secretary has not personally made the final decision referred to in 
paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, a recipient or applicant or 
the counsel for the Department may request the Secretary to review a 
decision of the reviewing authority in accordance with rules of 
procedure issued by the designated agency official. Such review is not a 
matter of right and shall be granted only where the Secretary determines 
there are special and important reasons therefor. The Secretary may 
grant or deny such request, in whole or in part. The Secretary also may 
review such a decision upon his own motion in accordance with rules of 
procedure issued by the designated agency official. In the absence of a 
review under this paragraph (e), a final decision referred to in 
paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section shall become the final 
decision of the Department when the Secretary transmits it as such to 
congressional committees with the report required under 20 U.S.C. 1682. 
Failure of an applicant or recipient to file an exception with the 
reviewing authority or to request review under this paragraph (e) shall 
not be deemed a failure to exhaust administrative remedies for the 
purpose of obtaining judicial review.
    (f) Content of orders. The final decision may provide for suspension 
or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial 
assistance, in whole or in part, to which these Title IX regulations 
apply, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as 
are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of Title IX and 
these Title IX regulations, including provisions designed to assure that 
no Federal financial assistance to which these Title IX regulations 
apply will thereafter be extended under such law or laws to the 
applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in default in 
its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to these Title IX 
regulations, or to have otherwise failed to comply with these Title IX 
regulations unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies 
the designated agency official that it will fully comply with these 
Title IX regulations.
    (g) Post-termination proceedings. (1) An applicant or recipient 
adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this 
section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal 
financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that 
order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with 
these Title IX regulations and provides reasonable assurance that it 
will fully comply with these Title IX regulations. An elementary or 
secondary school or school system that is unable to file an assurance of 
compliance shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal 
financial assistance if it files a court order or a plan for 
desegregation that meets the applicable requirements and provides 
reasonable assurance that it will comply with the court order or plan.
    (2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order 
entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time 
request the designated agency official to restore fully its eligibility 
to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be 
supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met 
the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the designated 
agency official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, 
the official shall restore such eligibility.
    (3) If the designated agency official denies any such request, the 
applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, 
specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall 
thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the 
record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the designated

[[Page 304]]

agency official. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such 
eligibility if it proves at such hearing that it satisfied the 
requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings 
under this paragraph (g) are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order 
issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.

<R05>
Sec. 29.104  Schedule for Federal Benefit Payments.

    Federal Benefit Payments are payable on the first business day of 
the month following the month in which the benefit accrues. (See Sec. 
29.105(b).)


<R05>
Sec. 29.105  Computation of time.

    (a) For filing documents. In computing the number of days allowed 
for filing a document, the first day counted is the day after the action 
or event from which the period begins to run. If the date that 
ordinarily would be the last day for filing falls on a Saturday, a 
Sunday, a Federal holiday, or a District holiday, the period runs until 
the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, a Sunday, or a Federal 
or a District holiday.
    (b) For benefit accrual. (1) Annuity accrues on a daily basis; one-
thirtieth of the monthly rate constitutes the daily rate.
    (2) Annuity does not accrue on the 31st day of any month except that 
annuity accrues on the 31st day of the initial month if the employee's 
annuity commences on the 31st day of a 31-day month.
    (3) For accrual purposes the last day of a 28-day month counts as 3 
days and the last day of a 29-day month counts as 2 days.
    (c) For counting unused sick leave. (1) For annuity computation 
purposes--
    (i) The service of a participant under the Police and Firefighters 
Plan who retires on an immediate annuity is increased by the number of 
days of unused sick leave to the participant's credit under a formal 
leave system; and
    (ii) The service of a participant under the Teachers Plan who 
retires on an immediate annuity or dies leaving a survivor entitled to 
an annuity is increased by the number of days of unused sick leave to 
the participant's credit under a formal leave system.
    (2) In general, 8 hours of unused sick leave increases total service 
by 1 day. In cases where more or less than 8 hours of sick leave would 
be charged for a day's absence, total service is increased by the number 
of days in the period between the date of separation and the date that 
the unused sick leave would have expired had the employee used it 
(except that holidays falling

[[Page 308]]

within the period are treated as work days, and no additional leave 
credit is earned for that period).
    (3) If an employee's tour of duty changes from part time to full 
time or full time to part time within 180 days before retirement, the 
credit for unused sick leave is computed as though no change had 
occurred.
    (d) For counting leave without pay (LWOP) that is creditable 
service. (1) Under the Police and Firefighters Plan, credit is allowed 
for no more than 6 months of LWOP in each calendar year.
    (2)(i) Under the Teachers Plan, credit is allowed for no more than 6 
months of LWOP in each fiscal year.
    (ii)(A) For years prior to fiscal year 1976, each fiscal year 
started on July 1 and ended on the following June 30.

on October 1 and ends on the following September 30.

30, 1997.

          Calculation of the Amount of Federal Benefit Payments


<R05>
Sec. 29.341  General principle.

    Except for disability retirements after June 30, 1997, and certain 
death benefits based on deaths after June 30, 1997, in which the 
calculation is not based upon length of service (see Sec. 29.344); for 
cases in which some service is creditable on or before June 30, 1997, 
and some service is creditable after June 30, 1997, Federal Benefit 
Payments are computed under the rules of the applicable plan as though--
    (a) The employee were eligible to retire effective July 1, 1997, 
under the same conditions as the actual retirement (that is, using the 
annuity computation formula that applies under the plan in effect on 
June 29, 1997, and the actual retirement age, including any applicable 
age reduction, based on the age at actual retirement);
    (b) The service that became creditable after June 30, 1997, did not 
exist; and
    (c) The average salary is the average salary at separation.

    Note to Sec. 29.341: See examples 7B, 9, and 13 of appendix A of 
this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 29.342  Computed annuity exceeds the statutory maximum.

    (a) In cases in which the total computed annuity exceeds the 
statutory maximum:
    (1) Federal Benefit Payments may equal total benefits even if the 
employee had service after June 30, 1997.
    (2) If the employee had sufficient service as of June 30, 1997, to 
qualify for the maximum annuity under the plan, the Federal Benefit 
Payment is the maximum annuity under the plan. This will be the entire 
benefit except for any amount in excess of the normal maximum due to 
unused sick leave, which is the responsibility of the District. (See 
example 3, of appendix A of this subpart.)
    (b) If the employee did not perform sufficient service as of June 
30, 1997, to reach the statutory maximum benefit, but has sufficient 
service at actual retirement to exceed the statutory maximum, the 
Federal Benefit Payment is the amount earned through June 30, 1997. The 
non-Federal-Benefit-Payment portion of the total benefit consists of 
only the amount by which the total benefit payable exceeds the Federal 
Benefit Payment.


<R05>
Sec. 29.343  Disability benefits.

    (a) The general rule that Federal Benefit Payments are calculated 
under the applicable retirement plan as though the employee were 
eligible for optional retirement and separated on June 30, 1997, does 
not apply to disability benefits prior to optional retirement age.
    (b) In cases involving disability benefits prior to optional 
retirement age, no Federal Benefit Payment is payable until the retiree 
reaches the age of eligibility to receive a deferred annuity (age 55 
under the Police and Firefighters Plan and age 62 under the Teachers 
Plan). When the age for deferred annuity is reached, the Federal Benefit 
Payment is paid using creditable service accrued as of June 30, 1997, 
and average salary (computed under the rules for the applicable plan) as 
of the date of separation. (See examples 6 and 7 of appendix A of this 
subpart.)


<R05>
Sec. 29.344  Survivor benefits.

    (a) The general rule that Federal Benefit Payments are calculated 
under the applicable retirement plan as though the employee were 
eligible for optional retirement and separated on June 30, 1997, does 
not apply to death benefits that are not determined by length of 
service.

[[Page 312]]

    (b) In cases in which the amount of death benefits is not determined 
by length of service, the amount of Federal Benefit Payments is 
calculated by multiplying the amount of the total benefit payable by the 
number of full months of service through June 30, 1997, and then 
dividing by the number of months of total service at retirement (for 
elected survivor benefits) or death (for guaranteed-minimum death-in-
service survivor benefits). (See example 13 of appendix A of this 
subpart.)


<R05>
Sec. 29.345  Cost-of-living adjustments.

    Cost-of-living increases are applied directly to Federal Benefit 
Payments, rather than computed on the total benefit and then prorated. 
(See example 14 of appendix A of this subpart.)


<R05>
Sec. 29.346  Reduction for survivor benefits.

    (a) If a retiree designates a base for a survivor annuity that is 
greater than or equal to the unreduced Federal Benefit Payment, the 
applicable plan's annuity reduction formula is applied to the unreduced 
Federal Benefit Payment to determine the reduced Federal Benefit 
Payment. (See example 10 of appendix A of this subpart.)
    (b) If a retiree designates a base for a survivor annuity that is 
less than the amount of the Federal Benefit Payment, the entire survivor 
reduction applies to the Federal Benefit Payment to determine the 
reduced Federal Benefit Payment.

              Appendix A to Subpart C of Part 29--Examples

    This appendix contains sample calculations of Federal Benefit 
Payments in a variety of situations.

                      Optional Retirement Examples

                     Example 1: No Unused Sick Leave

    A. In this example, an individual covered by the Police and 
Firefighters Plan hired before 1980 retires in October 1997. At 
retirement, he is age 51 with 20 years and 3 days of departmental 
service plus 3 years, 4 months, and 21 days of military service that 
preceded the departmental service. The Federal Benefit Payment begins at 
retirement. It is based on the 19 years, 8 months, and 22 days of 
departmental service and 3 years, 4 months, and 21 days of military 
service performed as of June 30, 1997. Thus, the Federal Benefit Payment 
is based on 23 years and 1 month of service, all at the 2.5 percent 
accrual rate. The total annuity is based on 23 years and 4 months of 
service, all at the 2.5 percent accrual rate.

                       Example 1A--Police Optional

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    B. In this example, the individual covered by the Police and 
Firefighters Plan was hired earlier than in example 1A and thus 
performed more service as of both June 30, 1997, and retirement in 
October 1997. At retirement, he is age 51 with 21 years, 11 months and 
29 days of departmental service plus 3 years, 4 months, and 21 days of 
military service that preceded the departmental service. The Federal 
Benefit Payment begins at retirement. It is based on the 21 years, 8 
months, and 18 days of departmental service and 3 years, 4 months, and 
21 days of military service performed as of June 30, 1997. Thus, the 
Federal Benefit Payment is based on 25 years and 1 month of service, 1 
year and 8 months at the 3.0 percent accrual rate and 23 years and 5 
months at the 2.5 percent accrual rate (including 1 month consisting of 
18 days of departmental service and 21 days of other service). The total 
annuity is based on 25 years and 4 months of service, 1 year and 11 
months at the 3.0 percent accrual rate and 23 years and 5 months at the 
2.5 percent accrual rate (including 1 month consisting of 29 days of 
departmental service and 21 days of other service).

                   Example 2: Unused Sick Leave Credit

    In this example, an individual covered by the Police and 
Firefighters Plan and hired before 1980 retires in March 1998. At 
retirement, she is age 48 with 24 years, 8 months, and 6 days of 
departmental service plus 6 months and 4 days of other service (deposit 
paid before June 30, 1997) and 11 months and 11 days of unused sick 
leave. For a police officer (or a non-firefighting division firefighter) 
such an amount of sick leave would be 1968 hours (246 days, based on a 
260-day year, times 8 hours per day). For a firefighting division 
firefighter, such an amount would be 2069 hours (341 days divided by 360 
days per year times 2184 hours per year). The Federal Benefit Payment 
begins at retirement. It is based on the 23 years, 11 months, and 23 
days of departmental service performed as of June 30, 1997, and 6 months 
and 4 days of other service. Thus, the Federal Benefit Payment is based 
on 20 years departmental and 6 months of other service at the 2.5 
percent accrual rate and 3 years and 11 months of service at the 3.0 
percent accrual rate. The total annuity is based on 20 years and 6 
months of service at the 2.5 percent accrual rate and 5 years and 7 
months of service at the 3 percent accrual rate.

         Example 3: Calculated Benefit Exceeds Statutory Maximum

    A. In this example, an individual covered by the Police and 
Firefighters Plan hired before 1980 retires in March 1998. At 
retirement, he is age 55 with 32 years and 17 days of departmental 
service. The Federal Benefit Payment begins at retirement. It is based 
on the 31 years, 3 months, and 17 days of departmental service performed 
as of June 30, 1997. Thus, the Federal Benefit Payment is based on 20 
years of service at the 2.5 percent accrual rate and 11 years and 3 
months of service at the 3.0 percent accrual rate. However, the annuity 
is limited to 80 percent of the basic salary at time of retirement. 
(This limitation does not apply to the unused sick leave credit.) The 
annuity computed as of June 30, 1997, equals the full benefit payable; 
therefore, the Federal Benefit Payment is the total benefit.

                       Example 3A--Police Optional

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    B. In this example, the individual in example 3A also has 6 months 
of unused sick leave at retirement. The sick leave credit is not subject 
to the 80% limitation and does not become creditable service until the 
date of separation. For a police officer (or a non-firefighting division 
firefighter) such an amount of sick leave would be 1040 hours (130 days, 
based on a 260-day year, times 8 hours per day). For a firefighting 
division firefighter, such an amount would be 1092 hours (180 days 
divided by 360 days per year times 2184 hours per year). Six months of 
unused sick leave increases the annual total benefit by 1.5 percent of 
the average salary, or in the example by $94 per month. The District is 
responsible for the portion of the annuity attributable to the unused 
sick leave because it became creditable at retirement, that is, after 
June 30, 1997.

                   Example 4: Excess Leave Without Pay

    In this example, an individual covered by the Teachers Plan hired 
before 1996 retires in February 1998. At retirement, she is age 64 with 
27 years of departmental service and 6 years, 7 months, and 28 days of 
other service (creditable before June 30, 1997). However, only 6 months 
of leave in a fiscal year without pay may be credited toward retirement 
under the Teachers Plan. She had 3 months and 18 days of excess leave 
without pay as of June 30, 1997. Since the excess leave without pay 
occurred before June 30, 1997, the time attributable to the excess leave 
without pay is subtracted from the service used in both the Federal 
Benefit Payment and the total benefit computations. The Federal Benefit 
Payment begins at retirement. It is based on the 32 years and 8 months 
of service (32 years, 11 months, and 28 days minus 3 months and 18 days 
and the partial month dropped); 5 years of service at the 1.5 percent 
accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual rate, and 
22 years and 8 months of service at the 2 percent accrual rate. The 
total annuity is based on 33 years and 4 months of service (33 years, 7 
months and 28 days minus 3 months and 18 days and the partial month 
dropped) 5 years of service at the 1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of 
service at the 1.75 percent accrual rate and 23 years and 4 months of 
service at the 2 percent accrual rate.

    Note: For the Teachers Plan, section 1230(a) of title 31 of the DC 
Code (1997) allows for 6 months leave without pay in any fiscal year. 
For the Police and Firefighters Plan, section 610(d) of title 4 of the 
DC Code (1997) allows for 6 months leave without pay in any calendar 
year.

                   Example 5: Service Credit Deposits

    A. An individual covered by the Teachers Plan hired before 1996 
retires in October 1997. At retirement, he is age 61 with 30 years and 3 
days of departmental service plus 3 years, 4 months, and 21 days of 
other service that preceded the departmental service for which the 
deposit was fully paid on or before June 30, 1997. The Federal Benefit 
Payment begins at retirement. It is based on the 29 years, 8 months, and 
22 days of departmental service and 3 years, 4 months, and 21 days of 
service performed as of June 30, 1997. Thus, the Federal Benefit Payment 
is based on 33 years and 1 month of service; 5 years of service at the 
1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual 
rate, and 23 years and 1 month of service at the 2 percent accrual rate. 
The total annuity is based on 33 years and 4 months of service; 5 years 
of service at the 1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 
1.75 percent accrual rate and 23 years and 4 months of service at the 2 
percent accrual rate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    B. In this example, the employee in example 5A did not pay any of 
the deposit to obtain credit for the 3 years, 4 months, and 21 days of 
other service as of June 30, 1997. Thus, none of the other service is 
used in the computation of the Federal Benefit Payment. An individual 
covered by the Teachers Plan hired before 1996 retires in October 1997. 
At retirement, he is age 61 with 30 years and 3 days of departmental 
service plus 3 years, 4 months, and 21 days of other service that 
preceded the departmental service for which the deposit was paid in full 
in October 1997 (at retirement). The Federal Benefit Payment begins at 
retirement. It is based on only the 29 years, 8 months, and 22 days of 
departmental service performed as of June 30, 1997; 5 years of service 
at the 1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent 
accrual rate, and 19 years and 8 months of service at the 2 percent 
accrual rate. The total annuity is based on 33 years and 4 months of 
service; 5 years of service at the 1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of 
service at the 1.75 percent accrual rate and 23 years and 4 months of 
service at the 2 percent accrual rate.

    C. In this example, the employee in examples 5A and B began 
installment payments on the deposit to obtain credit for the 3 years, 4 
months, and 21 days of other service as of June 30, 1997, but did not 
complete the deposit until October 1997 (at retirement). The other 
service is not used in the computation of the Federal Benefit Payment 
because the payment was not completed as of June 30, 1997. Thus, the

                     Disability Retirement Examples

 Example 6: Disability Occurs Before Eligibility for Optional Retirement

    A. In this example, an individual covered by the Police and 
Firefighters Plan hired before 1980 retires based on a disability in the 
line of duty in October 1997. At retirement, he is age 45 with 18 years, 
5 months, and 11 days of departmental service. Since he had performed 
less than 20 years of service and had not reached the age of eligibility 
for an optional retirement, the Federal Benefit Payment does not begin 
at retirement. When the disability annuitant reaches age 55, he 
satisfies the age and service requirements for deferred retirement. At 
that time (August 20, 2007), the Federal Benefit Payment begins. It is 
based on the 18 years, 1 month, and 17 days of departmental service 
performed as of June 30, 1997, all at the 2.5 percent accrual rate.

    B. In this example, an individual covered by the Teachers Plan hired 
before 1996 retires based on a disability in December 1997. At 
retirement, she is age 49 with 27 years and 4 months of departmental 
service which includes 3 years, 3 months and 14 days of excess leave 
without pay (prior to June 30, 1997). Since she does not qualify for 
optional retirement at separation, the Federal Benefit Payment does not 
begin at separation. When the disability annuitant reaches age 62, she

[[Page 317]]

will satisfy the age and service requirements for deferred retirement. 
At that time (March 9, 2010), the Federal Benefit Payment begins. The 
time attributable to the excess leave without pay is subtracted from the 
service used to compute the Federal Benefit Payment. Since the excess 
leave without pay occurred before June 30, 1997, the deferred Federal 
Benefit Payment is based on the 23 years and 6 months of service; 5 
years of service at the 1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at 
the 1.75 percent accrual rate, and 13 and 6 months of service at the 2 
percent accrual rate.

 Example 7: Disability Occurs After Eligibility for Optional Retirement

    A. In this example, an individual covered by the Police and 
Firefighters Plan hired before 1980 retires based on a disability in the 
line of duty in October 1997. At retirement, she is age 55 with 24 
years, 5 months, and 11 days of departmental service. Since she was also 
eligible for optional retirement at the time of separation, the Federal 
Benefit Payment commences at retirement. It is based on the 24 years, 1 
month, and 17 days of departmental service performed as of June 30, 
1997. Thus, the Federal Benefit Payment is based on 20 years of service 
at the 2.5 percent accrual rate and 4 years and 1 month of service at 
the 3 percent accrual rate. The total annuity is based on the disability 
formula and is equal to two-thirds of average pay because that amount is 
higher than the 63.25 percent payable based on total service.

    B. In this example, an individual covered by the Teachers Plan hired 
before 1996 retires based on a disability in December 1997. At 
retirement, he is age 60 with 27 years and 4 months of departmental 
service which includes 3 years, 3 months and 14 days of excess leave 
without pay (prior to June 30, 1997). Since he qualifies for optional 
retirement at separation, the Federal Benefit Payment begins at 
retirement. Since the excess leave without pay occurred before June 30, 
1997, and the total annuity is based on actual service (that is, exceeds 
the guaranteed disability minimum), the time attributable to the excess 
leave without pay is subtracted from the service used to compute the 
Federal Benefit Payment and total benefit. The Federal Benefit Payment 
is based on 23 years and 6 months of service; 5 years of service at the 
1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual 
rate, and 13 years and 6 months of service at the 2 percent accrual

accrual rate.

                      Deferred Retirement Examples

               Example 8: All Service Before June 30, 1997

    In this example, an individual covered by the Police and 
Firefighters Plan hired before 1980 separated in March 1986 with title 
to a deferred annuity. In November 1997, he reaches age 55 and becomes 
eligible for the deferred annuity based on his 15 years, 9 months, and 8 
days of departmental service, all at the 2.5 percent accrual rate. The 
total annuity is based on the same 15 years, 9 months, and 8 days of 
service all at the 2.5 percent accrual rate. Since all the service is 
creditable as of June 30, 1997, the Federal Benefit Payment equals the 
total annuity.

            Reduction To Provide a Survivor Annuity Examples

               Example 10: Survivor Reduction Calculations

    Both of the following examples involve a former teacher who elected 
a reduced annuity to provide a survivor benefit:
    A. In this example, the employee elected full survivor benefits. The 
Federal Benefit Payment is reduced by 2\1/2\ percent of the first $3600 
and 10 percent of the balance. The total annuity is also reduced by 2\1/
2\ percent of the first $3600 and 10 percent of the balance.

            Early Optional or Involuntary Retirement Examples

              Example 11: Early Optional With Age Reduction

    In this example, an individual covered by the Teachers Plan hired 
before 1996 retires voluntarily in February 1998, under a special 
program that allows early retirement with at least 20 years of service 
at age 50 older, or at least 25 years of service at any age. At 
retirement, she is 6 full months short of age 55. She has 25 years and 5 
months of departmental service; 6 years, 2 months, and 19 days of other 
service (creditable before June 30, 1997); and 2 months and 9 days of 
unused sick leave. Since she is not eligible for optional retirement and 
she is eligible to retire voluntarily only because of the District-
approved special program, the Federal Benefit Payment is calculated 
similar to a disability retirement. It does not begin until she becomes 
eligible for a deferred annuity at age 62. When it commences the Federal 
Benefit Payment will be based on the service creditable as of June 30, 
1997: 30 years and 11 months of service; 5 years of service at the 1.5 
percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual 
rate, and 20 years and 11 months of service at the 2 percent accrual 
rate. The total annuity is based on 5 years of service at the 1.5 
percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual 
rate and 21 years and 9 months of service at the 2 percent accrual rate 
(including the unused sick leave). Because the Federal

[[Page 320]]

Benefit Payment is based on the deferred annuity, rather than the early 
voluntary retirement, it is not reduced by the age reduction factor used 
to compute the total benefit.

               Example 12: Involuntary With Age Reduction

    In this example, an individual covered by the Teachers Plan hired 
before 1996 retires involuntarily in February 1998. At retirement, she 
is 6 full months short of age 55. She has 25 years and 5 months of 
departmental service; 6 years, 2 months, and 19 days of other service 
(creditable before June 30, 1997); and 2 months and 9 days of unused 
sick leave. The Federal Benefit Payment begins at retirement. It is 
based on the 30 years and 11 months of service; 5 years of service at 
the 1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent 
accrual rate, and 20 years and 11 months of service at the 2 percent 
accrual rate. The total annuity is based on 5 years of service at the 
1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual 
rate and 21 years and 9 months of service at the 2 percent accrual rate 
(including the unused sick leave). Both the Federal Benefit Payment and

                         Death Benefits Example

                 Example 13: Death Benefits Calculation

    Regardless of whether death occurs in service or after retirement, 
if the death benefit is not based on the length of service, the portion 
of a death benefit that is a Federal Benefit Payment is based on the 
ratio of the number of months of the deceased employee's service as of 
June 30, 1997, to the number of months of the deceased employee's total 
service. This proration will always apply to cases of death after 
retirement in which the survivor annuity is based on the reduction in 
the employee's annuity to provide the benefit. It also applies to lump-
sum benefits and benefits computed under a guaranteed-minimum or a 
percentage-of-disability-at-retirement formula.
    A. In this example, an individual covered by the Teachers Plan 
retires in April 1998 with 30 years of service and elects to provide a 
full survivor annuity. He dies in June 1998. The Federal Benefit Payment 
is 97\1/2\ percent (351 months/360 months) of the total survivor 
benefit.

                  Example 13A--Teachers Death Benefits

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    B. In this example, a teacher dies in service on June 30, 1998 after 
31 years of departmental service. Since the survivor annuity is based on 
actual service, the Federal Benefit Payment is based on the 30 years of 
service as of June 30, 1997. The total benefit is based on the 31 years 
of total service. No proration is appropriate.

                  Example 13B--Teachers Death Benefits

    C. In this example, a teacher dies in service on April 1, 1998 after 
15 years of departmental service. Since the survivor annuity is based on 
the guaranteed minimum, the Federal Benefit Payment is a prorated 
portion of the total benefit. Since the teacher had 171 months of 
service as of the freeze date and 180 months of service at death, the 
Federal Benefit Payment equals 171/180ths of the total benefit.

    D. In this example, as in the prior example, a teacher dies in 
service on April 1, 1998 after 15 years of departmental service. 
However, in this example, the teacher was age 40 on the hire date. The 
amount of service used in the survivor annuity calculation equals the 
amount of service that the teacher would have had if the teacher 
continued covered employment until age 60. Since the survivor annuity is 
based on projected service, a form of the guaranteed minimum, the 
Federal Benefit Payment is a prorated portion of the total benefit. 
Since the teacher had 171 months of service as of the freeze date and 
180 months of service at death, the Federal Benefit Payment equals 171/
180ths of the total benefit.

                   Cost of Living Adjustment Examples

          Example 14: Application of Cost of Living Adjustments

    Cost of living adjustments are applied directly to the Federal 
Benefit Payment to determine the new rate of the Federal Benefit Payment 
after a cost of living adjustment.
    A. In this example, the cost of living adjustment is the same for 
the Federal Benefit Payment and the non-Federal Benefit Payment portion 
of the total benefit. Effectively, the total cost of living adjustment 
is proportionally split between the Federal Benefit Payment and the non-
Federal Benefit Payment.

    B. In this example, a new District plan applies a different cost of 
living adjustment than is provided for the Federal Benefit Payment. The 
Federal Benefit Payment will be unaffected by the new District plan. In 
such a case, the total cost of living adjustment is no longer 
proportionally split between the Federal Benefit Payment and the non-
Federal Benefit Payment.

             Retroactive Payment of Accrued Annuity Example

             Example 15: Accrual of Federal Benefit Payment

    The Federal Benefit Payment begins to accrue on the annuity 
commencing date, regardless of whether the employee is added to the 
annuity roll in time for the regular payment cycle. If the employee is 
due a retroactive payment of accrued annuity, the portion of the 
retroactive payment that would have been Federal Benefit Payment (if it 
were made in the regular payment cycle) is still Federal Benefit 
Payment. In this example, a teacher retired effective September 11, 
1998. She was added to the retirement rolls on the pay date November 1, 
1998 (October 1 to October 31 accrual cycle). Her Federal Benefit 
Payment is $3000 per month and her total benefit payment is $3120 per 
month. Her initial check is $5200 because it includes a prorated payment 
for 20 days (September 11 to September 30). The Federal Benefit Payment 
is $5000 of the initial check ($3000 for the October cycle and $2000 for 
the September cycle).

Sec. 29.404  Initial benefit determinations and reconsideration by 
the Benefits Administrator.

    (a) Initial benefit determinations. The Benefits Administrator will 
process applications for Federal Benefit Payments and determine the 
eligibility for and the amount and form of Federal Benefit Payments. All 
initial benefit determination decisions which may reasonably be 
construed as a denial (in whole or part) of a claim for Federal Benefit 
Payments must be in writing, must advise claimants of their right to 
request reconsideration under paragraph (b), of this section and must 
state the time limits applicable to such a request.
    (b) Claimant's right to reconsideration of benefit denials. (1) 
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, claimants who 
disagree with the amount or form of a Federal Benefit Payment 
determination and wish to contest the determination must first request

Administrator within 30 calendar days from the date of the written 
notice of the initial benefit determination.
    (d) Reconsideration decisions. A reconsideration decision by the 
Benefits Administrator denying (in whole or part) a claim for a Federal 
Benefit Payment must--
    (1) Be in writing;
    (2) Provide adequate notice of such denial, setting forth the 
specific reason for the denial in a manner calculated to be understood 
by the average participant; and
    (3) Provide notice of the right to appeal the Benefit 
Administrator's decision to the Department, the address to which such an 
appeal must be submitted, and the time limits applicable to such an 
appeal.
    (e) Appeal of reconsideration decisions. The Department will review 
an appeal of a reconsideration decision under Sec. 29.405.


<R05>
Sec. 29.405  Appeals to the Department.

    (a) Who may file. Any claimant whose claim for a Federal Benefit

claimant's name, address, date of birth and claim number, if applicable, 
and must state the basis for the appeal.
    (c) Time limits on Appeals. (1) An appeal must be received by the 
Department within 30 calendar days from the date of the reconsideration 
decision under Sec. 29.404(d).
    (2) The Department may extend the time limit for filing when the 
claimant shows that he or she was not notified of the time limit and was 
not otherwise aware of it, or that he or she was prevented by 
circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request

[[Page 325]]

within the time limit, or for other good and sufficient reason.
    (d) Final decision. After consideration of the appeal, the 
Department will issue a final decision. The Department's decision must 
be in writing, must fully set forth the Department's findings and 
conclusions on the appeal, and must contain notice of the right to 
judicial review provided in Sec. 29.406. Copies of the final decision 
must be sent to the claimant seeking appeal, to any competing claimants 
(see Sec. 29.407) and to the Benefits Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 29.406  Judicial review.

    An individual whose claim for a Federal Benefit Payment has been 
denied (in whole or part) in a final decision by the Department under 
Sec. 29.405 may, within 180 days of the date of the final decision, 
file a civil action in the United States District Court for the District 
of Columbia. Any such civil action must be filed in accordance with the 
rules of that court.


<R05>
Sec. 29.407  Competing claimants.

    (a) Competing claimants are applicants for survivor benefits based 
on the service of a participant when--
    (1) A benefit is payable based on the service of the participant;
    (2) Two or more claimants have applied for benefits based on the 
service of the participant; and
    (3) A decision in favor of one claimant will adversely affect 
another claimant(s).
    (b)(1) When a competing claimant files a request for reconsideration 
under this section, the other competing claimants shall be notified of 
the request and given an opportunity to submit written substantiation of 
their claim.
    (2) When the Benefits Administrator receives an application from a 
competing claimant(s) before any payments are made based upon the 
service of the participant, and an initial determination of benefits in 
favor of one claimant adversely affects another claimant, all known 
claimants concerned will be notified in writing of that decision and 
those adversely affected will be given an opportunity to request 
reconsideration under the procedures and time limitations set forth in 
Sec. 29.404(c). The Benefits Administrator must not execute its 
decision until the time limit for filing a request for reconsideration 
has expired, or, if a reconsideration decision is made, until the time 
limit for filing an appeal to the Department has expired or the 
Department has issued a final decision on a timely appeal, whichever is 
later.
    (3) When the Benefits Administrator does not receive an application 
from a competing claimant(s) until after another person has begun to 
receive payments based upon the service of the participant, the payments 
will continue until the time limit for filing a request for 
reconsideration has expired, or, if a reconsideration decision is made, 
until the time limit for filing an appeal to the Department has expired 
or the Department has issued a final decision on a timely appeal, 
whichever is later.

    A payment of a Federal Benefit Payment to a debtor because of an

waiver and/or compromise, or a subsequent timely appeal of a 
reconsideration decision, will stop collection proceedings, unless--
    (1) Failure to take the offset would substantially prejudice the 
Federal Government's ability to collect the debt; and
    (2) The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably 
permit the completion of these procedures.


<R05>

beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit, 
or for other good and sufficient reason.

the decision also will contain the conditions for the collection of the 
overpayment. Copies of the final decision will be sent to the individual 
seeking appeal and to the Benefits Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 29.514  Requests for waiver and/or compromise.

    (a) Right to request waiver and/or compromise. Individuals who

[[Page 331]]

or part) in a final decision by the Department under Sec. 29.513 may, 
within 180 days of the date of the final decision, file a civil action 
in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Any 
such civil action must be filed in accordance with the rules of that 
court.


<R05>
Sec. 29.516  Collection of overpayments.

    (a) Means of collection. Collection of an overpayment may be made by 
means of offset under Sec. 29.517, or under any statutory provision 
providing for offset of money due the debtor from the Federal Government 
including, but not limited to, Federal Benefit Payments. Collection may 
also be effected by referral to the Justice Department for litigation, 
as provided in Sec. 29.520, or referral to a collection agency as 
provided in Sec. 29.519, or by other means authorized by federal law.
    (b) Additional charges. Interest, penalties, and administrative 
costs will be assessed on the overpayment in accordance with standards 
established in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and 31 CFR 901.9. Additional charges will 
be waived when required by the FCCS. The Department will waive the 
collection of interest on the overpayment pending the Benefits 
Administrator's consideration of a request for reconsideration and the 
Department's consideration of a request for waiver and/or compromise or 
the appeal of a reconsideration decision. In addition, such charges may 
be waived when the Department determines--
    (1) Collection of those charges would be against equity and good 
conscience under the standards prescribed in Sec. Sec. 29.523 through 
29.525; or
    (2) Waiver of those charges would be in the best interest of the 
United States.
    (c) Collection in installments. (1) Whenever feasible, overpayments 
will be collected in one lump sum.
    (2) However, installment payments may be effected when--
    (i) The debtor establishes that he or she is financially unable to 
pay in one lump sum; or
    (ii)(A) The benefit payable is insufficient to make collection in 
one lump sum;
    (B) The debtor fails to respond to a demand for full payment; and
    (C) Offset is available.
    (d) Offset Amount. (1) The amount offset from a monthly Federal 
Benefit Payment will be the lesser of:
    (i) The amount of the debt, including any interest, penalties and 
administrative costs;
    (ii) An amount equal to 15 percent of the monthly Federal Benefit 
Payment; or
    (iii) The amount, if any, by which the monthly Federal Benefit 
Payment exceeds $750.
    (2) For purposes of this subsection, the ``monthly Federal Benefit 
Payment'' is the amount of the gross monthly benefit after any 
reductions or deductions required under law, including reductions made 
to recover overpayments of Federal Benefit Payments.
    (e) Commencement of collection. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(e)(2) of this section, collection will begin after the time limits for 
requesting further rights stated in Sec. 29.512 through Sec.  29.514 
expire and no such requests have been made, or after the Benefits 
Administrator and/or the Department have issued decisions on all timely 
requests for or appeals of those rights, unless failure to make an 
offset would substantially prejudice the Department's ability to collect 
the overpayment and the time before the payment is to be made does not 
reasonably permit the completion of the proceedings in Sec. 29.511 
through Sec. 29.514 or litigation. When offset begins without 
completion of the administrative review process, these procedures will 
be completed promptly, and amounts recovered by offset but later found 
not owed will be refunded promptly.
    (2) The procedures identified in Sec. 29.511 through Sec.  29.514 
will not be applied when the overpayment is caused by--
    (i) A retroactive adjustment in the periodic rate of annuity or any 
deduction taken from annuity when the adjustment is a result of the 
annuitant's election of different entitlements under law, if the 
adjustment is made within 120 days of the effective date of the 
election; or
    (ii) interim estimated payments made before the formal determination 
of entitlement to annuity, if the

[[Page 332]]

amount is recouped from the total annuity payable on the first day of 
the month following the later of--
    (A) The last interim payment or
    (B) The date the formal determination is made.
    (f) Collection of delinquent debts--(1) Debts delinquent over 180 
days. The Benefits Administrator must refer all overpayment debts that 
are over 180 days delinquent to the Secretary for collection pursuant to 
31 U.S.C. 3711(g) and 3716, and 31 CFR part 901.
    (2) Debts delinquent less than 180 days. Once an overpayment debt 
becomes delinquent, the Benefits Administrator should refer it to the 
Secretary for collection by centralized administrative offset pursuant 
to 31 CFR 901.3, unless collection of the debt by some other means is 
likely to occur in a more timely and efficient manner.
    (3) Once a debt is referred under this subsection, the Benefits 
Administrator has no further obligation to collect the debt.


<R05>
Sec. 29.517  Collection by offset.

    (a) Offset from retirement payments. An overpayment may be collected 
in whole or in part from any refund payment or recurring Federal Benefit 
Payments.
    (b) Offset from other payments--(1) Administrative offset. When 
offset under subsection (a) is not available, an overpayment may be 
offset from other Federal payments due the debtor from other agencies 
under the procedures set forth in 31 CFR part 5 and 31 CFR 901.3(c).
    (2) Salary offset. When the debtor is an employee of the Federal 
Government, the Department may effect collection of an overpayment by 
offset of the debtor's pay in accordance with regulations published to 
implement such offsets under 5 U.S.C. 5514 (see 5 CFR part 550, subpart 
K; 31 CFR 285.7; and 31 CFR Part 5). Due process described in the 
federal salary offset regulations of 31 CFR part 5 will apply. When the 
debtor did not receive a hearing under those regulations and requests 
such a hearing, one will be conducted in accordance with 5 CFR part 550, 
subpart K and 31 CFR part 5.
    (3) Tax refund offset. The Department may effect collection of an 
overpayment by offset of the debtor's tax refund in accordance with the 
Department's tax refund offset regulations found at 31 CFR part 5.


<R05>
Sec. 29.518  Reporting delinquent debts to credit bureaus.

    (a) Notice. If a debtor's response to the demand letter does not 
result in payment in full, payment by offset, or payment in accordance 
with a voluntary repayment agreement or other repayment schedule 
acceptable to the Benefits Administrator, and the debtor's rights under 
Sec. 29.512 through Sec.  29.514 have been exhausted, the Benefits 
Administrator must report the debtor to a credit bureau. In addition, a 
debtor's failure to make subsequent payments in accordance with a 
repayment schedule must result in a report to a credit bureau. Before 
making a report to a credit bureau, the Benefits Administrator must 
notify the debtor in writing that--
    (1) The payment is overdue;
    (2) The Benefits Administrator intends, after 60 days, to make a 
report as described in paragraph (b) of this section to a credit bureau;
    (3) The debtor's right to dispute the liability has been exhausted 
under Sec. 29.512 through Sec.  29.514; and
    (4) The debtor may avoid having the Benefits Administrator report 
the debtor to a credit bureau by paying the debt in one lump sum or 
making payments current under a repayment schedule.
    (b) Report. If, after being sent the notice described in paragraph 
(a) of this section, the debtor does not pay the overpayment debt or 
make payments current under a repayment schedule or fails to respond to 
the notice, and 60 days have elapsed since the notice was mailed, the 
Benefits Administrator will report to a credit bureau that the debtor is 
responsible for an unpaid debt and provide the following information:
    (1) The debtor's name, address, taxpayer identification number, and 
any other information necessary to establish the identity of the 
individual;
    (2) The amount, status, and history of the debt; and
    (3) The fact that the debt arose in connection with the 
administration of Federal Benefit Payments under a District Retirement 
Fund.

[[Page 333]]

    (c) Subsequent reports. The Benefits Administrator must update its 
report to the credit bureau whenever it has knowledge of events that 
substantially change the status or the amount of the liability.
    (d) Other reporting of delinquent debts. Pursuant to 31 CFR 901.4, 
delinquent overpayment debts should be reported to the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development's Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response 
System (CAIVRS).
    (e) Privacy Act considerations. A delinquent debt may not be 
reported under this section unless a notice issued pursuant to the 
Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4), authorizes the disclosure of 
information about the debtor to a credit bureau or CAIVRS.


<R05>
Sec. 29.519  Referral to a collection agency.

    (a) The Department retains the responsibility for resolving 
disputes, compromising debts, referring overpayment debts for 
litigation, and suspending or terminating collection action.
    (b) The Department may not refer overpayment debts to commercial 
collection agencies until all procedures required by or requested under 
Sec. 29.511 through Sec.  29.514 have been completed.


<R05>
Sec. 29.520  Referral for litigation.

    The Department may refer to the Justice Department for litigation 
overpayment debts which cannot be compromised or waived, or on which 
collection activity cannot be suspended or terminated, and which the 
Department has been unable to recover pursuant to the collection 
activity described in Sec. 29.511 through Sec.  29.519. (See 31 CFR 
part 904.) Such debts should be referred to the Justice Department as 
early as possible, but at least within 1 year of the date such debts 
last became delinquent. In the case of overpayments arising from fraud, 
misrepresentation, or the presentation of a false claim, referral should 
be made to the Justice Department immediately. (See 31 CFR 900.3(a).) 
Referral of a debt to the Justice Department will suspend processing 
under Sec. 29.511 through Sec.  29.519 of this subpart.

                  Standards for Waiver of Overpayments


<R05>
Sec. 29.521  Conditions for waiver and other adjustments.

    (a) General. Overpayments made from the Retirement Funds will be 
recovered unless there is substantial evidence that the individual from 
whom recovery is to be made is eligible for waiver.
    (b) Waiver. The Department may waive an overpayment from the 
Retirement Funds (provided there is no indication of fraud, 
misrepresentation, or lack of good faith on the part of the debtor) 
under sections 11021(3) or 11251(c)(2)(B) of the Act when it is 
established by substantial evidence that the individual from whom 
recovery is to be made--
    (1) Is not at fault in causing or contributing to the overpayment, 
and
    (2) Recovery would be against equity and good conscience.
    (c) Adjustment in the installment schedule. (1)(i) An overpayment 
will not be waived because of financial hardship if a reasonable 
installment schedule can be established for repayment of the debt by 
adjusting the installment schedule originally established.
    (ii) For example, if the Department finds that the original 
installment schedule--24 installments at $125 each--causes the debtor 
financial hardship, but that repayment in 60 installments at $50 each 
does not, it may adjust the installments and recover the debt in full.
    (2) Where it has been determined that an individual is ineligible 
for a waiver, but the individual has shown that collection action 
pursuant to the original installment schedule would cause him or her 
financial hardship, the Department may--
    (i) Adjust the installment schedule if the individual shows that it 
would cause him or her financial hardship to make payments at the rate 
initially scheduled by the Department; or
    (ii) Terminate the collection action under 31 CFR 903.3 if the costs 
of collecting the debt are anticipated to exceed the amount recoverable.


<R05>
Sec. 29.522  Fault.

    (a) General rule. A debtor is considered to be at fault if he or 
she, or any

[[Page 334]]

other person having an interest in obtaining a waiver of the claim, 
caused or contributed to the accrual of the overpayment. The Department 
considers a debtor or any other person having an interest in obtaining a 
waiver of the claim to have caused or contributed to the accrual of an 
overpayment if--
    (1) Payment resulted from the individual's incorrect but not 
fraudulent statement, which the individual knew or should have known to 
be incorrect; or
    (2) Payment resulted from the individual's failure to disclose facts 
in his or her possession which the individual knew or should have known 
were material, when the Department has identified that the individual 
has a duty to report and has clearly notified the individual of this 
reporting requirement.
    (3) The following factors may affect the decision as to whether the 
debtor is or is not at fault where the debtor submitted an incorrect 
statement, or the debtor failed to disclose material facts in his or her 
possession--
    (i) The debtor's age;
    (ii) The debtor's physical and/or mental condition; and
    (iii) The availability and nature of the information provided to the 
debtor by the Department.
    (b) Knowledge of an overpayment. (1) Individuals who are aware that 
they are not entitled to a payment or are aware that a payment is higher 
than the payment to which they are entitled are not considered to have 
contributed to the overpayment if they promptly contact the Benefits 
Administrator and question the correctness of the payment and take no 
further action in reliance of the overpayment.
    (2) Any contact made with the Benefits Administrator concerning the 
overpayment within 60 days of receipt (if the overpayment is a recurring 
payment, contact must be made within 60 days of the initial payment) 
will satisfy the prompt notification requirement.
    (c) Reasonable person standard. The Department will use a reasonable 
person standard to determine whether an individual should have known 
that a statement was incorrect or that material facts in the 
individual's possession should have been disclosed. The reasonable 
person standard will take into account the objective factors set forth 
is paragraph (a)(3) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 29.523  Equity and good conscience.

    Recovery is against equity and good conscience when there is 
substantial evidence that--
    (a) It would cause financial hardship to the person from whom it is 
sought no matter what the amount and length of the proposed installment;
    (b) The recipient of the overpayment can show (regardless of his or 
her financial circumstances) that due to the notice that such payment 
would be made or because of the incorrect payment he or she either has 
relinquished a valuable right or has changed positions for the worse; or
    (c) Recovery would be unconscionable under the circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 29.524  Financial hardship.

    Financial hardship may be deemed to exist when the debtor needs 
substantially all of his or her current and anticipated income and 
liquid assets to meet current and anticipated ordinary and necessary 
living expenses during the projected period of collection. Financial 
hardship will not be found to exist when the debtor merely establishes 
that the repayment causes a financial burden, i.e., when it is 
inconvenient to repay the debt. If there are anticipated changes in 
income or expenses that would allow for the recovery of the overpayment 
at a later date, the Department may suspend collection action until a 
future date.
    (a) Considerations. Pertinent considerations in determining whether 
recovery would cause financial hardship include the following:
    (1) The debtor's financial ability to pay at the time collection is 
scheduled to be made, and
    (2) Income to other family member(s), if such member's ordinary and 
necessary living expenses are included in expenses reported by the 
debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 29.525  Ordinary and necessary living expenses.

    An individual's ordinary and necessary living expenses include rent, 
mortgage payments, utilities, maintenance, transportation, food, 
clothing,

[[Page 335]]

insurance (life, health, and accident), taxes, installment payments for 
which the individual is already liable, medical expenses, support 
expenses for which the individual is legally responsible, and other 
miscellaneous expenses that the individual can establish as being 
ordinary and necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 29.526  Waiver precluded.

    Waivers will not be offered or granted when--
    (1) The overpayment was obtained by fraud, misrepresentation, or by 
improper negotiation of checks or withdrawal of electronic fund transfer 
payments after the death of the payee; or
    (2) The overpayment was made to an estate and a timely demand for 
repayment is made prior to the final disbursement by the administrator 
or executor of the estate.

[68 FR 41264, July 11, 2003.]


<R05>
Sec. 50.4  Mandatory participation in Program.

    Any entity that meets the definition of an insurer under the Act is 
required to participate in the Program.


<R05>
Sec. 50.5  Definitions.

    For purposes of this Part:
    (a) Act means the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002.
    (b) Act of terrorism--(1) In general. The term act of terrorism 
means any act that is certified by the Secretary, in concurrence with 
the Secretary of State and the Attorney General of the United States:
    (i) To be an act of terrorism;
    (ii) To be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, 
property, or infrastructure;
    (iii) To have resulted in damage within the United States, or 
outside of the United States in the case of:
    (A) An air carrier (as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102) or a United 
States flag vessel (or a vessel based principally in the United States, 
on which United States income tax is paid and whose insurance coverage 
is subject to regulation in the United States); or
    (B) The premises of a United States mission; and
    (iv) To have been committed by an individual or individuals acting 
on behalf of any foreign person or foreign interest, as part of an 
effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to 
influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States 
Government by coercion.
    (2) Limitations. The Secretary is not authorized to certify an act 
as an act of terrorism if:
    (i) The act is committed as part of the course of a war declared by 
the Congress (except with respect to any coverage for workers' 
compensation); or
    (ii) property and casualty losses resulting from the act, in the 
aggregate, do not exceed $5,000,000.
    (3) Judicial review precluded. The Secretary's certification of an 
act of terrorism, or determination not to certify an act as an act of 
terrorism, is final and is not subject to judicial review.
    (c)(1) Affiliate means, with respect to an insurer, any entity that 
controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the insurer. 
An affiliate must itself meet the definition of insurer to participate 
in the Program.
    (2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, an insurer has 
control over another insurer for purposes of the Program if:
    (i) The insurer directly or indirectly or acting through one or more 
other persons owns, controls, or has power to vote 25 percent or more of 
any class of voting securities of the other insurer;
    (ii) The insurer controls in any manner the election of a majority 
of the directors or trustees of the other insurer; or
    (iii) The Secretary determines, after notice and opportunity for 
hearing, that an insurer directly or indirectly exercises a controlling 
influence over the management or policies of the other insurer, even if 
there is no control as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (c)(2)(ii) of 
this section.
    (3) An insurer described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (c)(2)(ii) of 
this section is conclusively deemed to have control.
    (4) For purposes of a determination of controlling influence under 
paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, if an insurer is not described in 
paragraph (c)(2)(i) or

[[Page 337]]

(c)(2)(ii) of this section, the following rebuttable presumptions will 
apply:
    (i) If an insurer controls another insurer under any State law, and 
at least one of the factors listed in paragraph (c) (4)(iv) of this 
section applies, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insurer that 
has control under State law exercises a controlling influence over the 
management or policies of the other insurer for purposes of paragraph 
(c)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (ii) If an insurer provides 25 percent or more of another insurer's 
capital (in the case of a stock insurer), policyholder surplus (in the 
case of a mutual insurer), or corporate capital (in the case of other 
entities that qualify as insurers), and at least one of the factors 
listed in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section applies, there is a 
rebuttable presumption that the insurer providing such capital, 
policyholder surplus, or corporate capital exercises a controlling 
influence over the management or policies of the receiving insurer for 
purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (iii) If an insurer, at any time during a Program Year, supplies 25 
percent or more of the underwriting capacity for that year to an insurer 
that is a syndicate consisting of a group including incorporated and 
individual unincorporated underwriters, and at least one of the factors 
in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section applies, there is a rebuttable 
presumption that the insurer exercises a controlling influence over the 
syndicate for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (iv) If paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section are 
not applicable, but two or more of the following factors apply to an 
insurer, with respect to another insurer, there is a rebuttable 
presumption that the insurer exercises a controlling influence over the 
management or policies of the other insurer for purposes of paragraph 
(c)(2)(iii) of this section:
    (A) The insurer is one of the two largest shareholders of any class 
of voting stock;
    (B) The insurer holds more than 35 percent of the combined debt 
securities and equity of the other insurer;
    (C) The insurer is party to an agreement pursuant to which the 
insurer possesses a material economic stake in the other insurer 
resulting from a profit-sharing arrangement, use of common names, 
facilities or personnel, or the provision of essential services to the 
other insurer;
    (D) The insurer is party to an agreement that enables the insurer to 
influence a material aspect of the management or policies of the other 
insurer;
    (E) The insurer would have the ability, other than through the 
holding of revocable proxies, to direct the votes of more than 25 
percent of the other insurer's voting stock in the future upon the 
occurrence of an event;
    (F) The insurer has the power to direct the disposition of more than 
25 percent of a class of voting stock of the other insurer in a manner 
other than a widely dispersed or public offering;
    (G) The insurer and/or the insurer's representative or nominee 
constitute more than one member of the other insurer's board of 
directors; or
    (H) The insurer or its nominee or an officer of the insurer serves 
as the chairman of the board, chairman of the executive committee, chief 
executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer or 
in any position with similar policymaking authority in the other 
insurer.
    (5) An insurer that is not described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) or 
(c)(2)(ii) of this section may request a hearing in which the insurer 
may rebut a presumption of controlling influence under paragraph 
(c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iv) of this section or otherwise request a 
determination of controlling influence by presenting and supporting its 
position through written submissions to Treasury, and in Treasury's 
discretion, through informal oral presentations, in accordance with the 
procedure in Sec. 50.8.
    (6) See Sec. 50.55 of this part for determination of an insurer's 
affiliates for purposes of subpart F.
    (d) Direct earned premium means a direct earned premium for all 
commercial property and casualty insurance issued by any insurer for 
insurance against all losses, including losses from an act of terrorism, 
occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the 
Act.

[[Page 338]]

    (1) State licensed or admitted insurers. For a State licensed or 
admitted insurer that reports to the NAIC, direct earned premium is the 
premium information for commercial property and casualty insurance 
coverage reported by the insurer on column 2 of the NAIC Exhibit of 
Premiums and Losses of the NAIC Annual Statement (commonly known as 
Statutory Page 14). (See definition of property and casualty insurance.)
    (i) Premium information as reported to the NAIC should be included 
in the calculation of direct earned premiums for purposes of the Program 
only to the extent of commercial property and casualty coverage issued 
by the insurer against losses occurring at the locations described in 
section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act.
    (ii) Premiums for personal property and casualty insurance coverage 
(coverage primarily designed to cover personal, family or household risk 
exposures, with the exception of coverage written to insure 1 to 4 
family rental dwellings owned for the business purpose of generating 
income for the property owner), or premiums for any other insurance 
coverage that does not meet the definition of commercial property and 
casualty insurance, should be excluded in the calculation of direct 
earned premiums for purposes of the Program.
    (iii) Personal property and casualty insurance coverage that 
includes incidental coverage for commercial purposes is primarily 
personal coverage, and therefore premiums may be fully excluded by an 
insurer from the calculation of direct earned premium. For purposes of 
the Program, commercial coverage is incidental if less than 25 percent 
of the total direct earned premium is attributable to commercial 
coverage. Commercial property and casualty insurance coverage insuring 
against losses occurring at locations other than the locations described 
in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act, or other insurance coverage 
that does not meet the definition of commercial property and casualty 
insurance, but that includes incidental coverage for commercial property 
and casualty insurance insuring against losses occurring at such 
locations, is primarily non-Program coverage, and therefore premiums 
also may be fully excluded by an insurer from the calculation of direct 
earned premium. For purposes of the Program, commercial property and 
casualty insurance coverage insuring against losses at the locations 
described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act is incidental if less 
than 25 percent of the total direct earned premium is attributable to 
such coverage. For purposes of the Program, commercial coverage combined 
with coverages that otherwise do not meet the definition of commercial 
property and casualty insurance is incidental if less than 25 percent of 
the total direct earned premium is for such coverage.
    (iv) If a property and casualty insurance policy covers both 
commercial and personal risk exposures, insurers may allocate the 
premiums in accordance with the proportion of risk between commercial 
and personal components in order to ascertain direct earned premium. If 
a policy includes insurance coverage that meets the definition of 
commercial property and casualty insurance for losses occurring at the 
locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act, but also 
includes other coverage, insurers may allocate the premiums in 
accordance with the proportion of risk attributable to the components, 
in order to ascertain direct earned premium.
    (2) Insurers that do not report to NAIC. An insurer that does not 
report to the NAIC, but that is licensed or admitted by any State (such 
as certain farm or county mutual insurers), should use the guidance 
provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to assist in ascertaining 
its direct earned premium.
    (i) Direct earned premium may be ascertained by adjusting data 
maintained by such insurer or reported by such insurer to its State 
regulator to reflect a breakdown of premiums for commercial and personal 
property and casualty exposure risk as described in paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section and, if necessary, re-stated to reflect the accrual method 
of determining direct earned premium versus direct premium.

[[Page 339]]

    (ii) Such an insurer should consider other types of payments that 
compensate the insurer for risk of loss (contributions, assessments, 
etc.) as part of its direct earned premium.
    (3) Certain eligible surplus line carrier insurers. An eligible 
surplus line carrier insurer listed on the NAIC Quarterly Listing of 
Alien Insurers must ascertain its direct earned premium as follows:
    (i) For policies that were in-force as of November 26, 2002, or 
entered into prior to January 1, 2003, direct earned premiums are to be 
determined with reference to the definition of property and casualty 
insurance and the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of 
the Act by allocating the appropriate portion of premium income for 
losses for property and casualty insurance at such locations. The same 
allocation methodologies contained within the NAIC's ``Allocation of 
Surplus Lines and Independently Procured Insurance Premium Tax on Multi-
State Risks Model Regulation'' for allocating premium between coverage 
for property and casualty insurance for losses occurring at the 
locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act and all 
other coverage, to ascertain the appropriate percentage of premium 
income to be included in direct earned premium, may be used.
    (ii) For policies issued after January 1, 2003, premium for 
insurance that meets the definition of property and casualty insurance 
for losses occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and 
(B) of the Act, must be priced separately by such eligible surplus line 
carriers.
    (4) Federally approved insurers. A federally approved insurer under 
section 102(6)(A)(iii) of the Act should use a methodology similar to 
that specified for eligible surplus line carrier insurers in paragraph 
(d)(3) of this section to calculate its direct earned premium. Such 
calculation should be adjusted to reflect the limitations on scope of 
insurance coverage under the Program (i.e. to the extent of federal 
approval of commercial property and casualty insurance in connection 
with maritime, energy or aviation activities).
    (e) Insured loss. (1) The term insured loss means any loss resulting 
from an act of terrorism (including an act of war, in the case of 
workers' compensation) that is covered by primary or excess property and 
casualty insurance issued by an insurer if the loss:
    (i) Occurs within the United States;
    (ii) Occurs to an air carrier (as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102), to a 
United States flag vessel (or a vessel based principally in the United 
States, on which United States income tax is paid and whose insurance 
coverage is subject to regulation in the United States), regardless of 
where the loss occurs; or
    (iii) Occurs at the premises of any United States mission.
    (2)(i) A loss that occurs to an air carrier (as defined in 49 U.S.C. 
40102), to a United States flag vessel, or a vessel based principally in 
the United States, on which United States income tax is paid and whose 
insurance coverage is subject to regulation in the United States, is not 
an insured loss under section 102(5)(B) of the Act unless it is incurred 
by the air carrier or vessel outside the United States.
    (ii) An insured loss to an air carrier or vessel outside the United 
States under section 102(5)(B) of the Act does not include losses 
covered by third party insurance contracts that are separate from the 
insurance coverage provided to the air carrier or vessel.
    (3) The term insured loss includes reasonable loss adjustment 
expenses, incurred by an insurer in connection with insured losses, that 
are allocated and identified by claim file in insurer records, including 
expenses incurred in the investigation, adjustment and defense of 
claims, but excluding staff salaries, overhead, and other insurer 
expenses that would have been incurred notwithstanding the insured loss.
    (4) The term insured loss does not include:
    (i) Punitive or exemplary damages awarded or paid in connection with 
the Federal cause of action specified in section 107(a)(1) of the Act. 
The term ``punitive or exemplary damages'' means damages that are not 
compensatory but are an award of money made to a claimant solely to 
punish or deter; or
    (ii) Extra contractual damages awarded against, or paid by, an 
insurer; or

[[Page 340]]

    (iii) Payments by an insurer in excess of policy limits.
    (f) Insurer means any entity, including any affiliate of the entity, 
that meets the following requirements:
    (1)(i) The entity must fall within at least one of the following

influence.

    (a) An insurer or insurers not having control over another insurer 
under Sec. 50.5(c)(2)(i) or (c)(2)(ii) may make a written submission to 
Treasury to rebut a presumption of controlling influence under Sec. 
50.5(c)(4)(i) through (iv) or otherwise to request a determination of 
controlling influence. Such submissions shall be made to the Terrorism 
Risk Insurance Program Office, Department of the Treasury, Suite 2110, 
1425 New York Ave NW, Washington, D.C. 20220. The submission should be 
entitled, ``Controlling Influence Submission,'' and should provide the 
full name and address of the submitting insurer(s) and the name, title, 
address and telephone number of the designated contact person(s) for 
such insurer(s).
    (b) Treasury will review submissions and determine whether Treasury 
needs additional written or orally presented information. In its 
discretion, Treasury may schedule a date, time and place for an oral 
presentation by the insurer(s).

[[Page 343]]

    (c) An insurer or insurers must provide all relevant facts and 
circumstances concerning the relationship(s) between or among the 
affected insurers and the control factors in Sec. 50.5(c)(4)(i) through 
(iv); and must explain in detail any basis for why the insurer believes 
that no controlling influence exists (if a presumption is being 
rebutted) in light of the particular facts and circumstances, as well as 
the Act's language, structure and purpose. Any confidential business or 
trade secret information submitted to Treasury should be clearly marked. 
Treasury will handle any subsequent request for information designated 
by an insurer as confidential business or trade secret information in 
accordance with Treasury's Freedom of Information Act regulations at 31 
C.F.R. Part 1.
    (d) Treasury will review and consider the insurer submission and 
other relevant facts and circumstances. Unless otherwise extended by 
Treasury, within 60 days after receipt of a complete submission, 
including any additional information requested by Treasury, and 
including any oral presentation, Treasury will issue a final 
determination of whether one insurer has a controlling influence over 
another insurer for purposes of the Program. The determination shall set 
forth Treasury's basis for its determination.
    (e) This Sec. 50.8 supersedes the Interim Guidance issued by 
Treasury in a notice published on March 27, 2003 (68 FR 15039).

<R05>
Sec. 50.10  General disclosure requirements.

    (a) All policies. As a condition for federal payments under section 
103(b) of the Act, the Act requires that an insurer provide clear and 
conspicuous disclosure to the policyholder of:
    (1) The premium charged for insured losses covered by the Program; 
and
    (2) The federal share of compensation for insured losses under the 
Program.
    (b) Policies in force on the date of enactment. For policies issued 
before November 26, 2002, the disclosure required by the Act must be 
provided within 90 days of November 26, 2002 (no later than February 24, 
2003).
    (c) Policies issued within 90 days of the date of enactment. For 
policies issued within the 90-day period beginning on November 26, 2002 
through February 24, 2003, the disclosure required by the Act must be 
provided at the time of offer, purchase, and renewal of the policy.

<R05>
Sec. 50.11  Definition.

    Except as provided in Sec. 50.18, for purposes of this subpart the 
term ``disclosure'' or ``disclosures'' refers to the disclosures 
described in section 103(b)(2) of the Act and Sec. 50.10.


<R05>
Sec. 50.12  Clear and conspicuous disclosure.

    (a) General. Whether a disclosure is clear and conspicuous depends 
on the totality of the facts and circumstances of the disclosure. See 
Sec. 50.17 for model forms.
    (b) Description of premium. An insurer may describe the premium 
charged for insured losses covered by the Program as a portion or 
percentage of an annual premium, if consistent with standard business 
practice. An insurer may not describe the premium in a manner that is 
misleading in the context of the Program, such as by characterizing the 
premium as a ``surcharge.''
    (c) Method of disclosure. An insurer may provide disclosures using 
normal business practices, including forms and methods of communication 
used to communicate similar policyholder information to policyholders.
    (d) Use of producer. If an insurer normally communicates with a 
policyholder through an insurance producer or other intermediary, an 
insurer may provide disclosures through such producer or other 
intermediary. If an insurer elects to make the disclosures through an 
insurance producer or other intermediary, the insurer remains 
responsible for ensuring that the disclosures are provided by the 
insurance producer or other intermediary to policyholders in accordance 
with the Act.
    (e) Demonstration of compliance. (1) An insurer may demonstrate that 
it has satisfied the requirement to provide clear and conspicuous 
disclosure as described in Sec. 50.10 through use of appropriate 
systems and normal business practices that demonstrate a practice of 
compliance.
    (2) If an insurer made available coverage for insured losses in a 
new policy or policy renewal in Program Year 3 for coverage becoming 
effective in Program Year 4, but did not provide a disclosure at the 
time of offer, purchase or renewal, then the insurer must be able to 
demonstrate to Treasury's satisfaction that it has provided a disclosure 
as soon as possible following January 1, 2006.
    (f) Certification of compliance. An insurer must certify that it has 
complied with the requirement to provide disclosure to the policyholder 
on all policies that form the basis for any claim that is submitted by 
an insurer for federal payment under the Program.

<R05>
Sec. 50.13  Offer, purchase, and renewal.

    An insurer is deemed to be in compliance with the requirement of 
providing disclosure ``at the time of offer, purchase, and renewal of 
the policy'' under Sec. 50.10(c) and (d) if the insurer:
    (a) Makes the disclosure no later than the time the insurer first 
formally offers to provide insurance coverage or renew a policy for a 
current policyholder; and
    (b) Makes clear and conspicuous reference back to that disclosure, 
as well as the final terms of terrorism insurance coverage, at the time 
the transaction is completed.


<R05>
Sec. 50.14  Separate line item.

    An insurer is deemed to be in compliance with the requirement of 
providing disclosure on a ``separate line item in the policy'' under 
Sec. 50.10(d) if the insurer makes the disclosure:
    (a) On the declarations page of the policy;
    (b) Elsewhere within the policy itself; or
    (c) In any rider or endorsement, or other document that is made a 
part of the policy.

[68 FR 59727, Oct. 17, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 50.17  Use of model forms.

    (a) Policies in force on the date of enactment. (1) An insurer that 
is required to make the disclosure under Sec. 50.10(b)

[[Page 345]]

and that makes no change in the existing premium, is deemed to be in 
compliance with the disclosure requirement if it uses NAIC Model 
Disclosure Form No. 2.
    (2) An insurer that is required to make the disclosure under Sec. 
50.10(b) and that makes a change in the existing premium, is deemed to 
be in compliance with the disclosure requirement if it uses NAIC Model 
Disclosure Form No. 1. Such an insurer may also use the same NAIC Model 
Disclosure Form No. 1 to comply with the disclosure requirement of 
section 105(c) of the Act. See Sec. 50.18.
    (b) Policies issued within 90 days of the date of enactment. An 
insurer that is required to make the disclosure under Sec. 50.10(c) is 
deemed to be in compliance with the disclosure requirement if it uses 
either NAIC Model Disclosure Form No. 1 or NAIC Model Disclosure Form 
No. 2, as long as the form used is modified as appropriate for the 
particular policy.
    (c) Policies issued more than 90 days after the date of enactment. 
An insurer that is required to make the disclosure under Sec. 50.10(d) 
may continue to use NAIC Model Disclosure Form No. 1 or NAIC Model 
Disclosure Form No. 2 if appropriate, or other disclosures that meet the 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 50.10(a) and 50.14 may be developed.
    (d) Not exclusive means of compliance. An insurer is not required to 
use NAIC Model Disclosure Form No. 1 or NAIC Model Disclosure Form No. 2 
to satisfy the disclosure requirement. An insurer may use other means to 
comply with the disclosure requirement, as long as the disclosure 
comports with the requirements of the Act.
    (e) Definitions. For purposes of this section, references to NAIC 
Model Disclosure Form No. 1 and NAIC Model Disclosure Form No. 2 refer 
to such forms as were in existence on April 18, 2003, or as subsequently 
modified by the NAIC, provided Treasury has stated that usage by 
insurers of the subsequently modified forms is deemed to satisfy the 
disclosure requirements of the Act and the insurer uses the most current 
forms that are available at the time of disclosure. These forms may be 
found on the Treasury Web site at http://www.treasury.gov/trip.

Sec. 50.18  Disclosure required by reinstatement provision.

    (a) Nullification of terrorism exclusion. Any terrorism exclusion in 
a contract for property and casualty insurance that was in force on 
November 26, 2002, is void to the extent it excludes losses that would 
otherwise be insured losses.
    (b) Reinstatement of terrorism exclusion. Notwithstanding paragraph 
(a) of this section, an insurer may reinstate a preexisting provision in 
a contract for property and casualty insurance that was in force on 
November 26, 2002, and that excludes coverage for an act of terrorism 
only if:
    (1) The insurer has received a written statement from the insured 
that affirmatively authorizes such reinstatement; or
    (2) The insurer provided notice at least 30 days before any such 
reinstatement of the increased premium for such terrorism coverage and 
the rights of the insured with respect to such coverage, including the 
date upon which the exclusion would be reinstated if no payment is 
received, and the insured fails to pay any increased premium charged by 
the insurer for providing such terrorism coverage.

or before January 15, 2004. For policies in force on October 17, 2003, 
or renewed or issued on or before January 15, 2004, the disclosure 
required by section 103(b) of the Act as a condition for Federal payment 
is waived for those State residual market insurance entities and State 
workers' compensation funds that since November 26, 2002, have not 
provided disclosures to policyholders, until January 15, 2004, after 
which disclosures are to be made to policyholders for policies then in 
force and subsequently issued.

[[Page 346]]

    (b) Residual Market Mechanism Disclosure. A State residual market 
insurance entity or State workers' compensation fund may provide the 
disclosures required by this subpart B to policyholders using normal 
business practices, including forms and methods of communication used to 
communicate similar policyholder information to policyholders. The 
disclosures may be made by the State residual market insurance entity or 
State workers' compensation fund itself, the individual insurers that 
participate in the State residual market insurance entity or a State 
workers' compensation fund, or its servicing carriers. The ultimate 
responsibility for ensuring that the disclosure requirements have been 
met rests with the insurer filing a claim under the Program.
    (c) Other requirements. Except as provided in this section, all 
other disclosure requirements set out in this subpart B apply to State 
residual insurance market entities and State workers' compensation 
funds.
    (d) Prior safe harbor superseded. This section supersedes the 
disclosure safe harbor provisions found at paragraph C.4 of the Interim

Sec. 50.21  Make available.

    (a) General. The requirement to make available coverage as provided 
in Sec. 50.20 applies to policies in existence on November 26, 2002, 
new policies issued and renewals of existing policies during the period 
beginning on November 26, 2002 and ending on December 31, 2004 (the last 
day of Program Year 2), and to new policies issued and renewals of 
existing policies in Program Years 3 through 5 (calendar years 2005 
through 2007). Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the 
requirement applies at the time an insurer makes the initial offer of 
coverage as well as at the time an insurer makes an initial offer of 
renewal of an existing policy.
    (b) Special Program Year 4 requirement for certain new policies 
issued and renewals of existing policies in Program Year 3. If coverage 
for insured losses under a policy of property and casualty insurance (as 
defined by the Act, as amended) expired as of December 31, 2005, but the 
remainder of coverage under the policy continued in force in Program 
Year 4, then an insurer must make available coverage as provided in 
Sec. 50.20 for insured losses for the remaining portion of the policy 
term in the manner specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and

[[Page 347]]

(d)(2) of this section. This requirement does not apply if during 
Program Year 3 a policyholder declined an offer of coverage for insured 
losses made at the time of the initial offer of coverage or offer of 
renewal of the existing policy.
    (c) Changes negotiated subsequent to initial offer. If an insurer 
satisfies the requirement to ``make available'' coverage as described in 
Sec. 50.20 by first making an offer with coverage for insured losses 
that does not differ materially from the terms, amounts, and other 
coverage limitations applicable to losses arising from events other than 
acts of terrorism, which the policyholder declines, the insurer may 
negotiate with the policyholder an option of partial coverage for 
insured losses at a lower amount of coverage if permitted by any 
applicable State law. An insurer is not required by the Act to offer 
partial coverage if the policyholder declines full coverage. See Sec. 
50.24.
    (d) Demonstrations of compliance. (1) If an insurer makes an offer 
of insurance but no contract of insurance is concluded, the insurer may 
demonstrate that it has satisfied the requirement to make available 
coverage as described in Sec. 50.20 through use of appropriate systems 
and normal business practices that demonstrate a practice of compliance.
    (2) If an insurer must make available coverage for insured losses as 
required by paragraph (b) of this section for a policy whose coverage 
period began in Program Year 3 but extends into Program Year 4, then the 
insurer must be able to demonstrate to Treasury's satisfaction that it 
has offered such coverage by January 1, 2006, or as soon as possible 
following that date.
    (3) If an insurer processed a new policy or policy renewal in 
Program Year 3 for coverage becoming effective in Program Year 4, but 
did not make available coverage for insured losses as required by Sec. 
50.20 by January 1, 2006, then the insurer must be able to demonstrate 
to Treasury's satisfaction that it has provided an offer of coverage for 
insured losses as soon as possible following that date.

[71 FR 27570, May 11, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 50.23  No material difference from other coverage.

    (a) Terms, amounts, and other coverage limitations. As provided in 
Sec. 50.20(a)(2), an insurer must offer coverage for insured losses 
resulting from an act of terrorism that does not differ materially from 
the terms, amounts, and other coverage limitations (including 
deductibles) applicable to losses from other perils. For purposes of 
this requirement, ``terms'' excludes price.
    (b) Limitations on types of risk. If an insurer does not cover all 
types of risks, then it is not required to cover the excluded risks in 
satisfying the requirement to make available coverage for losses 
resulting from an act of terrorism that does not differ materially from 
the terms, amounts, and other coverage limitations applicable to losses 
arising from events other than acts of terrorism. For example, if an 
insurer does not cover all types of risks, either because the insurer is 
outside of direct State regulatory oversight, or because a State permits 
certain exclusions for certain types of losses, such as nuclear, 
biological, or chemical events, then the insurer is not required to make 
such coverage available.


<R05>
Sec. 50.24  Applicability of State law requirements.

    (a) General. After satisfying the requirement to make available 
coverage for insured losses that does not differ materially from the 
terms, amounts, and other coverage limitations applicable to losses 
arising from events other than acts of terrorism, if coverage is 
rejected an insurer may then offer coverage that is on different terms, 
amounts, or coverage limitations, as long as such an offer does not 
violate any applicable State law requirements.
    (b) Examples. (1) If an insurer subject to State regulation first 
makes available coverage in accordance with Sec. 50.20 and the State 
has a requirement that an insurer offer full coverage without any 
exclusion, then the requirement would continue to apply and the insurer 
may not subsequently offer less than full coverage or coverage with 
exclusions.
    (2) If an insurer subject to State regulation first makes available 
coverage

[[Page 348]]

in accordance with Sec. 50.20 and the State permits certain exclusions 
or allows for other limitations, or an insurance policy is not governed 
by State law requirements, then the insurer may subsequently offer 
limited coverage or coverage with exclusions.

    (a) Treatment. A State residual market insurance entity or a State 
workers' compensation fund that does not share profits and losses with a 
private sector insurer is deemed to be a separate insurer under the 
Program.
    (b) Premium calculation. A State residual market insurance entity or 
a State workers' compensation fund that is deemed to be a separate 
insurer should follow the guidelines specified in Sec. 50.5(d)(1) or

    (a) Treatment. A State residual market insurance entity or a State 
workers' compensation fund that shares profits and losses with a private 
sector insurer is not deemed to be a separate insurer under the Program.
    (b) Premium and loss calculation. A State residual market insurance 
entity or a State workers' compensation fund that is not deemed to be a 
separate insurer should continue to report, in accordance with normal 
business practices, to each participant insurer its share of premium 
income and insured losses, which shall then be included respectively in 
the participant insurer's direct earned premium or insured loss 
calculations.

Sec. 50.36  Allocation of premium income associated with entities that 
do share profits and losses with private sector insurers.

    (a) Servicing Carriers. For purposes of this Subpart, a servicing 
carrier is an insurer that enters into an agreement to place and service 
insurance contracts for a State residual market insurance entity or a 
State workers' compensation fund and to cede premiums associated with 
such insurance contracts to the State residual market insurance entity 
or State workers' compensation fund. Premiums written by a servicing 
carrier on behalf of a State residual market insurance entity or State 
workers' compensation fund that are ceded to such an entity or fund 
shall not be included as direct earned premium (as described in Sec. 
50.5(d)(1) or 50.5(d)(2)) of the servicing carrier.
    (b) Participant Insurers. For purposes of this Subpart, a 
participant insurer is an insurer that shares in the profits and losses 
of a State residual market insurance entity or a State workers' 
compensation fund. Premium income that is distributed to or assumed by 
participant insurers in a State residual market insurance entity or 
State workers' compensation fund (whether directly or as quota share 
insurers of risks written by servicing carriers),

[[Page 349]]

shall be included in direct earned premium (as described in Sec.

Sec. 50.50  Federal share of compensation.

    (a) General. (1) The Treasury will pay the Federal share of 
compensation for insured losses as provided in section 103 of the Act 
once a Certification of Loss required by Sec. 50.53 is deemed 
sufficient. The Federal share of compensation under the Program shall 
be:
    (i) 90 percent of that portion of the insurer's aggregate insured 
losses that exceed its insurer deductible during each Program Year 
through Program Year 4, and
    (ii) 85 percent of that portion of the insurer's aggregate insured 
losses that exceed its insurer deductible during Program Year 5.
    (2) The percentages in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) are both 
subject to any adjustments in Sec. 50.51 and the cap of $100 billion as 
provided in section 103(e)(2) of the Act.
    (b) Program Trigger amounts. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) or 
anything in this Subpart to the contrary, no Federal share of 
compensation will be paid by Treasury unless the aggregate industry 
insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism occurring 
after March 31, 2006 exceed the following amounts:
    (1) For a certified act of terrorism occurring after March 31, 2006 
and before January 1, 2007: $50 million;
    (2) For a certified act of terrorism occurring in calendar year 
2007: $100 million.
    (c) Insured losses after March 31, 2006. For all purposes of subpart 
F, insured loss or insured losses or aggregate insured losses resulting 
from acts of terrorism after March 31, 2006 shall be limited to those 
insured losses resulting from Program Trigger events.
    (d) Conditions for payment of Federal share. Subject to paragraph 
(e) of this section, Treasury shall pay the appropriate amount of the 
Federal share of compensation to an insurer upon a determination that:
    (1) The insurer is an entity, including an affiliate thereof, that 
meets the requirements of Sec. 50.5(f);
    (2) The insurer's insured losses, as defined in Sec. 50.5(e) and 
limited by Sec. 50.50(c) (including the allocated dollar value of the 
insurer's proportionate share of insured losses from a State residual 
market insurance entity or State workers' compensation fund as described 
in Sec. 50.35), have exceeded its insurer deductible as defined in 
Sec. 50.5(g);
    (3) The insurer has paid or is prepared to pay an underlying insured 
loss, based on a filed claim for the insured loss;
    (4) Neither the insurer's claim for Federal payment nor any 
underlying claim for an insured loss is fraudulent, collusive, made in 
bad faith, dishonest or otherwise designed to circumvent the purposes of 
the Act and regulations;
    (5) The insurer had provided a clear and conspicuous disclosure as 
required by Sec. Sec. 50.10 through 50.19;
    (6) The insurer offered coverage for insured losses and the offer 
was accepted by the insured prior to the occurrence of the loss;
    (7) The insurer took all steps reasonably necessary to properly and 
carefully investigate the underlying insured loss and otherwise 
processed the underlying insured loss using appropriate insurance 
business practices;
    (8) The insured losses submitted for payment are within the scope of 
coverage issued by the insurer under the terms and conditions of the 
policies for commercial property and casualty insurance as defined in 
Sec. 50.5(n); and
    (9) The procedures specified in this Subpart have been followed and 
all conditions for payment have been met.
    (e) Adjustments. Treasury may subsequently adjust, including 
requiring repayment of, any payment made under paragraph (d) of this 
section in accordance with its authority under the Act.
    (f) Suspension of payment for other insured losses. Upon a 
determination by Treasury that an insurer has failed to meet any of the 
requirements for payment specified in paragraph (d) of this section for 
a particular insured loss, Treasury may suspend payment of the

[[Page 350]]

Federal share of compensation for all other insured losses of the 
insurer pending investigation and audit of the insurer's insured losses.
    (g) Aggregate industry losses. Treasury will determine the amount of 
aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a certified act of 
terrorism. If such aggregate industry insured losses exceed the 
applicable Program Trigger amounts specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section, Treasury will publish notice in the Federal Register that the 
act of terrorism is a Program Trigger event.

[71 FR 27571, May 11, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 50.51  Adjustments to the Federal share of compensation.

    (a) Aggregate amount of insured losses. The aggregate amount of 
insured losses of an insurer in a Program Year used to calculate the 
Federal share of compensation shall be reduced by any amounts recovered 
by the insurer as salvage or subrogation for its insured losses in the 
Program Year.
    (b) Amount of Federal share of compensation. The Federal share of 
compensation shall be adjusted as follows:
    (1) No excess recoveries. For any Program Year, the sum of the 
Federal share of compensation paid by Treasury to an insurer and the 
insurer's recoveries for insured losses from other sources shall not be 
greater than the insurer's aggregate amount of insured losses for acts 
of terrorism in that Program Year. Amounts recovered for insured losses 
in excess of an insurer's aggregate amount of insured losses in a 
Program Year shall be repaid to Treasury within 45 days after the end of 
the month in which total recoveries of the insurer, from all sources, 
become excess. For purposes of this paragraph, amounts recovered from a 
reinsurer pursuant to an agreement whereby the reinsurer's right to any 
excess recovery has priority over the rights of Treasury shall not be 
considered a recovery subject to repayment to Treasury.
    (2) Reduction of amount payable. The Federal share of compensation 
for insured losses under the Program shall be reduced by the amount of 
other compensation provided by other Federal programs to an insured or a 
third party to the extent such other compensation duplicates the 
insurance indemnification for those insured losses.
    (i) Other Federal program compensation. For purposes of this 
section, compensation provided by other Federal programs for insured 
losses means compensation that is provided by Federal programs 
established for the purpose of compensating persons for losses in the 
event of emergencies, disasters, acts of terrorism, or similar events. 
Compensation provided by Federal programs for insured losses excludes 
benefit or entitlement payments, such as those made under the Social 
Security Act, under laws administered by the Secretary of Veteran 
Affairs, railroad retirement benefit payments, and other similar types 
of benefit payments.
    (ii) Insurer due diligence. Each insurer shall inquire of each of 
its policyholders, insureds, and claimants whether the person receiving 
insurance proceeds for an insured loss has received, expects to receive, 
or is entitled to receive compensation from another Federal program for 
the insured loss, and if so, the source and the amount of the 
compensation received or expected. The response, source, and such 
amounts shall be reported with each underlying claim on the bordereau 
specified in Sec. 50.53(b)(1).


<R05>
Sec. 50.52  Initial Notice of Insured Loss.

    Each insurer shall submit to Treasury an Initial Notice of Insured 
Loss, on a form prescribed by Treasury, whenever the insurer's aggregate 
insured losses (including reserves for ``incurred but not reported'' 
losses) within a Program Year exceed an amount equal to 50 percent of 
the insurer's deductible as specified in Sec. 50.5(g). Insurers are 
advised the form for the Initial Notice of Insured Loss will include an 
initial estimate of aggregate losses for the Program Year, the amount of 
the insurer deductible and an estimate of the Federal share of 
compensation for the insurer's aggregate insured losses. In the case of 
an affiliated group of insurers, the form for the Initial Notice of 
Insured Loss will include the name and address of a single designated 
insurer within the affiliated group that will serve as the single point 
of contact for the purpose

[[Page 351]]

of providing loss and compliance certifications as required in Sec. 
50.53 and for receiving, disbursing, and distributing payments of the 
Federal share of compensation in accordance with Sec. 50.54. An 
insurer, at its option, may elect to include with its Initial Notice of 
Insured Loss the certification of direct earned premium required by 
Sec. 50.53(b)(3).


<R05>
Sec. 50.53  Loss certifications.

    (a) General. When an insurer has paid aggregate insured losses that 
exceed its insurer deductible, the insurer may make claim upon Treasury 
for the payment of the Federal share of compensation for its insured 
losses. The insurer shall file an Initial Certification of Loss, on a 
form prescribed by Treasury, and thereafter such Supplementary 
Certifications of Loss, on a form prescribed by Treasury, as may be 
necessary to receive payment for the Federal share of compensation for 
its insured losses.
    (b) Initial Certification of Loss. An insurer shall use its best 
efforts to file with the Program the Initial Certification of Loss 
within 45 days following the last calendar day of the month when an 
insurer has paid aggregate insured losses that exceed its insurer 
deductible. The Initial Certification of Loss will include the 
following:
    (1) A bordereau, on a form prescribed by Treasury, that includes 
basic information about each underlying insured loss. For purposes of 
this section, a ``bordereau'' is a report of basic information about an 
insurer's underlying claims that, in the aggregate, constitute the 
insured losses of the insurer. The bordereau will include, but may not 
be limited to:
    (i) A listing of each underlying insured loss by catastrophe code 
and line of business;
    (ii) The total amount of reinsurance recovered from other sources;
    (iii) A calculation of the aggregate insured losses sustained by the 
insurer above its insurer deductible for the Program Year; and
    (iv) The amount the insurer claims as the Federal share of 
compensation for its aggregate insured losses.
    (2) A certification that the insurer is in compliance with the 
provisions of section 103(b) of the Act and this part, including 
certifications that:
    (i) The underlying insured losses listed on the bordereau filed 
pursuant to Sec. 50.53(b)(1) either: Have been paid by the insurer; or 
will be paid by the insurer upon receipt of an advance payment of the 
Federal share of compensation as soon as possible, consistent with the 
insurer's normal business practices, but not longer than five business 
days after receipt of the Federal share of compensation;
    (ii) The underlying claims for insured losses were filed by persons 
who suffered an insured loss, or by persons acting on behalf of such 
persons;
    (iii) The underlying claims for insured losses were processed in 
accordance with appropriate business practices and the procedures 
specified in this subpart;
    (iv) The insurer has complied with the disclosure requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 50.10 through 50.19 for each underlying insured loss that is 
included in the amount of the insurer's aggregate insured losses; and
    (v) The insurer has complied with the mandatory availability 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 50.20 through 50.24.
    (3) A certification of the amount of the insurer's ``direct earned 
premium'' as defined in Sec. 50.5(d), together with the calculation of 
its ``insurer deductible'' as defined in Sec. 50.5(g) (provided this 
certification was not submitted previously with the Initial Notice of 
Insured Loss specified in Sec. 50.52).
    (4) A certification that the insurer will disburse payment of the 
Federal share of compensation in accordance with this subpart.
    (c) Supplementary Certification of Loss. If the total amount of the 
Federal share of compensation due an insurer for insured losses under 
the Act has not been determined at the time an Initial Certification of 
Loss has been filed, the insurer shall file monthly, or on a schedule 
otherwise determined by Treasury, Supplementary Certifications of Loss 
updating the amount of the Federal share of compensation owed for the 
insurer's insured losses. Supplementary Certifications of Loss will 
include the following:
    (1) A bordereau described in Sec. 50.53(b)(1); and

[[Page 352]]

    (2) A certification as described in Sec. 50.53(b)(2).
    (d) Supplementary information. In addition to the information 
required in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, Treasury may require 
such additional supporting documentation as required to ascertain the 
Federal share of compensation for the insured losses of any insurer.
    (e) State Residual Market Insurance Entities and State Workers' 
Compensation Funds. A State residual market insurance entity or State 
workers' compensation fund described in Sec. 50.35 shall provide the 
Certifications of Loss described in Sec. Sec. 50.53(b) and 50.53(c) for 
all its insured losses to each participating insurer at the time it 
provides the allocated dollar value of the participating insurer's 
proportionate share of insured losses. In addition, at such time the 
State residual market insurance entity or State workers' compensation 
fund shall provide the certification described in Sec. 50.53(b)(2) to 
Treasury. Participating insurers shall treat the allocated dollar value 
of their proportionate share of insured losses from a State residual 
market insurance entity or State workers' compensation fund as an 
insured loss for the purpose of their own reporting to Treasury in 
seeking the Federal share of compensation.


<R05>
Sec. 50.54  Payment of Federal share of compensation.

    (a) Timing. Treasury will promptly pay to an insurer the Federal 
share of compensation due the insurer for its insured losses. Payment 
shall be made in such installments and on such conditions as determined 
by the Treasury to be appropriate. Any overpayments by Treasury of the 
Federal share of compensation will be offset from future payments to the 
insurer or returned to Treasury within 45 days.
    (b) Payment process. Payment of the Federal share of compensation 
for insured losses will be made to the insurer designated on the Initial 
Notice of Loss required by Sec. 50.52. An insurer that requests payment 
of the Federal share of compensation for insured losses must receive 
payment through electronic funds transfer. The insurer must establish 
either an account for reimbursement as described in paragraph (c) of 
this section (if the insurer only seeks reimbursement) or a segregated 
account as described in paragraph (d) of this section (if the insurer 
seeks advance payments or a combination of advance payments and 
reimbursement). Applicable procedures will be posted at 
www.treasury.gov/trip or otherwise will be made publicly available.
    (c) Account for reimbursement. An insurer shall designate an account 
for the receipt of reimbursement of the Federal share of compensation at 
an institution eligible to receive payments through the Automated 
Clearing House (ACH) network.
    (d) Segregated account for advance payments. An insurer that seeks 
advance payments of the Federal share of compensation as certified 
according to Sec. 50.53(b)(2)(i)(B) shall establish an interest-bearing 
segregated account into which Treasury will make advance payments as 
well as reimbursements to the insurer.
    (1) Definition of segregated account. For purposes of this section, 
a segregated account is an interest-bearing separate account established 
by an insurer at a financial institution eligible to receive payments 
through the ACH network. Such an account is limited to the purposes of:
    (i) Receiving payments of the Federal share of compensation;
    (ii) Disbursing payments to insureds and claimants; and
    (iii) Transferring payments to the insurer or affiliated insurers 
for insured losses reported on the bordereau as already paid.
    (2) Remittance of interest. All interest earned on advance payments 
in the segregated account must be remitted at least quarterly to 
Treasury's Office of Financial Management or as otherwise prescribed in 
applicable procedures.
    (e) Denial or withholding of advance payment. Treasury may deny or 
withhold advance payments of the Federal share of compensation to an 
insurer if Treasury determines that the insurer

[[Page 353]]

has not properly disbursed previous advances of the Federal share of 
compensation or otherwise has not complied with the requirements for 
advance payment as provided in this subpart.
    (f) Affiliated group. In the case of an affiliated group of 
insurers, Treasury will make payment of the Federal share of 
compensation for the insured losses of the affiliated group to the 
insurer designated in the Initial Notice of Insured Loss to receive 
payment on behalf of the affiliated group. The designated insurer 
receiving payment from Treasury must distribute payment to affiliated 
insurers in a manner that ensures that each insurer in the affiliated 
group is compensated for its share of insured losses, taking into 
account a reasonable and fair allocation of the group deductible among 
affiliated insurers. Upon payment of the Federal share of compensation 
to the designated insurer, Treasury's payment obligation to the insurers 
in the affiliated group with respect to any insured losses covered on 
the applicable bordereau is discharged to the extent of the payment.


<R05>
Sec. 50.55  Determination of Affiliations.

    For the purposes of subpart F, an insurer's affiliates for any 
Program Year shall be determined by the circumstances existing on the 
date of occurrence of the act of terrorism that is the first act of 
terrorism in a Program Year to be certified by the Secretary for that 
Program Year. Provided, however, if such act of terrorism occurs after 
March 31, 2006, the act of terrorism must also be a Program Trigger 
event to determine affiliations as provided in this section.

but not limited to, records regarding premiums and insured losses for 
all commercial property and casualty insurance issued by the insurer and 
information relating to any adjustment in the amount of the Federal 
share of compensation payable. Insurers shall maintain detailed records 
for not less than 5 years from the termination dates of all reinsurance 
agreements involving commercial property and casualty insurance subject 
to the Act. Records relating to premiums shall be retained and available 
for review for not less than 3 years following the conclusion of the

<R05>
Sec. 50.80  Federal cause of action and remedy.

    (a) General. If the Secretary certifies an act as an act of 
terrorism pursuant to section 102 of the Act, there shall exist a 
Federal cause of action for property damage, personal injury, or death 
arising out of or resulting from such act of terrorism, pursuant to 
section 107 of the Act, which shall be the exclusive cause of action and 
remedy for claims for property damage, personal injury, or death arising 
out of or

relating to such act of terrorism, except as provided in paragraph (c) 
of this section.
    (b) Effective period. The exclusive Federal cause of action and 
remedy described in paragraph (a) of this section shall exist only for 
causes of action for property damage, personal injury, or death that 
arise out of or result from acts of terrorism that occur or occurred 
during the effective period of the Program.
    (c) Rights not affected. Nothing in section 107 of the Act or this 
Subpart shall in any way:
    (1) Limit the liability of any government, organization, or person

    (2) Affect any party's contractual right to arbitrate a dispute; or

Stabilization Act (Pub. L. 107-42; 49 U.S.C. 40101 note).


<R05>
Sec. 50.81  State causes of action preempted.

    All State causes of action of any kind for property damage, personal 
injury, or death arising out of or resulting from an act of terrorism 
that are otherwise available under State law are preempted, except that, 
pursuant to section 107(b) of the Act, nothing in this section shall 
limit in any way the liability of any government, organization, or 
person who knowingly participates in, conspires to commit, aids and 
abets, or commits the act of terrorism certified by the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 50.82  Advance approval of settlements.

    (a) Mandatory submission of settlements for advance approval. An 
insurer shall submit to Treasury for advance approval any proposed 
agreement to settle or compromise any Federal cause of action for 
property damage, personal injury, or death, asserted by a third-party or 
parties against an insured, involving an insured loss, all or part of 
the payment of which the insurer intends to submit as part of its claim 
for Federal payment under the Program, when:
    (1) Any portion of the proposed settlement amount that is 
attributable to an insured loss or losses involving personal injury or 
death in the aggregate is $2 million or more per third-party claimant, 
regardless of the number of causes of action or insured losses being 
settled; or
    (2) Any portion of the proposed settlement amount that is 
attributable to an insured loss or losses involving property damage 
(including loss of use) in the aggregate is $10 million or more per 
third-party claimant, regardless of the number of causes of action or 
insured losses being settled.
    (b) Discretionary review of other settlements. Notwithstanding 
paragraph (a), Treasury may require that an insurer submit for review 
and advance approval any proposed agreement to settle or compromise any 
Federal cause of action for property damage, personal injury, or death, 
asserted by a third-party or parties against an insured, involving an 
insured loss, all or part of the payment of which the insurer intends to 
submit as part of its claim for Federal payment under the Program where 
the settlement amounts are below the applicable monetary thresholds 
identified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (c) Factors. In determining whether to approve a proposed 
settlement, Treasury will consider the nature of the loss, the facts and 
circumstances surrounding the loss, and other factors such as whether:
    (1) The proposed settlement compensates for a third-party's loss, 
the liability for which is an insured loss under the terms and 
conditions of the underlying commercial property and casualty insurance 
policy, as certified by the insurer pursuant to Sec. 50.83(d)(2);
    (2) Any amount of the proposed settlement is attributable to 
punitive or exemplary damages intended to punish or deter (whether or 
not specifically so described as such damages);
    (3) The settlement amount offsets amounts received from the United 
States pursuant to any other Federal program;
    (4) The settlement amount does not include any items such as fees 
and expenses of attorneys, experts, and other

[[Page 355]]

professionals that have caused the insured losses under the underlying 
commercial property and casualty insurance policy to be overstated; and
    (5) Any other criteria that Treasury may consider appropriate, 
depending on the facts and circumstances surrounding the settlement, 
including the information contained in Sec. 50.83.
    (d) Settlement without seeking advance approval or despite 
disapproval. If an insurer settles a cause of action or agrees to the 
settlement of a cause of action without submitting the proposed 
settlement for Treasury's advance approval in accordance with paragraph 
(a) or (b) of this section, and in accordance with Sec. 50.83 or 
despite Treasury's disapproval of the proposed settlement, the insurer 
will not be entitled to include the paid settlement amount (or portion 
of the settlement amount, to the extent partially disapproved) in its 
aggregate insured losses for purposes of calculating the Federal share 
of compensation of its insured losses, unless the insurer can 
demonstrate, to the satisfaction of Treasury, extenuating circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 50.83  Procedure for requesting approval of proposed settlements.

    (a) Submission of notice. Insurers must request advance approval of 
a proposed settlement by submitting a notice of the proposed settlement 
and other required information in writing to the Terrorism Risk 
Insurance Program Office or its designated representative. The address 
where notices are to be submitted will be available at http://
www.treasury.gov/trip following any certification of an act of terrorism 
pursuant to section 102(1) of the Act.
    (b) Complete notice. Treasury will review requests for advance 
approval and determine whether additional information is needed to 
complete the notice.
    (c) Treasury response or deemed approval. Within 30 days after 
Treasury's receipt of a complete notice, or as extended in writing by 
Treasury, Treasury may issue a written response and indicate its partial 
or full approval or rejection of the proposed settlement. If Treasury 
does not issue a response within 30 days after Treasury's receipt of a 
complete notice, unless extended in writing by Treasury, the request for 
advance approval is deemed approved by Treasury. Any settlement is still 
subject to review under the claim procedures pursuant to Sec. 50.50.
    (d) Notice format. A notice of a proposed settlement should be 
entitled, ``Notice of Proposed Settlement--Request for Approval,'' and 
should provide the full name and address of the submitting insurer and 
the name, title, address, and telephone number of the designated contact 
person. An insurer must provide all relevant information, including the 
following, as applicable:
    (1) A brief description of the insured's underlying claim, the 
insured's loss, the amount of the claim, the operative policy terms, 
defenses to coverage, and all damages sustained;
    (2) A certification by the insurer that the settlement is for a 
third-party's loss the liability for which is an insured loss under the 
terms and conditions of the underlying commercial property and casualty 
insurance policy;
    (3) An itemized statement of all damages by category (i.e., actual, 
economic and non-economic loss, punitive damages, etc.);
    (4) A statement from the insurer or its attorney in support of the 
settlement.;
    (5) The total dollar amount of the proposed settlement;
    (6) Indication as to whether the settlement was negotiated by 
counsel;
    (7) The amount to be paid that will compensate for any items such as 
fees and expenses of attorneys, experts, and other professionals for 
their services and expenses related to the insured loss and/or 
settlement and the net amount to be received by the third-party after 
such payment;
    (8) The amount received from the United States pursuant to any other 
Federal program for compensation of insured losses related to an act of 
terrorism;
    (9) The proposed terms of the written settlement agreement, 
including release language and subrogation terms;
    (10) If requested by Treasury, other relevant agreements, including:
    (i) Admissions of liability or insurance coverage;

[[Page 356]]

    (ii) Determinations of the number of occurrences under a commercial 
property and casualty insurance policy;
    (iii) The allocation of paid amounts or amounts to be paid to 
certain policies, or to specific policy, coverage and/or aggregate 
limits; and
    (iv) Any other agreement that may affect the payment or amount of 
the Federal share of compensation to be paid to the insurer;
    (11) A statement indicating whether the proposed settlement has been 
approved by the Federal court or is subject to such approval and whether 
such approval is expected or likely; and
    (12) Such other information that is related to the insured loss as 
may be requested by Treasury that it deems necessary to evaluate the 
proposed settlement.


<R05>
Sec. 50.84  Subrogation.

    An insurer shall not waive its rights of subrogation under its 
property and casualty insurance policy and preserve the subrogation 
right of the United States as provided by section 107(c) of the Act by 
not taking any action that would prejudice the United States' right of 
subrogation.


<R05>
Sec. 50.85  Amendment related to settlement approval.

    Section 107(a)(6) of the Act, added December 22, 2005, provides that 
procedures and requirements established by the Secretary under Sec. 
50.82 (as in effect on the date of issuance of that section in final 
form) shall apply to any cause of action described in section 107(a)(1) 
of the Act.

Sec. 100.2  Scope of regulations; transactions effected through Federal 
Reserve banks and branches; distribution of coin and currencies.

    The regulations in this part govern the exchange of the coin and 
paper currency of the United States (including national bank notes and 
Federal Reserve bank notes in process of retirement and Federal Reserve 
notes). Under authorization in the Act approved May 29, 1920, 41 Stat. 
655 (31 U.S.C. 476), the Secretary of the Treasury transferred to the 
Federal Reserve banks and branches the duties and

[[Page 365]]

functions performed by the former Assistant Treasurers of the United 
States in connection with the exchange of paper currency and coin of the 
United States. Except for the duties in this respect to be performed by 
the Treasurer of the United States and the Director of the Mint, as may 
be indicated from time to time by the Secretary of the Treasury, 
exchanges of the paper currency and coin of the United States and the 
distribution and replacement thereof will, so far as practicable, be 
effected through the Federal Reserve banks and branches. The Federal 
Reserve banks and branches are authorized to distribute available 
supplies of coin and currency to depository institutions, as that term 
is defined in section 103 of the Monetary Control Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 
96-221). As authorized by section 107 of the Act, transportation of coin 
and currency and coin wrapping services will be provided according to a 
schedule of fees established by the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System. Inquiries by depository institutions regarding 
distribution and related services should be addressed to the Federal 
Reserve bank of the district where the institution is located.

<R05>
Sec. 100.5  Mutilated paper currency.

    (a) Lawfully held paper currency of the United States which has been 
mutilated will be exchanged at face amount if clearly more than one-half 
of the original whole note remains. Fragments of such mutilated currency 
which are not clearly more than one-half of the original whole note will 
be exchanged at face value only if the Director, Bureau of Engraving and 
Printing, Department of the Treasury, is satisfied that the missing 
portions have been totally destroyed. The Director's judgment shall be 
based on such evidence of total destruction as is necessary and shall be 
final.

                               Definitions

    (1) Mutilated currency is currency which has been damaged to the 
extent that (i) one-half or less of the original note remains or (ii) 
its condition is such that its value is questionable and the currency 
must be forwarded to the Treasury Department for examination by trained 
experts before any exchange is made.
    (2) Unfit currency is currency which is unfit for further 
circulation because of its physical condition such as torn, dirty, limp, 
worn or defaced. Unfit currency should not be forwarded to the Treasury, 
but may be exchanged at commercial banks.

<R05>
Sec. 100.7  Treasury's liability.

    (a) Payment will be made to lawful holders of mutilated currency at 
full value when:
    (1) Clearly more than 50% of a note identifiable as United States 
currency is present; or
    (2) Fifty percent or less of a note identifiable as United States 
currency is present and the method of mutilation and supporting evidence 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Treasury that the missing 
portions have been totally destroyed.
    (b) No payments will be made when:
    (1) Fragments and remnants presented are not identifiable as United 
States currency; or
    (2) Fragments and remnants presented which represent 50% or less of 
a note are identifiable as United States currency but the method of 
destruction and supporting evidence do not satisfy the Treasury that the 
missing portion has been totally destroyed.
    (c) All cases will be handled under proper procedures to safeguard 
the funds and interests of the claimant. In some cases, the amount 
repaid will be less than the amount claimed. In other cases, the amount 
repaid may be greater. The amount paid will be determined by an 
examination made by trained mutilated currency examiners and governed by 
the above criteria.
    (d) The Director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing shall have 
final authority with respect to settlements for mutilated currency 
claims.

Sec. 100.8  Packaging of mutilated currency.

    Mutilated currency examiners are normally able to determine the 
value of mutilated currency when it has been carefully packed and boxed 
as described below:
    (a) Regardless of the condition of the currency, do not disturb the 
fragments more than is absolutely necessary.
    (b) If the currency is brittle or inclined to fall apart, pack it 
carefully in cotton and box it as found, without disturbing the 
fragments, if possible.
    (c) If the money was in a purse, box, or other container when 
mutilated, it should be left therein, if possible, in order to prevent 
further deterioration of the fragments or from their being lost.
    (d) If it is absolutely necessary to remove the fragments from the 
container, send the container with the currency and any other contents 
found, except as noted in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (e) If the money was flat when mutilated, do not roll or fold.
    (f) If the money was in a roll when mutilated, do not attempt to 
unroll or straighten.
    (g) If coin or any other metal is mixed with the currency, remove 
carefully. Do not send coin or other metal in the same package with 
mutilated paper currency, as the metal will break up the currency. Coin 
should be forwarded as provided in Sec. 100.12 (c) and (d).
    (h) Any fused or melted coin should be sent to: Superintendent, 
United States Mint, P.O. Box 400, Philadelphia, PA 19105.

Sec. 101.2  Petitions for mitigation.

    (a) Who may file. Any person may petition the Secretary of the

forfeited to the United States, if:
    (1) The petitioner innocently purchased or received the coins and 
held them without the knowledge that they were counterfeit; and,
    (2) The petitioner voluntarily submitted the coins to the Treasury 
Department for a determination of whether they were legitimate or 
counterfeit; and,
    (3) The coins were determined to be counterfeit and were seized by 
the Treasury Department and forfeited to the United States.

    (1) The full name and address of the petitioner;
    (2) A description of the coin or coins involved;
    (3) The name and address of the person from whom the coins were

Operations, Tariff Affairs.

    (a) The Assistant Secretary will receive and review all petitions 
for mitigation of the forfeiture of counterfeit gold coins. He shall

approved if the Assistant Secretary determines that:
    (1) The gold coins have not been previously disposed of by normal 
procedures;
    (2) The petitioner was an innocent purchaser or holder of the gold 
coins and is not under investigation in connection with the coins at the 
time of submission or thereafter;
    (3) The coins are not needed and will not be needed in the future in 
any investigation or as evidence in legal proceedings; and
    (4) Mitigation of the forfeiture is in the best interest of the 
Government.


<R05>
Sec. 101.4  Extraction of gold bullion from the counterfeit coins.

    If the petition is approved, the Assistant Secretary shall then 
forward the gold coins to the Bureau of the Mint where, if economically 
feasible, the gold bullion will be extracted from the counterfeit coins. 
The Bureau of the Mint will then return the bullion to the Assistant 
Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 101.5  Payment of smelting costs.

    The petitioner shall be required to pay all reasonable costs 
incurred in extracting the bullion from the counterfeit coins, as shall 
be determined by the Assistant Secretary. Payment must be made prior to 
the return of the gold bullion to the petitioner.


<R05>
Sec. 101.6  Return of the bullion.

    After receiving the gold bullion from the Bureau of the Mint, the 
Assistant Secretary shall notify the petitioner that his petition has 
been approved and that payment of the smelting costs in an amount set 
forth in such notice must be made prior to the return of the bullion.


<R05>
Sec. 101.7  Exceptions.

    The provisions of this part shall not apply where the cost of 
smelting the gold coins exceeds the value of the gold bullion to be 
returned.


<R05>
Sec. 101.8  Discretion of the Secretary.

    The Secretary of the Treasury retains complete discretion to deny 
any claim of any petitioner when the Secretary believes it is not in the 
best interest of the Government to return the

[[Page 370]]

bullion to the petitioner or when the Secretary is not convinced that 
the petitoner was an innocent purchaser or holder without knowledge that 
the gold coins were counterfeit.

Sec. 103.15  Reports by mutual funds of suspicious transactions.

    (a) General. (1) Every investment company (as defined in section 3 
of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-3) (``Investment 
Company Act'') that is an open-end company (as defined in section 5 of 
the Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-5)) and that is registered, or 
is required to register, with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
pursuant to that Act (for purposes of this section, a ``mutual fund''), 
shall file with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, to the extent 
and in the manner required by this section, a report of any suspicious 
transaction relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation. A 
mutual fund may also file with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network 
a report of any suspicious transaction that it believes is relevant to 
the possible violation of any law or regulation, but whose reporting is 
not required by this section. Filing a report of a suspicious 
transaction does not relieve a mutual fund from the responsibility of 
complying with any other reporting requirements imposed by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission.
    (2) A transaction requires reporting under this section if it is 
conducted or attempted by, at, or through a mutual fund, it involves or 
aggregates funds or other assets of at least $5,000, and the mutual fund 
knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that the transaction (or a 
pattern of transactions of which the transaction is a part):
    (i) Involves funds derived from illegal activity or is intended or 
conducted in order to hide or disguise funds or assets derived from 
illegal activity (including, without limitation, the ownership, nature, 
source, location, or control of such funds or assets) as part of a plan 
to violate or evade any Federal law or regulation or to avoid any 
transaction reporting requirement under Federal law or regulation;
    (ii) Is designed, whether through structuring or other means, to 
evade any requirements of this part or any other regulations promulgated 
under the Bank Secrecy Act, Public Law 91-508, as amended, codified at 
12 U.S.C. 1829b, 12 U.S.C. 1951-1959, and 31 U.S.C. 5311-5314, 5316-
5332;
    (iii) Has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort 
in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage, 
and the mutual fund knows of no reasonable explanation for the 
transaction after examining the available facts, including the 
background and possible purpose of the transaction; or
    (iv) Involves use of the mutual fund to facilitate criminal 
activity.
    (3) More than one mutual fund may have an obligation to report the 
same transaction under this section, and other financial institutions 
may have separate obligations to report suspicious activity with respect 
to the same transaction pursuant to other provisions of this part. In 
those instances, no more than one report is required to be filed by the 
mutual fund(s) and other financial institution(s) involved in the 
transaction, provided that the report filed contains all relevant facts, 
including the name of each financial institution and the words ``joint 
filing'' in the narrative section, and each institution maintains a copy 
of the report filed, along with any supporting documentation.
    (b) Filing and notification procedures--(1) What to file. A 
suspicious transaction shall be reported by completing a Suspicious 
Activity Report by Securities and Futures Industries (``SAR-SF''), and 
collecting and maintaining supporting documentation as required by 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Where to file. Form SAR-SF shall be filed with the Financial 
Crimes Enforcement Network in accordance with the instructions to the 
Form SAR-SF.
    (3) When to file. A Form SAR-SF shall be filed no later than 30 
calendar

[[Page 379]]

days after the date of the initial detection by the reporting mutual 
fund of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a Form SAR-SF under 
this section. If no suspect is identified on the date of such initial 
detection, a mutual fund may delay filing a Form SAR-SF for an 
additional 30 calendar days to identify a suspect, but in no case shall 
reporting be delayed more than 60 calendar days after the date of such 
initial detection.
    (4) Mandatory notification to law enforcement. In situations 
involving violations that require immediate attention, such as suspected 
terrorist financing or ongoing money laundering schemes, a mutual fund 
shall immediately notify by telephone an appropriate law enforcement 
authority in addition to filing timely a Form SAR-SF.
    (5) Voluntary notification to the Financial Crimes Enforcement 
Network or the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mutual funds wishing 
voluntarily to report suspicious transactions that may relate to 
terrorist activity may call the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network's 
Financial Institutions Hotline at 1-866-556-3974 in addition to filing 
timely a Form SAR-SF if required by this section. The mutual fund may 
also, but is not required to, contact the Securities and Exchange 
Commission to report in such situations.
    (c) Retention of records. A mutual fund shall maintain a copy of any 
Form SAR-SF filed by the fund or on its behalf (including joint 
reports), and the original (or business record equivalent) of any 
supporting documentation concerning any Form SAR-SF that it files (or is 
filed on its behalf), for a period of five years from the date of filing 
the Form SAR-SF. Supporting documentation shall be identified as such 
and maintained by the mutual fund, and shall be deemed to have been 
filed with the Form SAR-SF. The mutual fund shall make all supporting 
documentation available to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, any 
other appropriate law enforcement agencies or federal or state 
securities regulators, and for purposes of an examination of a broker-
dealer pursuant to Sec. 103.19(g) regarding a joint report, to a self-
regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a)(26) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26)) registered with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, upon request.
    (d) Confidentiality of reports. No mutual fund, and no director, 
officer, employee, or agent of any mutual fund, who reports a suspicious 
transaction under this part (whether such a report is required by this 
section or made voluntarily), may notify any person involved in the 
transaction that the transaction has been reported, except to the extent 
permitted by paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Any person subpoenaed or 
otherwise required to disclose a Form SAR-SF or the information 
contained in a Form SAR-SF, including a Form SAR-SF filed jointly with 
another financial institution involved in the same transaction (except 
where such disclosure is requested by the Financial Crimes Enforcement 
Network, the Securities and Exchange Commission, another appropriate law 
enforcement or regulatory agency, or, in the case of a joint report 
involving a broker-dealer, a self-regulatory organization registered 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission conducting an examination of 
such broker-dealer pursuant to Sec. 103.19(g)), shall decline to 
produce Form SAR-SF or to provide any information that would disclose 
that a Form SAR-SF has been prepared or filed, citing this paragraph (d) 
and 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(2), and shall notify the Financial Crimes 
Enforcement Network of any such request and its response thereto.
    (e) Limitation of liability. A mutual fund, and any director, 
officer, employee, or agent of such mutual fund, that makes a report of 
any possible violation of law or regulation pursuant to this section, 
including a joint report (whether such report is required by this 
section or made voluntarily) shall be protected from liability for any 
disclosure contained in, or for failure to disclose the fact of, such 
report, or both, to the extent provided in 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(3).
    (f) Examinations and enforcement. Compliance with this section shall 
be examined by the Department of the Treasury, through the Financial 
Crimes Enforcement Network or its delegees, under the terms of the Bank

[[Page 380]]

Secrecy Act. Failure to satisfy the requirements of this section may 
constitute a violation of the reporting rules of the Bank Secrecy Act 
and of this part.
    (g) Effective date. This section applies to transactions occurring 
after October 31, 2006.

law enforcement authority in addition to filing timely a SAR-IC. 
Insurance companies wishing voluntarily to report suspicious 
transactions that may relate to terrorist activity may call the

this part (whether such a report is required by this section or made 
voluntarily), may notify any person involved in the transaction that the 
transaction has been reported, except to the extent permitted by 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Thus, any insurance company subpoenaed 
or otherwise requested to disclose a SAR-IC or the information contained 
in a SAR-IC (or a copy of a joint Suspicious Activity Report filed with 
another financial institution involved in the same transaction, 
including an insurance agent), except where such disclosure is requested 
by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network or another appropriate law 
enforcement or supervisory agency, shall decline to produce the 
Suspicious Activity Report or to provide any information that would 
disclose that a Suspicious Activity Report has been prepared or filed, 
citing as authority 31 CFR 103.16 and 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(2), and shall 
notify the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of any such request and 
its response thereto. An insurance company, and any director, officer, 
employee, agent, or broker of such insurance company, that makes a 
report pursuant to this section, including a joint report (whether such 
report is required by this section or made voluntarily) shall be 
protected from liability for any disclosure contained in, or for failure 
to disclose the fact of, such report, or both, to the extent provided by 
31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(3).
    (g) Compliance. Compliance with this section shall be examined by 
the Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement 
Network or its delegees, under the terms of the Bank Secrecy Act. 
Failure to comply with the requirements of this section may constitute a 
violation of the reporting rules of the Bank Secrecy Act and of this 
part.
    (h) Suspicious transaction reporting requirements for insurance 
companies registered or required to register with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission as broker-dealers in securities. An insurance 
company that is registered or required to register with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission as a broker-dealer in securities shall be deemed 
to have satisfied the requirements of this section for its broker-dealer 
activities to the extent that the company complies with the reporting 
requirements applicable to such activities pursuant to Sec. 103.19.
    (i) Applicability date. This section applies to transactions 
occurring after May 2, 2006.

Sec. 103.17  Reports by futures commission merchants and introducing 
brokers in commodities of suspicious transactions.

    (a) General--(1) Every futures commission merchant (``FCM'') and 
introducing broker in commodities (``IB-C'') within the United States 
shall file with FinCEN, to the extent and in the manner required by this 
section, a report of any suspicious transaction relevant to a possible 
violation of law or regulation. An FCM or IB-C may also file with FinCEN 
a report of any suspicious transaction that it believes is relevant to 
the possible violation of any law or regulation but whose reporting is 
not required by this section. Filing a report of a suspicious 
transaction does not relieve an FCM or IB-C from the responsibility of 
complying with any other reporting requirements imposed by the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') or any registered futures 
association or registered entity as those terms are defined in the 
Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA''), 7 U.S.C. 21 and 7 U.S.C. 1a(29).
    (2) A transaction requires reporting under the terms of this section 
if it is conducted or attempted by, at, or through an FCM or IB-C, it 
involves or aggregates funds or other assets of at least $5,000, and the 
FCM or IB-C

[[Page 383]]

knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that the transaction (or a 
pattern of transactions of which the transaction is a part):
    (i) Involves funds derived from illegal activity or is intended or 
conducted in order to hide or disguise funds or assets derived from 
illegal activity (including, without limitation, the ownership, nature, 
source, location, or control of such funds or assets) as part of a plan 
to violate or evade any federal law or regulation or to avoid any 
transaction reporting requirement under federal law or regulation;
    (ii) Is designed, whether through structuring or other means, to 
evade any requirements of this part or of any other regulations 
promulgated under the Bank Secrecy Act (``BSA''), Public Law 91-508, as 
amended, codified at 12 U.S.C. 1829b, 12 U.S.C. 1951-1959, and 31 U.S.C. 
5311-5314, 5316-5332;
    (iii) Has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort 
in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage, 
and the FCM or IB-C knows of no reasonable explanation for the 
transaction after examining the available facts, including the 
background and possible purpose of the transaction; or
    (iv) Involves use of the FCM or IB-C to facilitate criminal 
activity.
    (3) The obligation to identify and properly and timely to report a 
suspicious transaction rests with each FCM and IB-C involved in the 
transaction, provided that no more than one report is required to be 
filed by any of the FCMs or IB-Cs involved in a particular transaction, 
so long as the report filed contains all relevant facts.
    (b) Filing procedures--(1) What to file. A suspicious transaction 
shall be reported by completing a Suspicious Activity Report-Securities 
and Futures Industry (``SAR-SF''), and collecting and maintaining 
supporting documentation as required by paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) Where to file. The SAR-SF shall be filed with FinCEN in a 
central location, to be determined by FinCEN, as indicated in the 
instructions to the SAR-SF.
    (3) When to file. A SAR-SF shall be filed no later than 30 calendar 
days after the date of the initial detection by the reporting FCM or IB-
C of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR-SF under this 
section. If no suspect is identified on the date of such initial 
detection, an FCM or IB-C may delay filing a SAR-SF for an additional 30 
calendar days to identify a suspect, but in no case shall reporting be 
delayed more than 60 calendar days after the date of such initial 
detection. In situations involving violations that require immediate 
attention, such as terrorist financing or ongoing money laundering 
schemes, the FCM or IB-C shall immediately notify by telephone an 
appropriate law enforcement authority in addition to filing timely a 
SAR-SF. FCMs and IB-Cs wishing voluntarily to report suspicious 
transactions that may relate to terrorist activity may call FinCEN's 
Financial Institutions Hotline at 1-866-556-3974 in addition to filing 
timely a SAR-SF if required by this section. The FCM or IB-C may also, 
but is not required to, contact the CFTC to report in such situations.
    (c) Exceptions--(1) An FCM or IB-C is not required to file a SAR-SF 
to report--
    (i) A robbery or burglary committed or attempted of the FCM or IB-C 
that is reported to appropriate law enforcement authorities;
    (ii) A violation otherwise required to be reported under the CEA (7 
U.S.C. 1 et seq.), the regulations of the CFTC (17 CFR chapter I), or 
the rules of any registered futures association or registered entity as 
those terms are defined in the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 21 and 7 U.S.C. 1a(29), by 
the FCM or IB-C or any of its officers, directors, employees, or 
associated persons, other than a violation of 17 CFR 42.2, as long as 
such violation is appropriately reported to the CFTC or a registered 
futures association or registered entity.
    (2) An FCM or IB-C may be required to demonstrate that it has relied 
on an exception in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and must maintain 
records of its determinations to do so for the period specified in 
paragraph (d) of this section. To the extent that a Form 8-R, 8-T, U-5, 
or any other similar form concerning the transaction is filed consistent 
with CFTC, registered futures association, or registered entity rules,

[[Page 384]]

a copy of that form will be a sufficient record for the purposes of this 
paragraph (c)(2).
    (d) Retention of records. An FCM or IB-C shall maintain a copy of 
any SAR-SF filed and the original or business record equivalent of any 
supporting documentation for a period of five years from the date of 
filing the SAR-SF. Supporting documentation shall be identified as such 
and maintained by the FCM or IB-C, and shall be deemed to have been 
filed with the SAR-SF. An FCM or IB-C shall make all supporting 
documentation available to FinCEN, the CFTC, or any other appropriate 
law enforcement agency or regulatory agency, and, for purposes of 
paragraph (g) of this section, to any registered futures association, 
registered entity, or self-regulatory organization (``SRO'') (as defined 
in section 3(a)(26) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 
78c(a)(26)), upon request.
    (e) Confidentiality of reports. No financial institution, and no 
director, officer, employee, or agent of any financial institution, who 
reports a suspicious transaction under this part, may notify any person 
involved in the transaction that the transaction has been reported, 
except to the extent permitted by paragraph (a)(3) of this section. 
Thus, any person subpoenaed or otherwise requested to disclose a SAR-SF 
or the information contained in a SAR-SF, except where such disclosure 
is requested by FinCEN, the CFTC, another appropriate law enforcement or 
regulatory agency, or for purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, a 
registered futures association, registered entity, or SRO shall decline 
to produce the SAR-SF or to provide any information that would disclose 
that a SAR-SF has been prepared or filed, citing this paragraph and 31 
U.S.C. 5318(g)(2), and shall notify FinCEN of any such request and its 
response thereto.
    (f) Limitation of liability. An FCM or IB-C, and any director, 
officer, employee, or agent of such FCM or IB-C, that makes a report of 
any possible violation of law or regulation pursuant to this section or 
any other authority (or voluntarily) shall not be liable to any person 
under any law or regulation of the United States (or otherwise to the 
extent also provided in 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(3), including in any 
arbitration or reparations proceeding) for any disclosure contained in, 
or for failure to disclose the fact of, such report.
    (g) Examination and enforcement. Compliance with this section shall 
be examined by the Department of the Treasury, through FinCEN or its 
delegates, under the terms of the BSA. Reports filed under this section 
or Sec. 103.19 (including any supporting documentation), and 
documentation demonstrating reliance on an exception under paragraph (c) 
of this section or Sec. 103.19, shall be made available, upon request, 
to the CFTC, Securities and Exchange Commission, and any registered 
futures association, registered entity, or SRO, examining an FCM, IB-C, 
or broker or dealer in securities for compliance with the requirements 
of this section or Sec. 103.19. Failure to satisfy the requirements of 
this section may constitute a violation of the reporting rules of the 
BSA or of this part.
    (h) Effective date. This section applies to transactions occurring 
after May 18, 2004.

    (a) General. (1) Every bank shall file with the Treasury Department, 
to the extent and in the manner required by this section, a report of 
any suspicious transaction relevant to a possible violation of law or 
regulation. A bank may also file with the Treasury Department by using 
the Suspicious Activity Report specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section or otherwise, a report of any suspicious transaction that it 
believes is relevant to the possible violation of any law or regulation 
but whose reporting is not required by this section.
    (2) A transaction requires reporting under the terms of this section 
if it is conducted or attempted by, at, or through the bank, it involves 
or aggregates at least $5,000 in funds or other assets, and the bank 
knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that:
    (i) The transaction involves funds derived from illegal activities 
or is intended or conducted in order to hide or

[[Page 385]]

disguise funds or assets derived from illegal activities (including, 
without limitation, the ownership, nature, source, location, or control 
of such funds or assets) as part of a plan to violate or evade any 
federal law or regulation or to avoid any transaction reporting 
requirement under federal law or regulation;
    (ii) The transaction is designed to evade any requirements of this 
part or of any other regulations promulgated under the Bank Secrecy Act, 
Pub. L. 91-508, as amended, codified at 12 U.S.C. 1829b, 12 U.S.C. 1951-
1959, and 31 U.S.C. 5311-5330; or
    (iii) The transaction has no business or apparent lawful purpose or 
is not the sort in which the particular customer would normally be 
expected to engage, and the bank knows of no reasonable explanation for 
the transaction after examining the available facts, including the 
background and possible purpose of the transaction.
    (b) Filing procedures--(1) What to file. A suspicious transaction 
shall be reported by completing a Suspicious Activity Report (``SAR''), 
and collecting and maintaining supporting documentation as required by 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) Where to file. The SAR shall be filed with FinCEN in a central 
location, to be determined by FinCEN, as indicated in the instructions 
to the SAR.
    (3) When to file. A bank is required to file a SAR no later than 30 
calendar days after the date of initial detection by the bank of facts 
that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR. If no suspect was 
identified on the date of the detection of the incident requiring the 
filing, a bank may delay filing a SAR for an additional 30 calendar days 
to identify a suspect. In no case shall reporting be delayed more than 
60 calendar days after the date of initial detection of a reportable 
transaction. In situations involving violations that require immediate 
attention, such as, for example, ongoing money laundering schemes, the 
bank shall immediately notify, by telephone, an appropriate law 
enforcement authority in addition to filing timely a SAR.
    (c) Exceptions. A bank is not required to file a SAR for a robbery 
or burglary committed or attempted that is reported to appropriate law 
enforcement authorities, or for lost, missing, counterfeit, or stolen 
securities with respect to which the bank files a report pursuant to the 
reporting requirements of 17 CFR 240.17f-1.
    (d) Retention of records. A bank shall maintain a copy of any SAR 
filed and the original or business record equivalent of any supporting 
documentation for a period of five years from the date of filing the 
SAR. Supporting documentation shall be identified, and maintained by the 
bank as such, and shall be deemed to have been filed with the SAR. A 
bank shall make all supporting documentation available to FinCEN and any 
appropriate law enforcement agencies or bank supervisory agencies upon 
request.
    (e) Confidentiality of reports; limitation of liability. No bank or 
other financial institution, and no director, officer, employee, or 
agent of any bank or other financial institution, who reports a 
suspicious transaction under this part, may notify any person involved 
in the transaction that the transaction has been reported. Thus, any 
person subpoenaed or otherwise requested to disclose a SAR or the 
information contained in a SAR, except where such disclosure is 
requested by FinCEN or an appropriate law enforcement or bank 
supervisory agency, shall decline to produce the SAR or to provide any 
information that would disclose that a SAR has been prepared or filed, 
citing this paragraph (e) and 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(2), and shall notify 
FinCEN of any such request and its response thereto. A bank, and any 
director, officer, employee, or agent of such bank, that makes a report 
pursuant to this section (whether such report is required by this 
section or is made voluntarily) shall be protected from liability for 
any disclosure contained in, or for failure to disclose the fact of such 
report, or both, to the full extent provided by 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(3).
    (f) Compliance. Compliance with this section shall be audited by the 
Department of the Treasury, through FinCEN or its delegees under the 
terms of the Bank Secrecy Act. Failure to satisfy the requirements of 
this section may be a violation of the reporting rules of

[[Page 386]]

the Bank Secrecy Act and of this part. Such failure may also violate 
provisions of Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

Sec. 103.19  Reports by brokers or dealers in securities of suspicious 
transactions.

    (a) General. (1) Every broker or dealer in securities within the 
United States (for purposes of this section, a ``broker-dealer'') shall 
file with FinCEN, to the extent and in the manner required by this 
section, a report of any suspicious transaction relevant to a possible 
violation of law or regulation. A broker-dealer may also file with 
FinCEN a report of any suspicious transaction that it believes is 
relevant to the possible violation of any law or regulation but whose 
reporting is not required by this section. Filing a report of a 
suspicious transaction does not relieve a broker-dealer from the 
responsibility of complying with any other reporting requirements 
imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission or a self-regulatory 
organization (``SRO'') (as defined in section 3(a)(26) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26)).
    (2) A transaction requires reporting under the terms of this section 
if it is conducted or attempted by, at, or through a broker-dealer, it 
involves or aggregates funds or other assets of at least $5,000, and the 
broker-dealer knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that the 
transaction (or a pattern of transactions of which the transaction is a 
part):
    (i) Involves funds derived from illegal activity or is intended or 
conducted in order to hide or disguise funds or assets derived from 
illegal activity (including, without limitation, the ownership, nature, 
source, location, or control of such funds or assets) as part of a plan 
to violate or evade any federal law or regulation or to avoid any 
transaction reporting requirement under federal law or regulation;
    (ii) Is designed, whether through structuring or other means, to 
evade any requirements of this part or of any other regulations 
promulgated under the Bank Secrecy Act, Public Law 91-508, as amended, 
codified at 12 U.S.C. 1829b, 12 U.S.C. 1951-1959, and 31 U.S.C. 5311-
5332;
    (iii) Has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort 
in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage, 
and the broker-dealer knows of no reasonable explanation for the 
transaction after examining the available facts, including the 
background and possible purpose of the transaction; or
    (iv) Involves use of the broker-dealer to facilitate criminal 
activity.
    (3) The obligation to identify and properly and timely to report a 
suspicious transaction rests with each broker-dealer involved in the 
transaction, provided that no more than one report is required to be 
filed by the broker-dealers involved in a particular transaction (so 
long as the report filed contains all relevant facts).
    (b) Filing procedures--(1) What to file. A suspicious transaction 
shall be reported by completing a Suspicious Activity Report--Brokers or 
Dealers in Securities (``SAR-S-F''), and collecting and maintaining 
supporting documentation as required by paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) Where to file. The SAR-BD shall be filed with FinCEN in a 
central location, to be determined by FinCEN, as indicated in the 
instructions to the SAR-S-F.
    (3) When to file. A SAR-S-F shall be filed no later than 30 calendar 
days after the date of the initial detection by the reporting broker-
dealer of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR-S-F under 
this section. If no suspect is identified on the date of such initial 
detection, a broker-dealer may delay filing a SAR-S-F for an additional 
30 calendar days to identify a suspect, but in no case shall reporting 
be delayed more than 60 calendar days after the date of such initial 
detection. In situations involving violations that require immediate 
attention, such as terrorist financing or ongoing money laundering 
schemes, the broker-dealer shall immediately notify by telephone an 
appropriate law enforcement authority in addition to filing timely a

[[Page 387]]

SAR-S-F. Broker-dealers wishing voluntarily to report suspicious 
transactions that may relate to terrorist activity may call FinCEN's 
Financial Institutions Hotline at 1-866-556-3974 in addition to filing 
timely a SAR-S-F if required by this section. The broker-dealer may 
also, but is not required to, contact the Securities and Exchange 
Commission to report in such situations.
    (c) Exceptions. (1) A broker-dealer is not required to file a SAR-S-
F to report:
    (i) A robbery or burglary committed or attempted of the broker-
dealer that is reported to appropriate law enforcement authorities, or 
for lost, missing, counterfeit, or stolen securities with respect to 
which the broker-dealer files a report pursuant to the reporting 
requirements of 17 CFR 240.17f-1;
    (ii) A violation otherwise required to be reported under this 
section of any of the federal securities laws or rules of an SRO by the 
broker-dealer or any of its officers, directors, employees, or other 
registered representatives, other than a violation of 17 CFR 240.17a-8 
or 17 CFR 405.4, so long as such violation is appropriately reported to 
the SEC or an SRO.
    (2) A broker-dealer may be required to demonstrate that it has 
relied on an exception in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and must 
maintain records of its determinations to do so for the period specified 
in paragraph (d) of this section. To the extent that a Form RE-3, Form 
U-4, or Form U-5 concerning the transaction is filed consistent with the 
SRO rules, a copy of that form will be a sufficient record for purposes 
of this paragraph (c)(2).
    (3) For the purposes of this paragraph (c) the term ``federal 
securities laws'' means the ``securities laws,'' as that term is defined 
in section 3(a)(47) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 
78c(a)(47), and the rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities 
and Exchange Commission under such laws.
    (d) Retention of records. A broker-dealer shall maintain a copy of 
any SAR-S-F filed and the original or business record equivalent of any 
supporting documentation for a period of five years from the date of 
filing the SAR-S-F. Supporting documentation shall be identified as such 
and maintained by the broker-dealer, and shall be deemed to have been 
filed with the SAR-S-F. A broker-dealer shall make all supporting 
documentation available to FinCEN, any other appropriate law enforcement 
agencies or federal or state securities regulators, and for purposes of 
paragraph (g) of this section, to an SRO registered with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission, upon request.
    (e) Confidentiality of reports. No financial institution, and no 
director, officer, employee, or agent of any financial institution, who 
reports a suspicious transaction under this part, may notify any person 
involved in the transaction that the transaction has been reported, 
except to the extent permitted by paragraph (a)(3) of this section. 
Thus, any person subpoenaed or otherwise requested to disclose a SAR-S-F 
or the information contained in a SAR-S-F, except where such disclosure 
is requested by FinCEN, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or 
another appropriate law enforcement or regulatory agency, or for 
purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, an SRO registered with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, shall decline to produce the SAR-S-F 
or to provide any information that would disclose that a SAR-S-F has 
been prepared or filed, citing this paragraph (e) and 31 U.S.C. 
5318(g)(2), and shall notify FinCEN of any such request and its response 
thereto.
    (f) Limitation of liability. A broker-dealer, and any director, 
officer, employee, or agent of such broker-dealer, that makes a report 
of any possible violation of law or regulation pursuant to this section 
or any other authority (or voluntarily) shall not be liable to any 
person under any law or regulation of the United States (or otherwise to 
the extent also provided in 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(3), including in any 
arbitration proceeding) for any disclosure contained in, or for failure 
to disclose the fact of, such report.
    (g) Examination and enforcement. Compliance with this section shall 
be examined by the Department of the Treasury, through FinCEN or its 
delegees, under the terms of the Bank

[[Page 388]]

Secrecy Act. Reports filed under this section shall be made available to 
an SRO registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission examining 
a broker-dealer for compliance with the requirements of this section. 
Failure to satisfy the requirements of this section may constitute a 
violation of the reporting rules of the Bank Secrecy Act and of this 
part.
    (h) Effective date. This section applies to transactions occurring 
after December 30, 2002.

Sec. 103.20  Reports by money services businesses of suspicious 
transactions.

    (a) General. (1) Every money services business, described in Sec. 
103.11(uu) (1), (3), (4), (5), or (6), shall file with the Treasury 
Department, to the extent and in the manner required by this section, a 
report of any suspicious transaction relevant to a possible violation of 
law or regulation. Any money services business may also file with the 
Treasury Department, by using the form specified in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, or otherwise, a report of any suspicious transaction that 
it believes is relevant to the possible violation of any law or 
regulation but whose reporting is not required by this section.
    (2) A transaction requires reporting under the terms of this section 
if it is conducted or attempted by, at, or through a money services 
business, involves or aggregates funds or other assets of at least 
$2,000 (except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section), and the 
money services business knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that 
the transaction (or a pattern of transactions of which the transaction 
is a part):
    (i) Involves funds derived from illegal activity or is intended or 
conducted in order to hide or disguise funds or assets derived from 
illegal activity (including, without limitation, the ownership, nature, 
source, location, or control of such funds or assets) as part of a plan 
to violate or evade any federal law or regulation or to avoid any 
transaction reporting requirement under federal law or regulation;
    (ii) Is designed, whether through structuring or other means, to 
evade any requirements of this part or of any other regulations 
promulgated under the Bank Secrecy Act, Public Law 91-508, as amended, 
codified at 12 U.S.C. 1829b, 12 U.S.C. 1951-1959, and 31 U.S.C. 5311-
5330; or
    (iii) Serves no business or apparent lawful purpose, and the 
reporting money services business knows of no reasonable explanation for 
the transaction after examining the available facts, including the 
background and possible purpose of the transaction.
    (iv) Involves use of the money services business to facilitate 
criminal activity.
    (3) To the extent that the identification of transactions required 
to be reported is derived from a review of clearance records or other 
similar records of money orders or traveler's checks that have been sold 
or processed, an issuer of money orders or traveler's checks shall only 
be required to report a transaction or pattern of transactions that 
involves or aggregates funds or other assets of at least $5,000.
    (4) The obligation to identify and properly and timely to report a 
suspicious transaction rests with each money services business involved 
in the transaction, provided that no more than one report is required to 
be filed by the money services businesses involved in a particular 
transaction (so long as the report filed contains all relevant facts). 
Whether, in addition to any liability on its own for failure to report, 
a money services business that issues the instrument or provides the 
funds transfer service involved in the transaction may be liable for the 
failure of another money services business involved in the transaction 
to report that transaction depends upon the nature of the contractual or 
other relationship between the businesses, and the legal effect of the 
facts and circumstances of the relationship and transaction involved, 
under general principles of the law of agency.
    (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a transaction 
that involves solely the issuance, or facilitation of the transfer of 
stored value, or the issuance, sale, or redemption of

[[Page 389]]

stored value, shall not be subject to reporting under this paragraph 
(a), until the promulgation of rules specifically relating to such 
reporting.
    (b) Filing procedures--(1) What to file. A suspicious transaction 
shall be reported by completing a Suspicious Activity Report-MSB (``SAR-
MSB''), and collecting and maintaining supporting documentation as

is required to file each SAR-MSB no later than 30 calendar days after 
the date of the initial detection by the money services business of 
facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR-MSB under this 
section. In situations involving violations that require immediate 
attention, such as ongoing money laundering schemes, the money services 
business shall immediately notify by telephone an appropriate law 
enforcement authority in addition to filing a SAR-MSB. Money services 
businesses wishing voluntarily to report suspicious transactions that 
may relate to terrorist activity may call FinCEN's Financial 
Institutions Hotline at 1-866-556-3974 in addition to filing timely a 
SAR-MSB if required by this section.
    (c) Retention of records. A money services business shall maintain a 
copy of any SAR-MSB filed and the original or business record equivalent 
of any supporting documentation for a period of five years from the date 
of filing the SAR-MSB. Supporting documentation shall be identified as 
such and maintained by the money services business, and shall be deemed 
to have been filed with the SAR-MSB. A money services business shall 
make all supporting documentation available to FinCEN and any other 
appropriate law enforcement agencies or supervisory agencies upon 
request.
    (d) Confidentiality of reports; limitation of liability. No 
financial institution, and no director, officer, employee, or agent of 
any financial institution, who reports a suspicious transaction under 
this part, may notify any person involved in the transaction that the 
transaction has been reported. Thus, any person subpoenaed or otherwise 
requested to disclose a SAR-MSB or the information contained in a SAR-
MSB, except where such disclosure is requested by FinCEN or an 
appropriate law enforcement or supervisory agency, shall decline to 
produce the SAR-MSB or to provide any information that would disclose 
that a SAR-MSB has been prepared or filed, citing this paragraph (d) and 
31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(2), and shall notify FinCEN of any such request and 
its response thereto. A reporting money services business, and any 
director, officer, employee, or agent of such reporting money services 
business, that makes a report pursuant to this section (whether such 
report is required by this section or made voluntarily) shall be 
protected from liability for any disclosure contained in, or for failure 
to disclose the fact of, such report, or both, to the extent provided by 
31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(3).
    (e) Compliance. Compliance with this section shall be audited by the 
Department of the Treasury, through FinCEN or its delegees under the 
terms of the Bank Secrecy Act. Failure to satisfy the requirements of 
this section may constitute a violation of the reporting rules of the 
Bank Secrecy Act and of this part.
    (f) Effective date. This section applies to transactions occurring

Sec. 103.22  Reports of transactions in currency.

    (a) General. This section sets forth the rules for the reporting by 
financial institutions of transactions in currency. The reporting 
obligations themselves are stated in paragraph (b) of this section. The 
reporting rules relating to aggregation are stated in paragraph (c) of 
this section. Rules permitting banks to exempt certain transactions from 
the reporting obligations appear in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) Filing obligations--(1) Financial institutions other than 
casinos. Each financial institution other than a casino shall file a 
report of each deposit, withdrawal, exchange of currency or other 
payment or transfer, by, through, or to such financial institution which 
involves a transaction in currency of more than $10,000, except as 
otherwise provided in this section. In the case of the Postal Service, 
the obligation contained in the preceding sentence shall not apply to 
payments or transfers made solely in connection with the purchase of 
postage or philatelic products.
    (2) Casinos. Each casino shall file a report of each transaction in 
currency, involving either cash in or cash out, of more than $10,000.

includes all of its domestic branch offices, and any recordkeeping 
facility, wherever located, that contains records relating to the 
transactions of the institution's domestic offices, for purposes of this 
section's reporting requirements.
    (2) Multiple transactions--general. In the case of financial 
institutions other than casinos, for purposes of this section, multiple 
currency transactions shall be treated as a single transaction if the 
financial institution has knowledge that they are by or on behalf of any 
person and result in either cash in or cash out totaling more than 
$10,000 during any one business day (or in the case of the Postal 
Service, any one day). Deposits made at night or over a weekend or

knowledge that they are by or on behalf of any person and result in 
either cash in or cash out totaling more than $10,000 during any gaming 
day. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), a casino shall be deemed to 
have the knowledge described in the preceding sentence, if: any sole 
proprietor, partner, officer, director, or employee of the casino, 
acting within the scope of his or her employment, has knowledge that 
such multiple currency transactions have occurred, including knowledge 
from examining the books, records, logs, information retained on 
magnetic disk, tape or other machine-readable media, or in any manual 
system, and similar documents and information, which the casino 
maintains pursuant to any law or regulation or within the ordinary 
course of its business, and which contain information that such multiple 
currency transactions have occurred.
    (d) Transactions of exempt persons--(1) General. No bank is required 
to file a report otherwise required by paragraph (b) of this section

such bank, or, to the extent provided in paragraph (d)(6)(vi) of this 
section, between such exempt person and other banks affiliated with such 
bank. In addition, a non-bank financial institution is not required to 
file a report otherwise required by paragraph (b) of this section with 
respect to a transaction in currency between the institution and a 
commercial bank. (A limitation on the exemption described in this 
paragraph (d)(1) is set forth in paragraph (d)(7) of this section.)
    (2) Exempt person. For purposes of this section, an exempt person 
is:
    (i) A bank, to the extent of such bank's domestic operations;
    (ii) A department or agency of the United States, of any State, or 
of any political subdivision of any State;
    (iii) Any entity established under the laws of the United States, of 
any State, or of any political subdivision of any State, or under an 
interstate compact between two or more States, that exercises 
governmental authority on behalf of the United States or any such State 
or political subdivision;
    (iv) Any entity, other than a bank, whose common stock or analogous 
equity interests are listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the 
American Stock Exchange or whose common stock or analogous equity 
interests have been designated as a Nasdaq National Market Security 
listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market (except stock or interests listed 
under the separate ``Nasdaq Small-Cap Issues'' heading), provided that, 
for purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(iv), a person that is a financial 
institution, other than a bank, is an exempt person only to the extent 
of its domestic operations;
    (v) Any subsidiary, other than a bank, of any entity described in 
paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section (a ``listed entity'') that is 
organized under the laws of the United States or of any State and at 
least 51 percent of whose common stock or analogous equity interest is 
owned by the listed entity, provided that, for purposes of this 
paragraph (d)(2)(v), a person that is a financial institution, other 
than a bank, is an exempt person only to the extent of its domestic 
operations;
    (vi) To the extent of its domestic operations and only with respect 
to transactions conducted through its exemptible accounts, any other 
commercial enterprise (for purposes of this paragraph (d), a ``non-
listed business''), other than an enterprise specified in paragraph 
(d)(6)(viii) of this section, that:
    (A) Has maintained a transaction account, as defined in paragraph 
(d)(6)(ix) of this section, at the bank for at least 12 months;
    (B) Frequently engages in transactions in currency with the bank in 
excess of $10,000; and
    (C) Is incorporated or organized under the laws of the United States 
or a State, or is registered as and eligible to do business within the 
United States or a State; or
    (vii) With respect solely to withdrawals for payroll purposes from 
existing exemptible accounts, any other person (for purposes of this 
paragraph (d), a ``payroll customer'') that:
    (A) Has maintained a transaction account, as defined in paragraph 
(d)(6)(ix) of this section, at the bank for at least 12 months;

[[Page 393]]

    (B) Operates a firm that regularly withdraws more than $10,000 in 
order to pay its United States employees in currency; and
    (C) Is incorporated or organized under the laws of the United States 
or a State, or is registered as and eligible to do business within the 
United States or a State.
    (3) Initial designation of exempt persons--(i) General. A bank must 
designate each exempt person with which it engages in transactions in 
currency by the close of the 30-day period beginning after the day of 
the first reportable transaction in currency with that person sought to 
be exempted from reporting under the terms of this paragraph (d). Except 
as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, designation by a 
bank of an exempt person shall be made by a single filing of Treasury 
Form TD F 90-22.53. (A bank is not required to file a Treasury Form TD F 
90-22.53 with respect to the transfer of currency to or from any of the 
twelve Federal Reserve Banks.) The designation must be made separately 
by each bank that treats the person in question as an exempt person, 
except as provided in paragraph (d)(6)(vi) of this section. The 
designation requirements of this paragraph (d)(3) apply whether or not 
the particular exempt person to be designated has previously been 
treated as exempt from the reporting requirements of prior Sec. 
103.22(a) under the rules contained in 31 CFR 103.22(a) through (g), as 
in effect on October 20, 1998 (see 31 CFR Parts 0 to 199 revised as of 
July 1, 1998). A special transitional rule, which extends the time for 
initial designation for customers that have been previously treated as 
exempt under such prior rules, is contained in paragraph (d)(11) of this 
section.
    (ii) Special rules for banks. When designating another bank as an 
exempt person, a bank must either make the filing required by paragraph 
(d)(3)(i) of this section or file, in such a format and manner as FinCEN 
may specify, a current list of its domestic bank customers. In the event 
that a bank files its current list of domestic bank customers, the bank 
must make the filing as described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section 
for each bank that is a new customer and for which an exemption is 
sought under this paragraph (d).
    (4) Annual review. The information supporting each designation of an 
exempt person, and the application to each account of an exempt person 
described in paragraphs (d)(2)(vi) or (d)(2)(vii) of this section of the 
monitoring system required to be maintained by paragraph (d)(9)(ii) of 
this section, must be reviewed and verified at least once each year.
    (5) Biennial filing with respect to certain exempt persons--(i) 
General. A biennial filing, as described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this 
section, is required for continuation of the treatment as an exempt 
person of a customer described in paragraph (d)(2)(vi) or (vii) of this 
section. No biennial filing is required for continuation of the 
treatment as an exempt person of a customer described in paragraphs 
(d)(2)(i) through (v) of this section.
    (ii) Non-listed businesses and payroll customers. The designation of 
a non-listed business or a payroll customer as an exempt person must be 
renewed biennially, beginning on March 15 of the second calendar year 
following the year in which the first designation of such customer as an 
exempt person is made, and every other March 15 thereafter, on Treasury 
Form TD F 90-22.53. Biennial renewals must include a statement 
certifying that the bank's system of monitoring the transactions in 
currency of an exempt person for suspicious activity, required to be 
maintained by paragraph (d)(9)(ii) of this section, has been applied as 
necessary, but at least annually, to the account of the exempt person to 
whom the biennial renewal applies. Biennial renewals also must include 
information about any change in control of the exempt person involved of 
which the bank knows (or should know on the basis of its records).
    (6) Operating rules--(i) General rule. Subject to the specific rules 
of this paragraph (d), a bank must take such steps to assure itself that 
a person is an exempt person (within the meaning of the applicable 
provision of paragraph (d)(2) of this section), to document the basis 
for its conclusions, and document its compliance, with the

[[Page 394]]

terms of this paragraph (d), that a reasonable and prudent bank would 
take and document to protect itself from loan or other fraud or loss 
based on misidentification of a person's status, and in the case of the 
monitoring system requirement set forth in paragraph (d)(9)(ii) of this 
section, such steps that a reasonable and prudent bank would take and 
document to identify suspicious transactions as required by paragraph 
(d)(9)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Governmental departments and agencies. A bank may treat a 
person as a governmental department, agency, or entity if the name of 
such person reasonably indicates that it is described in paragraph 
(d)(2)(ii) or (d)(2)(iii) of this section, or if such person is known 
generally in the community to be a State, the District of Columbia, a 
tribal government, a Territory or Insular Possession of the United 
States, or a political subdivision or a wholly-owned agency or 
instrumentality of any of the foregoing. An entity generally exercises 
governmental authority on behalf of the United States, a State, or a 
political subdivision, for purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this 
section, only if its authorities include one or more of the powers to 
tax, to exercise the authority of eminent domain, or to exercise police 
powers with respect to matters within its jurisdiction. Examples of 
entities that exercise governmental authority include, but are not 
limited to, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority and the Port Authority of 
New York and New Jersey.
    (iii) Stock exchange listings. In determining whether a person is 
described in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section, a bank may rely on 
any New York, American or Nasdaq Stock Market listing published in a 
newspaper of general circulation, on any commonly accepted or published 
stock symbol guide, on any information contained in the Securities and 
Exchange Commission ``Edgar'' System, or on any information contained on 
an Internet World-Wide Web site or sites maintained by the New York 
Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, or the National Association 
of Securities Dealers.
    (iv) Listed company subsidiaries. In determining whether a person is 
described in paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section, a bank may rely upon:
    (A) Any reasonably authenticated corporate officer's certificate;
    (B) Any reasonably authenticated photocopy of Internal Revenue 
Service Form 851 (Affiliation Schedule) or the equivalent thereof for 
the appropriate tax year; or
    (C) A person's Annual Report or Form 10-K, as filed in each case 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    (v) Aggregated accounts. In determining the qualification of a 
customer as a non-listed business or a payroll customer, a bank may 
treat all exemptible accounts of the customer as a single account. If a 
bank elects to treat all exemptible accounts of a customer as a single 
account, the bank must continue to treat such accounts consistently as a 
single account for purposes of determining the qualification of the 
customer as a non-listed business or payroll customer.
    (vi) Affiliated banks. The designation required by paragraph (d)(3) 
of this section may be made by a parent bank holding company or one of 
its bank subsidiaries on behalf of all bank subsidiaries of the holding 
company, so long as the designation lists each bank subsidiary to which 
the designation shall apply.
    (vii) Sole proprietorships. A sole proprietorship may be treated as 
a non-listed business if it otherwise meets the requirements of 
paragraph (d)(2)(vi) of this section, as applicable. In addition, a sole 
proprietorship may be treated as a payroll customer if it otherwise 
meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(vii) of this section, as 
applicable.
    (viii) Ineligible businesses. A business engaged primarily in one or 
more of the following activities may not be treated as a non-listed 
business for purposes of this paragraph (d): serving as financial 
institutions or agents of financial institutions of any type; purchase 
or sale to customers of motor vehicles of any kind, vessels, aircraft, 
farm equipment or mobile homes; the practice of law, accountancy, or 
medicine; auctioning of goods; chartering or operation of ships, buses, 
or aircraft;

[[Page 395]]

gaming of any kind (other than licensed parimutuel betting at race 
tracks); investment advisory services or investment banking services; 
real estate brokerage; pawn brokerage; title insurance and real estate 
closing; trade union activities; and any other activities that may be 
specified by FinCEN. A business that engages in multiple business 
activities may be treated as a non-listed business so long as no more 
than 50% of its gross revenues is derived from one or more of the 
ineligible business activities listed in this paragraph (d)(6)(viii).
    (ix) Exemptible accounts of a non-listed business or payroll 
customer. The exemptible accounts of a non-listed business or payroll 
customer include transaction accounts and money market deposit accounts. 
However, money market deposit accounts maintained other than in 
connection with a commercial enterprise are not exemptible accounts. A 
transaction account, for purposes of this paragraph (d), is any account 
described in section 19(b)(1)(C) of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. 
461(b)(1)(C), and its implementing regulations (12 CFR part 204). A 
money market deposit account, for purposes of this paragraph (d), is any 
interest-bearing account that is described as a money market deposit 
account in 12 CFR 204.2(d)(2).
    (x) Documentation. The records maintained by a bank to document its 
compliance with and administration of the rules of this paragraph (d) 
shall be maintained in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 103.38.
    (7) Limitation on exemption. A transaction carried out by an exempt 
person as an agent for another person who is the beneficial owner of the 
funds that are the subject of a transaction in currency is not subject 
to the exemption from reporting contained in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section.
    (8) Limitation on liability. (i) No bank shall be subject to penalty 
under this part for failure to file a report required by paragraph (b) 
of this section with respect to a transaction in currency by an exempt 
person with respect to which the requirements of this paragraph (d) have 
been satisfied, unless the bank:
    (A) Knowingly files false or incomplete information with respect to 
the transaction or the customer engaging in the transaction; or
    (B) Has reason to believe that the customer does not meet the 
criteria established by this paragraph (d) for treatment of the 
transactor as an exempt person or that the transaction is not a 
transaction of the exempt person.
    (ii) Subject to the specific terms of this paragraph (d), and absent 
any specific knowledge of information indicating that a customer no 
longer meets the requirements of an exempt person, a bank satisfies the 
requirements of this paragraph (d) to the extent it continues to treat 
that customer as an exempt person until the date of that customer's next 
periodic review, which, as required by paragraph (d)(4) of this section, 
shall occur no less than once each year.
    (iii) A bank that files a report with respect to a currency 
transaction by an exempt person rather than treating such person as 
exempt shall remain subject, with respect to each such report, to the 
rules for filing reports, and the penalties for filing false or 
incomplete reports that are applicable to reporting of transactions in 
currency by persons other than exempt persons.
    (9) Obligations to file suspicious activity reports and maintain 
system for monitoring transactions in currency. (i) Nothing in this 
paragraph (d) relieves a bank of the obligation, or reduces in any way 
such bank's obligation, to file a report required by Sec. 103.21 with 
respect to any transaction, including any transaction in currency that a 
bank knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect is a transaction or 
attempted transaction that is described in Sec. 103.21(a)(2)(i), (ii), 
or (iii), or relieves a bank of any reporting or recordkeeping 
obligation imposed by this part (except the obligation to report 
transactions in currency pursuant to this section to the extent provided 
in this paragraph (d)). Thus, for example, a sharp increase from one 
year to the next in the gross total of currency transactions made by an 
exempt customer, or similarly anomalous transaction trends or patterns, 
may trigger the obligations of a bank under Sec. 103.21.
    (ii) Consistent with its annual review obligations under paragraph 
(d)(4)of this section, a bank shall establish and

[[Page 396]]

maintain a monitoring system that is reasonably designed to detect, for 
each account of a non-listed business or payroll customer, those 
transactions in currency involving such account that would require a 
bank to file a suspicious transaction report. The statement in the 
preceding sentence with respect to accounts of non-listed and payroll 
customers does not limit the obligation of banks generally to take the 
steps necessary to satisfy the terms of paragraph (d)(9)(i) of this 
section and Sec. 103.21 with respect to all exempt persons.
    (10) Revocation. The status of any person as an exempt person under 
this paragraph (d) may be revoked by FinCEN by written notice, which may 
be provided by publication in the Federal Register in appropriate 
situations, on such terms as are specified in such notice. Without any 
action on the part of the Treasury Department and subject to the 
limitation on liability contained in paragraph (d)(8)(ii) of this 
section:
    (i) The status of an entity as an exempt person under paragraph 
(d)(2)(iv) of this section ceases once such entity ceases to be listed 
on the applicable stock exchange; and
    (ii) The status of a subsidiary as an exempt person under paragraph 
(d)(2)(v) of this section ceases once such subsidiary ceases to have at 
least 51 per cent of its common stock or analogous equity interest owned 
by a listed entity.
    (11) Transitional rule. (i) No accounts may be newly granted an 
exemption or placed on an exempt list on or after October 21, 1998, 
under the rules contained in 31 CFR 103.22(b) through (g), as in effect 
on October 20, 1998 (see 31 CFR Parts 0 to 199 revised as of July 1, 
1998).
    (ii) If a bank properly treated an account (a ``previously exempted 
account'') as exempt on October 20, 1998 under the rules contained in 31 
CFR 103.22(b) through (g), as in effect on October 20, 1998 (see 31 CFR 
Parts 0 to 199 revised as of July 1, 1998), it may continue to treat 
such account as exempt under such prior rules with respect to 
transactions in currency occurring on or before June 30, 2000, provided 
that it does so consistently until the earlier of June 30, 2000, and the 
date on which the bank makes the designation or the determination 
described in paragraph (d)(11)(iii) of this section. A bank that 
continues to treat a previously exempted account as exempt under the 
prior rules, and for the period, specified in the preceding sentence, 
shall remain subject to such prior rules, and to the penalties for 
failing to comply therewith, with respect to transactions in currency 
occurring during such period.
    (iii) A bank must, on or before July 1, 2000, either designate the 
holder of a previously exempted account as an exempt person under 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section or determine that it may not or will 
not treat such holder as an exempt person under paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section (so that it will be required to make reports under paragraph (a) 
of this section with respect to transactions in currency by such person 
occurring on or after the date of determination, but no later than July 
1, 2000). A bank that initially does not designate the holder of a 
previously exempted account as an exempt person for periods beginning 
after June 30, 2000, may later make such a designation, to the extent 
otherwise permitted to do so by this paragraph (d), for periods after 
the effective date of such designation.

Sec. 103.23  Reports of transportation of currency or monetary 
instruments.

    (a) Each person who physically transports, mails, or ships, or 
causes to be physically transported, mailed, or shipped, or attempts to 
physically transport, mail or ship, or attempts to cause to be 
physically transported, mailed or shipped, currency or other monetary 
instruments in an aggregate amount exceeding $10,000 at one time from 
the United States to any place outside the United States, or into the 
United States from any place outside the United States, shall make a 
report thereof. A person is deemed to have caused such transportation, 
mailing or shipping when he aids, abets, counsels, commands, procures, 
or requests it to

[[Page 397]]

be done by a financial institution or any other person.
    (b) Each person who receives in the U.S. currency or other monetary 
instruments in an aggregate amount exceeding $10,000 at one time which 
have been transported, mailed, or shipped to such person from any place 
outside the United States with respect to which a report has not been 
filed under paragraph (a) of this section, whether or not required to be 
filed thereunder, shall make a report thereof, stating the amount, the 
date of receipt, the form of monetary instruments, and the person from 
whom received.
    (c) This section shall not require reports by:
    (1) A Federal Reserve;
    (2) A bank, a foreign bank, or a broker or dealer in securities, in 
respect to currency or other monetary instruments mailed or shipped 
through the postal service or by common carrier;
    (3) A commercial bank or trust company organized under the laws of 
any State or of the United States with respect to overland shipments of 
currency or monetary instruments shipped to or received from an 
established customer maintaining a deposit relationship with the bank, 
in amounts which the bank may reasonably conclude do not exceed amounts 
commensurate with the customary conduct of the business, industry or 
profession of the customer concerned;
    (4) A person who is not a citizen or resident of the United States 
in respect to currency or other monetary instruments mailed or shipped 
from abroad to a bank or broker or dealer in securities through the 
postal service or by common carrier;
    (5) A common carrier of passengers in respect to currency or other 
monetary instruments in the possession of its passengers;
    (6) A common carrier of goods in respect to shipments of currency or 
monetary instruments not declared to be such by the shipper;
    (7) A travelers' check issuer or its agent in respect to the 
transportation of travelers' checks prior to their delivery to selling 
agents for eventual sale to the public;
    (8) By a person with respect to a restrictively endorsed traveler's 
check that is in the collection and reconciliation process after the 
traveler's check has been negotiated,
    (9) Nor by a person engaged as a business in the transportation of 
currency, monetary instruments and other commercial papers with respect 
to the transportation of currency or other monetary instruments overland 
between established offices of banks or brokers or dealers in securities 
and foreign persons.
    (d) A transfer of funds through normal banking procedures which does 
not involve the physical transportation of currency or monetary 
instruments is not required to be reported by this section. This section 
does not require that more than one report be filed covering a 
particular transportation, mailing or shipping of currency or other 
monetary instruments with respect to which a complete and truthful 
report has been filed by a person. However, no person required by 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section to file a report shall be excused 
from liability for failure to do so if, in fact, a complete and truthful 
report has not been filed.

<R05>
Sec. 103.25  Reports of transactions with foreign financial agencies.

    (a) Promulgation of reporting requirements. The Secretary, when he 
deems appropriate, may promulgate regulations requiring specified 
financial institutions to file reports of certain transactions with 
designated foreign financial agencies. If any such regulation is issued 
as a final rule without notice and opportunity for public comment, then 
a finding of good cause for dispensing with notice and comment in 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(b) will be included in the regulation. If 
any such regulation is not published in the Federal Register, then any 
financial institution subject to the regulation will be named and 
personally served or otherwise given actual notice in accordance with 5 
U.S.C. 553(b). If a financial institution is given notice of a reporting 
requirement under this section by means other than publication in the 
Federal Register, the Secretary may prohibit disclosure of the existence 
or provisions of that reporting requirement to the designated foreign 
financial agency or agencies and to any other party.
    (b) Information subject to reporting requirements. A regulation 
promulgated pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall designate 
one or more of the following categories of information to be reported:
    (1) Checks or drafts, including traveler's checks, received by 
respondent financial institution for collection or credit to the account 
of a foreign financial agency, sent by respondent financial institution 
to a foreign country for collection or payment, drawn by respondent 
financial institution on a foreign financial agency, drawn by a foreign 
financial agency on respondent financial institution--including the 
following information.
    (i) Name of maker or drawer;
    (ii) Name of drawee or drawee financial institution;
    (iii) Name of payee;
    (iv) Date and amount of instrument;
    (v) Names of all endorsers.
    (2) Transmittal orders received by a respondent financial 
institution from a foreign financial agency or sent by respondent 
financial institution to a foreign financial agency, including all 
information maintained by that institution pursuant to Sec. 103.33.
    (3) Loans made by respondent financial institution to or through a 
foreign financial agency--including the following information:
    (i) Name of borrower;
    (ii) Name of person acting for borrower;
    (iii) Date and amount of loan;
    (iv) Terms of repayment;
    (v) Name of guarantor;
    (vi) Rate of interest;
    (vii) Method of disbursing proceeds;
    (viii) Collateral for loan.
    (4) Commercial paper received or shipped by the respondent financial 
institution--including the following information:
    (i) Name of maker;
    (ii) Date and amount of paper;
    (iii) Due date;
    (iv) Certificate number;
    (v) Amount of transaction.
    (5) Stocks received or shipped by respondent financial institution--
including the following information:
    (i) Name of corporation;
    (ii) Type of stock;
    (iii) Certificate number;
    (iv) Number of shares;
    (v) Date of certificate;
    (vi) Name of registered holder;
    (vii) Amount of transaction.
    (6) Bonds received or shipped by respondent financial institution--
including the following information:
    (i) Name of issuer;
    (ii) Bond number;
    (iii) Type of bond series;
    (iv) Date issued;
    (v) Due date;
    (vi) Rate of interest;
    (vii) Amount of transaction;
    (viii) Name of registered holder.
    (7) Certificates of deposit received or shipped by respondent 
financial institution--including the following information:
    (i) Name and address of issuer;
    (ii) Date issued;
    (iii) Dollar amount;
    (iv) Name of registered holder;

[[Page 399]]

    (v) Due date;
    (vi) Rate of interest;
    (vii) Certificate number;
    (viii) Name and address of issuing agent.
    (c) Scope of reports. In issuing regulations as provided in 
paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary will prescribe:
    (1) A reasonable classification of financial institutions subject to 
or exempt from a reporting requirement;
    (2) A foreign country to which a reporting requirement applies if 
the Secretary decides that applying the requirement to all foreign 
countries is unnecessary or undesirable;
    (3) The magnitude of transactions subject to a reporting 
requirement; and
    (4) The kind of transaction subject to or exempt from a reporting 
requirement.
    (d) Form of reports. Regulations issued pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section may prescribe the manner in which the information is to be 
reported. However, the Secretary may authorize a designated financial 
institution to report in a different manner if the institution 
demonstrates to the Secretary that the form of the required report is 
unnecessarily burdensome on the institution as prescribed; that a report 
in a different form will provide all the information the Secretary deems 
necessary; and that submission of the information in a different manner 
will not unduly hinder the effective administration of this part.
    (e) Limitations. (1) In issuing regulations under paragraph (a) of 
this section, the Secretary shall consider the need to avoid impeding or 
controlling the export or import of monetary instruments and the need to 
avoid burdening unreasonably a person making a transaction with a 
foreign financial agency.
    (2) The Secretary shall not issue a regulation under paragraph (a) 
of this section for the purpose of obtaining individually identifiable 
account information concerning a customer, as defined by the Right to 
Financial Privacy Act (12 U.S.C. 3401 et seq.), where that customer is 
already the subject of an ongoing investigation for possible violation 
of the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, or is known by 
the Secretary to be the subject of an investigation for possible 
violation of any other Federal law.
    (3) The Secretary may issue a regulation pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this section requiring a financial institution to report transactions 
completed prior to the date it received notice of the reporting 
requirement. However, with respect to completed transactions, a 
financial institution may be required to provide information only from 
records required to be maintained pursuant to Subpart C of this part, or 
any other provision of state or Federal law, or otherwise maintained in 
the regular course of business.

    (a) If the Secretary of the Treasury finds, upon the Secretary's own 
initiative or at the request of an appropriate Federal or State law 
enforcement official, that reasonable grounds exist for concluding that 
additional recordkeeping and/or reporting requirements are necessary to 
carry out the purposes of this part and to prevent persons from evading 
the reporting/recordkeeping requirements of this part, the Secretary may

domestic financial institutions in a geographic area and any other 
person participating in the type of transaction to file a report in the 
manner and to the extent specified in such order. The order shall

effective until made in writing by the Secretary.
    (3) Unless otherwise specified in the order, a bank receiving an 
order under this section may continue to use the exemptions granted 
under Sec. 103.22 of this part prior to the receipt of the order, but

Sec. 103.28  Identification required.

    Before concluding any transaction with respect to which a report is 
required under Sec. 103.22, a financial institution shall verify and 
record the name and address of the individual presenting a transaction, 
as well as record the identity, account number, and the social security 
or taxpayer identification number, if any, of any person or entity on 
whose behalf such transaction is to be effected. Verification of the 
identity of an individual who indicates that he or she is an alien or is 
not a resident of the United States must be made by passport, alien 
identification card, or other official document evidencing nationality 
or residence (e.g., a Provincial driver's license with indication of 
home address). Verification of identity in any other case shall be made 
by examination of a document, other than a bank signature card, that is 
normally acceptable within the banking community as a means of 
identification when cashing checks for nondepositors (e.g., a drivers 
license or credit card). A bank signature card may be relied upon only 
if it was issued after documents establishing the identity of the 
individual were examined and notation of the specific information was 
made on the signature card. In each instance, the specific identifying 
information (i.e., the account number of the credit card, the driver's 
license number, etc.) used in verifying the identity of the customer 
shall be recorded on the report, and the mere notation of ``known 
customer'' or ``bank signature card on file'' on the report is 
prohibited.

Sec. 103.29  Purchases of bank checks and drafts, cashier's checks, 
money orders and traveler's checks.

    (a) No financial institution may issue or sell a bank check or 
draft, cashier's check, money order or traveler's check for $3,000 or 
more in currency unless it maintains records of the following 
information, which must be obtained for each issuance or sale of one or 
more of these instruments to any individual purchaser which involves 
currency in amounts of $3,000-$10,000 inclusive:
    (1) If the purchaser has a deposit account with the financial 
institution:

    (E) The amount in dollars of each of the instrument(s) purchased.
    (ii) In addition, the financial institution must verify that the 
individual is a deposit accountholder or must verify the individual's 
identity. Verification may be either through a signature card or other 
file or record at the financial institution provided the deposit 
accountholder's name and address were verified previously and that 
information was recorded on the signature card or other file or record; 
or by examination of a document which is normally acceptable within the 
banking community as a means of identification when cashing checks for 
nondepositors and which contains the name and address of the purchaser. 
If the deposit accountholder's identity has not been verified 
previously, the financial institution shall verify the deposit

[[Page 402]]

accountholder's identity by examination of a document which is normally 
acceptable within the banking community as a means of identification 
when cashing checks for nondepositors and which contains the name and 
address of the purchaser, and shall record the specific identifying 
information (e.g., State of issuance and number of driver's license).
    (2) If the purchaser does not have a deposit account with the 
financial institution:
    (i)(A) The name and address of the purchaser;
    (B) The social security number of the purchaser, or if the purchaser 
is an alien and does not have a social security number, the alien 
identification number;
    (C) The date of birth of the purchaser;
    (D) The date of purchase;
    (E) The type(s) of instrument(s) purchased;
    (F) The serial number(s) of the instrument(s) purchased; and
    (G) The amount in dollars of each of the instrument(s) purchased.
    (ii) In addition, the financial institution shall verify the 
purchaser's name and address by examination of a document which is 
normally acceptable within the banking community as a means of 
identification when cashing checks for nondepositors and which contains 
the name and address of the purchaser, and shall record the specific 
identifying information (e.g., State of issuance and number of driver's 
license).
    (b) Contemporaneous purchases of the same or different types of 
instruments totaling $3,000 or more shall be treated as one purchase. 
Multiple purchases during one business day totaling $3,000 or more shall 
be treated as one purchase if an individual employee, director, officer, 
or partner of the financial institution has knowledge that these 
purchases have occurred.
    (c) Records required to be kept shall be retained by the financial 
institution for a period of five years and shall be made available to 
the Secretary upon request at any time.

[59 FR 52252, Oct. 17, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 103.30  Reports relating to currency in excess of $10,000 received 
in a trade or business.

    (a) Reporting requirement--(1) Reportable transactions--(i) In 
general. Any person (solely for purposes of section 5331 of title 31, 
United States Code and this section, ``person'' shall have the same 
meaning as under 26 U.S.C. 7701 (a)(1)) who, in the course of a trade or 
business in which such person is engaged, receives currency in excess of 
$10,000 in 1 transaction (or 2 or more related transactions) shall, 
except as otherwise provided, make a report of information with respect 
to the receipt of currency. This section does not apply to amounts 
received in a transaction reported under 31 U.S.C. 5313 and Sec. 
103.22.
    (ii) Certain financial transactions. Section 6050I of title 26 of 
the United States Code requires persons to report information about 
financial transactions to the IRS, and 31 U.S.C. 5331 requires persons 
to report similar information about certain transactions to the 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. This information shall be reported 
on the same form as prescribed by the Secretary.
    (2) Currency received for the account of another. Currency in excess 
of $10,000 received by a person for the account of another must be 
reported under this section. Thus, for example, a person who collects 
delinquent accounts receivable for an automobile dealer must report with 
respect to the receipt of currency in excess of $10,000 from the 
collection of a particular account even though the proceeds of the 
collection are credited to the account of the automobile dealer (i.e., 
where the rights to the proceeds from the account are retained by the 
automobile dealer and the collection is made on a fee-for-service 
basis).
    (3) Currency received by agents--(i) General rule. Except as 
provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, a person who in the 
course of a trade or business acts as an agent (or in some other similar 
capacity) and receives currency in excess of $10,000 from a principal 
must report the receipt of currency under this section.
    (ii) Exception. An agent who receives currency from a principal and 
uses all

[[Page 403]]

of the currency within 15 days in a currency transaction (the ``second 
currency transaction'') which is reportable under section 5312 of title 
31, or 31 U.S.C. 5331 and this section, and who discloses the name, 
address, and taxpayer identification number of the principal to the 
recipient in the second currency transaction need not report the initial 
receipt of currency under this section. An agent will be deemed to have 
met the disclosure requirements of this paragraph (a)(3)(ii) if the 
agent discloses only the name of the principal and the agent knows that 
the recipient has the principal's address and taxpayer identification 
number.
    (iii) Example. The following example illustrates the application of 
the rules in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section:

    Example. B, the principal, gives D, an attorney, $75,000 in currency 
to purchase real property on behalf of B. Within 15 days D purchases 
real property for currency from E, a real estate developer, and 
discloses to E, B's name, address, and taxpayer identification number. 
Because the transaction qualifies for the exception provided in 
paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, D need not report with respect to 
the initial receipt of currency under this section. The exception does 
not apply, however, if D pays E by means other than currency, or effects 
the purchase more than 15 days following receipt of the currency from B, 
or fails to disclose B's name, address, and taxpayer identification 
number (assuming D does not know that E already has B's address and 
taxpayer identification number), or purchases the property from a person 
whose sale of the property is not in the course of that person's trade 
or business. In any such case, D is required to report the receipt of 
currency from B under this section.

    (b) Multiple payments. The receipt of multiple currency deposits or 
currency installment payments (or other similar payments or prepayments) 
relating to a single transaction (or two or more related transactions), 
is reported as set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this 
section.
    (1) Initial payment in excess of $10,000. If the initial payment 
exceeds $10,000, the recipient must report the initial payment within 15 
days of its receipt.
    (2) Initial payment of $10,000 or less. If the initial payment does 
not exceed $10,000, the recipient must aggregate the initial payment and 
subsequent payments made within one year of the initial payment until 
the aggregate amount exceeds $10,000, and report with respect to the 
aggregate amount within 15 days after receiving the payment that causes 
the aggregate amount to exceed $10,000.
    (3) Subsequent payments. In addition to any other required report, a 
report must be made each time that previously unreportable payments made 
within a 12-month period with respect to a single transaction (or two or 
more related transactions), individually or in the aggregate, exceed 
$10,000. The report must be made within 15 days after receiving the 
payment in excess of $10,000 or the payment that causes the aggregate 
amount received in the 12-month period to exceed $10,000. (If more than 
one report would otherwise be required for multiple currency payments 
within a 15-day period that relate to a single transaction (or two or 
more related transactions), the recipient may make a single combined 
report with respect to the payments. The combined report must be made no 
later than the date by which the first of the separate reports would 
otherwise be required to be made.)
    (4) Example. The following example illustrates the application of 
the rules in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section:

    Example. On January 10, Year 1, M receives an initial payment in 
currency of $11,000 with respect to a transaction. M receives subsequent 
payments in currency with respect to the same transaction of $4,000 on 
February 15, Year 1, $6,000 on March 20, Year 1, and $12,000 on May 15, 
Year 1. M must make a report with respect to the payment received on 
January 10, Year 1, by January 25, Year 1. M must also make a report 
with respect to the payments totaling $22,000 received from February 15, 
Year 1, through May 15, Year 1. This report must be made by May 30, Year 
1, that is, within 15 days of the date that the subsequent payments, all 
of which were received within a 12-month period, exceeded $10,000.

    (c) Meaning of terms. The following definitions apply for purposes 
of this section--
    (1) Currency. Solely for purposes of 31 U.S.C. 5331 and this 
section, currency means--
    (i) The coin and currency of the United States or of any other 
country,

[[Page 404]]

which circulate in and are customarily used and accepted as money in the 
country in which issued; and
    (ii) A cashier's check (by whatever name called, including 
``treasurer's check'' and ``bank check''), bank draft, traveler's check, 
or money order having a face amount of not more than $10,000--
    (A) Received in a designated reporting transaction as defined in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section (except as provided in paragraphs 
(c)(3), (4), and (5) of this section), or
    (B) Received in any transaction in which the recipient knows that 
such instrument is being used in an attempt to avoid the reporting of 
the transaction under section 5331 and this section.
    (2) Designated reporting transaction. A designated reporting 
transaction is a retail sale (or the receipt of funds by a broker or 
other intermediary in connection with a retail sale) of--
    (i) A consumer durable, (ii) A collectible, or
    (iii) A travel or entertainment activity.
    (3) Exception for certain loans. A cashier's check, bank draft, 
traveler's check, or money order received in a designated reporting 
transaction is not treated as currency pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section if the instrument constitutes the proceeds 
of a loan from a bank. The recipient may rely on a copy of the loan 
document, a written statement from the bank, or similar documentation 
(such as a written lien instruction from the issuer of the instrument) 
to substantiate that the instrument constitutes loan proceeds.
    (4) Exception for certain installment sales. A cashier's check, bank 
draft, traveler's check, or money order received in a designated 
reporting transaction is not treated as currency pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section if the instrument is received in payment 
on a promissory note or an installment sales contract (including a lease 
that is considered to be a sale for Federal income tax purposes). 
However, the preceding sentence applies only if--
    (i) Promissory notes or installment sales contracts with the same or 
substantially similar terms are used in the ordinary course of the 
recipient's trade or business in connection with sales to ultimate 
consumers; and
    (ii) The total amount of payments with respect to the sale that are 
received on or before the 60th day after the date of the sale does not 
exceed 50 percent of the purchase price of the sale.
    (5) Exception for certain down payment plans. A cashier's check, 
bank draft, traveler's check, or money order received in a designated 
reporting transaction is not treated as currency pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section if the instrument is received pursuant to 
a payment plan requiring one or more down payments and the payment of 
the balance of the purchase price by a date no later than the date of 
the sale (in the case of an item of travel or entertainment, a date no 
later than the earliest date that any item of travel or entertainment 
pertaining to the same trip or event is furnished). However, the 
preceding sentence applies only if--
    (i) The recipient uses payment plans with the same or substantially 
similar terms in the ordinary course of its trade or business in 
connection with sales to ultimate consumers; and
    (ii) The instrument is received more than 60 days prior to the date 
of the sale (in the case of an item of travel or entertainment, the date 
on which the final payment is due).
    (6) Examples. The following examples illustrate the definition of 
``currency'' set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this 
section:

    Example 1. D, an individual, purchases gold coins from M, a coin 
dealer, for $13,200. D tenders to M in payment United States currency in 
the amount of $6,200 and a cashier's check in the face amount of $7,000 
which D had purchased. Because the sale is a designated reporting 
transaction, the cashier's check is treated as currency for purposes of 
31 U.S.C. 5331 and this section. Therefore, because M has received more 
than $10,000 in currency with respect to the transaction, M must make 
the report required by 31 U.S.C. 5331 and this section.
    Example 2. E, an individual, purchases an automobile from Q, an 
automobile dealer, for $11,500. E tenders to Q in payment United States 
currency in the amount of $2,000 and a cashier's check payable to E and 
Q in the

[[Page 405]]

amount of $9,500. The cashier's check constitutes the proceeds of a loan 
from the bank issuing the check. The origin of the proceeds is evident 
from provisions inserted by the bank on the check that instruct the 
dealer to cause a lien to be placed on the vehicle as security for the 
loan. The sale of the automobile is a designated reporting transaction. 
However, under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, because E has furnished 
Q documentary information establishing that the cashier's check 
constitutes the proceeds of a loan from the bank issuing the check, the 
cashier's check is not treated as currency pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section.
    Example 3. F, an individual, purchases an item of jewelry from S, a 
retail jeweler, for $12,000. F gives S traveler's checks totaling $2,400 
and pays the balance with a personal check payable to S in the amount of 
$9,600. Because the sale is a designated reporting transaction, the 
traveler's checks are treated as currency for purposes of section 5331 
and this section. However, because the personal check is not treated as 
currency for purposes of section 5331 and this section, S has not 
received more than $10,000 in currency in the transaction and no report 
is required to be filed under section 5331 and this section.
    Example 4. G, an individual, purchases a boat from T, a boat dealer, 
for $16,500. G pays T with a cashier's check payable to T in the amount 
of $16,500. The cashier's check is not treated as currency because the 
face amount of the check is more than $10,000. Thus, no report is 
required to be made by T under section 5331 and this section.
    Example 5. H, an individual, arranges with W, a travel agent, for 
the chartering of a passenger aircraft to transport a group of 
individuals to a sports event in another city. H also arranges with W 
for hotel accommodations for the group and for admission tickets to the 
sports event. In payment, H tenders to W money orders which H had 
previously purchased. The total amount of the money orders, none of 
which individually exceeds $10,000 in face amount, exceeds $10,000. 
Because the transaction is a designated reporting transaction, the money 
orders are treated as currency for purposes of section 5331 and this 
section. Therefore, because W has received more than $10,000 in currency 
with respect to the transaction, W must make the report required by 
section 5331 and this section.

    (7) Consumer durable. The term consumer durable means an item of 
tangible personal property of a type that is suitable under ordinary 
usage for personal consumption or use, that can reasonably be expected 
to be useful for at least 1 year under ordinary usage, and that has a 
sales price of more than $10,000. Thus, for example, a $20,000 
automobile is a consumer durable (whether or not it is sold for business 
use), but a $20,000 dump truck or a $20,000 factory machine is not.
    (8) Collectible. The term collectible means an item described in 
paragraphs (A) through (D) of section 408 (m)(2) of title 26 of the 
United States Code (determined without regard to section 408 (m)(3) of 
title 26 of the United States Code).
    (9) Travel or entertainment activity. The term travel or 
entertainment activity means an item of travel or entertainment (within 
the meaning of 26 CFR 1.274-2(b)(1)) pertaining to a single trip or 
event where the aggregate sales price of the item and all other items 
pertaining to the same trip or event that are sold in the same 
transaction (or related transactions) exceeds $10,000.
    (10) Retail sale. The term retail sale means any sale (whether for 
resale or for any other purpose) made in the course of a trade or 
business if that trade or business principally consists of making sales 
to ultimate consumers.
    (11) Trade or business. The term trade or business has the same 
meaning as under section 162 of title 26, United States Code.
    (12) Transaction. (i) Solely for purposes of 31 U.S.C. 5331 and this 
section, the term transaction means the underlying event precipitating 
the payer's transfer of currency to the recipient. In this context, 
transactions include (but are not limited to) a sale of goods or 
services; a sale of real property; a sale of intangible property; a 
rental of real or personal property; an exchange of currency for other 
currency; the establishment or maintenance of or contribution to a 
custodial, trust, or escrow arrangement; a payment of a preexisting 
debt; a conversion of currency to a negotiable instrument; a 
reimbursement for expenses paid; or the making or repayment of a loan. A 
transaction may not be divided into multiple transactions in order to 
avoid reporting under this section.
    (ii) The term related transactions means any transaction conducted 
between a payer (or its agent) and a recipient of currency in a 24-hour 
period. Additionally, transactions conducted

[[Page 406]]

between a payer (or its agent) and a currency recipient during a period 
of more than 24 hours are related if the recipient knows or has reason 
to know that each transaction is one of a series of connected 
transactions.
    (iii) The following examples illustrate the definition of paragraphs 
(c)(12) (i) and (ii) of this section:

    Example 1. A person has a tacit agreement with a gold dealer to 
purchase $36,000 in gold bullion. The $36,000 purchase represents a 
single transaction under paragraph (c)(12)(i) of this section and the 
reporting requirements of this section cannot be avoided by recasting 
the single sales transaction into 4 separate $9,000 sales transactions.
    Example 2. An attorney agrees to represent a client in a criminal 
case with the attorney's fee to be determined on an hourly basis. In the 
first month in which the attorney represents the client, the bill for 
the attorney's services comes to $8,000 which the client pays in 
currency. In the second month in which the attorney represents the 
client, the bill for the attorney's services comes to $4,000, which the 
client again pays in currency. The aggregate amount of currency paid 
($12,000) relates to a single transaction as defined in paragraph 
(c)(12)(i) of this section, the sale of legal services relating to the 
criminal case, and the receipt of currency must be reported under this 
section.
    Example 3. A person intends to contribute a total of $45,000 to a 
trust fund, and the trustee of the fund knows or has reason to know of 
that intention. The $45,000 contribution is a single transaction under 
paragraph (c)(12)(i) of this section and the reporting requirement of 
this section cannot be avoided by the grantor's making five separate 
$9,000 contributions of currency to a single fund or by making five 
$9,000 contributions of currency to five separate funds administered by 
a common trustee.
    Example 4. K, an individual, attends a one day auction and purchases 
for currency two items, at a cost of $9,240 and $1,732.50 respectively 
(tax and buyer's premium included). Because the transactions are related 
transactions as defined in paragraph (c)(12)(ii) of this section, the 
auction house is required to report the aggregate amount of currency 
received from the related sales ($10,972.50), even though the auction 
house accounts separately on its books for each item sold and presents 
the purchaser with separate bills for each item purchased.
    Example 5. F, a coin dealer, sells for currency $9,000 worth of gold 
coins to an individual on three successive days. Under paragraph 
(c)(12)(ii) of this section the three $9,000 transactions are related 
transactions aggregating $27,000 if F knows, or has reason to know, that 
each transaction is one of a series of connected transactions.

    (13) Recipient. (i) The term recipient means the person receiving 
the currency. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(13)(ii) of this 
section, each store, division, branch, department, headquarters, or 
office (``branch'') (regardless of physical location) comprising a 
portion of a person's trade or business shall for purposes of this 
section be deemed a separate recipient.
    (ii) A branch that receives currency payments will not be deemed a 
separate recipient if the branch (or a central unit linking such branch 
with other branches) would in the ordinary course of business have 
reason to know the identity of payers making currency payments to other 
branches of such person.
    (iii) Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of 
the rules in paragraphs (c)(13)(i) and (ii) of this section:

    Example 1. N, an individual, purchases regulated futures contracts 
at a cost of $7,500 and $5,000, respectively, through two different 
branches of Commodities Broker X on the same day. N pays for each 
purchase with currency. Each branch of Commodities Broker X transmits 
the sales information regarding each of N's purchases to a central unit 
of Commodities Broker X (which settles the transactions against N's 
account). Under paragraph (c)(13)(ii) of this section the separate 
branches of Commodities Broker X are not deemed to be separate 
recipients; therefore, Commodities Broker X must report with respect to 
the two related regulated futures contracts sales in accordance with 
this section.
    Example 2. P, a corporation, owns and operates a racetrack. P's 
racetrack contains 100 betting windows at which pari-mutuel wagers may 
be made. R, an individual, places currency wagers of $3,000 each at five 
separate betting windows. Assuming that in the ordinary course of 
business each betting window (or a central unit linking windows) does 
not have reason to know the identity of persons making wagers at other 
betting windows, each betting window would be deemed to be a separate 
currency recipient under paragraph (c)(13)(i) of this section. As no 
individual recipient received currency in excess of $10,000, no report 
need be made by P under this section.

    (d) Exceptions to the reporting requirements of 31 U.S.C. 5331--(1) 
Receipt of currency by certain casinos having gross annual gaming 
revenue in excess of

[[Page 407]]

$1,000,000--(i) In general. If a casino receives currency in excess of 
$10,000 and is required to report the receipt of such currency directly 
to the Treasury Department under Sec. Sec. 103.22 (a)(2) and 103.25 and 
is subject to the recordkeeping requirements of Sec. 103.36, then the 
casino is not required to make a report with respect to the receipt of 
such currency under 31 U.S.C. 5331 and this section.
    (ii) Casinos exempt under Sec. 103.55(c). Pursuant to Sec.  103.55, 
the Secretary may exempt from the reporting and recordkeeping 
requirements under Sec. Sec. 103.22, 103.25 and 103.36 casinos in any 
state whose regulatory system substantially meets the reporting and 
recordkeeping requirements of this part. Such casinos shall not be 
required to report receipt of currency under 31 U.S.C. 5331 and this 
section.
    (iii) Reporting of currency received in a nongaming business. 
Nongaming businesses (such as shops, restaurants, entertainment, and 
hotels) at casino hotels and resorts are separate trades or businesses 
in which the receipt of currency in excess of $10,000 is reportable 
under section 5331 and these regulations. Thus, a casino exempt under 
paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section must report with respect to 
currency in excess of $10,000 received in its nongaming businesses.
    (iv) Example. The following example illustrates the application of 
the rules in paragraphs (d)(2) (i) and (iii) of this section:

    Example. A and B are casinos having gross annual gaming revenue in 
excess of $1,000,000. C is a casino with gross annual gaming revenue of 
less than $1,000,000. Casino A receives $15,000 in currency from a 
customer with respect to a gaming transaction which the casino reports 
to the Treasury Department under Sec. Sec. 103.22(a)(2) and 103.25. 
Casino B receives $15,000 in currency from a customer in payment for 
accommodations provided to that customer at Casino B's hotel. Casino C 
receives $15,000 in currency from a customer with respect to a gaming 
transaction. Casino A is not required to report the transaction under 31 
U.S.C. 5331 or this section because the exception for certain casinos 
provided in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section (``the casino 
exception'') applies. Casino B is required to report under 31 U.S.C. 
5331 and this section because the casino exception does not apply to the 
receipt of currency from a nongaming activity. Casino C is required to 
report under 31 U.S.C. 5331 and this section because the casino 
exception does not apply to casinos having gross annual gaming revenue 
of $1,000,000 or less which do not have to report to the Treasury 
Department under Sec. Sec. 103.22(a)(2) and 103.25.

    (2) Receipt of currency not in the course of the recipient's trade 
or business. The receipt of currency in excess of $10,000 by a person 
other than in the course of the person's trade or business is not 
reportable under 31 U.S.C. 5331. Thus, for example, F, an individual in 
the trade or business of selling real estate, sells a motorboat for 
$12,000, the purchase price of which is paid in currency. F did not use 
the motorboat in any trade or business in which F was engaged. F is not 
required to report under 31 U.S.C. 5331 or this section because the 
exception provided in this paragraph (d)(2) applies.
    (3) Receipt is made with respect to a foreign currency transaction--
(i) In general. Generally, there is no requirement to report with 
respect to a currency transaction if the entire transaction occurs 
outside the United States (the fifty states and the District of 
Columbia). An entire transaction consists of both the transaction as 
defined in paragraph (c)(12)(i) of this section and the receipt of 
currency by the recipient. If, however, any part of an entire 
transaction occurs in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or a possession or 
territory of the United States and the recipient of currency in that 
transaction is subject to the general jurisdiction of the Internal 
Revenue Service under title 26 of the United States Code, the recipient 
is required to report the transaction under this section.
    (ii) Example. The following example illustrates the application of 
the rules in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section:

    Example. W, an individual engaged in the trade or business of 
selling aircraft, reaches an agreement to sell an airplane to a U.S. 
citizen living in Mexico. The agreement, no portion of which is 
formulated in the United States, calls for a purchase price of $125,000 
and requires delivery of and payment for the airplane to be made in 
Mexico. Upon delivery of the airplane in Mexico, W receives $125,000 in 
currency. W is not required to report under 31 U.S.C. 5331 or this 
section because the exception provided in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this 
section (``foreign transaction exception'') applies. If, however, any 
part of the agreement to sell had been formulated in the

[[Page 408]]

United States, the foreign transaction exception would not apply and W 
would be required to report the receipt of currency under 31 U.S.C. 5331 
and this section.

    (e) Time, manner, and form of reporting--(1) In general. The reports 
required by paragraph (a) of this section must be made by filing a Form 
8300, as specified in 26 CFR 1.6050I-1(e)(2). The reports must be filed 
at the time and in the manner specified in 26 CFR 1.6050I-1(e)(1) and 
(3) respectively.
    (2) Verification. A person making a report of information under this 
section must verify the identity of the person from whom the reportable 
currency is received. Verification of the identity of a person who 
purports to be an alien must be made by examination of such person's 
passport, alien identification card, or other official document 
evidencing nationality or residence. Verification of the identity of any 
other person may be made by examination of a document normally 
acceptable as a means of identification when cashing or accepting checks 
(for example, a driver's license or a credit card). In addition, a 
report will be considered incomplete if the person required to make a 
report knows (or has reason to know) that an agent is conducting the 
transaction for a principal, and the return does not identify both the 
principal and the agent.
    (3) Retention of reports. A person required to make a report under 
this section must keep a copy of each report filed for five years from 
the date of filing.

the United States.
    (d) A record of such information for such period of time as the 
Secretary may require in an order issued under Sec. 103.26(a), not to 
exceed five years.
    (e) Banks. Each agent, agency, branch, or office located within the 
United States of a bank is subject to the requirements of this paragraph 
(e) with respect to a funds transfer in the amount of $3,000 or more:
    (1) Recordkeeping requirements. (i) For each payment order that it 
accepts as an originator's bank, a bank shall obtain and retain either 
the original or a microfilm, other copy, or electronic record of the 
following information relating to the payment order:
    (A) The name and address of the originator;
    (B) The amount of the payment order;
    (C) The execution date of the payment order;
    (D) Any payment instructions received from the originator with the 
payment order;
    (E) The identity of the beneficiary's bank; and
    (F) As many of the following items as are received with the payment 
order: \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ For funds transfers effected through the Federal Reserve's 
Fedwire funds transfer system, only one of the items is required to be 
retained, if received with the payment order, until such time as the 
bank that sends the order to the Federal Reserve Bank completes its 
conversion to the expanded Fedwire message format.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) The name and address of the beneficiary;
    (2) The account number of the beneficiary; and
    (3) Any other specific identifier of the beneficiary.
    (ii) For each payment order that it accepts as an intermediary bank, 
a bank shall retain either the original or a microfilm, other copy, or 
electronic record of the payment order.
    (iii) For each payment order that it accepts as a beneficiary's 
bank, a bank shall retain either the original or a microfilm, other 
copy, or electronic record of the payment order.
    (2) Originators other than established customers. In the case of a 
payment order from an originator that is not an established customer, in 
addition to obtaining and retaining the information required in 
paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section:
    (i) If the payment order is made in person, prior to acceptance the 
originator's bank shall verify the identity of the person placing the 
payment order. If it accepts the payment order, the originator's bank 
shall obtain and retain a record of the name and address, the type of 
identification reviewed, the number of the identification document 
(e.g., driver's license), as well as a record of the person's taxpayer 
identification number (e.g., social security or employer identification 
number) or, if none, alien identification number or passport number and 
country of issuance, or a notation in the record of the lack thereof. If 
the originator's bank has knowledge that the person placing the payment 
order is not the originator, the originator's bank shall obtain and 
retain a record of the originator's taxpayer identification number 
(e.g., social security or employer identification number) or, if none, 
alien identification number or passport number and country of issuance, 
if known by the person placing the order, or a notation in the record of 
the lack thereof.
    (ii) If the payment order accepted by the originator's bank is not 
made in person, the originator's bank shall obtain and retain a record 
of name and address of the person placing the payment order, as well as 
the person's taxpayer identification number (e.g., social security or 
employer identification number) or, if none, alien identification number 
or passport number and country of issuance, or a notation in the record 
of the lack thereof, and a copy or record of the method of payment 
(e.g., check or credit card transaction) for the funds transfer. If the 
originator's bank has knowledge that the person placing the payment 
order is not the originator, the originator's bank shall obtain and 
retain a record of the originator's taxpayer identification number 
(e.g., social security or

[[Page 410]]

employer identification number) or, if none, alien identification number 
or passport number and country of issuance, if known by the person 
placing the order, or a notation in the record of the lack thereof.
    (3) Beneficiaries other than established customers. For each payment 
order that it accepts as a beneficiary's bank for a beneficiary that is 
not an established customer, in addition to obtaining and retaining the 
information required in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section:
    (i) if the proceeds are delivered in person to the beneficiary or 
its representative or agent, the beneficiary's bank shall verify the 
identity of the person receiving the proceeds and shall obtain and 
retain a record of the name and address, the type of identification 
reviewed, and the number of the identification document (e.g., driver's 
license), as well as a record of the person's taxpayer identification 
number (e.g., social security or employer identification number) or, if 
none, alien identification number or passport number and country of 
issuance, or a notation in the record of the lack thereof. If the 
beneficiary's bank has knowledge that the person receiving the proceeds 
is not the beneficiary, the beneficiary's bank shall obtain and retain a 
record of the beneficiary's name and address, as well as the 
beneficiary's taxpayer identification number (e.g., social security or 
employer identification number) or, if none, alien identification number 
or passport number and country of issuance, if known by the person 
receiving the proceeds, or a notation in the record of the lack thereof.
    (ii) if the proceeds are delivered other than in person, the 
beneficiary's bank shall retain a copy of the check or other instrument 
used to effect payment, or the information contained thereon, as well as 
the name and address of the person to which it was sent.
    (4) Retrievability. The information that an originator's bank must 
retain under paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (e)(2) of this section shall be 
retrievable by the originator's bank by reference to the name of the 
originator. If the originator is an established customer of the 
originator's bank and has an account used for funds transfers, then the 
information also shall be retrievable by account number. The information 
that a beneficiary's bank must retain under paragraphs (e)(1)(iii) and 
(e)(3) of this section shall be retrievable by the beneficiary's bank by 
reference to the name of the beneficiary. If the beneficiary is an 
established customer of the beneficiary's bank and has an account used 
for funds transfers, then the information also shall be retrievable by 
account number. This information need not be retained in any particular 
manner, so long as the bank is able to retrieve the information required 
by this paragraph, either by accessing funds transfer records directly 
or through reference to some other record maintained by the bank.
    (5) Verification. Where verification is required under paragraphs 
(e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section, a bank shall verify a person's 
identity by examination of a document (other than a bank signature 
card), preferably one that contains the person's name, address, and 
photograph, that is normally acceptable by financial institutions as a 
means of identification when cashing checks for persons other than 
established customers. Verification of the identity of an individual who 
indicates that he or she is an alien or is not a resident of the United 
States may be made by passport, alien identification card, or other 
official document evidencing nationality or residence (e.g., a foreign 
driver's license with indication of home address).
    (6) Exceptions. The following funds transfers are not subject to the 
requirements of this section:
    (i) Funds transfers where the originator and beneficiary are any of 
the following:
    (A) A bank;
    (B) A wholly-owned domestic subsidiary of a bank chartered in the 
United States;
    (C) A broker or dealer in securities;
    (D) A wholly-owned domestic subsidiary of a broker or dealer in 
securities;
    (E) A futures commission merchant or an introducing broker in 
commodities;

[[Page 411]]

    (F) A wholly-owned domestic subsidiary of a futures commission 
merchant or an introducing broker in commodities;
    (G) The United States;
    (H) A state or local government; or
    (I) A federal, state or local government agency or instrumentality; 
and
    (ii) Funds transfers where both the originator and the beneficiary 
are the same person and the originator's bank and the beneficiary's bank 
are the same bank.
    (f) Nonbank financial institutions. Each agent, agency, branch, or 
office located within the United States of a financial institution other 
than a bank is subject to the requirements of this paragraph (f) with 
respect to a transmittal of funds in the amount of $3,000 or more:
    (1) Recordkeeping requirements. (i) For each transmittal order that 
it accepts as a transmittor's financial institution, a financial 
institution shall obtain and retain either the original or a microfilm, 
other copy, or electronic record of the following information relating 
to the transmittal order:
    (A) The name and address of the transmittor;
    (B) The amount of the transmittal order;
    (C) The execution date of the transmittal order;
    (D) Any payment instructions received from the transmittor with the 
transmittal order;
    (E) The identity of the recipient's financial institution;
    (F) As many of the following items as are received with the 
transmittal order: \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ For transmittals of funds effected through the Federal Reserve's 
Fedwire funds transfer system by a domestic broker or dealers in 
securities, only one of the items is required to be retained, if 
received with the transmittal order, until such time as the bank that 
sends the order to the Federal Reserve Bank completes its conversion to 
the expanded Fedwire message format.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) The name and address of the recipient;
    (2) The account number of the recipient; and
    (3) Any other specific identifier of the recipient; and
    (G) Any form relating to the transmittal of funds that is completed 
or signed by the person placing the transmittal order.
    (ii) For each transmittal order that it accepts as an intermediary 
financial institution, a financial institution shall retain either the 
original or a microfilm, other copy, or electronic record of the 
transmittal order.
    (iii) for each transmittal order that it accepts as a recipient's 
financial institution, a financial institution shall retain either the 
original or a microfilm, other copy, or electronic record of the 
transmittal order.
    (2) Transmittors other than established customers. In the case of a 
transmittal order from a transmittor that is not an established 
customer, in addition to obtaining and retaining the information 
required in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section:
    (i) If the transmittal order is made in person, prior to acceptance 
the transmittor's financial institution shall verify the identity of the 
person placing the transmittal order. If it accepts the transmittal 
order, the transmittor's financial institution shall obtain and retain a 
record of the name and address, the type of identification reviewed, and 
the number of the identification document (e.g., driver's license), as 
well as a record of the person's taxpayer identification number (e.g., 
social security or employer identification number) or, if none, alien 
identification number or passport number and country of issuance, or a 
notation in the record the lack thereof. If the transmittor's financial 
institution has knowledge that the person placing the transmittal order 
is not the transmittor, the transmittor's financial institution shall 
obtain and retain a record of the transmittor's taxpayer identification 
number (e.g., social security or employer identification number) or, if 
none, alien identification number or passport number and country of 
issuance, if known by the person placing the order, or a notation in the 
record the lack thereof.
    (ii) If the transmittal order accepted by the transmittor's 
financial institution is not made in person, the transmittor's financial 
institution shall obtain and retain a record of the

[[Page 412]]

name and address of the person placing the transmittal order, as well as 
the person's taxpayer identification number (e.g., social security or 
employer identification number) or, if none, alien identification number 
or passport number and country of issuance, or a notation in the record 
of the lack thereof, and a copy or record of the method of payment 
(e.g., check or credit card transaction) for the transmittal of funds. 
If the transmittor's financial institution has knowledge that the person 
placing the transmittal order is not the transmittor, the transmittor's 
financial institution shall obtain and retain a record of the 
transmittor's taxpayer identification number (e.g., social security or 
employer identification number) or, if none, alien identification number 
or passport number and country of issuance, if known by the person 
placing the order, or a notation in the record the lack thereof.
    (3) Recipients other than established customers. For each 
transmittal order that it accepts as a recipient's financial institution 
for a recipient that is not an established customer, in addition to 
obtaining and retaining the information required in paragraph 
(f)(1)(iii) of this section:
    (i) If the proceeds are delivered in person to the recipient or its 
representative or agent, the recipient's financial institution shall 
verify the identity of the person receiving the proceeds and shall 
obtain and retain a record of the name and address, the type of 
identification reviewed, and the number of the identification document 
(e.g., driver's license), as well as a record of the person's taxpayer 
identification number (e.g., social security or employer identification 
number) or, if none, alien identification number or passport number and 
country of issuance, or a notation in the record of the lack thereof. If 
the recipient's financial institution has knowledge that the person 
receiving the proceeds is not the recipient, the recipient's financial 
institution shall obtain and retain a record of the recipient's name and 
address, as well as the recipient's taxpayer identification number 
(e.g., social security or employer identification number) or, if none, 
alien identification number or passport number and country of issuance, 
if known by the person receiving the proceeds, or a notation in the 
record of the lack thereof.
    (ii) If the proceeds are delivered other than in person, the 
recipient's financial institution shall retain a copy of the check or 
other instrument used to effect payment, or the information contained 
thereon, as well as the name and address of the person to which it was 
sent.
    (4) Retrievability. The information that a transmittor's financial 
institution must retain under paragraphs (f)(1)(i) and (f)(2) of this 
section shall be retrievable by the transmittor's financial institution 
by reference to the name of the transmittor. If the transmittor is an 
established customer of the transmittor's financial institution and has 
an account used for transmittals of funds, then the information also 
shall be retrievable by account number. The information that a 
recipient's financial institution must retain under paragraphs 
(f)(1)(iii) and (f)(3) of this section shall be retrievable by the 
recipient's financial institution by reference to the name of the 
recipient. If the recipient is an established customer of the

transmittals of funds, then the information also shall be retrievable by 
account number. This information need not be retained in any particular 
manner, so long as the financial institution is able to retrieve the 
information required by this paragraph, either by accessing transmittal 
of funds records directly or through reference to some other record 
maintained by the financial institution.
    (5) Verification. Where verification is required under paragraphs 
(f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section, a financial institution shall verify 
a person's identity by examination of a document (other than a customer 
signature card), preferably one that contains the person's name, 
address, and photograph, that is normally acceptable by financial 
institutions as a means of identification when cashing checks for 
persons other than established customers. Verification of the identity 
of an individual who indicates that he or she is an alien or is not a 
resident of the

United States may be made by passport, alien identification card, or 
other official document evidencing nationality or residence (e.g., a 
foreign driver's license with indication of home address).

Sec. 103.34  Additional records to be made and retained by banks.

    (a)(1) With respect to each certificate of deposit sold or redeemed 
after May 31, 1978, and before October 1, 2003, or each deposit or share

2003, a bank shall, within 30 days from the date such a transaction 
occurs or an account is opened,

[[Page 415]]

secure and maintain a record of the taxpayer identification number of 
the customer involved; or where the account or certificate is in the 
names of two or more persons, the bank shall secure the taxpayer 
identification number of a person having a financial interest in the 
certificate or account. In the event that a bank has been unable to 
secure, within the 30-day period specified, the required identification, 
it shall nevertheless not be deemed to be in violation of this section 
if (i) it has made a reasonable effort to secure such identification, 
and (ii) it maintains a list containing the names, addresses, and 
account numbers of those persons from whom it has been unable to secure 
such identification, and makes the names, addresses, and account numbers 
of those persons available to the Secretary as directed by him. A bank 
acting as an agent for another person in the purchase or redemption of a 
certificate of deposit issued by another bank is responsible for 
obtaining and recording the required taxpayer identification, as well as 
for maintaining the records referred to in paragraphs (b) (11) and (12) 
of this section. The issuing bank can satisfy the recordkeeping 
requirement by recording the name and address of the agent together with 
a description of the instrument and the date of the transaction. Where a 
person is a non-resident alien, the bank shall also record the person's 
passport number or a description of some other government document used 
to verify his identity.

section shall be extended where the person opening the account has 
applied for a taxpayer identification or social security number on Form 
SS-4 or SS-5, until such time as the person maintaining the account has 
had a reasonable opportunity to secure such number and furnish it to the 
bank.
    (3) A taxpayer identification number required under paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section need not be secured for accounts or transactions with 
the following: (i) Agencies and instrumentalities of Federal, state, 
local or foreign governments; (ii) judges, public officials, or clerks 
of courts of record as custodians of funds in controversy or under the 
control of the court; (iii) aliens who are (A) ambassadors, ministers, 
career diplomatic or consular officers, or (B) naval, military or other 
attaches of foreign embassies and legations, and for the members of 
their immediate families; (iv) aliens who are accredited representatives 
of international organizations which are entitled to enjoy privileges, 
exemptions and immunities as an international organization under the 
International Organization Immunities Act of December 29, 1945 (22 
U.S.C. 288), and the members of their immediate families; (v) aliens 
temporarily residing in the United States for a period not to exceed 180 
days; (vi) aliens not engaged in a trade or business in the United 
States who are attending a recognized college or university or any 
training program, supervised or conducted by any agency of the Federal 
Government; (vii) unincorporated subordinate units of a tax exempt 
central organization which are covered by a group exemption letter, 
(viii) a person under 18 years of age with respect to an account opened 
as a part of a school thrift savings program, provided the annual 
interest is less than $10; (ix) a person opening a Christmas club, 
vacation club and similar installment savings programs provided the 
annual interest is less than $10; and (x) non-resident aliens who are 
not engaged in a trade or business in the United States. In instances 
described in paragraphs (a)(3), (viii) and (ix) of this section, the 
bank shall, within 15 days following the end of any calendar year in 
which the interest accrued in that year is $10 or more use its best 
effort to secure and maintain the appropriate taxpayer identification 
number or application form therefor.
    (4) The rules and regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service 
under section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 shall determine 
what constitutes a taxpayer identification number and whose number shall 
be obtained in the case of an account maintained by one or more persons.

microfilm or other copy or reproduction of each of the following:

on Form SS-4 or SS-5, until such time as the person maintaining the 
account or credit line has had a reasonable opportunity to secure such 
number and furnish it to the currency dealer or exchanger.
    (3) A taxpayer identification number for an account or credit line 
required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section need not be secured in

    (4) Signature cards or other documents evidencing signature 
authority over each deposit or security account, containing the name of 
the depositor, street address, taxpayer identification number (TIN) or

or of a person authorized to sign on the account (if customer accounts 
are maintained in a code name, a record of the actual owner of the 
account);
    (5) Each item, including checks, drafts, or transfers of credit, of 
more than $10,000 remitted or transferred to a person, account or place

Sec. 103.38  Nature of records and retention period.

    (a) Wherever it is required that there be retained either the 
original or a microfilm or other copy or reproduction of a check, draft, 
monetary instrument, investment security, or other similar instrument,

          Subpart D_Special Rules for Money Services Businesses

    Source: 64 FR 45451, Aug. 20, 1999, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 103.41  Registration of money services businesses.

    (a) Registration requirement--(1) In general. Except as provided in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, relating to agents, each money 
services business (whether or not licensed as a money services business 
by any State) must register with the Department of the

[[Page 422]]

Treasury and, as part of that registration, maintain a list of its 
agents as required by 31 U.S.C. 5330 and this section. This section does 
not apply to the United States Postal Service, to agencies of the United 
States, of any State, or of any political subdivision of a State, or to 
a person to the extent that the person is an issuer, seller, or redeemer 
of stored value.
    (2) Agents. A person that is a money services business solely 
because that person serves as an agent of another money services 
business, see Sec. 103.11(uu), is not required to register under this 
section, but a money services business that engages in activities 
described in Sec. 103.11(uu) both on its own behalf and as an agent for 
others must register under this section. For example, a supermarket 
corporation that acts as an agent for an issuer of money orders and 
performs no other services of a nature and value that would cause the 
corporation to be a money services business, is not required to 
register; the answer would be the same if the supermarket corporation 
served as an agent both of a money order issuer and of a money 
transmitter. However, registration would be required if the supermarket 
corporation, in addition to acting as an agent of an issuer of money 
orders, cashed checks or exchanged currencies (other than as an agent 
for another business) in an amount greater than $1,000 in currency or 
monetary or other instruments for any person on any day, in one or more 
transactions.
    (3) Agency status. The determination whether a person is an agent 
depends on all the facts and circumstances.
    (b) Registration procedures--(1) In general. (i) A money services 
business must be registered by filing such form as FinCEN may specify 
with the Detroit Computing Center of the Internal Revenue Service (or 
such other location as the form may specify). The information required 
by 31 U.S.C. 5330(b) and any other information required by the form must 
be reported in the manner and to the extent required by the form.
    (ii) A branch office of a money services business is not required to 
file its own registration form. A money services business must, however, 
report information about its branch locations or offices as provided by 
the instructions to the registration form.
    (iii) A money services business must retain a copy of any 
registration form filed under this section and any registration number 
that may be assigned to the business at a location in the United States 
and for the period specified in Sec. 103.38(d).
    (2) Registration period. A money services business must be 
registered for the initial registration period and each renewal period. 
The initial registration period is the two-calendar-year period 
beginning with the calendar year in which the money services business is 
first required to be registered. However, the initial registration 
period for a money services business required to register by December 
31, 2001 (see paragraph (b)(3) of this section) is the two-calendar year 
period beginning 2002. Each two-calendar-year period following the 
initial registration period is a renewal period.
    (3) Due date. The registration form for the initial registration 
period must be filed on or before the later of December 31, 2001, and 
the end of the 180-day period beginning on the day following the date 
the business is established. The registration form for a renewal period 
must be filed on or before the last day of the calendar year preceding 
the renewal period.
    (4) Events requiring re-registration. If a money services business 
registered as such under the laws of any State experiences a change in 
ownership or control that requires the business to be re-registered 
under State law, the money services business must also be re-registered 
under this section. In addition, if there is a transfer of more than 10 
percent of the voting power or equity interests of a money services 
business (other than a money services business that must report such 
transfer to the Securities and Exchange Commission), the money services 
business must be re-registered under this section. Finally, if a money 
services business experiences a more than 50-per cent increase in the 
number of its agents during any registration period, the money services 
business must be re-registered under this section. The registration form 
must be filed not later than 180

[[Page 423]]

days after such change in ownership, transfer of voting power or equity 
interests, or increase in agents. The calendar year in which the change, 
transfer, or increase occurs is treated as the first year of a new two-
year registration period.
    (c) Persons required to file the registration form. Under 31 U.S.C. 
5330(a), any person who owns or controls a money services business is 
responsible for registering the business; however, only one registration 
form is required to be filed for each registration period. A person is 
treated as owning or controlling a money services business for purposes 
of filing the registration form only to the extent provided by the form. 
If more than one person owns or controls a money services business, the 
owning or controlling persons may enter into an agreement designating 
one of them to register the business. The failure of the designated 
person to register the money services business does not, however, 
relieve any of the other persons who own or control the business of 
liability for the failure to register the business. See paragraph (e) of 
this section, relating to consequences of the failure to comply with 31 
U.S.C. 5330 or this section.
    (d) List of agents--(1) In general. A money services business must 
prepare and maintain a list of its agents. The initial list of agents 
must be prepared by January 1, 2002, and must be revised each January 1, 
for the immediately preceding 12 month period; for money services 
businesses established after December 31, 2001, the initial agent list 
must be prepared by the due date of the initial registration form and 
must be revised each January 1 for the immediately preceding 12-month 
period. The list is not filed with the registration form but must be 
maintained at the location in the United States reported on the 
registration form under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Upon request, 
a money services business must make its list of agents available to 
FinCEN and any other appropriate law enforcement agency (including, 
without limitation, the examination function of the Internal Revenue 
Service in its capacity as delegee of Bank Secrecy Act examination 
authority). Requests for information made pursuant to the preceding 
sentence shall be coordinated through FinCEN in the manner and to the 
extent determined by FinCEN. The original list of agents and any revised 
list must be retained for the period specified in Sec. 103.38(d).
    (2) Information included on the list of agents--(i) In general. 
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, a money 
services business must include the following information with respect to 
each agent on the list (including any revised list) of its agents--
    (A) The name of the agent, including any trade names or doing-
business-as names;
    (B) The address of the agent, including street address, city, state, 
and ZIP code;
    (C) The telephone number of the agent;
    (D) The type of service or services (money orders, traveler's 
checks, check sales, check cashing, currency exchange, and money 
transmitting) the agent provides;
    (E) A listing of the months in the 12 months immediately preceding 
the date of the most recent agent list in which the gross transaction 
amount of the agent with respect to financial products or services 
issued by the money services business maintaining the agent list 
exceeded $100,000. For this purpose, the money services gross 
transaction amount is the agent's gross amount (excluding fees and 
commissions) received from transactions of one or more businesses 
described in Sec. 103.11(uu);
    (F) The name and address of any depository institution at which the 
agent maintains a transaction account (as defined in 12 U.S.C. 
461(b)(1)(C)) for all or part of the funds received in or for the 
financial products or services issued by the money services business 
maintaining the list, whether in the agent's or the business principal's 
name;
    (G) The year in which the agent first became an agent of the money 
services business; and
    (H) The number of branches or subagents the agent has.
    (ii) Special rules. Information about agent volume must be current 
within 45 days of the due date of the agent list. The information 
described by

[[Page 424]]

paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(G) and (d)(2)(i)(H) of this section is not required 
to be included in an agent list with respect to any person that is an 
agent of the money services business maintaining the list before the 
first day of the month beginning after February 16, 2000 so long as the 
information described by paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(G) and (d)(2)(i)(H) of 
this section is made available upon the request of FinCEN and any other 
appropriate law enforcement agency (including, without limitation, the 
examination function of the Internal Revenue Service in its capacity as 
delegee of Bank Secrecy Act examination authority).
    (e) Consequences of failing to comply with 31 U.S.C. 5330 or the 
regulations thereunder. It is unlawful to do business without complying 
with 31 U.S.C. 5330 and this section. A failure to comply with the 
requirements of 31 U.S.C 5330 or this section includes the filing of 
false or materially incomplete information in connection with the 
registration of a money services business. Any person who fails to 
comply with any requirement of 31 U.S.C. 5330 or this section shall be 
liable for a civil penalty of $5,000 for each violation. Each day a 
violation of 31 U.S.C. 5330 or this section continues constitutes a 
separate violation. In addition, under 31 U.S.C. 5320, the Secretary of 
the Treasury may bring a civil action to enjoin the violation. See 18 
U.S.C. 1960 for a criminal penalty for failure to comply with the 
registration requirements of 31 U.S.C. 5330 or this section.
    (f) Effective date. This section is effective September 20, 1999. 
Registration of money services businesses under this section will not be 
required prior to December 31, 2001.

<R05>
Sec. 103.83  Oral communications.

    (a) The Office of the Assistant Secretary (Enforcement) will not 
issue administrative rulings in response to oral requests. Oral opinions 
or advice by Treasury, the Customs Service, the Internal Revenue 
Service, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or any other 
bank supervisory agency personnel, regarding the interpretation and 
application of this part, do not bind the Treasury Department and carry 
no precedential value.
    (b) A person who has made a ruling request in conformity with Sec. 
103.81 may request an opportunity for oral discussion of the issues 
presented in the request. The request should be made to the Director, 
Office of Financial Enforcement, and any decision to grant such a 
conference is wholly within the discretion of the Director. Personal 
conferences or telephone conferences may be scheduled only for the 
purpose of affording the requester an opportunity to discuss freely and 
openly the matters set forth in the administrative ruling request. 
Accordingly, the conferees will not be bound by any argument or position 
advocated or agreed to, expressly or impliedly, during the conference. 
Any new arguments or facts put forth by the requester at the meeting 
must be reduced to writing by the requester and submitted in conformity 
with Sec. 103.81 before they may be considered in connection with the 
request.

    A person may withdraw a request for an administrative ruling at any 
time before the ruling has been issued.


<R05>
Sec. 103.85  Issuing rulings.

    The Assistant Secretary (Enforcement), or his designee may issue a 
written ruling interpreting the relationship between part 103 and each 
situation for which such a ruling has been requested in conformity with 
Sec. 103.81. A ruling issued under this section shall bind the Treasury 
Department only in the event that the request describes a specifically 
identified actual situation. A ruling issued under this section shall 
have precedential value, and hence may be relied upon by others 
similarly situated, only if it is published or will be published by the 
Office of Financial Enforcement in the Federal Register. Rulings with 
precedential value will be published periodically in the Federal 
Register and yearly in the Appendix to this part. All rulings with 
precedential value will be available by mail to any person upon written 
request specifically identifying the ruling sought. Treasury will make 
every effort to respond to each requestor within 90 days of receiving a 
request.

<R05>
Sec. 103.86  Modifying or rescinding rulings.

    (a) The Assistant Secretary (Enforcement), or his designee may 
modify or rescind any ruling made pursuant to Sec. 103.85:
    (1) When, in light of changes in the statute or regulations, the 
ruling no longer sets forth the interpretation of the Assistant 
Secretary (Enforcement) with respect to the described situation,

[[Page 434]]

    (2) When any fact or statement submitted in the original ruling 
request is found to be materially inaccurate or incomplete, or
    (3) For other good cause.
    (b) Any person may submit to the Assistant Secretary (Enforcement) a 
written request that an administrative ruling be modified or rescinded. 
The request should conform to the requirements of Sec. 103.81, explain 
why rescission or modification is warranted, and refer to any reasons in 
paragraph (a) of this section that are relevant. The request may 
advocate an alternative interpretation and may set forth the legal and 
factual basis for that interpretation.
    (c) Treasury shall modify an existing administrative ruling by 
issuing a new ruling that rescinds the relevant prior ruling. Once 
rescinded, an administrative ruling shall no longer have any 
precedential value.
    (d) An administrative ruling may be modified or rescinded 
retroactively with respect to one or more parties to the original ruling 
request if the Assistant Secretary determines that:
    (1) A fact or statement in the original ruling request was 
materially inaccurate or incomplete,
    (2) The requestor failed to notify in writing the Office of 
Enforcement of a material change to any fact or statement in the 
original request, or
    (3) A party to the original request acted in bad faith when relying 
upon the ruling.

Sec. 103.87  Disclosing information.

    (a) Any part of any administrative ruling, including names, 
addresses, or information related to the business transactions of 
private parties, may be disclosed pursuant to a request under the 
Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. If the request for an 
administrative ruling contains information which the requestor wishes to 
be considered for exemption from disclosure under the Freedom of 
Information Act, the requestor should clearly identify such portions of 
the request and the reasons why such information should be exempt from 
disclosure.
    (b) A requestor claiming an exemption from disclosure will be 
notified, at least 10 days before the administrative ruling is issued, 
of a decision not to exempt any of such information from disclosure so 
that the underlying request for an administrative ruling can be 
withdrawn if the requestor so chooses.

    (b) Information requests based on credible evidence concerning 
terrorist activity or money laundering--(1) In general. A Federal law 
enforcement agency investigating terrorist activity or money laundering 
may request that FinCEN solicit, on the investigating agency's behalf, 
certain information from a financial institution or a group of financial 
institutions. When submitting such a request to FinCEN, the Federal law 
enforcement agency shall provide FinCEN with a written certification, in 
such form and manner as FinCEN may prescribe. At a minimum, such 
certification must: state that each individual, entity, or organization 
about which the Federal law enforcement agency is seeking information is 
engaged in, or is reasonably suspected based on credible evidence of 
engaging in, terrorist activity or money laundering; include enough 
specific identifiers, such as date of birth, address, and social 
security number, that would permit a financial institution to 
differentiate between common or similar names; and identify one person 
at the agency who can be contacted with any questions relating to its 
request. Upon receiving the requisite certification from the requesting 
Federal law enforcement agency, FinCEN may require any financial 
institution to search its records to determine whether the financial 
institution maintains or has maintained accounts for, or has engaged in 
transactions with, any specified individual, entity, or organization.
    (2) Obligations of a financial institution receiving an information 
request--(i) Record search. Upon receiving an information request from 
FinCEN under this section, a financial institution shall expeditiously 
search its records to determine whether it maintains or has maintained 
any account for, or has engaged in any transaction with, each 
individual, entity, or organization named in FinCEN's request. A 
financial institution may contact the Federal law enforcement agency 
named in the information request provided to the institution by FinCEN 
with any questions relating to the scope or terms of the request. Except 
as otherwise provided in the information request, a financial 
institution shall only be required to search its records for:
    (A) Any current account maintained for a named suspect;
    (B) Any account maintained for a named suspect during the preceding 
twelve months; and
    (C) Any transaction, as defined by Sec. 103.90(d), conducted by or 
on behalf of a named suspect, or any transmittal of funds conducted in 
which a named suspect was either the transmittor or the recipient, 
during the preceding six months that is required under law or regulation 
to be recorded by the financial institution or is recorded and 
maintained electronically by the institution.
    (ii) Report to FinCEN. If a financial institution identifies an 
account or transaction identified with any individual, entity, or 
organization named in a request from FinCEN, it shall report to FinCEN, 
in the manner and in the time frame specified in FinCEN's request, the 
following information:
    (A) The name of such individual, entity, or organization;
    (B) The number of each such account, or in the case of a 
transaction, the date and type of each such transaction; and
    (C) Any Social Security number, taxpayer identification number, 
passport number, date of birth, address, or other similar identifying 
information provided by the individual, entity, or organization when 
each such account was opened or each such transaction was conducted.
    (iii) Designation of contact person. Upon receiving an information 
request under this section, a financial institution shall designate one 
person to be the point of contact at the institution regarding the 
request and to receive similar requests for information from FinCEN in 
the future. When requested by FinCEN, a financial institution shall 
provide FinCEN with the name, title, mailing address, e-mail address, 
telephone number, and facsimile number of such person, in such manner as 
FinCEN may prescribe. A financial institution that has provided FinCEN 
with contact information must promptly notify FinCEN of any changes to 
such information.
    (iv) Use and security of information request. (A) A financial 
institution shall not use information provided by

[[Page 436]]

FinCEN pursuant to this section for any purpose other than:
    (1) Reporting to FinCEN as provided in this section;
    (2) Determining whether to establish or maintain an account, or to 
engage in a transaction; or
    (3) Assisting the financial institution in complying with any 
requirement of this part.
    (B)(1) A financial institution shall not disclose to any person, 
other than FinCEN or the Federal law enforcement agency on whose behalf 
FinCEN is requesting information, the fact that FinCEN has requested or 
has obtained information under this section, except to the extent 
necessary to comply with such an information request.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B)(1) of this section, a 
financial institution authorized to share information under Sec. 
103.110 may share information concerning an individual, entity, or 
organization named in a request from FinCEN in accordance with the 
requirements of such section. However, such sharing shall not disclose 
the fact that FinCEN has requested information concerning such 
individual, entity, or organization.
    (C) Each financial institution shall maintain adequate procedures to 
protect the security and confidentiality of requests from FinCEN for 
information under this section. The requirements of this paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(C) shall be deemed satisfied to the extent that a financial 
institution applies to such information procedures that the institution 
has established to satisfy the requirements of section 501 of the Gramm-
Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. 6801), and applicable regulations issued 
thereunder, with regard to the protection of its customers' nonpublic 
personal information.
    (v) No other action required. Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to require a financial institution to take any action, or to 
decline to take any action, with respect to an account established for, 
or a transaction engaged in with, an individual, entity, or organization 
named in a request from FinCEN, or to decline to establish an account 
for, or to engage in a transaction with, any such individual, entity, or 
organization. Except as otherwise provided in an information request 
under this section, such a request shall not require a financial 
institution to report on future account opening activity or transactions 
or to treat a suspect list received under this section as a government 
list for purposes of section 326 of Public Law 107-56.
    (3) Relation to the Right to Financial Privacy Act and the Gramm-
Leach-Bliley Act. The information that a financial institution is 
required to report pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section is 
information required to be reported in accordance with a Federal statute 
or rule promulgated thereunder, for purposes of subsection 3413(d) of 
the Right to Financial Privacy Act (12 U.S.C. 3413(d)) and subsection 
502(e)(8) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. 6802(e)(8)).
    (4) No effect on law enforcement or regulatory investigations. 
Nothing in this subpart affects the authority of a Federal agency or 
officer to obtain information directly from a financial institution.

mean any institution included within a class of financial institutions

[[Page 437]]

and (b)(4) of this section, a financial institution or an association of 
financial institutions may, under the protection of the safe harbor from 
liability described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, transmit, 
receive, or otherwise share information with any other financial 
institution or association of financial institutions regarding 
individuals, entities, organizations, and countries for purposes of 
identifying and, where appropriate, reporting activities that the 
financial institution or association suspects may involve possible 
terrorist activity or money laundering.
    (2) Notice requirement. A financial institution or association of 
financial institutions that intends to share information as described in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall submit to FinCEN a notice 
described in Appendix A to this subpart H. Each notice provided pursuant 
to this paragraph (b)(2) shall be effective for the one year period 
beginning on the date of the notice. In order to continue to engage in 
the sharing of information after the end of the one year period, a 
financial institution or association of financial institutions must 
submit a new notice. Completed notices may be submitted to FinCEN by 
accessing FinCEN's Internet Web site, http://www.treas.gov/fincen, and 
entering the appropriate information as directed, or, if a financial 
institution does not have Internet access, by mail to: FinCEN, P.O. Box 
39, Mail Stop 100, Vienna, VA 22183.
    (3) Verification requirement. Prior to sharing information as 
described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a financial institution 
or an association of financial institutions must take reasonable steps 
to verify that the other financial institution or association of 
financial institutions with which it intends to share information has 
submitted to FinCEN the notice required by paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section. A financial institution or an association of financial 
institutions may satisfy this paragraph (b)(3) by confirming that the 
other financial institution or association of financial institutions 
appears on a list that FinCEN will periodically make available to 
financial institutions or associations of financial institutions that 
have filed a notice with it, or by confirming directly with the other 
financial institution or association of financial institutions that the 
requisite notice has been filed.
    (4) Use and security of information. (i) Information received by a 
financial institution or an association of financial institutions 
pursuant to this section shall not be used for any purpose other than:
    (A) Identifying and, where appropriate, reporting on money 
laundering or terrorist activities;
    (B) Determining whether to establish or maintain an account, or to 
engage in a transaction; or
    (C) Assisting the financial institution in complying with any

institution applies to such information procedures that the institution 
has established to satisfy the requirements of section 501 of the Gramm-
Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. 6801), and applicable regulations issued 
thereunder, with regard to the protection of its customers' nonpublic 
personal information.
    (5) Safe harbor from certain liability--(i) In general. A financial 
institution or association of financial institutions that shares 
information pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall be protected

such sharing, to an individual, entity, or organization that is 
identified in such sharing, to the full extent provided in subsection 
314(b) of Public Law 107-56.
    (ii) Limitation. Paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section shall not apply 
to a financial institution or association of financial institutions to 
the extent such institution or association fails to comply with 
paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section.
    (c) Information sharing between financial institutions and the 
Federal Government. If, as a result of information shared pursuant to 
this section, a financial institution knows, suspects, or

[[Page 438]]

has reason to suspect that an individual, entity, or organization is 
involved in, or may be involved in terrorist activity or money 
laundering, and such institution is subject to a suspicious activity 
reporting requirement under this part or other applicable regulations, 
the institution shall file a Suspicious Activity Report in accordance 
with those regulations. In situations involving violations requiring 
immediate attention, such as when a reportable violation involves 
terrorist activity or is ongoing, the financial institution shall 
immediately notify, by telephone, an appropriate law enforcement 
authority and financial institution supervisory authorities in addition 
to filing timely a Suspicious Activity Report. A financial institution 
that is not subject to a suspicious activity reporting requirement is 
not required to file a Suspicious Activity Report or otherwise to notify 
law enforcement of suspicious activity that is detected as a result of 
information shared pursuant to this section. Such a financial 
institution is encouraged, however, to voluntarily report such activity 
to FinCEN.
    (d) No effect on financial institution reporting obligations. 
Nothing in this subpart affects the obligation of a financial 
institution to file a Suspicious Activity Report pursuant to subpart B 
of this part or any other applicable regulations, or to otherwise 
contact directly a Federal agency concerning individuals or entities 
suspected of engaging in terrorist activity or money laundering.

    (b) Customer Identification Program: minimum requirements--(1) In 
general. A bank must implement a written Customer Identification Program 
(CIP) appropriate for its size and type of business that, at a minimum, 
includes each of the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of 
this section. If a bank is required to have an anti-money laundering 
compliance program under the regulations implementing 31 U.S.C. 5318(h), 
12 U.S.C. 1818(s), or 12 U.S.C. 1786(q)(1), then the CIP must be a part 
of the anti-money laundering compliance program. Until such time as 
credit unions, private banks, and trust companies without a Federal 
functional regulator are subject to such a program, their CIPs must be 
approved by their boards of directors.
    (2) Identity verification procedures. The CIP must include risk-
based procedures for verifying the identity of each customer to the 
extent reasonable and practicable. The procedures must enable the bank 
to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of each 
customer. These procedures must be based on the bank's assessment of the 
relevant risks, including those presented by the various types of 
accounts maintained by the bank, the various methods of opening accounts 
provided by the bank, the various types of identifying information 
available, and the bank's size, location, and customer base. At a 
minimum, these procedures must contain the elements described in this 
paragraph (b)(2).
    (i) Customer information required--(A) In general. The CIP must 
contain procedures for opening an account that specify the identifying 
information that will be obtained from each customer. Except as 
permitted by paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(B) and (C) of this section, the bank 
must obtain, at a minimum, the following information from the customer 
prior to opening an account:
    (1) Name;
    (2) Date of birth, for an individual;
    (3) Address, which shall be:
    (i) For an individual, a residential or business street address;
    (ii) For an individual who does not have a residential or business 
street address, an Army Post Office (APO) or Fleet Post Office (FPO) box 
number, or the residential or business street address of next of kin or 
of another contact individual; or
    (iii) For a person other than an individual (such as a corporation, 
partnership, or trust), a principal place of

[[Page 442]]

business, local office, or other physical location; and
    (4) Identification number, which shall be:
    (i) For a U.S. person, a taxpayer identification number; or
    (ii) For a non-U.S. person, one or more of the following: a taxpayer 
identification number; passport number and country of issuance; alien 
identification card number; or number and country of issuance of any 
other government-issued document evidencing nationality or residence and 
bearing a photograph or similar safeguard.

    Note to paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(4)(ii): When opening an account for a 
foreign business or enterprise that does not have an identification 
number, the bank must request alternative government-issued 
documentation certifying the existence of the business or enterprise.

    (B) Exception for persons applying for a taxpayer identification 
number. Instead of obtaining a taxpayer identification number from a 
customer prior to opening the account, the CIP may include procedures 
for opening an account for a customer that has applied for, but has not 
received, a taxpayer identification number. In this case, the CIP must 
include procedures to confirm that the application was filed before the 
customer opens the account and to obtain the taxpayer identification 
number within a reasonable period of time after the account is opened.
    (C) Credit card accounts. In connection with a customer who opens a 
credit card account, a bank may obtain the identifying information about 
a customer required under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) by acquiring it from a 
third-party source prior to extending credit to the customer.
    (ii) Customer verification. The CIP must contain procedures for 
verifying the identity of the customer, using information obtained in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, within a reasonable 
time after the account is opened. The procedures must describe when the 
bank will use documents, non-documentary methods, or a combination of 
both methods as described in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii).
    (A) Verification through documents. For a bank relying on documents, 
the CIP must contain procedures that set forth the documents that the 
bank will use. These documents may include:
    (1) For an individual, unexpired government-issued identification 
evidencing nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or similar 
safeguard, such as a driver's license or passport; and
    (2) For a person other than an individual (such as a corporation, 
partnership, or trust), documents showing the existence of the entity, 
such as certified articles of incorporation, a government-issued 
business license, a partnership agreement, or trust instrument.
    (B) Verification through non-documentary methods. For a bank relying 
on non-documentary methods, the CIP must contain procedures that 
describe the non-documentary methods the bank will use.
    (1) These methods may include contacting a customer; independently 
verifying the customer's identity through the comparison of information 
provided by the customer with information obtained from a consumer 
reporting agency, public database, or other source; checking references 
with other financial institutions; and obtaining a financial statement.
    (2) The bank's non-documentary procedures must address situations 
where an individual is unable to present an unexpired government-issued 
identification document that bears a photograph or similar safeguard; 
the bank is not familiar with the documents presented; the account is 
opened without obtaining documents; the customer opens the account 
without appearing in person at the bank; and where the bank is otherwise 
presented with circumstances that increase the risk that the bank will 
be unable to verify the true identity of a customer through documents.
    (C) Additional verification for certain customers. The CIP must 
address situations where, based on the bank's risk assessment of a new 
account opened by a customer that is not an individual, the bank will 
obtain information about individuals with authority or control over such 
account, including signatories, in order to verify the customer's 
identity. This verification method applies only when the bank cannot 
verify

[[Page 443]]

the customer's true identity using the verification methods described in 
paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.
    (iii) Lack of verification. The CIP must include procedures for 
responding to circumstances in which the bank cannot form a reasonable 
belief that it knows the true identity of a customer. These procedures 
should describe:
    (A) When the bank should not open an account;
    (B) The terms under which a customer may use an account while the 
bank attempts to verify the customer's identity;
    (C) When the bank should close an account, after attempts to verify 
a customer's identity have failed; and
    (D) When the bank should file a Suspicious Activity Report in 
accordance with applicable law and regulation.
    (3) Recordkeeping. The CIP must include procedures for making and 
maintaining a record of all information obtained under the procedures 
implementing paragraph (b) of this section.
    (i) Required records. At a minimum, the record must include:
    (A) All identifying information about a customer obtained under 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section;
    (B) A description of any document that was relied on under paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section noting the type of document, any 
identification number contained in the document, the place of issuance 
and, if any, the date of issuance and expiration date;
    (C) A description of the methods and the results of any measures 
undertaken to verify the identity of the customer under paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section; and
    (D) A description of the resolution of any substantive discrepancy 
discovered when verifying the identifying information obtained.
    (ii) Retention of records. The bank must retain the information in 
paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section for five years after the date the 
account is closed or, in the case of credit card accounts, five years 
after the account is closed or becomes dormant. The bank must retain the 
information in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(B), (C), and (D) of this section for 
five years after the record is made.
    (4) Comparison with government lists. The CIP must include 
procedures for determining whether the customer appears on any list of 
known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations issued by any 
Federal government agency and designated as such by Treasury in 
consultation with the Federal functional regulators. The procedures must 
require the bank to make such a determination within a reasonable period 
of time after the account is opened, or earlier, if required by another 
Federal law or regulation or Federal directive issued in connection with 
the applicable list. The procedures must also require the bank to follow 
all Federal directives issued in connection with such lists.
    (5)(i) Customer notice. The CIP must include procedures for 
providing bank customers with adequate notice that the bank is 
requesting information to verify their identities.
    (ii) Adequate notice. Notice is adequate if the bank generally 
describes the identification requirements of this section and provides 
the notice in a manner reasonably designed to ensure that a customer is 
able to view the notice, or is otherwise given notice, before opening an 
account. For example, depending upon the manner in which the account is 
opened, a bank may post a notice in the lobby or on its website, include 
the notice on its account applications, or use any other form of written 
or oral notice.
    (iii) Sample notice. If appropriate, a bank may use the following 
sample language to provide notice to its customers:

    IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT

    To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money 
laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions 
to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person 
who opens an account.
    What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for 
your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow 
us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's license or 
other identifying documents.

    (6) Reliance on another financial institution. The CIP may include 
procedures

[[Page 444]]

specifying when a bank will rely on the performance by another financial 
institution (including an affiliate) of any procedures of the bank's 
CIP, with respect to any customer of the bank that is opening, or has 
opened, an account or has established a similar formal banking or 
business relationship with the other financial institution to provide or 
engage in services, dealings, or other financial transactions, provided 
that:
    (i) Such reliance is reasonable under the circumstances;
    (ii) The other financial institution is subject to a rule 
implementing 31 U.S.C. 5318(h) and is regulated by a Federal functional 
regulator; and
    (iii) The other financial institution enters into a contract 
requiring it to certify annually to the bank that it has implemented its 
anti-money laundering program, and that it will perform (or its agent 
will perform) the specified requirements of the bank's CIP.
    (c) Exemptions. The appropriate Federal functional regulator, with 
the concurrence of the Secretary, may, by order or regulation, exempt 
any bank or type of account from the requirements of this section. The 
Federal functional regulator and the Secretary shall consider whether 
the exemption is consistent with the purposes of the Bank Secrecy Act 
and with safe and sound banking, and may consider other appropriate 
factors. The Secretary will make these determinations for any bank or 
type of account that is not subject to the authority of a Federal 
functional regulator.
    (d) Other requirements unaffected. Nothing in this section relieves 
a bank of its obligation to comply with any other provision in this 
part, including provisions concerning information that must be obtained, 
verified, or maintained in connection with any account or transaction.

    (9) Non-U.S. person means a person that is not a U.S. person.
    (b) Customer identification program: minimum requirements--(1) In 
general. A broker-dealer must establish, document, and maintain a 
written Customer Identification Program (``CIP'') appropriate for its 
size and business that, at a minimum, includes each of the requirements 
of paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. The CIP must be a 
part of the broker-dealer's anti-money laundering compliance program 
required under 31 U.S.C. 5318(h).
    (2) Identity verification procedures. The CIP must include risk-
based procedures for verifying the identity of each customer to the 
extent reasonable and practicable. The procedures must enable the 
broker-dealer to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true 
identity of each customer. The procedures must be based on the broker-
dealer's assessment of the relevant risks, including those presented by 
the various types of accounts maintained by the broker-dealer, the

    Note to paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(4)(ii): When opening an account for a 
foreign business or enterprise that does not have an identification 
number, the broker-dealer must request alternative government-issued 
documentation certifying the existence of the business or enterprise.

    (B) Exception for persons applying for a taxpayer identification 
number. Instead of obtaining a taxpayer identification number from a 
customer prior to opening an account, the CIP may include procedures for 
opening an account for a customer that has applied for, but has not

documents, the CIP must contain procedures that set forth the documents 
the broker-dealer will use. These documents may include:
    (1) For an individual, an unexpired government-issued identification 
evidencing nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or similar 
safeguard, such as a driver's license or passport; and

[[Page 446]]

    (2) For a person other than an individual (such as a corporation, 
partnership or trust), documents showing the existence of the entity, 
such as certified articles of incorporation, a government-issued 
business license, a partnership agreement, or a trust instrument.
    (B) Verification through non-documentary methods. For a broker-
dealer relying on non-documentary methods, the CIP must contain 
procedures that set forth the non-documentary methods the broker-dealer 
will use.
    (1) These methods may include contacting a customer; independently 
verifying the customer's identity through the comparison of information 
provided by the customer with information obtained from a consumer 
reporting agency, public database, or other source; checking references 
with other financial institutions; or obtaining a financial statement.
    (2) The broker-dealer's non-documentary procedures must address 
situations where an individual is unable to present an unexpired 
government-issued identification document that bears a photograph or 
similar safeguard; the broker-dealer is not familiar with the documents 
presented; the account is opened without obtaining documents; the 
customer opens the account without appearing in person at the broker-
dealer; and where the broker-dealer is otherwise presented with 
circumstances that increase the risk that the broker-dealer will be 
unable to verify the true identity of a customer through documents.

the broker-dealer cannot verify the customer's true identity using the 
verification methods described in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of 
this section.
    (iii) Lack of verification. The CIP must include procedures for 
responding to circumstances in which the broker-dealer cannot form a 
reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of a customer. These 
procedures should describe:

    (B) The terms under which a customer may conduct transactions while 
the broker-dealer attempts to verify the customer's identity;
    (C) When the broker-dealer should close an account after attempts to 
verify a customer's identity fail; and
    (D) When the broker-dealer should file a Suspicious Activity Report 
in accordance with applicable law and regulation.
    (3) Recordkeeping. The CIP must include procedures for making and 
maintaining a record of all information obtained under procedures 
implementing paragraph (b) of this section.
    (i) Required records. At a minimum, the record must include:
    (A) All identifying information about a customer obtained under 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section,
    (B) A description of any document that was relied on under paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section noting the type of document, any 
identification number contained in the document, the place of issuance, 
and if any, the date of issuance and expiration date;
    (C) A description of the methods and the results of any measures 
undertaken to verify the identity of a customer under paragraphs

record is made. In all other respects, the records must be maintained 
pursuant to the provisions of 17 CFR 240.17a-4.
    (4) Comparison with government lists. The CIP must include 
procedures for determining whether a customer appears on any list of 
known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations issued by any 
Federal government

[[Page 447]]

agency and designated as such by Treasury in consultation with the 
Federal functional regulators. The procedures must require the broker-
dealer to make such a determination within a reasonable period of time 
after the account is opened, or earlier if required by another Federal 
law or regulation or Federal directive issued in connection with the 
applicable list. The procedures also must require the broker-dealer to 
follow all Federal directives issued in connection with such lists.
    (5)(i) Customer notice. The CIP must include procedures for 
providing customers with adequate notice that the broker-dealer is 
requesting information to verify their identities.
    (ii) Adequate notice. Notice is adequate if the broker-dealer 
generally describes the identification requirements of this section and 
provides such notice in a manner reasonably designed to ensure that a 
customer is able to view the notice, or is otherwise given notice, 
before opening an account. For example, depending upon the manner in 
which the account is opened, a broker-dealer may post a notice in the 
lobby or on its Web site, include the notice on its account applications 
or use any other form of oral or written notice.
    (iii) Sample notice. If appropriate, a broker-dealer may use the 
following sample language to provide notice to its customers:

    Important Information About Procedures for Opening a New Account

    To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money 
laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions 
to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person 
who opens an account.
    What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for 
your name, address, date of birth and other information that will allow 
us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's license or 
other identifying documents.

    (6) Reliance on another financial institution. The CIP may include 
procedures specifying when the broker-dealer will rely on the 
performance by another financial institution (including an affiliate) of 
any procedures of the broker-dealer's CIP, with respect to any customer 
of the broker-dealer that is opening an account or has established an 
account or similar business relationship with the other financial 
institution to provide or engage in services, dealings, or other 
financial transactions, provided that:
    (i) Such reliance is reasonable under the circumstances;
    (ii) The other financial institution is subject to a rule 
implementing 31 U.S.C. 5318(h), and regulated by a Federal functional 
regulator; and
    (iii) The other financial institution enters into a contract 
requiring it to certify annually to the broker-dealer that it has 
implemented its anti-money laundering program, and that it will perform 
(or its agent will perform) specified requirements of the broker-
dealer's CIP.
    (c) Exemptions. The Commission, with the concurrence of the 
Secretary, may by order or regulation exempt any broker-dealer that 
registers with the Commission pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 78o or 15 U.S.C. 
78o-4 or any type of account from the requirements of this section. The 
Secretary, with the concurrence of the Commission, may exempt any 
broker-dealer that registers with the Commission pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 
78o-5. In issuing such exemptions, the Commission and the Secretary 
shall consider whether the exemption is consistent with the purposes of 
the Bank Secrecy Act, and in the public interest, and may consider other 
necessary and appropriate factors.
    (d) Other requirements unaffected. Nothing in this section relieves 
a broker-dealer of its obligation to comply with any other provision of 
this part, including provisions concerning information that must be 
obtained, verified, or maintained in connection with any account or 
transaction.

    (13) Non-U.S. person means a person that is not a U.S. person.
    (b) Customer identification program: minimum requirements--(1) In 
general. Each futures commission merchant and introducing broker must 
implement a written Customer Identification Program (CIP) appropriate 
for its size and business that, at a minimum, includes each of the 
requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. The 
CIP must be a part of each futures commission merchant's and introducing 
broker's anti-money laundering compliance program required under 31 
U.S.C. 5318(h).
    (2) Identity verification procedures. The CIP must include risk-
based procedures for verifying the identity of each customer to the 
extent reasonable and practicable. The procedures must enable each 
futures commission merchant and introducing broker to form a

[[Page 449]]

reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of each customer. The 
procedures must be based on the futures commission merchant's or 
introducing broker's assessment of the relevant risks, including those 
presented by the various types of accounts maintained, the various 
methods of opening accounts, the various types of identifying 
information available, and the futures commission merchant's or 
introducing broker's size, location and customer base. At a minimum, 
these procedures must contain the elements described in paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section.
    (i)(A) Customer information required. The CIP must include 
procedures for opening an account that specify identifying information 
that will be obtained from each customer. Except as permitted by 
paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, each futures commission merchant 
and introducing broker must obtain, at a minimum, the following 
information prior to opening an account:
    (1) Name;
    (2) Date of birth, for an individual;
    (3) Address, which shall be:
    (i) For an individual, a residential or business street address;
    (ii) For an individual who does not have a residential or business 
street address, an Army Post Office (APO) or Fleet Post Office (FPO) box 
number, or the residential or business street address of a next of kin 
or another contact individual; or
    (iii) For a person other than an individual (such as a corporation, 
partnership or trust), a principal place of business, local office or 
other physical location; and
    (4) Identification number, which shall be:
    (i) For a U.S. person, a taxpayer identification number; or
    (ii) For a non-U.S. person, one or more of the following: a taxpayer 
identification number, a passport number and country of issuance, an 
alien identification card number, or the number and country of issuance 
of any other government-issued document evidencing nationality or 
residence and bearing a photograph or similar safeguard.

    Note to paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(4)(ii): When opening an account for a 
foreign business or enterprise that does not have an identification 
number, the futures commission merchant or introducing broker must 
request alternative government-issued documentation certifying the 
existence of the business or enterprise.

    (B) Exception for persons applying for a taxpayer identification 
number. Instead of obtaining a taxpayer identification number from a 
customer prior to opening an account, the CIP may include procedures for 
opening an account for a customer that has applied for, but has not 
received, a taxpayer identification number. In this case, the CIP must 
include procedures to confirm that the application was filed before the 
customer opens the account and to obtain the taxpayer identification 
number within a reasonable period of time after the account is opened.
    (ii) Customer verification. The CIP must contain procedures for 
verifying the identity of each customer, using information obtained in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, within a reasonable 
time before or after the customer's account is opened. The procedures 
must describe when the futures commission merchant or introducing broker 
will use documents, non-documentary methods, or a combination of both 
methods, as described in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii).
    (A) Verification through documents. For a futures commission 
merchant or introducing broker relying on documents, the CIP must 
contain procedures that set forth the documents the futures commission 
merchant or introducing broker will use. These documents may include:
    (1) For an individual, an unexpired government-issued identification 
evidencing nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or similar 
safeguard, such as a driver's license or passport; and
    (2) For a person other than an individual (such as a corporation, 
partnership or trust), documents showing the existence of the entity, 
such as certified articles of incorporation, a government-issued 
business license, a partnership agreement, or a trust instrument.
    (B) Verification through non-documentary methods. For a futures 
commission merchant or introducing broker relying on non-documentary 
methods, the

[[Page 450]]

CIP must contain procedures that set forth the non-documentary methods 
the futures commission merchant or introducing broker will use.
    (1) These methods may include contacting a customer; independently 
verifying the customer's identity through the comparison of information 
provided by the customer with information obtained from a consumer 
reporting agency, public database, or other source; checking references 
with other financial institutions; or obtaining a financial statement.
    (2) The futures commission merchant's or introducing broker's non-
documentary procedures must address situations where an individual is 
unable to present an unexpired government-issued identification document 
that bears a photograph or similar safeguard; the futures commission 
merchant or introducing broker is not familiar with the documents 
presented; the account is opened without obtaining documents; the 
customer opens the account without appearing in person at the futures 
commission merchant or introducing broker; and where the futures 
commission merchant or introducing broker is otherwise presented with 
circumstances that increase the risk that the futures commission 
merchant or introducing broker will be unable to verify the true 
identity of a customer through documents.
    (C) Additional verification for certain customers. The CIP must 
address situations where, based on the futures commission merchant's or 
introducing broker's risk assessment of a new account opened by a 
customer that is not an individual, the futures commission merchant or 
introducing broker will obtain information about individuals with 
authority or control over such account in order to verify the customer's 
identity. This verification method applies only when the futures 
commission merchant or introducing broker cannot verify the customer's 
true identity after using the verification methods described in 
paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.
    (iii) Lack of verification. The CIP must include procedures for 
responding to circumstances in which the futures commission merchant or 
introducing broker cannot form a reasonable belief that it knows the 
true identity of a customer. These procedures should describe:
    (A) When an account should not be opened;
    (B) The terms under which a customer may conduct transactions while 
the futures commission merchant or introducing broker attempts to verify 
the customer's identity;
    (C) When an account should be closed after attempts to verify a 
customer's identity have failed; and
    (D) When the futures commission merchant or introducing broker 
should file a Suspicious Activity Report in accordance with applicable 
law and regulation.
    (3) Recordkeeping. The CIP must include procedures for making and 
maintaining a record of all information obtained under procedures 
implementing paragraph (b) of this section.
    (i) Required records. At a minimum, the record must include:
    (A) All identifying information about a customer obtained under 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section;
    (B) A description of any document that was relied on under paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section noting the type of document, any 
identification number contained in the document, the place of issuance, 
and if any, the date of issuance and expiration date;
    (C) A description of the methods and the results of any measures 
undertaken to verify the identity of a customer under paragraphs 
(b)(2)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section; and
    (D) A description of the resolution of each substantive discrepancy 
discovered when verifying the identifying information obtained.
    (ii) Retention of records. Each futures commission merchant and 
introducing broker must retain the records made under paragraph 
(b)(3)(i)(A) of this section for five years after the account is closed 
and the records made under paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(B), (C), and (D) of this 
section for five years after the record is made. In all other respects, 
the records must be maintained pursuant to the provisions of 17 CFR 
1.31.
    (4) Comparison with government lists. The CIP must include 
procedures for determining whether a customer appears on any list of 
known or suspected

[[Page 451]]

terrorists or terrorist organizations issued by any Federal government 
agency and designated as such by Treasury in consultation with the 
Federal functional regulators. The procedures must require the futures 
commission merchant or introducing broker to make such a determination 
within a reasonable period of time after the account is opened, or 
earlier if required by another Federal law or regulation or Federal 
directive issued in connection with the applicable list. The procedures 
also must require the futures commission merchant or introducing broker 
to follow all Federal directives issued in connection with such lists.
    (5)(i) Customer notice. The CIP must include procedures for 
providing customers with adequate notice that the futures commission 
merchant or introducing broker is requesting information to verify their 
identities.
    (ii) Adequate notice. Notice is adequate if the futures commission 
merchant or introducing broker generally describes the identification 
requirements of this section and provides such notice in a manner 
reasonably designed to ensure that a customer is able to view the 
notice, or is otherwise given notice, before opening an account. For 
example, depending upon the manner in which the account is opened, a 
futures commission merchant or introducing broker may post a notice in 
the lobby or on its Web site, include the notice on its account 
applications or use any other form of written or oral notice.
    (iii) Sample notice. If appropriate, a futures commission merchant 
or introducing broker may use the following sample language to provide 
notice to its customers:

    Important Information About Procedures For Opening a New Account

    To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money 
laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions 
to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person 
who opens an account.
    What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for 
your name, address, date of birth and other information that will allow 
us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's license or 
other identifying documents.

    (6) Reliance on another financial institution. The CIP may include 
procedures specifying when the futures commission merchant or 
introducing broker will rely on the performance by another financial 
institution (including an affiliate) of any procedures of its CIP, with 
respect to any customer of the futures commission merchant or 
introducing broker that is opening an account, or has established an 
account or similar business relationship with the other financial 
institution to provide or engage in services, dealings, or other 
financial transactions, provided that:
    (i) Such reliance is reasonable under the circumstances;
    (ii) The other financial institution is subject to a rule 
implementing 31 U.S.C. 5318(h), and is regulated by a Federal functional 
regulator; and
    (iii) The other financial institution enters into a contract 
requiring it to certify annually to the futures commission merchant or 
introducing broker that it has implemented its anti-money laundering 
program, and that it will perform (or its agent will perform) specified 
requirements of the futures commission merchant's or introducing 
broker's CIP.
    (c) Exemptions. The Commission, with the concurrence of the 
Secretary, may by order or regulation exempt any futures commission 
merchant or introducing broker that registers with the Commission or any 
type of account from the requirements of this section. In issuing such 
exemptions, the Commission and the Secretary shall consider whether the 
exemption is consistent with the purposes of the Bank Secrecy Act, and 
in the public interest, and may consider other necessary and appropriate 
factors.
    (d) Other requirements unaffected. Nothing in this section relieves 
a futures commission merchant or introducing broker of its obligation to 
comply with any other provision of this part, including provisions 
concerning information that must be obtained, verified, or maintained in 
connection with any account or transaction.

businesses.

    (a) Each money services business, as defined by Sec. 103.11(uu),

activities.
    (b) The program shall be commensurate with the risks posed by the 
location and size of, and the nature and volume of the financial 
services provided by, the money services business.
    (c) The program shall be in writing, and a money services business 
shall make copies of the anti-money laundering program available for 
inspection to the Department of the Treasury upon request.
    (d) At a minimum, the program shall:
    (1) Incorporate policies, procedures, and internal controls 
reasonably designed to assure compliance with this part.

    (D) Responding to law enforcement requests.
    (ii) Money services businesses that have automated data processing 
systems should integrate their compliance procedures with such systems.
    (iii) A person that is a money services business solely because it 
is an agent for another money services business as set forth in Sec. 
103.41(a)(2), and the money services business for which it serves as 
agent, may by agreement allocate between them responsibility for 
development of policies, procedures, and internal controls required by 
this paragraph (d)(1). Each money services business shall remain solely 
responsible for implementation of the requirements set forth in this 
section, and nothing in this paragraph (d)(1) relieves any money 
services business from its obligation to establish and maintain an 
effective anti-money laundering program.
    (2) Designate a person to assure day to day compliance with the 
program and this part. The responsibilities of such person shall include 
assuring that:
    (i) The money services business properly files reports, and creates 
and retains records, in accordance with applicable requirements of this 
part;
    (ii) The compliance program is updated as necessary to reflect 
current requirements of this part, and related guidance issued by the 
Department of the Treasury; and

    (3) Provide education and/or training of appropriate personnel 
concerning their responsibilities under the program, including training 
in the detection of suspicious transactions to the extent that the money 
services business is required to report such transactions under this 
part.
    (4) Provide for independent review to monitor and maintain an 
adequate program. The scope and frequency of the review shall be 
commensurate with the risk of the financial services provided by the 
money services business. Such review may be conducted by an officer or 
employee of the money services business so long as the reviewer is not 
the person designated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (e) Effective date. A money services business must develop and 
implement an anti-money laundering program that complies with the 
requirements of this section on or before the later of July 24, 2002, 
and the end of the 90-day period beginning on the day following the date 
the business is established.

    (b) Customer identification program: minimum requirements--(1) In 
general. A

[[Page 454]]

mutual fund must implement a written Customer Identification Program 
(``CIP'') appropriate for its size and type of business that, at a 
minimum, includes each of the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through 
(5) of this section. The CIP must be a part of the mutual fund's anti-
money laundering program required under the regulations implementing 31 
U.S.C. 5318(h).
    (2) Identity verification procedures. The CIP must include risk-
based procedures for verifying the identity of each customer to the 
extent reasonable and practicable. The procedures must enable the mutual 
fund to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of each 
customer. The procedures must be based on the mutual fund's assessment 
of the relevant risks, including those presented by the manner in which 
accounts are opened, fund shares are distributed, and purchases, sales 
and exchanges are effected, the various types of accounts maintained by 
the mutual fund, the various types of identifying information available, 
and the mutual fund's customer base. At a minimum, these procedures must 
contain the elements described in this paragraph (b)(2).
    (i) Customer information required--(A) In general. The CIP must 
contain procedures for opening an account that specify the identifying 
information that will be obtained with respect to each customer. Except 
as permitted by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, a mutual fund 
must obtain, at a minimum, the following information prior to opening an 
account:
    (1) Name;
    (2) Date of birth, for an individual;
    (3) Address, which shall be:
    (i) For an individual, a residential or business street address;

bearing a photograph or similar safeguard.

    Note to paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(4)(ii): When opening an account for a 
foreign business or enterprise that does not have an identification 
number, the mutual fund must request alternative government-issued 
documentation certifying the existence of the business or enterprise.

    (B) Exception for persons applying for a taxpayer identification 
number. Instead of obtaining a taxpayer identification number from a 
customer prior to opening an account, the CIP may include procedures for 
opening an account for a person that has applied for, but has not 
received, a taxpayer identification number. In this case, the CIP must 
include procedures to confirm that the application was filed before the 
person opens the account and to obtain the taxpayer identification 
number within a reasonable period of time after the account is opened.
    (ii) Customer verification. The CIP must contain procedures for 
verifying the identity of the customer, using the information obtained 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, within a 
reasonable time after the account is opened. The procedures must 
describe when the mutual fund will use documents, non-documentary 
methods, or a combination of both methods as described in this paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii).
    (A) Verification through documents. For a mutual fund relying on 
documents, the CIP must contain procedures that set forth the documents 
that the mutual fund will use. These documents may include:
    (1) For an individual, unexpired government-issued identification 
evidencing nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or similar 
safeguard, such as a driver's license or passport; and

[[Page 455]]

    (2) For a person other than an individual (such as a corporation, 
partnership, or trust), documents showing the existence of the entity, 
such as certified articles of incorporation, a government-issued 
business license, a partnership agreement, or trust instrument.
    (B) Verification through non-documentary methods. For a mutual fund 
relying on non-documentary methods, the CIP must contain procedures that 
describe the non-documentary methods the mutual fund will use.
    (1) These methods may include contacting a customer; independently 
verifying the customer's identity through the comparison of information 
provided by the customer with information obtained from a consumer 
reporting agency, public database, or other source; checking references 
with other financial institutions; and obtaining a financial statement.
    (2) The mutual fund's non-documentary procedures must address 
situations where an individual is unable to present an unexpired 
government-issued identification document that bears a photograph or 
similar safeguard; the mutual fund is not familiar with the documents 
presented; the account is opened without obtaining documents; the 
customer opens the account without appearing in person; and where the 
mutual fund is otherwise presented with circumstances that increase the 
risk that the mutual fund will be unable to verify the true identity of 
a customer through documents.
    (C) Additional verification for certain customers. The CIP must 
address situations where, based on the mutual fund's risk assessment of 
a new account opened by a customer that is not an individual, the mutual 
fund will obtain information about individuals with authority or control 
over such account, including persons authorized to effect transactions 
in the shareholder of record's account, in order to verify the 
customer's identity. This verification method applies only when the 
mutual fund cannot verify the customer's true identity using the 
verification methods described in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of 
this section.
    (iii) Lack of verification. The CIP must include procedures for 
responding to circumstances in which the mutual fund cannot form a 
reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of a customer. These 
procedures should describe:
    (A) When the mutual fund should not open an account;
    (B) The terms under which a customer may use an account while the 
mutual fund attempts to verify the customer's identity;
    (C) When the mutual fund should file a Suspicious Activity Report in 
accordance with applicable law and regulation; and
    (D) When the mutual fund should close an account, after attempts to 
verify a customer's identity have failed.
    (3) Recordkeeping. The CIP must include procedures for making and 
maintaining a record of all information obtained under paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (i) Required records. At a minimum, the record must include:
    (A) All identifying information about a customer obtained under 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section;
    (B) A description of any document that was relied on under paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section noting the type of document, any 
identification number contained in the document, the place of issuance, 
and if any, the date of issuance and expiration date;
    (C) A description of the methods and the results of any measures 
undertaken to verify the identity of the customer under paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section; and
    (D) A description of the resolution of any substantive discrepancy 
discovered when verifying the identifying information obtained.
    (ii) Retention of records. The mutual fund must retain the 
information in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section for five years 
after the date the account is closed. The mutual fund must retain the 
information in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(B), (C), and (D) of this section for 
five years after the record is made.
    (4) Comparison with government lists. The CIP must include 
procedures for determining whether the customer appears on any list of 
known or suspected

[[Page 456]]

terrorists or terrorist organizations issued by any federal government 
agency and designated as such by the Department of the Treasury in 
consultation with the federal functional regulators. The procedures must 
require the mutual fund to make such a determination within a reasonable 
period of time after the account is opened, or earlier, if required by 
another federal law or regulation or federal directive issued in 
connection with the applicable list. The procedures must also require 
the mutual fund to follow all federal directives issued in connection 
with such lists.
    (5)(i) Customer notice. The CIP must include procedures for 
providing mutual fund customers with adequate notice that the mutual 
fund is requesting information to verify their identities.
    (ii) Adequate notice. Notice is adequate if the mutual fund 
generally describes the identification requirements of this section and 
provides the notice in a manner reasonably designed to ensure that a 
customer is able to view the notice, or is otherwise given notice, 
before opening an account. For example, depending on the manner in which 
the account is opened, a mutual fund may post a notice on its website, 
include the notice on its account applications, or use any other form of 
written or oral notice.
    (iii) Sample notice. If appropriate, a mutual fund may use the 
following sample language to provide notice to its customers:

    IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT

    To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money 
laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions 
to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person 
who opens an account.
    What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for 
your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow 
us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's license or 
other identifying documents.

    (6) Reliance on other financial institutions. The CIP may include 
procedures specifying when a mutual fund will rely on the performance by 
another financial institution (including an affiliate) of any procedures 
of the mutual fund's CIP, with respect to any customer of the mutual

             Appendix A to Part 103--Administrative Rulings

                          88-1 (June 22, 1988)

                                  Issue

    What action should a financial institution take when it believes 
that it is being misused by persons who are intentionally structuring 
transactions to evade the reporting requirement or engaging in 
transactions that may involve illegal activity such as drug trafficking, 
tax evasion or money laundering?

                                  Facts

    A teller at X State Bank notices that the same person comes into the 
bank each day and purchases, with cash, between $9,000 and $9,900 in 
cashier's checks. Even when aggregated, these purchases never exceed 
$10,000 during any one business day. The teller also notices that this 
person tries to go to different tellers for each transaction and is very 
reluctant to provide information about his frequent transactions or 
other information such as name, address, etc. Likewise, the payees on 
these cashier's checks all have common names such as ``John Smith'' or 
``Mary Jones.'' The teller informs the bank's compliance officer that 
she believes that this person is structuring his transactions in order 
to evade the reporting requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act. X State 
Bank wants to know what actions it should take in this situation or in 
any other situation where a transaction or a person conducting a 
transaction appears suspicious.

                            Law and Analysis

    As it appears that the person may be intentionally structuring the 
transactions to evade the Bank Secrecy Act reporting requirements, X 
State Bank should immediately telephone the local office of the Internal 
Revenue Service (``IRS'') and speak to a Special Agent in the IRS 
Criminal Investigation Division, or should call 1-800-BSA-CTRS, where 
his call will be referred to a Special Agent.
    Any information provided to the IRS should be given within the 
confines of Sec. 1103(c) of the Right to Financial Privacy Act. 12 
U.S.C. 3401-3422. Section 1103(c) of that Act permits a financial 
instituiton to

[[Page 480]]

notify a government authority of information relevant to a possible 
violation of any statute or regulation. Such information may consist of 
the names of any individuals or corporate entities involved in the 
suspicious transactions; account numbers; home and business addresses; 
social security numbers; type of account; interest paid on account; 
location of the branch or office where the suspicious transaction 
occurred; a specification of the offense that the financial institution 
believes has been committed; and a description of the activities giving 
rise to the bank's suspicion. S. Rep. 99-433, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 
15-16.
    Additionally, the bank may be required, by the Federal regulatory 
agency which supervises it, to submit a criminal referral form. Thus, 
the bank should check with its regulatory agency to determine whether a 
referral form should be submitted.
    Lastly, under the facts as described above, X State Bank is not 
required to file a Currency Transaction Report (``CTR'') because the 
currency transaction (i.e. purchase of cashier's checks) did not exceed 
$10,000 during one business day. If the bank had found that on a 
particular day the person had in fact used a total of more than $10,000 
in currency to purchase cashier's checks, but had each individual 
cashier's check made out in amounts of less than $10,000, the bank is 
obligated to file a CTR, and should follow the other steps described 
above.

                                 Holding

    If X State Bank notices that a person may be misusing it by 
intentionally structuring transactions to evade the BSA reporting 
requirements or engaging in transactions that may involve other illegal 
activity, the bank should telephone the local office of the Internal 
Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation Division, and report that 
information to a Special Agent, or should call 1-800-BSA-CTRS. In 
addition, the Federal regulatory agency which supervises X State Bank 
may require the bank to submit a criminal referral form. All disclosures 
to the Government should be made in accordance with the provisions of 
the Right to Financial Privacy Act.

                          88-2 (June 22, 1988)

                                  Issue

    When, if ever, should a bank file a CMIR on behalf of its customer, 
when the customer is importing or exporting more than $10,000 in 
currency or monetary instruments?

                                  Facts

    A customer walks into B National Bank (``B'') with $15,000 in cash 
for deposit into her account. As is required, the bank teller begins to 
fill out a Currency Transaction Report (``CTR'', IRS Form 4789) in order 
to report a transaction in currency of more than $10,000. While the 
teller is filling out the CTR, the customer mentions to the teller that 
she has just received the money in a letter from a relative in France. 
Should the teller also file a CMIR, either on the customer's behalf or 
on the bank's behalf?

                            Law and Analysis

    B National Bank should not file a CMIR when a customer deposits 
currency in excess of $10,000 into her account, even if the bank has 
knowledge that the customer received the currency from a place outside 
the United States. 31 CFR 103.23 requires that a CMIR be filed by anyone 
who transports, mails, ships or receives, or attempts, causes or 
attempts to cause the transportation, mailing, shipping or receiving of 
currency or monetary instruments in excess of $10,000, from or to a 
place outside the United States. The term ``monetary instruments'' 
includes currency and instruments such as negotiable instruments 
endorsed without restriction. See 31 CFR 103.11(k).
    The obligation to file the CMIR is solely on the person who 
transports, mails, ships or receives, or causes or attempts to 
transport, mail, ship or receive. No other person is under any 
obligation to file a CMIR. Thus, if a customer walks into the bank and 
declares that he or she has received or transported currency in an 
aggregate amount exceeding $10,000 from a place outside the United 
States and wishes to deposit the currency into his or her account, the 
bank is under no obligation to file a CMIR on the customer's behalf. 
Likewise, because the bank itself did not receive the money from a 
customer outside the United States, it has no obligation to file a CMIR 
on its own behalf. The same holds true if a customer declares his intent 
to transport currency or monetary instruments in excess of $10,000 to a 
place outside the United States.
    However, the bank is strongly encouraged to inform the customer of 
the CMIR reporting requirement. If the bank has knowledge that the 
customer is aware of the CMIR reporting requirement, but is nevertheless 
disregarding the requirement or if information about the transaction is 
otherwise suspicious, the bank should contact the local office of the 
U.S. Customs Service or 1-800-BE ALERT. The United States Customs 
Service has been delegated authority by the Assistant Secretary 
(Enforcement) to investigate criminal violations of 31 CFR 103.23. See 
31 CFR 103.36(c)(1).
    Any information provided to Customs should be given within the 
confines of section 1103(c) of the Right to Financial Privacy Act, 12 
U.S.C. 3401-3422. Section 1103(c) permits a financial institution to 
notify a Government authority of information relevant to a possible 
violation of any statute or regulation. Such information may consist of 
the

[[Page 481]]

name (including those of corporate entities) of any individual involved 
in the suspicious transaction; account numbers; home and business 
addresses; social security numbers; type of account; interest paid on 
account; location of branch where the suspicious transaction occurred; a 
specification of the offense that the financial institution believes has 
been committed; and a description of the activities giving rise to the 
bank's suspicions. See S. Rep. 99-433, 99th Cong., 2nd Sess., pp. 15-16. 
Therefore, under the facts above, the teller need only file a CTR for 
the deposit of the customer's $15,000 in currency.
    A previous interpretation of Sec. 103.23(b) by Treasury held that 
if a bank received currency or monetary instruments over the counter 
from a person who may have transported them into the United States, and 
knows that such items have been transported into the country, it must 
file a report on Form 4790 if a complete and truthful report has not 
been filed by the customer. See 31 CFR 103 appendix, Sec. 103.23, 
interpretation 2, at 364 (1987). This ruling hereby supersedes that 
interpretation.

                                 Holding

    A bank should not file a CMIR when a customer deposits currency or 
monetary instruments in excess of $10,000 into her account even if the 
bank has knowledge that the currency or monetary instruments were 
received or transported from a place outside the United States. 31 CFR 
103.23. The same is true if the bank has knowledge that the customer 
intends to transport the currency or monetary instruments to a place 
outside the United States. However, the bank is required to file a CTR 
if it receives in excess of $10,000 in cash from its customer, and is 
strongly encouraged to inform the customer of the CMIR requirements. In 
addition, if the bank has knowledge that the customer is aware of the 
CMIR reporting requirement and is nevertheless planning to disregard it 
or if the transaction is otherwise suspicious, the bank should notify 
the local office of the United States Customs Service (or 1-800-Be 
Alert) of the suspicious transaction. Such notice should be made within 
the confines of the Right to Financial Privacy Act, 12 U.S.C. 3403(c).

                          88-3 (June 22, 1988)

                                  Issue

    Whether a bank may exempt ``cash-back'' transactions of a customer 
whose primary business is of a type that may be exempted either 
unilaterally by the bank or pursuant to additional authority granted by 
the IRS.

                                  Facts

    The ABC Grocery (``ABC''), a retail grocery store, has an account at 
the X State Bank for its daily deposits of currency. Because ABC 
regularly and frequently deposits amounts ranging from $20,000 to 
$30,000, the bank has properly granted ABC an exemption for daily 
deposits up to a limit of $30,000.
    Recently, ABC began providing its customers with a check-cashing 
service as an adjunct to its primary business of selling groceries. 
ABC's primary business still consists of the sale of groceries. However, 
the unexpectedly heavy demand for ABC's check-cashing service has 
required ABC to maintain a substantially greater quantity of cash in the 
store than was necessary for the grocery business in the past. To 
facilitate the operations of its check-cashing service, ABC is 
presenting the bank with large numbers of checks in ``cash-back'' 
transactions, rather than depositing the checks into its account and 
withdrawing cash from that account. X State Bank has just been presented 
with a ``cash-back'' transaction wherein an employee of ABC is 
exchanging $15,000 worth of checks for cash. How should the bank treat 
this transaction?

                            Law and Analysis

    A cash back transaction is one where one or more checks or other 
monetary instruments are presented in exchange for cash or a portion of 
the checks or monetary instruments are deposited while the remainder is 
exchanged for cash. ``Cash back'' transactions can never be exempted 
from the Bank Secrecy Act reporting requirements. Thus, the bank must 
file a Currency Transaction Report on IRS Form 4789 reporting this 
$15,000 ``cash back'' transaction, even though the customer's account 
has been granted an exemption for daily deposits of up to $30,000. This 
is because Sec. 103.22(b)(i) permits a bank to exempt only ``(d)eposits 
or withdrawals of currency from an existing account by an established 
depositor who is a United States resident and operates a retail type of 
business in the United States'' (emphasis added). As ``cash-back'' 
transactions do not constitute either a ``deposit or withdrawal of 
currency'' within the meaning of the regulations, the bank must report 
on a CTR any ``cash-back'' transaction that results in the transfer of 
more than $10,000 in currency to a customer during a single banking day, 
regardless of whether the customer has properly been granted an 
exemption for its deposits or withdrawals.
    Moreover, because ``cash back'' transactions are never exemptible, 
the bank may not unilaterally exempt ``cash-back'' transactions by ABC, 
or seek additional authority from the IRS to grant a special exemption 
for ABC's ``cash-back'' transactions. Instead, the bank must report 
ABC's ``cash back'' transaction on a CTR, listing it as a $15,000 
``check cashed'' transaction.

[[Page 482]]

                                 Holding

    A bank may never grant a unilateral exemption, or obtain additional 
authority from the IRS to grant a special exemption to the ``cash-back'' 
transactions of a customer. A ``cash back'' transaction is one where one 
or more checks or other monetary instruments are presented in exchange 
for cash or a portion of the checks or monetary instruments are 
deposited while the remainder is exchanged for cash. If a bank handles a 
``cash-back'' transaction that results in the transfer of more than 
$10,000 to a customer during a single banking day, it must report that 
transaction on IRS Form 4789, the Currency Transaction Report, as a 
``check cashed'' transaction, regardless of whether the customer has 
been properly granted an exemption for daily deposits or withdrawals.

                          88-4 (August 2, 1988)

                                  Issue

    If a bank has exempted a single account of a customer into which 
multiple establishments of that customer make deposits, must the bank 
list all of the establishments on its exemption list or may the bank 
list only the Sec. 103.22(f) information of the customer's headquarters 
or its principal business establishment on its exemption list?

                                  Facts

    A fast food company operates a chain of fast-food restaurants in 
several states. In New York, the company has established a single 
deposit account at Bank A, into which all of the company's 
establishments in that area make deposits. In Connecticut, the company 
has established ten bank accounts at Bank B; each of the company's ten 
establishments in Connecticut have been assigned a separate account into 
which it makes deposits. Banks A and B have properly exempted the 
company's accounts, but now seek guidance on the manner in which they 
should add these accounts to their exemption lists. All of the company's 
establishments use the same taxpayer identification number (``TIN'').

                            Law and Analysis

    Under the regulations, the bank must keep ``in a centralized list,'' 
Sec. 103.22(f) information for ``each depositor that has engaged in 
currency transactions which have not been reported because of (an) 
exemption * * *'' However, where all of the company's establishments 
deposit into one exempt account as at Bank A, above, the bank need only 
maintain Sec. 103.22(f) information on its list for the customer's 
corporate headquarters or the principal establishment that obtained the 
exemption. The bank may, but is not required to, list identifying 
information for all of the customers' establishments depositing into the 
one account. If the bank chooses to list only the information for the 
customer's headquarters or principal establishment, it should briefly 
note that on the exemption list and should ensure that the individual 
addresses for each establishment are readily available upon request. 
Where each of the company's establishments deposit into separate exempt 
accounts as at Bank B, the bank must maintain separate Sec. 103.22(f) 
information on the exemption list for each establishment.
    Under Sec. 103.22(b)(2) (i), (ii), and (iv) and Sec.  103.22(e) of 
the regulation, a bank can only grant an exemption for ``an existing 
account (of) an established depositor who is a United States resident.'' 
Under these provisions, therefore, the bank can only grant an exemption 
for an existing individual account, not for an individual customer or 
group of accounts. Thus, if a customer has a separate account for each 
of its business establishments, the bank must consider each account for 
a separate exemption. If the bank grants exemptions for more than one 
account, it should prepare a separate exemption statement and establish 
a separate dollar limit for each account.
    Once an exemption has been granted for an account, Sec. 103.22(f) 
requires the bank to maintain a centralized exemption list that includes 
the name, address, business, types of transactions exempted, the dollar 
limit of the exemption, taxpayer identification number, and account 
number of the customers whose accounts have been exempted.

                                 Holding

    Under 31 CFR 103.22, when a bank has exempted a single account of a 
customer into which more than one of the customer's establishments make 
deposits, the bank may include the name, address, business, type of 
transactions exempted, the dollar limit of the exemption, taxpayer 
identification number, and account number (``Sec. 103.22(f) 
information'') of either the customer's headquarters or the principal 
business establishment, or it may separately list Sec. 103.22(f) 
information for each of the establishments using that account. If the 
bank chooses to list only the information for the customer's 
headquarters or principal establishment, it should briefly note that 
fact on the exemption list, and it should ensure that the individual 
addresses of those establishments not on the list are readily available 
upon request. If a bank has granted separate exemptions to several 
accounts, each of which is used by a single establishment of the same 
customer, the bank must include on its exemption list Sec. 103.22(f) 
information for each of those establishments. Previous Treasury 
correspondence or interpretations contrary to this policy are hereby 
rescinded.

    Does a financial institution have a duty to file a CTR on currency 
transactions where the financial institution never physically receives 
the cash because it uses an armored car service to collect, transport 
and process its customer's cash receipts?

                                  Facts

    X State Bank (the ``Bank'') and Acme Armored Car Service (``Acme'') 
have entered into a contract which provides for Acme to collect, 
transport and process revenues received from Bank customers:
    Each day, Acme picks up cash, checks, and deposit tickets from 
Little Z, a non-exempt customer of the Bank. Recently, receipts of cash 
from Little Z have exceeded $10,000. Acme delivers the checks and 
deposit tickets to the Bank where they are processed and Little Z's 
account is credited. All cash collected, however, is taken by Acme to 
its central office where it is counted and processed. The cash is then 
delivered by Acme to the Federal Reserve Bank for deposit into the 
Bank's account. Must the Bank file a CTR to report a receipt of cash in 
excess of $10,000 by Acme from Little Z?

                            Law and Anaylsis

    Yes. Since Acme is receiving cash in excess of $10,000 on behalf of 
the Bank, the Bank must file a CTR in order to report these 
transactions.
    Section 103.22(a)(1) requires ``(e)ach financial institution * * * 
[to] file a report of each deposit, withdrawal, exchange of currency or 
other payment or transfer, by, through or to such financial institution 
which involves a transaction in currency of more than $10,000.'' Section 
103.11 (a) and (g) defines ``Bank'' and ``Financial Institution'' to 
include agents of those banks and financial institutions.
    Under the facts presented, Acme is acting as an agent of the Bank. 
This is because Acme and the Bank have a contractual relationship 
whereby the Bank has authorized Acme to pick up, transport and process 
Little Z's receipts on behalf of the Bank. The Federal Reserve Bank's 
acceptance of deposits from Acme into the Bank's account at the Fed, is 
additional evidence of the agency relationship between the Bank and 
Acme.
    Therefore, when Acme receives currency in excess of $10,000 from 
Little Z, the Bank must report that transaction on Form 4789. Likewise, 
if Acme receives currency from Little Z in multiple transactions, Sec. 
103.22(a)(1) requires the Bank to aggregate these transactions and file 
a single CTR for the total amount of currency received by Acme, if the 
Bank has knowledge of these multiple transactions. Knowledge by the 
Bank's agent, i.e., Acme, that the currency was received in multiple 
transactions, is attributable to the Bank. The Bank must assure that 
Acme, as its agent, obtains all the information and identification 
necessary to complete the CTR.

                                 Holding

    Financial institutions must file a CTR for the currency received by 
an armored car service from the financial institution's customer when 
the armored car service physically receives the cash from the customer, 
transports it and processes the receipts, even though the currency may 
never physically be received by the financial institution. This is 
because the armored car service is acting as an agent of the financial 
institution.

                                  Issue

    Under Sec. 103.22 of the BSA regulations, may a bank unilaterally 
grant one exemption or establish a single dollar exemption limit for a 
group of existing accounts of the same customer? If not, may a bank 
obtain additional authority from the IRS to grant a single exemption for 
a group of exemptible accounts belonging to the same customer?

                                  Facts

    ABC Inc. (``ABC''), with TIN 12-3456789, owns five fast food 
restaurants. Each restaurant has its own account at the X State Bank and 
each restaurant routinely deposits less than $10,000 into its individual 
account. However, when the deposits into these five accounts are 
aggregated they regularly and frequently exceed $10,000. Accordingly, 
the bank prepares and files one CTR for ABC Inc., on each business day 
that ABC's aggregated currency transactions exceed $10,000. X State Bank 
wants to know whether it can unilaterally exempt these five accounts 
having the same TIN, and, if not, whether it can obtain additional 
authority from the IRS to grant a single exemption to the group of five 
accounts belonging to ABC.

                            Law and Analysis

    Under Sec. 103.22(b)(2) (i) and (ii) of the Bank Secrecy Act 
(``BSA'') regulations, 31 CFR part 103, only an individual account of a 
customer may be unilaterally exempted from the currency transaction 
reporting provisions. The bank may not unilaterally grant one exemption 
or establish a single dollar exemption limit for multiple accounts of 
the same customer. This is because Sec. Sec. 103.22(b)(2)(i) and 
103.22(b)(2)(ii) of the BSA regulations only permit a bank to 
unilaterally exempt ``[d]eposits or withdrawals of currency from an 
existing account by an established depositor who is a United States

[[Page 484]]

resident and operates a retail type of business in the United States.'' 
31 CFR 103.22(b)(2) (i) and (ii).
    Section 103.22(e) of the BSA regulations provides, however, that 
``[a] bank may apply to the * * * [IRS] for additional authority to 
grant exemptions to the reporting requirements not otherwise permitted 
under paragraph (b) of this section * * *'' 31 CFR 103.22(e). Therefore, 
under this authority, and at the request of a bank, the IRS may, in its 
discretion, grant the requesting bank additional authority to exempt a 
group of accounts when the following conditions are met:
    (1) Each of the accounts in the group is owned by the same person 
and has the same taxpayer identification number.
    (2) The deposits or withdrawals into each account are made by a 
customer that operates a business that may be either unilaterally or 
specially exemptible and each account meets the other exemption criteria 
(except for the dollar amount).
    (3) Currency transactions for each account individually do not 
exceed $10,000 on a regular and frequent basis.
    (4) Aggregated currency transactions for all accounts included in 
the group regularly and frequently exceed $10,000.
    If a bank determines that an exemption would be appropriate in a 
situation involving a group of accounts belonging to a single customer, 
it must apply to the IRS for authority to grant one special exemption 
covering the accounts in question. As with all requests for special 
exemptions, any request for additional authority to grant a special 
exemption must be made in writing and accompanied by a statement of the 
circumstances that warrant special exemption treatment and a copy of the 
statement signed by the customer as required by Sec. 103.22(d). 31 CFR 
103.22(d).
    Additional authority to grant a special exemption for a group of 
accounts must be obtained from the IRS regardless of whether the 
businesses may be unilaterally exempted under Sec. 103.22(b)(2), 
because the exemption, if granted, would apply to a group of existing 
accounts as opposed to an individual existing account. 31 CFR 
103.22(b)(2).
    Also, if any one of a given customer's accounts has regular and 
frequent currency transactions which exceed $10,000, that account may 
not be included in the group exemption. This is because the bank may, as 
provided by Sec. 103.22(b)(2), either unilaterally exempt that account 
or obtain authority from the IRS to grant a special exemption for that 
account if it meets the other criteria for exemption. Thus, only 
accounts of exemptible businesses which do not have regular and frequent 
(e.g., daily, weekly or twice a month) currency transactions in excess 
of $10,000 may be eligible for a group exemption.
    The intention of this special exemption is to permit banks to exempt 
the accounts of established customers, such as the ABC Inc. restaurants 
described above, which are owned by the same person and have the same 
TIN but which individually do not have sufficient currency deposit or 
withdrawal activity that regularly and frequently exceed $10,000.

                                 Holding

    If X State Bank determines that an exemption would be appropriate 
for ABC Inc., it must apply to the IRS for authority to grant one 
special exemption covering ABC's five separate accounts. As with all 
requests for special exemptions, ABC's request for additional authority 
to grant a special exemption must be made in writing and accompanied by 
a statement of the circumstances that warrant special exemption 
treatment and a copy of the statement signed by the customer as required 
by Sec. 103.22(d). 31 CFR 103.22(d). The IRS may, in its discretion, 
grant additional authority to exempt the ABC accounts if: (1) They have 
the same taxpayer identification number; (2) they each are for customers 
that operate a business that may be either unilaterally or specially 
exemptible and each account meets the other exemption criteria (except 
for dollar amount); (3) the currency transactions for each account 
individually do not exceed $10,000 on a regular and frequent basis; but 
(4) when aggregated the currency transactions for all the accounts 
regularly and frequently do exceed $10,000.

                          89-2 (June 21, 1989)

                                  Issue

    When a customer has established bank accounts for each of several 
establishments that it owns, and the bank has exempted one or more of 
those accounts, how does the bank aggregate the customer's currency 
transactions?

                                  Facts

    X Company (``X'') operates two fast-food restaurants and a wholesale 
food business. X has opened separate bank accounts at the A National 
Bank (the ``Bank'') for each of its two restaurants, account numbers 1 
and 2 respectively. Each of these two accounts has been properly 
exempted by the bank. Account number 1 has an exemption limit of $25,000 
for deposits, and account number 2 has an exemption limit of $40,000 for 
deposits. X also has a third account, account number 3, at the bank for 
use in the operation of its wholesale food business. On occasion, cash 
deposits of more than $10,000 are made into this third account. Because 
these cash

[[Page 485]]

deposits are infrequent, the bank cannot obtain additional authority to 
grant this account a special exemption.
    During the same business day, two $15,000 cash deposits totalling 
$30,000 are made into account number 1, a separate cash deposit of 
$35,000 is made into account number 2 and a deposit of $9,000 in 
currency is made into account number 3 (X's account for its wholesale 
food business).
    The bank must now determine how to aggregate and report all of these 
transactions on a Form 4789, Currency Transaction Report, (``CTR''). 
Must they aggregate all of the deposits made into account numbers 1, 2 
and 3 and report them on a single CTR?

                            Law and Analysis

    Section 103.22 of the Bank Secrecy Act (``BSA''), 31 CFR part 103, 
requires a financial institution to treat multiple currency transactions 
``as a single transaction if the financial institution has knowledge 
that they are by or on behalf of any person and result in either cash-in 
or cash-out totalling more than $10,000 during any one business day.'' 
This means that a financial institution must file a CTR if it knows that 
multiple currency transactions involving two or more accounts have been 
conducted by or on behalf of the same person and, those transactions, 
when aggregated, exceed $10,000. Knowledge, in this context, means 
knowledge on the part of a partner, director, officer or employee of the 
institution or on the part of any existing computer or manual system at 
the institution that permits it to aggregate transactions.
    Thus, if the bank has knowledge of multiple transactions, the bank 
should aggregate the transactions in the following manner.
    First, the bank should separately review and total all cash-in and 
cash-out transactions within each account. Cash-in transactions should 
be aggregated with other cash-in transactions and cash-out transactions 
should be aggregated with cash-out transactions. Cash-in and cash-out 
transactions should not be aggregated together or offset against each 
other.
    Second, the bank should determine whether the account has an 
exemption limit. If the account has an exemption limit, the bank should 
determine whether it has been exceeded. If the exemption limit has not 
been exceeded, the transactions for the exempted account should not be 
aggregated with other transactions.
    If the total transactions during the same business day for a 
particular account exceed the exemption limit, the total of all of the 
transactions for that account should be aggregated with the total amount 
of the transactions for other accounts that exceed their respective 
exemption limits, with any accounts without exemption limits, and with 
transactions conducted by or on behalf of the same person that do not 
involve accounts (e.g., purchases of bank checks with cash) of which the 
bank has knowledge.
    In the example discussed above, all of the transactions have been 
conducted ``on behalf of'' X, as X owns the restaurants and the 
wholesale food business. The total $30,000 deposit for account 1 exceeds 
the $25,000 exemption limit for that account. The $35,000 deposit into 
account number 2 is less than the $40,000 exemption limit for that 
account. Finally, the $9,000 deposit into account number 3, does not by 
itself constitute a reportable transaction.
    Therefore, under the facts above, the bank should aggregate the 
entire $30,000 deposit into account number 1 (not just the amount that 
exceeds the exemption limit), with the $9,000 deposit into account 
number 3, for a total of $39,000. The bank should not include the 
$35,000 deposit into account number 2, as that deposit does not exceed 
the exemption limit for that account. Accordingly, the bank should 
complete and file a single CTR for $39,000.
    If the bank does not have knowledge that multiple currency 
transactions have been conducted in these accounts on the same business 
day (e.g., because it does not have a system that aggregates among 
accounts and the deposits were made by three different individuals at 
different times) the bank should file one CTR for $30,000 for account 
number 1, as the activity into that account exceeds its exemption limit.

                                 Holding

    When a customer has more than one account and a bank employee has 
knowledge that multiple currency transaction have been conducted in the 
accounts or the bank has an existing computer or manual system that 
permits it to aggregate transactions for multiple accounts, the bank 
should aggregate the transactions in the following manner.
    First, the bank should aggregate for each account all cash-in or 
cash-out transactions conducted during one business day. If the account 
has an exemption limit, the bank should determine whether the exemption 
limit of that account has been exceeded. If the exemption limit has not 
been exceeded, the total of the transactions for that particular account 
does not have to be aggregated with other transactions. If the total 
transactions during the same business day for a particular account 
exceed the exemption limit, however, the total of all of the 
transactions for that account should be aggregated with any total from 
other accounts that exceed their respective exemption limits, with any 
accounts without exemption limits, and with any reportable transactions 
conducted by or on behalf of the customer not involving accounts (e.g., 
purchases of

[[Page 486]]

bank checks or ``cash back'' transactions) of which the bank has 
knowledge. The bank should then file a CTR for the aggregated amount.

    How does a financial institution fulfill the requirement that it 
furnish information about the person on whose behalf a reportable 
currency transaction is being conducted?

                                  Facts

    No. 1. Linda Scott has had an account relationship with the Bank for 
15 years. Ms. Scott enters the bank and deposits $15,000 in cash into 
her personal checking account. The bank knows that Ms. Scott is an 
artist who on occasions exhibits and sells her art work and that her art 
work currently is on exhibit at the local gallery. The bank further 
knows that cash deposits in the amount of $15,000 are commensurate with 
Ms. Scott's art sales.
    No. 2. Dick Wallace has recently opened a personal account at the 
Bank. Although the bank verified his identity when the account was 
opened, the bank has no additional information about Mr. Wallace. Mr. 
Wallace enters the bank with $18,000 in currency and asks that it be 
wire transferred to a bank in a foreign country.
    No. 3. Dorothy Green, a partner at a law firm, makes a $50,000 cash 
deposit into the firm's trust account.\1\ The bank knows that this is a 
trust account. The $50,000 represents cash received from three clients.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ This type of account is sometimes called a trust account, 
attorney account or special account. It is an account established by an 
attorney into which commingled funds of clients may be deposited. It is 
not necessarily a ``trust'' in the legal sense of the term.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No. 4. Carlos Gomez enters a Currency Dealer and asks to buy $12,000 
in traveler's checks with cash.
    No. 5. Gail Julian, a trusted employee of Q-mart, a large retail 
chain, enters the bank three times during one business day and makes 
three large cash deposits totalling $48,000 into Q-mart's account. The 
Bank knows that Ms. Julian is responsible for making the deposits on 
behalf of Q-mart. Q-mart has an exemption limit of $45,000.

                            Law and Analysis

    Under Sec. 103.28 of the Bank Secrecy Act (``BSA'') regulations, 31 
CFR part 103, a financial institution must report on a Currency 
Transaction Report (``CTR'') the name and address of the individual 
conducting the transaction, and the identity, account number, and the 
social security or taxpayer identification number of any person on whose 
behalf the transaction was conducted. See 31 U.S.C. 5313. ``A 
participant acting for another person shall make the report as the agent 
or bailee of the person and identify the person for whom the transaction 
is being made.'' Identifying information about the person on whose 
behalf the transaction is conducted must always be furnished if the 
transaction is reportable under the BSA, regardless of whether the 
transaction involves an account.
    Because the BSA requires financial institutions to file complete and 
accurate CTR's, it is the financial institution's responsibility to 
ascertain the real party in interest. 31 U.S.C. 5313. One way that a 
financial institution can obtain information about the identity of the 
person on whose behalf the transaction is being conducted is to ask the 
person conducting the transaction whether he is acting for himself or on 
behalf of another person. Only if as a result of strong ``know your 
customer'' or other internal control policies, the financial institution 
is satisfied that its records contain information concerning the true 
identity of the person on whose behalf the transaction is conducted, may 
the financial institution rely on those records to complete the CTR.
    No. 1. Linda Scott, an artist, is a known customer of the bank. The 
bank is aware that she is exhibiting her work at a local gallery and 
that cash deposits in the amount of $15,000 would not be unusual or 
inconsistent with Ms. Scott's business practices. Therefore, if the bank 
through its stringent ``know your customer'' policies is satisfied that 
the money being deposited by Ms. Scott into her personal account is for 
her benefit, the bank need not ask Ms. Scott whether she is acting on 
behalf of someone else.
    No. 2. Because Dick Wallace is a new customer of the bank and 
because the bank has no additional information about him or his business 
activity, the bank should ask Mr. Wallace whether he is acting on his 
own behalf or on behalf of someone else. This is particularly true given 
the nature of the transaction--a wire transfer with cash for an 
individual to a foreign country.
    No. 3. Dorothy Green's cash deposit of $50,000 into the law firm's 
trust account clearly is being done on behalf of someone else. The bank 
should ask Ms. Green to identify the clients on whose behalf the 
transaction is being conducted. Because Ms. Green is acting both on 
behalf of her employer and the clients, the names of the three clients 
and the law firm should be included on the CTR filed by the bank.
    No. 4. The currency dealer, having no account relationship with 
Carlos Gomez, should ask Mr. Gomez if he is acting on behalf of someone 
else.
    No. 5. Gail Julian is known to the bank as a trusted employee of Q-
mart, who often deposits cash into Q-mart's account. If the

[[Page 487]]

bank, through its strong ``know your customer'' policies is satisfied 
that Ms. Julian makes these deposits on behalf of Q-mart, the bank need 
not ask her if she is acting on behalf of someone other than Q-mart.

                                 Holding

    It is the responsibility of a financial institution to file complete 
and accurate CTRs. This includes providing identifying information about 
the person on whose behalf the transaction is conducted in Part II of 
the CTR. One way that a financial institution can obtain information 
about the true identity of the person on whose behalf the transaction is 
being conducted is to ask the person conducting the transaction whether 
he is acting for himself or on behalf of another person. Only if as a 
result of strong ``know your customer'' or other internal control 
policies, the financial institution is satisfied that its record contain 
the necessary information concerning the true identity of the person on 
whose behalf the transaction is being conducted, may the financial 
institutions rely on those records in completing the CTR.

    How does a financial institution fulfill the requirement to verify 
and record the name and address of an elderly or disabled individual who 
conducts a currency transaction in excess of $10,000 or who purchases 
certain monetary instruments with currency valued between $3,000 and 
$10,000 when he/she does not possess a passport, alien identification 
card or other official document, or other document that is normally 
acceptable within the banking community as a means of identification 
when cashing checks for nondepositors?

                                 Holding

    It is the responsibility of a financial institution to file complete 
and accurate CTRs and to maintain complete and accurate monetary 
instrument logs pursuant to 31 CFR Sec. Sec. 103.27(d) and 103.29 of 
the BSA regulations. It is also the responsibility of a financial 
institution to verify and to record the identity of individuals 
conducting reportable currency transactions and/or cash purchases of 
certain monetary instruments as required by BSA regulations Sec. Sec. 
103.28 and 103.29. Only if the financial institution is confident that 
an elderly or disabled patron is who s/he says s/he is may it complete 
these transactions. A financial institution shall use whatever 
information it has available, in accordance with its established 
policies and procedures, to determine its patron's identity. This 
includes review of its internal records for any information on file, and 
asking for other forms of identification, including a social security or 
medicare/medicaid card along with another document which contains both 
the patron's name and address such as an organizational membership card, 
voter registration card, utility bill or real estate tax bill. These 
forms of identification shall also be identified as acceptable in the 
bank's formal written policy and operating procedures as identification 
for transactions involving the elderly or the disabled. Once 
implemented, the financial institution should permit no exception to its 
policy and procedures. In these cases, the financial institution should 
record the word ``Elderly'' or ``Disabled'' on the CTR and/or 
chronological log and the method used to identify the elderly, or 
disabled patron such as ``Social Security and (organization) Membership 
Card only ID.''

                            Law and Analysis

    Before concluding a transaction for which a Currency Transaction 
Report is required pursuant to 31 CFR 103.22, a financial institution 
must verify and record the name and address of the individual conducting 
the transaction. 31 CFR 103.28. Verification of the individual's 
identity must be made by examination of a document, other than a bank 
signature card, that is normally acceptable within the banking community 
as a means of identification when cashing checks for nondepositors 
(e.g., a driver's license). A bank signature card may be relied upon 
only if it was issued after documents establishing the

[[Page 488]]

identity of the individual were examined and a notation of the method 
and specific information regarding identification (e.g., state of 
issuance and driver's license number) was made on the signature card. In 
each instance, the specific identifying information noted above and used 
to verify the identity of the individual must be recorded on the CTR. 
The notation of ``known customer'' or ``bank signature card on file'' on 
the CTR is prohibited. 31 CFR 103.28.
    Before issuing or selling bank checks or drafts, cashier's checks, 
traveler's checks or money orders to an individual(s), for currency 
between $3,000 and $10,000, a financial institution must verify whether 
the individual has a deposit account or verify the individual's 
identity. 31 CFR 103.29. Verification may be made by examination of a 
signature card or other account record at the financial institution if 
the deposit accountholder's name and address were verified at the time 
the account was opened, or at any subsequent time, and that information 
was recorded on the signature card or record being examined.
    Verification may also be made by examination of a document that 
contains the name and address of the purchaser and which is normally 
acceptable within the banking community as a means of identification 
when cashing checks for nondepositors. In the case of a deposit 
accountholder whose identity has not been previously verified, the 
financial institution shall record the specific identifying information 
on its chronological log (e.g. state of issuance and driver's license 
number). In all situations, the financial institution must record all 
the appropriate information required by Sec. 103.29(a)(1)(i) for 
deposit account holders or 103.29(a)(2)(i) for nondeposit account 
holders.
    Certain elderly or disabled patrons do not possess identification 
documents that would normally be considered acceptable within the 
banking community (e.g., driver's licenses, passports, or state-issued 
identification cards). Accordingly, the procedure set forth below should 
be followed to fulfill the identification verification requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 103.28 and 103.29.
    Financial institutions may accept as appropriate identification a 
social security, medicare, medicaid or other insurance card presented 
along with another document that contains both the name and address of 
the patron (e.g. an organization membership or voter registration card, 
utility or real estate tax bill). Such forms of identification shall be 
specified in the bank's formal written policy and operating procedures 
as acceptable identification for transactions involving elderly or 
disabled patrons who do not possess identification documents normally 
considered acceptable within the banking community for cashing checks 
for nondepositors.
    This procedure may only be applied if the following circumstances 
exist. First, the financial institution must establish that the 
identification the elderly or disabled patron has is limited to a social 
security or medicare/medicaid card plus another document which contains 
the patron's name and address. Second, the financial institution must 
use whatever information it has available, or policies and procedures it 
has in place, to determine the patron's identity. If the patron is a 
deposit accountholder, the financial institution should review its 
internal records to determine if there is information on file to verify 
his/her identity. Only if the financial institution is confident that 
the elderly or disabled patron is who s/he says s/he is, may the 
transaction be concluded. Failure to identify an elderly or a disabled 
customer's identity as required by 31 CFR Sec. 103.28 and as described 
herein may result in the imposition of civil and or criminal penalties. 
Finally, the financial institution shall establish a formal written 
policy and implement operating procedures for processing reportable 
currency transactions or recording cash sales of certain monetary 
instruments to elderly or disabled patrons who do not have forms of 
identification ordinarily considered ``acceptable.'' Once implemented, 
the financial institution shall permit no exceptions to its policy and 
procedures. In addition, financial institutions are encouraged to record 
the elderly or disabled patron's identity and address as well as the 
method of identification on a signature card or other record when it is 
obtained and verified.
    In completing a CTR, if all of the above conditions are satisfied, 
the financial institution should enter the words ``Elderly'' or 
``Disabled'' and the method used to verify the patron's identity, such 
as ``Social Security and (organization) Membership Cards Only ID,'' in 
Item 15a.
    Similarly, when logging the cash purchase of a monetary 
instrument(s), the financial institution shall enter on its 
chronological log the words, ``Elderly'' or ``Disabled,'' and the method 
used to verify such patron's identity.

                                 Example

    Jesse Fleming, a 75 year old retiree, has been saving $10 bills for 
twenty years in order to help pay for his granddaughter's college 
education. He enters the Trustworthy National Bank where he has no 
account but his granddaughter has a savings account, and presents 
$13,000 in $10 bills to the teller. He instructs the teller to deposit 
$9,000 into his granddaughter's savings account, and requests a 
cashier's check for $4,000 made payable to State University.
    Because of poor eyesight, Mr. Fleming no longer drives and does not 
possess a valid

[[Page 489]]

driver's license. When asked for identification by the teller he 
presents a social security card and his retirement organization 
membership card that contains his name and address.

                      Application of Law to Example

    In this example, the Trustworthy National Bank must check to 
determine if Mr. Fleming's social security and organizational membership 
cards are acceptable forms of identification as defined in the bank's 
policy and procedures. If so, and the bank is confident that Mr. Fleming 
is who he says he is, it may complete the transaction. Because Mr. 
Fleming conducted a transaction in currency which exceeded $10,000 
(deposit of $9,000 and purchase of $4,000 monetary instrument), First 
National Bank must complete a CTR. It should record information about 
Mr. Fleming in Part I of the CTR and in Item 15a record the words 
``Elderly--Social Security and (organization) Membership Cards Only 
ID.'' The balance of the CTR must be appropriately completed as required 
by Sec. Sec. 103.22 and 103.27(d). First National Bank must also record 
the transaction in its monetary instrument sales log because it issued 
to Mr. Fleming a cashier's check for $4,000 in currency. Mr. Fleming 
must be listed as the purchaser and the bank should record on the log 
the words ``Elderly--Social Security and (organization) Membership Cards 
Only ID'' as the method used to verify his identity. In addition, 
because Mr. Fleming is not a deposit accountholder at First National 
Bank, the bank is required to record on the log all the information 
required under Sec. 103.29(a)(2)(i) for cash purchases of monetary 
instruments by nondeposit accountholders.

31 U.S.C. 5313--Reports on Domestic Coins and Currency Transactions
31 CFR 103.22--Reporting of Currency Transactions
31 CFR 103.28--Identification Required

    Proper completion of the Currency Transaction Report (CTR), IRS Form 
4789, when reporting multiple transactions. Financial institutions must 
report transactions in currency that exceed $10,000 or an exempted 
account's established exemption limit and provide certain information 
including verified identifying information about the individual 
conducting the transaction. Multiple currency transactions must be 
treated as a single transaction, aggregated, and reported on a single 
Form 4789, if the financial institution has knowledge that the 
transactions are by or on behalf of any person and result in either cash 
in or cash out totalling more than $10,000, or the exemption limit, 
during any one business day. All CTRs must be fully and accurately 
completed. Some or all of the individual transactions which comprise an 
aggregated CTR are frequently below the $10,000 reporting or applicable 
exemption threshold and, as such, are not reportable and financial 
institutions do not gather the information required to complete a CTR.

                                  Issue

    How should a financial institution complete a CTR when multiple 
transactions are aggregated and reported on a single form and all or 
part of the information called for in the form may not be known?

                                 Holding

    Multiple transactions that total in excess of $10,000, or an 
established exemption limit, when aggregated must be reported on a CTR 
if the financial institution has knowledge that the transactions have 
occurred. In many cases, the individual transactions being reported are 
each under $10,000, or the exemption limit, and the institution was not 
aware at the time of any one of the transactions that a CTR would be 
required. Therefore, the identifying information on the person 
conducting the transaction was not required to be obtained at the time 
the transaction was conducted.
    If after a reasonable effort to obtain the information required to 
complete items 4 through 15 of the CTR, all or part of such information 
is not available, the institution must check item 3d to indicate that 
the information is not being provided because the report involves 
multiple transactions for which complete information is not available. 
The institution must, however, provide as much of the information as is 
reasonably available.
    All subsections of item 48 on the CTR must be completed to report 
the number of transactions involved and the number of locations of the 
financial institution and zip codes of those locations where the 
transactions were conducted.

                            Law and Analysis

    Sections 103.22(a)(1) and (c) of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) 
regulations, 31 CFR part 103, require a financial institution to file a 
CTR for each deposit, withdrawal, exchange of currency, or other payment 
or transfer, by, through, or to the financial institution, which 
involves a transaction in currency of more than $10,000 or the 
established exemption limit for an exempt account. Multiple transactions 
must be treated as a single transaction if the financial institution has 
knowledge that they are by, or on behalf of, any person and result in 
either cash in or cash out of the financial institution totalling more 
than $10,000 or the exemption limit during any one business day. 
Knowledge, in this context, means knowledge on the part of a partner, 
director, officer or employee of

[[Page 490]]

the financial institution or on the part of any existing automated or 
manual system at the financial institution that permits it to aggregate 
transactions.
    The purpose of item 3 on the CTR is to indicate why all or part of 
the information required in items 4 through 15 is not being provided on 
the form. If the reason information is missing is solely because the 
transaction(s) occurred through an armored car service, a mail deposit 
or shipment, or a night deposit or Automated Teller Machine (ATM), the 
financial institution must check either box a, b, or c, as appropriate, 
in item 3. CTR instructions state that item 3d is to be checked for 
multiple transactions where none of the individual transactions exceeds 
$10,000 or the exemption limit and all of the required information might 
not be available.
    As described in Example No. 5 below, there may be situations where 
one transaction among several exceeds the applicable threshold. Item 3d 
should be checked whenever multiple transactions are being reported and 
all or part of the information necessary to complete items 4 through 15 
is not available because at the time of any one of the individual 
transactions, a CTR was not required and the financial institution did 
not obtain the appropriate information.
    When reporting multiple transactions, the financial institution must 
complete as many of items 4 through 15 as possible. In the event the 
institution learns that more than one person conducted the multiple 
transactions being reported, it must check item 2 on the CTR and is 
encouraged to make reasonable efforts to obtain and report any 
appropriate information on each of the persons in items 4 through 15 on 
the front and back of the CTR form, and if necessary, on additional 
sheets of paper attached to the report.
    The purpose of item 48 is to indicate that multiple transactions are 
involved in the CTR being filed. Items 48 a, b, and c require 
information about the number of transactions being reported and the 
number of bank branches and the zip code of each branch where the 
transactions took place. If multiple transactions exceeding $10,000 or 
an account exemption limit occur at the same time, the financial 
institution should treat the transactions in a manner consistent with 
its internal transaction posting procedures. For example, if a customer 
presents four separate deposits, at the same time, totalling over 
$10,000, the institution may report the transactions in item 48a to be 
one or four separate transactions. If the transactions are posted as 
four separate transactions the financial institution should enter the 
number 4 in item 48a and the number 1 in item 48b. If the transactions 
are posted as one transaction the institution should enter the 1 in both 
48a and 48b. Reporting the transactions in this manner will guarantee 
the integrity of the paper trail being created, that is, the number of 
transactions reported on the CTR will be the same as the number of 
transactions showing in the institution's records.
    These situations should be differentiated from those cases where 
separate transactions occur at different times during the same business 
day, and which, when aggregated, exceed $10,000 or the exemption limit. 
For instance, if the same or another individual conducts two of the same 
type of transactions at different times during the same business day at 
two different branches of the financial institution on behalf of the 
same person, and the institution has knowledge that the transactions 
occurred and exceed $10,000 or the exemption limit, then the financial 
institution must enter the number 2 in items 48a and 48b.

               Examples and Application of Law to Examples

                              Example No. 1

    Dorothy Fishback presents a teller with three cash deposits to the 
same account, at the same time, in amounts of $5,000, $6,000, and $8,500 
requesting that the deposits be posted to the account separately. It is 
the bank's procedure to post the transactions separately. A CTR is 
completed while the customer is at the teller window.

                   Application of Law to Example No. 1

    A CTR is completed based upon the information obtained at the time 
Dorothy Fishback presents the multiple transactions. Item 3d would not 
be checked on the CTR because all of the information in items 4 through 
15 is being provided contemporaneously with the transaction. As it is 
the bank's procedure to post the transactions separately, the number of 
transactions reported in item 48a would be 3 and the number of branches 
reported in item 48b would be 1. The zip code for the location where the 
transactions were conducted would be entered in item 48c.

                              Example No. 2

    Andrew Weiner makes a $7,000 cash deposit to his account at ABC 
Federal Savings Bank. Later the same day, Mr. Weiner returns to the same 
teller and deposits $5,000 in cash to a different account. At the time 
Mr. Weiner makes the second deposit, the teller realizes that the two 
deposits exceed $10,000 and prepares a CTR obtaining all of the 
necessary identifying information directly from Mr. Weiner.

                   Application of Law to Example No. 2

    Even though the two transactions were conducted at different times 
during the same business day, Mr. Weiner conducted both

[[Page 491]]

transactions at the same place and the appropriate identifying 
information was obtained by the teller at the time of the second 
transaction. Item 3d would not be checked on the CTR. The number of 
transactions reported in item 48a must be 2 and the number of branches 
reported in item 48b would be 1. The zip code for the location where the 
transactions took place would be entered in item 48c.

                              Example No. 3

    Internal auditor Mike Pelzer is reviewing the daily cash 
transactions report for People's Bank and notices that five cash 
deposits were made the previous day to account <greek-i>12345. The total 
of the deposits is $25,000 and they were made at three different offices 
of the bank. Mike researches the account data base and finds that the 
account belongs to a department store and that the account is exempted 
for deposits up to $17,000 per day. Each of the five transactions was 
under $17,000.

                   Application of Law to Example No. 3

    Having reviewed the report of aggregated transactions, Mike Pelzer 
has knowledge that transactions exceeding the account exemption limit 
have occurred during a single business day. A CTR must be filed. 
People's Bank is encouraged to make a reasonable effort to provide the 
information for items 4 through 15 on the CTR. Such efforts could 
include a search of the institution's records or a phone call to the 
department store to identify the persons that conducted the 
transactions. If all of the information is not contained in the 
institution's records or otherwise obtained, item 3d must be checked. 
The number of transactions reported in item 48a must be 5 and the number 
of branches reported in 48b would be 3. The zip codes for the three 
locations where the transactions occurred must be entered in item 48c.

                              Example No. 4

    Mrs. Saunders makes a cash withdrawal, for $4,000, from a joint 
savings account she owns with her husband. That day her husband, Mr. 
Saunders, withdraws $7,000 cash using the same teller. Realizing that 
the withdrawals exceed $10,000, the teller obtains identifying 
information on Mr. Saunders required to complete a CTR.

                   Application of Law to Example No. 4

    In this case, item 2 on the CTR must be checked because the teller 
knows that more than one person conducted the transactions. Information 
on Mr. Saunders would appear in Part I and the bank is encouraged to ask 
him for, or to check its records for the required identifying 
information on Mrs. Saunders. If after taking reasonable efforts to 
locate the desired information, all of the required information is not 
found on file in the institution's records or is not otherwise obtained, 
box 3d must be checked to indicate that all information is not being 
provided because multiple transactions are being reported. Whatever 
information on Mrs. Saunders is contained in the records of the 
institution must be reported in the continuation of Part I on the back 
of Form 4789. The number of transactions reported in item 48a must be 2 
and the number of branches reported in item 48b would be 1. The zip code 
for the branch where the transactions took place would be entered in 
item 48c.

                              Example No. 5

    On another day, Mrs. Saunders makes a deposit of $3,000 cash and no 
information required for Part I of the CTR is requested of her. She is 
followed later the same day by her husband, Mr. Saunders, who deposits 
$12,000 in currency and who provides all data required to complete Part 
I for himself.

                   Application of Law to Example No. 5

    Item 2 on the CTR must be checked because the teller knows that more 
than one person conducted the transactions. Information on Mr. Saunders 
would appear in Part I and the bank is encouraged to ask him for, or to 
check its records for the required identifying information on Mrs. 
Saunders. If after taking reasonable efforts to locate the desired 
information, all of the required information is not found on file in the 
institution's records or is not otherwise obtained, box 3d must be 
checked to indicate that all information is not being provided because 
multiple transactions are being reported. Whatever information on Mrs. 
Saunders is contained in the records of the institution must be reported 
in the continuation of Part I on the back of Form 4789. The number of 
transactions reported in item 48a must be 2 and the number of branches 
reported in item 48b would be 1. The zip code for the branch where the 
transactions took place would be entered in item 48c.

                              Example No. 6

    A review of First Federal Bank's daily cash transactions report for 
a given day indicates several cash deposits to a single account totaling 
more than $10,000. Two separate deposits were made in the night 
depository at the institution's main office, and two deposits were 
conducted at the teller windows of two other branch locations. Each 
deposit was under $10,000.

                   Application of Law to Example No. 6

    Item 3c should be checked to indicate that identifying information 
is not provided because transactions were received through the night 
deposit box. If the tellers involved with the two face to face deposits 
remember who

[[Page 492]]

conducted the transactions, institution records can be checked for 
identifying information. If the records contain some of the information 
required by items 4 through 15, that information must be provided, and 
item 3d must be checked to indicate that some information is missing 
because multiple transactions are being reported and the information was 
not obtained at the time the transactions were conducted. Item 48a must 
indicate 4 transactions and item 48b must indicate 3 locations. The zip 
code of those locations would be provided in item 48c.

               Appendix C TO Part 103--Interpretive Rules

                           Release No. 2004-01

    This Interpretive Guidance sets forth our interpretation of the 
regulation requiring Money Services Businesses that are required to 
register with FinCEN to establish and maintain anti-money laundering 
programs. See 31 CFR 103.125. Specifically, this Interpretive Guidance 
clarifies that the anti-money laundering program regulation requires 
Money Services Businesses to establish adequate and appropriate 
policies, procedures, and controls commensurate with the risks of money 
laundering and the financing of terrorism posed by their relationship 
with foreign agents or foreign counterparties of the Money Services 
Business.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ This Interpretive Guidance focuses on the need to control risks 
arising out of the relationship between a Money Service Business and its 
foreign counterparty or agent. Under existing FinCEN regulations, only 
Money Service Business principals are required to register with FinCEN, 
and only Money Service Business principals establish the counterparty or 
agency relationships. 31 CFR 103.41. Accordingly, this Interpretive 
Guidance only applies to those Money Service Businesses required to 
register with FinCEN, that is, only those Money Service Businesses that 
may have a relationship with a foreign agent or counterparty.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under existing Bank Secrecy Act regulations, we have defined Money 
Services Businesses to include five distinct types of financial services 
providers and the U.S. Postal Service: (1) Currency dealers or 
exchangers; (2) check cashers; (3) issuers of traveler's checks, money 
orders, or stored value; (4) sellers or redeemers of traveler's checks, 
money orders, or stored value; and (5) money transmitters. See 31 CFR 
103.11(uu). With limited exception, Money Services Businesses are 
subject to the full range of Bank Secrecy Act regulatory controls, 
including the anti-money laundering program rule, suspicious activity 
and currency transaction reporting rules, and various other 
identification and recordkeeping rules.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ See 31 CFR 103.125 (requirement for Money Service Businesses to 
establish and maintain an anti-money laundering compliance program); 31 
CFR 103.22 (requirement for Money Service Businesses to file currency 
transaction reports); 31 CFR 103.20 (requirement for Money Service 
Businesses, other than check cashers and issuers, sellers, or redeemers 
of stored value, to file suspicious activity reports); 31 CFR 103.29 
(requirement for Money Service Businesses that sell money orders, 
traveler's checks, or other instruments for cash to verify the identity 
of the customer and create and maintain a record of each cash purchase 
between $3,000 and $10,000, inclusive); 31 CFR 103.33(f) (requirement 
for Money Service Businesses that send or accept instructions to 
transmit funds of $3,000 or more to verify the identity of the sender or 
receiver and create and maintain a record of the transmittal regardless 
of the method of payment); and 31 CFR 103.37 (requirement for currency 
exchangers to create and maintain a record of each exchange of currency 
in excess of $1,000).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Many Money Services Businesses, including the vast majority of money 
transmitters in the United States, operate through a system of agents 
both domestically and internationally. We estimate that a substantial 
majority of all cross-border remittances by money transmitters are 
conducted using this model. Other Money Services Businesses may operate 
through more informal relationships, such as the trust-based hawala 
system.\3\ Regardless of the form of the relationship between a Money 
Services Business and its foreign agents or counterparties, Money 
Services Business transactions generally are initiated by customers 
seeking to send or receive funds, cash checks, buy or sell money orders 
or traveler's checks, or buy or sell currency. The customer directs the 
Money Services Business to execute the transactions; the Money Services 
Business does not unilaterally determine the recipient of its products 
or services. Although the customer can use the Money Services Business' 
services, the customer does not typically establish an account 
relationship with the Money Services Business. The focus of this 
Interpretive Guidance is the establishment of, and ongoing relationship 
between, a Money Services Business and its foreign agent or foreign 
counterparty that facilitates the flow of funds cross-border into and 
out of the United States on behalf of customers.

  The Cross-Border Flow of Funds through Money Services Businesses and 
                            Associated Risks

    Ensuring that financial institutions based in the United States 
establish and apply adequate and appropriate policies, procedures, and 
controls in their anti-money laundering compliance programs to protect 
the international gateways to the U.S. financial system is an essential 
element of the Bank Secrecy Act regulatory regime. This Interpretive 
Guidance forms a part of our comprehensive approach to accomplishing 
this

[[Page 495]]

goal. To the extent Money Services Businesses utilize relationships with 
foreign agents or counterparties to facilitate the movement of funds 
into or out of the United States, they must take reasonable steps to 
guard against the flow of illicit funds, or the flow of funds from 
legitimate sources to persons seeking to use those funds for illicit 
purposes, through such relationships.
    The money laundering or terrorism financing risks associated with 
foreign agents or counterparties are similar to the risks presented by 
domestic agents of Money Services Businesses. For example, the foreign 
agent of the domestic Money Services Business may have lax anti-money 
laundering policies, procedures, and internal controls, or actually may 
be complicit with those seeking to move illicit funds. In some 
instances, the risk with foreign agents can be greater than with 
domestic agents because foreign agents are not subject to the Bank 
Secrecy Act regulatory regime; the extent to which they are subject to 
anti-money laundering regulation, and the quality of that regulation, 
will vary with the jurisdictions in which they are located.
    There are a variety of ways in which a Money Services Business may 
be susceptible to the unwitting facilitation of money laundering through 
foreign agents or counterparties. For example, our review of Bank 
Secrecy Act data revealed several instances of suspected criminal 
activity--detected by existing anti-money laundering and suspicious 
activity reporting programs of Money Services Businesses and banks--
where foreign agents of Money Services Business have engaged in bulk 
sales of sequentially numbered, U.S. denominated traveler's checks or 
blocks of money orders, to one or two individuals. The individuals 
involved frequently purchased the instruments on multiple dates and in 
different locations, structuring the purchases to avoid reporting 
thresholds and issuer limits on daily instrument sales. The instruments 
usually had illegible signatures or failed to designate a beneficiary or 
payor. The instruments were then negotiated with one or more dealers in 
goods, such as diamonds, gems, or precious metals, deposited in foreign 
banks, and cleared through U.S. banks. In such cases, the clearing banks 
were so far removed from the transactions that they could not trace back 
or screen either the intervening transactions or the individuals 
involved in the transactions.
    A case involving suspicious activity in a Money Services Business' 
domestic agent provides a further example of the type of high-risk 
activity that also may be engaged in by foreign agents or 
counterparties. In this instance, the domestic Money Service Business 
had policies, procedures, and controls that facilitated the detection of 
illicit activity at the agent. A group of six customers entered a money 
transmitter agent at approximately five-minute intervals to send the 
same structured amounts ($2,500) to the same receiver in a foreign 
country. Several weeks later, another group of six customers entered the 
same agent location and conducted an identical pattern of successive 
$2,500 transfers (a few minutes apart) to the same recipient in the same 
foreign country as the first set of transactions. Some of the 
individuals in the second group had the same last names as customers in 
the first group. Additional suspicious activity reports filed by the 
primary Money Services Business identified several other groups of 
customers initiating money transfers at this same agent business 
location, in the same manner, and in the same overall time frame. This 
activity by an agent drew the scrutiny of the Money Services Business, 
and in addition to the filing of suspicious activity reports, led to the 
termination of the relationship of the Money Services Business with the 
agent.
    These examples of illicit activity occurring at the agents of Money 
Services Businesses underscore the need for Money Services Businesses to 
include, as a part of their anti-money laundering programs, procedures, 
policies, and controls to govern relationships with foreign agents and 
counterparties to enable the Money Services Business to perform the 
appropriate level of suspicious activity and risk monitoring. We believe 
that this obligation is an essential part of each Money Services 
Business' existing obligation under 31 CFR 103.125 to develop and 
implement an effective anti-money laundering program.\4\ This 
Interpretive Guidance will aid Money Services Businesses in adopting 
appropriate risk-based policies, procedures, and controls on cross-
border relationships with foreign agents and counterparties.

    \4\ FinCEN previously interpreted 31 CFR 103.125 to impose a similar 
obligation on a money transmitter with respect to its domestic agents.

 Anti-Money Laundering Program Elements Relating to Foreign Agents and 
                             Counterparties

    Under 31 CFR 103.125(a), Money Services Businesses are required to 
develop, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering 
program reasonably designed to prevent the Money Services Business from 
being used to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist 
activities. The program must be commensurate with the risks posed by the 
location, size, nature, and volume of the financial services provided by 
the Money Services Business. Additionally, the program must incorporate 
policies, procedures, and controls reasonably designed to

[[Page 496]]

assure compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and implementing 
regulations.
    With respect to Money Services Businesses that utilize foreign 
agents or counterparties, a Money Services Business' anti-money 
laundering program must include risk-based policies, procedures, and 
controls designed to identify and minimize money laundering and 
terrorist financing risks associated with foreign agents and 
counterparties that facilitate the flow of funds into and out of the 
United States. The program must be aimed at preventing the products and 
services of the Money Services Business from being used to facilitate 
money laundering or terrorist financing through these relationships and 
detecting the use of these products and services for money laundering or 
terrorist financing by the Money Services Business or agent. Relevant 
risk factors may include, but are not limited to:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> The foreign agent or counterparty's location and 
jurisdiction of organization, chartering, or licensing. This would 
include considering the extent to which the relevant jurisdiction is 
internationally recognized as presenting a greater risk for money 
laundering or is considered to have more robust anti-money laundering 
standards.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> The ownership of the foreign agent or 
counterparty. This includes whether the owners are known, upon 
reasonable inquiry, to be associated with criminal conduct or terrorism. 
For example, have the individuals been designated by Treasury's Office 
of Foreign Assets Control as Specially Designated Nationals or Blocked 
Persons (i.e., involvement in terrorism, drug trafficking, or the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction)?
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> The extent to which the foreign agent or 
counterparty is subject to anti-money laundering requirements in its 
jurisdiction and whether it has established such controls.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Any information known or readily available to the 
Money Services Business about the foreign agent or counterparty's anti-
money laundering record, including public information in industry 
guides, periodicals, and major publications.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> The nature of the foreign agent or counterparty's 
business, the markets it serves, and the extent to which its business 
and the markets it serves present an increased risk for money laundering 
or terrorist financing.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> The types and purpose of services to be provided 
to, and anticipated activity with, the foreign agent or counterparty.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> The nature and duration of the Money Services 
Business' relationship with the foreign agent or counterparty.
    Specifically, a Money Services Business' anti-money laundering 
program should include procedures for the following:

    1. Conduct of Due Diligence on Foreign Agents and Counterparties

    Money Services Businesses should establish procedures for conducting 
reasonable, risk-based due diligence on potential and existing foreign 
agents and counterparties to help ensure that such foreign agents and 
counterparties are not themselves complicit in illegal activity 
involving the Money Services Business' products and services, and that 
they have in place appropriate anti-money laundering controls to guard 
against the abuse of the Money Services Business' products and services. 
Such due diligence must, at a minimum, include reasonable procedures to 
identify the owners of the Money Services Business' foreign agents and 
counterparties, as well as to evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the 
operations of those foreign agents and counterparties and their 
implementation of policies, procedures, and controls reasonably designed 
to help assure that the Money Services Business' products and services 
are not subject to abuse by the foreign agent's or counterparty's 
customers, employees, or contractors.\5\ The extent of the due diligence 
required will depend on a variety of factors specific to each agent or 
counterparty. We expect Money Services Businesses to assess such risks 
and perform due diligence in a manner consistent with that risk, in 
light of the availability of information.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Our anti-money laundering program rule, 31 CFR 103.125(d)(iii), 
permits Money Service Businesses to satisfy this last requirement with 
regard to their domestic agents (which are also Money Service Businesses 
under the BSA regulations), by allocating responsibility for the program 
to their agents. Such an allocation, however, does not relieve a Money 
Service Business from ultimate responsibility for establishing and 
maintaining an effective anti-money laundering program. Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

      2. Risk-based Monitoring of Foreign Agents or Counterparties

    In addition to the due diligence described above, in order to detect 
and report suspected money laundering or terrorist financing, Money 
Services Businesses should establish procedures for risk-based 
monitoring and review of transactions from, to, or through the United 
States that are conducted through foreign agents and counterparties.\6\ 
Such procedures should also

[[Page 497]]

focus on identifying material changes in the agent's risk profile, such 
as a change in ownership, business, or the regulatory scrutiny to which 
it is subject.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ Nothing in this Interpretive Guidance is intended to require 
Money Service Businesses to monitor or review, for purposes of the Bank 
Secrecy Act, transactions or activities of foreign agents or 
counterparties that occur entirely outside of the United States and do 
not flow from, to, or through the United States.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The review of transactions should enable the Money Services Business 
to identify and, where appropriate, report as suspicious such 
occurrences as: instances of unusual wire activity, bulk sales or 
purchases of sequentially numbered instruments, multiple purchases or 
sales that appear to be structured, and illegible or missing customer 
information. Additionally, Money Services Businesses should establish 
procedures to assure that their foreign agents or counterparties are 
effectively implementing an anti-money laundering program and to discern 
obvious breakdowns in the implementation of the program by the foreign 
agent or counterparty.
    Similarly, money transmitters should have procedures in place to 
enable them to review foreign agent or counterparty activity for signs 
of structuring or unnecessarily complex transmissions through multiple 
jurisdictions that may be indicative of layering. Such procedures should 
also enable them to discern attempts to evade identification or other 
requirements, whether imposed by applicable law or by the Money Services 
Business' own internal policies. Activity by agents or counterparties 
that appears aimed at evading the Money Services Business' own controls 
can be indicative of complicity in illicit conduct; this activity must 
be scrutinized, reported as appropriate, and corrective action taken as 
warranted.

                  3. Corrective Action and Termination

    Money Services Businesses should have procedures for responding to 
foreign agents or counterparties that present unreasonable risks of 
money laundering or the financing of terrorism. Such procedures should 
provide for the implementation of corrective action on the part of the 
foreign agent or counterparty or for the termination of the relationship 
with any foreign agent or counterparty that the Money Services Business 
determines poses an unacceptable risk of money laundering or terrorist 
financing, or that has demonstrated systemic, willful, or repeated 
lapses in compliance with the Money Services Business' own anti-money 
laundering procedures or requirements.
    While Money Services Businesses may already have implemented some or 
all of the procedures described in this Interpretive Guidance as a part 
of their anti-money laundering programs, we wish to provide a reasonable 
period of time for all affected Money Services Businesses to assess 
their operations, review their existing policies and programs for 
compliance with this Advisory, and implement any additional necessary 
changes. We will expect full compliance with this Interpretive Release 
within 180 days.
    Finally, we are mindful of the potential impact that this 
Interpretive Release may have on continuing efforts to bring informal 
value transfer systems into compliance with the existing regulatory 
framework of the Bank Secrecy Act. Experience has demonstrated the 
challenges in securing compliance by, for instance, hawalas and other 
informal value transfer systems. Further specification of Bank Secrecy 
Act compliance obligations carries with it the risk of driving these 
businesses underground, thereby undermining our ultimate regulatory 
goals. On balance, however, we believe that outlining the requirements 
for dealing with foreign agents and counterparties, including informal 
networks, is appropriate in light of the risks of money laundering and 
the financing of terrorism.

                           Release No. 2004-02

    This FinCEN interpretive guidance clarifies that reports filed with 
the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control 
(``OFAC'') of blocked transactions with Specially Designated Global 
Terrorists, Specially Designated Terrorists, Foreign Terrorist 
Organizations, Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker Kingpins, and 
Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers will be deemed by FinCEN to 
fulfill the requirement to file suspicious activity reports on such 
transactions for purposes of FinCEN's suspicious activity reporting 
rules. However, the filing of a blocking report with OFAC will not be 
deemed to satisfy a financial institution's obligation to file a 
suspicious activity report if the transactions would be reportable under 
FinCEN's suspicious activity reporting rules even if there were no OFAC 
match. Moreover, to the extent that the financial institution is in 
possession of information not included on the blocking report filed with 
OFAC, a separate suspicious activity report should be filed with FinCEN 
including that information.

                               Background

    The Bank Secrecy Act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to 
require financial institutions to report ``any suspicious transaction 
relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation.'' \1\ Under this 
authority, FinCEN has issued regulations requiring banks, securities 
broker-dealers, introducing brokers, casinos, futures commission 
merchants, and money services businesses, to report suspicious activity 
that meets a particular dollar threshold.\2\ Each rule includes

[[Page 498]]

filing procedures requiring that a suspicious transaction shall be 
reported by completing a suspicious activity report and filing it with 
FinCEN in a central location to be determined by FinCEN. Generally, the 
rules provide a financial institution with thirty days from the date of 
the initial detection of suspicious activity to file a report, with an 
additional thirty days if the financial institution is unable to 
identify a suspect. Reports are filed on forms developed for each 
industry subject to the reporting requirement.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(1).
    \2\ See 31 CFR 103.17-21. The threshold for most financial 
institutions is $5,000; transactions conducted at points of sale for 
money services businesses have a reporting threshold of $2,000. See 31 
CFR 103.20.
    \3\ See TD F 90-22.47 (depository institutions); TD F 22.56 (money 
services businesses); FinCEN Form 101 (securities and futures 
industries); FinCEN Form 102 (casinos and card clubs).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on 
U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign 
countries, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, and those 
engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction. OFAC's Reporting, Procedures and Penalties Regulations at 
31 CFR part 501 require U.S. financial institutions to block and file 
reports on accounts, payments, or transfers in which an OFAC-designated 
country, entity, or individual has any interest.\4\ These reports must 
be filed with OFAC within ten business days of the blocking of the 
property.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ 31 CFR 501.603.
    \5\ 31 CFR 501.603(b)(1)(i).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             Prior Guidance

    Transactions involving an individual or entity designated on OFAC's 
list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons as a global 
terrorist, terrorist, terrorist organization, narcotics trafficker, or 
narcotics kingpin \6\ may be in furtherance of a criminal act, and 
therefore relevant to a possible violation of law. Thus, blocking 
reports related to such persons also describe potentially suspicious 
activity. In the November 2003 edition of its ``SAR Activity Review,'' 
\7\ FinCEN instructed financial institutions to file suspicious activity 
reports on verified matches of persons designated by OFAC. While this 
guidance ensured that the relevant information would be available to law 
enforcement, it also resulted in financial institutions being required 
to make two separate filings with the Department of the Treasury--one 
with OFAC pursuant to its Reporting, Procedures and Penalties 
Regulations, and one with FinCEN pursuant to its suspicious activity 
reporting rules.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ The specific designations are as follows: Specially designated 
terrorist; foreign terrorist organization; specially designated global 
terrorist; specially designated narcotics trafficker; specially 
designated narcotics trafficker kingpin. See 31 CFR parts 595, 597, 598 
and the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Act, 21 U.S.C. 1901-08, 8 U.S.C. 1182. 
These categories of designations are subject solely to blocking 
requirements.
    \7\ Issue 6 (Nov. 2003).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            Revised Guidance

    FinCEN is hereby revising its prior guidance to eliminate the need 
for duplicative reporting in cases where a financial institution 
identifies a verified match with individuals or entities designated by 
OFAC. As of the date of publication of this interpretation, FinCEN will 
deem its rules requiring the filing of suspicious activity reports to be 
satisfied by the filing of a blocking report with OFAC in accordance 
with OFAC's Reporting, Penalties and Procedures Regulations. OFAC will 
then provide the information to FinCEN for inclusion in the suspicious 
activity reporting database where it will be made available to law 
enforcement. This construction of the suspicious activity reporting 
rules will serve the public interest by enabling FinCEN to obtain and 
provide potentially important information about terrorists and major 
drug traffickers to law enforcement on an expedited basis without 
imposing duplicative reporting burdens on the regulated industry.
    Accordingly, a financial institution that files a blocking report 
with OFAC due to the involvement in a transaction or account of a person 
designated as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, a Specially 
Designated Terrorist, a Foreign Terrorist Organization, a Specially 
Designated Narcotics Trafficker Kingpin, or a Specially Designated 
Narcotics Trafficker, shall be deemed to have simultaneously filed a 
suspicious activity report on the fact of the match with FinCEN, in 
satisfaction of the requirements of the applicable suspicious activity 
reporting rule. This interpretation does not affect a financial 
institution's obligation to identify and report suspicious activity 
beyond the fact of the OFAC match. To the extent that the financial 
institution is in possession of information not included on the blocking 
report filed with OFAC, a separate suspicious activity report should be 
filed with FinCEN including that information. This interpretation also 
does not affect a financial institution's obligation to file a 
suspicious activity report even if it has filed a blocking report with 
OFAC, to the extent that the facts and circumstances surrounding the 
OFAC match are independently suspicious--and are otherwise required to 
be reported under existing FinCEN regulations. In those cases, the OFAC 
blocking report would not satisfy a financial institution's suspicious 
activity report filing obligation.
    Further, nothing in this interpretation is intended to preclude a 
financial institution

[[Page 499]]

from filing a suspicious activity report to disclose additional 
information concerning the OFAC match,\8\ nor does it preclude a 
financial institution from filing a suspicious activity report if the 
financial institution has reason to believe that terrorism or drug 
trafficking is taking place, even though there is no OFAC match. 
Finally, this interpretation does not apply to blocking reports filed to 
report transactions and accounts involving persons owned by, or who are 
nationals of, countries subject to OFAC-administered sanctions programs. 
Such transactions should be reported on suspicious activity reports 
under the suspicious activity reporting rules if, and only, if, the 
activity itself appears to be suspicious under the criteria established 
by the suspicious activity reporting rules.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ Such a report would be a voluntary report under the statute and 
regulations. See 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(3) (extending safe harbor protection 
from civil liability to voluntary filings).
