                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2002), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

    (4) When first-aid fire appliances, alarm boxes, other safety 
equipment or deck hatches are located in a space surrounded by cargo, 
freight, merchandise, or other materials, there shall be maintained a 
straight, free, and open space at least three feet in width running 
therefrom to the center aisle. This space shall be kept clear of all 
rubbish, dunnage, and other obstruction.
    (5) A main aisle of at least twenty feet in width shall be 
maintained the entire length of the waterfront facility if control of 
fire requires trucks to come on the pier. The aisle may be reduced to 
eight feet in width if such access by fire trucks is not required.
    (6) Cross aisles, at least five (5) feet wide and straight shall be 
maintained at intervals not exceeding seventy-five (75) feet, and 
extending to the side of the waterfront facility.
    (n) Adequacy of guarding, fire extinguishing equipment, and 
lighting. That the word ``adequate'', as used in paragraphs (a), (j), 
and (l) of this section with respect to guarding, fire extinguishing 
equipment, and lighting, respectively, means that determination which a 
reasonable person would make under the circumstances of the particular 
case. Unless there is gross noncompliance, the judgment and 
determination of the operator of the facility will be acceptable as 
fulfilling the requirements unless and until the Captain of the Port 
inspects the facility and notifies the operator thereof in writing in 
what respect the guarding, fire extinguishing equipment, or lighting, is 
deemed inadequate and affords such operator an opportunity to correct 
the deficiency.

from electric wiring, steam pipes, radiators or any heating mechanism.
    (4) These materials shall be separated by a fire resistant wall or 
by a distance of at least 30 feet from organic materials or other 
chemicals and substances which could cause contamination such as 
flammable liquids, combustible liquids, corrosive liquids, chlorates, 
permanganates, finely divided metals, caustic soda, charcoal, sulfur, 
cotton, coal, fats, fish oils or vegetable oils.
    (5) Storage of any of these materials shall be in a clean area upon 
clean wood dunnage, or on pallets over a clean floor. In the case of a 
concrete floor, storage may be made directly on the floor if it is first 
covered with a moisture barrier such as a polyethylene sheet or 
asphaltic laminated paper.
    (6) Any spilled material shall be promptly and thoroughly cleaned up 
and removed from the waterfront facility. If any spilled material has 
remained in contact with a wooden floor for any length of time the floor 
shall be scrubbed with water and all spilled material shall be 
thoroughly dissolved and flushed away.
    (7) An abundance of water for firefighting shall be readily 
available.

concerning the levy of fees.


<R05>
Sec. 135.103  Levy and payment of barrel fee on OCS oil.

    (a) A fee of $.03 per barrel is levied on all oil produced on the 
OCS and is imposed upon the owner of the oil when such oil is produced.
    (b) The owner of oil obtained from the OCS shall, for the purpose of 
computing the barrel fee levied in paragraph (a) of this section, 
measure OCS oil production by employing the methods and criteria of the 
Minerals Management Service contained in 30 CFR 250.180.
    (c) The barrel fee levied in paragraph (a) of this section applies 
whenever the unobligated Fund balance is less than $200,000,000.

[[Page 61]]

    (d) Payment of the fee levied in paragraph (a) of this section is 
made in accordance with the fee collection regulations of the IRS at 26 
CFR part 301, Sec. 301.9001. Federal government entitlement to royalty 
oil does not constitute ownership of oil at time of production. The Fund 
Administrator advises the IRS when the unobligated Fund balance requires 
starting or stopping the collection of the barrel fee levied in this 
section, so the IRS may provide appropriate notice to affected owners of 
OCS oil.

       Subpart C--Financial Responsibility for Offshore Facilities


<R05>
Sec. 135.201  Applicability.

    (a) This subpart applies to the owner or operator of each offshore 
facility required by the Act to establish and maintain evidence of 
financial responsibility.
    (b) For the purpose of this subpart:
    (1) All structures, including platforms, wells, and pipelines, are 
considered a single offshore facility if they are physically connected, 
located upstream of the point of custody transfer, within the same oil 
field, and under one ownership.
    (2) If separate parts of a structure, including platforms and 
pipelines, are owned separately, each part having common ownership is 
considered a separate offshore facility.
    (3) A mobile offshore drilling unit is considered an offshore 
facility from the moment a drill shaft or other device connected to the 
unit first touches the seabed or connects to a well for the purposes of 
exploration, development, or production of oil until drilling is 
completed and the unit is no longer attached to the well or drill hole 
by any device.
    (4) A mobile offshore drilling unit considered an offshore facility 
under paragraph (b)(3) of this section remains a separate facility when 
physically connected to another offshore facility, unless both are under 
one ownership.
    (5) All segments of a common carrier pipeline from the point of 
custody transfer to the shore, including any pumping or booster 
stations, which are under one ownership are considered a single offshore 
facility.
    (6) Any pipeline, which is under one ownership, between two offshore 
facilities, or between an offshore facility and the shore, is considered 
a single offshore facility.
    (7) Offshore facilities which drill for, produce, or process only 
natural gas are not subject to this subpart unless the facilities have 
the capacity to transport, store, or otherwise handle more than 1,000 
barrels of condensate at any one time.
    Note: Regulations governing financial responsiblity and 
certification for vessels are promulgated by the Federal Maritime 
Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 135.203  Amount required.

    (a) Each facility that is used for drilling for, producing, or 
processing oil, or which has the capacity to transport, store, transfer, 
or otherwise handle more than one thousand barrels of oil at any one 
time must be covered by evidence of financial responsibility submitted 
by or on behalf of the owner or operator of the facility, in the amount 
of $35,000,000.
    (b) Evidence of financial responsibility established and maintained 
by a person who owns or operates more than one facility, or who has an 
interest in the ownership or operation of more than one facility, may be 
applied by that person towards establishing and maintaining the required 
evidence of financial responsibility for each facility in which that 
person has an interest, if the evidence is available to satisfy 
liabilities arising out of incidents involving those facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 135.204  Submission of evidence.

    (a) Where the offshore facility is owned and operated solely by one 
person, that person must establish and maintain evidence of financial 
responsibility covering the facility.
    (b) Where the offshore facility is owned in its entirety by one 
person and operated solely by another person, evidence of financial 
responsibility covering the facility must be established and maintained 
by either the owner or the operator, or, in consolidated form, by both 
the owner and operator.

[[Page 62]]

    (c) Where the offshore facility is owned or operated by more than 
one person, evidence of financial responsibility covering the facility 
must be established and maintained by any one of the owners or 
operators, or, in consolidated form, by or on behalf of two or more 
owners or operators.
    (d) When evidence of financial responsibility is established in a 
consolidated form, the proportional share of each participant must be 
shown. The evidence must be accompanied by a statement authorizing the 
applicant to act for and in behalf of each participant in submitting and 
maintaining the evidence of financial responsibility.
    (e) Each owner and operator of a facility is subject to the penalty 
provided by section 312(a) of the Act if evidence of financial 
responsibility is not established and maintained for that facility.

require additional information before final consideration of the 
application.
    (f) Certificates, as issued, are to be considered property of the

orders of the Fund Administrator concerning establishing or maintaining 
evidence of financial responsibility.

    (5) Cancellation or termination of any insurance policy, surety

certificant to meet the requirements of this subpart, unless substitute 
evidence of financial responsibility has been submitted to and accepted 
by the Fund Administrator.
    (b) Denial or revocation of a certificate shall be immediate and 
without prior notice in a case where the applicant or certificant:
    (1) Is no longer the owner or operator of the offshore facility in 
question;
    (2) Fails to furnish acceptable evidence of financial responsibility 
in support of an application; or
    (3) Permits the cancellation or termination of the insurance policy, 
surety bond, indemnity, or guaranty upon which the continued validity of 
the certificate is based.
    (c) In any other case, before the denial or revocation of a 
certificate, the Fund Administrator advises the applicant or 
certificant, in writing, of the intention to deny or revoke the 
certificate, and shall state the reason therefor.
    (d) If the reason for an intended revocation is failure to file the 
reports or documents required by Sec. 135.213 (c) and (d) the revocation 
shall be effective 10 days after the date of receipt of the notice of 
intention to revoke, unless the certificant shall, before revocation, 
submit the required material or demonstrate that the required material 
was timely filed.
    (e) If the intended denial or revocation is based upon one of the 
reasons in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(3) of this section, the applicant or 
certificant may request, in writing, a hearing to show that the 
applicant or certificant is in compliance with this subpart. If the 
applicant or certificant fails to file a timely request for a hearing, 
the denial or revocation is effective 10 days after receipt of the 
notice.
    (f) If a request for a hearing under paragraph (e) of this section 
is received by the Fund Administrator within 10

[[Page 66]]

days after the date of receipt of a notice of intention to deny or 
revoke, the Fund Administrator grants a hearing and notifies the 
requesting party of the date, time, and location of the hearing. If a 
requesting party fails to enter an appearance at the scheduled hearing, 
or in lieu thereof fails to submit written evidence for the 
consideration of the hearing official, denial or revocation is effective 
as of the scheduled date and time of the hearing, unless an extension of 
time is granted by the Fund Administrator for good cause shown.
    (g) Hearings under this section are informal and are conducted by an 
official designated by the Fund Administrator. The official conducting 
the hearing considers all relevant material submitted and makes

other benefits.


<R05>
Sec. 136.115  Settlement and notice to claimant.

    (a) Payment in full, or acceptance by the claimant of an offer of 
settlement by the Fund, is final and conclusive for all purposes and, 
upon payment, constitutes a release of the Fund for the claim. In 
addition, acceptance of any compensation from the Fund precludes the 
claimant from filing any subsequent action against any person to recover 
costs or damages which are the subject of the compensated claim. 
Acceptance of any compensation also constitutes an agreement by the 
claimant to assign to the Fund any rights, claims, and causes of action 
the claimant has against any person for the costs and damages which are 
the subject of the compensated claims and to cooperate reasonably with 
the Fund in any claim or action by the Fund against any person to 
recover the amounts paid by the Fund. The cooperation shall include, but 
is not limited to, immediately reimbursing the Fund for any compensation 
received from any other source for the same costs and damages and 
providing any documentation, evidence, testimony, and other support, as 
may be necessary

[[Page 72]]

for the Fund to recover from any person.
    (b) Claimant's failure to accept an offer of settlement within 60 
days after the date the offer was mailed to the claimant automatically 
voids the offer. The Director, NPFC, reserves the right to revoke an 
offer at any time.
    (c) A claimant will be notified in writing sent by certified or 
registered mail whenever a claim against the Fund is denied. The failure 
of the Director, NPFC, to make final disposition of a claim within six 
months after it is filed shall, at the option of the claimant any time 
thereafter, be deemed a final denial of the claim.
    (d) The Director, NPFC, upon written request of the claimant or of a 
person duly authorized to act on the claimant's behalf, reconsiders any 
claim denied. The request for reconsideration must be in writing and 
include the factual or legal grounds for the relief requested, providing 
any additional support for the claim. The request must be received by 
the Director, NPFC, within 60 days after the date the denial was mailed 
to the claimant or within 30 days after receipt of the denial by the 
claimant, whichever date is earlier. Reconsideration may only be 
requested once for each claim denied. The Director, NPFC will provide 
the claimant seeking reconsideration with written notification of the 
decision within 90 days after receipt of the request for 
reconsideration. This written decision is final. The failure of the 
Director, NPFC, to make final disposition of a reconsideration within 90 
days after it is received shall, at the option of the claimant any time 
thereafter, be deemed a final denial of the reconsideration.

               Subpart C--Procedures for Particular Claims

                              Removal Costs


<R05>
Sec. 136.201  Authorized claimants.

claimant must establish--
    (a) That the actions taken were necessary to prevent, minimize, or 
mitigate the effects of the incident;
    (b) That the removal costs were incurred as a result of these 
actions;
    (c) That the actions taken were determined by the FOSC to be 
consistent with the National Contingency Plan or were directed by the 
FOSC.


<R05>
Sec. 136.205  Compensation allowable.

    The amount of compensation allowable is the total of uncompensated 
reasonable removal costs of actions taken that were determined by the 
FOSC to be consistent with the National Contingency Plan or were 
directed by the FOSC. Except in exceptional circumstances, removal 
activities for which costs are being claimed must have been coordinated 
with the FOSC.

                            Natural Resources


<R05>
Sec. 136.207  Authorized claimants.

    (a) Claims for uncompensated natural resource damages may be 
presented by an appropriate natural resources trustee. However, in order 
to facilitate the processing of these claims with respect to a single 
incident where multiple trustees are involved and to prevent double 
recovery, the affected trustees should select a lead administrative 
trustee who will present consolidated claims on behalf of the trustees.
    (b) A trustee may present a claim for the reasonable cost of 
assessing natural resources damages separately from a claim for the cost 
of developing and implementing plans for the restoration, 
rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition of the equivalent of the 
natural resources damaged.


<R05>
Sec. 136.209  Proof.

    In addition to the requirements of subparts A and B of this part, a 
trustee must do the following:
    (a) Submit the assessment and restoration plans which form the basis 
of the claim.
    (b) Provide documented costs and cost estimates for the claim. Final 
cost estimates for conducting damage assessments or implementing a 
restoration plan may form the basis for a

[[Page 73]]

claim against the Fund for an uncompensated natural resources damage 
claim.
    (c) Identify all trustees who may be potential claimants for the 
same natural resources damaged.
    (d) Certify the accuracy and integrity of any claim submitted to the 
Fund, and certify that any actions taken or proposed were or will be 
conducted in accordance with the Act and consistent with all applicable 
laws and regulations.
    (e) Certify whether the assessment was conducted in accordance with 
applicable provisions of the natural resources damage assessment 
regulations promulgated under section 1006(e)(1) of the Act (33 U.S.C. 
2706(e)(1)). Identify any other or additional damage assessment 
regulations or methodology utilized.
    (f) Certify that, to the best of the trustee's knowledge and belief, 
no other trustee has the right to present a claim for the same natural 
resources damages and that payment of any subpart of the claim presented 
would not constitute a double recovery for the same natural resources 
damages.


<R05>
Sec. 136.211  Compensation allowable.

    (a) The amount of compensation allowable is the reasonable cost of 
assessing damages, and the cost of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, 
or acquiring the equivalent of the damaged natural resources.
    (b) In addition to any other provision of law respecting the use of 
sums recovered for natural resources damages, trustees shall reimburse 
the Fund for any amounts received from the Fund in excess of that amount 
required to accomplish the activities for which the claim was paid.

                        Real or Personal Property


<R05>
Sec. 136.213  Authorized claimants.

    (a) A claim for injury to, or economic losses resulting from the 
destruction of, real or personal property may be presented only by a 
claimant either owning or leasing the property.
    (b) Any claim for loss of profits or impairment of earning capacity 
due to injury to, destruction of, or loss of real or personal property 
must be included as subpart of the claim under this section and must 
include the proof required under Sec. 136.233.


<R05>
Sec. 136.215  Proof.

    (a) In addition to the requirements of subparts A and B of this 
part, a claimant must establish--
    (1) An ownership or leasehold interest in the property;
    (2) That the property was injured or destroyed;
    (3) The cost of repair or replacement; and
    (4) The value of the property both before and after injury occurred.
    (b) In addition, for each claim for economic loss resulting from 
destruction of real or personal property, the claimant must establish--
    (1) That the property was not available for use and, if it had been, 
the value of that use;
    (2) Whether or not substitute property was available and, if used, 
the costs thereof; and
    (3) That the economic loss claimed was incurred as the result of the 
injury to or destruction of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 136.217  Compensation allowable.

    (a) The amount of compensation allowable for damaged property is the 
lesser of--
    (1) Actual or estimated net cost of repairs necessary to restore the 
property to substantially the same condition which existed immediately 
before the damage;
    (2) The difference between value of the property before and after 
the damage; or
    (3) The replacement value.
    (b) Compensation for economic loss resulting from the destruction of 
real or personal property may be allowed in an amount equal to the 
reasonable costs actually incurred for use of substitute commercial 
property or, if substitute commercial property was not reasonably 
available, in an amount equal to the net economic loss which resulted 
from not having use of the property. When substitute commercial property 
was reasonably available, but not used, allowable compensation for loss 
of use is limited to the cost of the substitute commercial property, or 
the

[[Page 74]]

property lost, whichever is less. Compensation for loss of use of 
noncommercial property is not allowable.
    (c) Compensation for a claim for loss of profits or impairment of 
earning capacity under Sec. 136.213(b) is limited to that allowable 
under Sec. 136.235.

                             Subsistence Use


<R05>
Sec. 136.219  Authorized claimants.

    (a) A claim for loss of subsistence use of natural resources may be 
presented only by a claimant who actually uses, for subsistence, the 
natural resources which have been injured, destroyed, or lost, without 
regard to the ownership or management of the resources.
    (b) A claim for loss of profits or impairment of earning capacity 
due to loss of subsistence use of natural resources must be included as 
part of the claim under this section and must include the proof required 
under Sec. 136.233.


<R05>
Sec. 136.221  Proof.

    In addition to the requirements of subparts A and B of this part, a 
claimant must provide--
    (a) The identification of each specific natural resource for which 
compensation for loss of subsistence use is claimed;
    (b) A description of the actual subsistence use made of each 
specific natural resource by the claimant;
    (c) A description of how and to what extent the claimant's 
subsistence use was affected by the injury to or loss of each specific 
natural resource;
    (d) A description of each effort made by the claimant to mitigate 
the claimant's loss of subsistence use; and
    (e) A description of each alternative source or means of subsistence 
available to the claimant during the period of time for which loss of 
subsistence is claimed, and any compensation available to the claimant 
for loss of subsistence.


<R05>
Sec. 136.223  Compensation allowable.

    (a) The amount of compensation allowable is the reasonable 
replacement cost of the subsistence loss suffered by the claimant if, 
during the period of time for which the loss of subsistence is claimed, 
there was no alternative source or means of subsistence available.
    (b) The amount of compensation allowable under paragraph (a) of this 
section must be reduced by--
    (1) All compensation made available to the claimant to compensate 
for subsistence loss;
    (2) All income which was derived by utilizing the time which 
otherwise would have been used to obtain natural resources for 
subsistence use; and
    (3) Overheads or other normal expenses of subsistence use not 
incurred as a result of the incident.
    (c) Compensation for a claim for loss of profits or impairment of 
earning capacity under Sec. 136.219(b) is limited to that allowable 
under Sec. 136.235.

Sec. 138.10  Scope.

    This part sets forth the procedures by which an operator of a vessel 
may establish and maintain, for itself, and, where the operator is not 
the owner or demise charterer, for the owner and demise charterer of the 
vessel, evidence of financial responsibility to cover liability of the 
owner, operator, and demise charterer arising under--
    (a) Section 1002 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (33 
U.S.C. 2702); and

[[Page 78]]

    (b) Section 107(a)(1) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. 
9607(a)(1)).

9274, Mar. 7, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 138.12  Applicability.

    (a) This part applies to--
    (1) A tank vessel of any size, and to a foreign-flag vessel of any 
size, using the waters of the exclusive economic zone to transship or 
lighter oil (whether delivering or receiving) destined for a place 
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States; and
    (2) A vessel using the navigable waters of the United States or any 
port or place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, 
including an offshore facility subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, except--
    (i) A vessel that is 300 gross tons or less; and
    (ii) A non-self-propelled barge that does not carry oil as cargo or 
fuel and does not carry hazardous substances as cargo.
    (b) For the purposes of financial responsibility under OPA 90, a 
mobile offshore drilling unit is treated as a tank vessel when it is 
being used as an offshore facility and there is a discharge, or a 
substantial threat of a discharge, of oil on or above the surface of the 
water. A mobile offshore drilling unit is treated as a vessel other than 
a tank vessel when it is not being used as an offshore facility.
    (c) In addition to a non-self-propelled barge over 300 gross tons 
that carries hazardous substances as cargo, for the purposes of 
financial responsibility under CERCLA, this part applies to a self-
propelled vessel over 300 gross tons, even if it does not carry 
hazardous substances.
    (d) This part does not apply to a public vessel.

[CGD 91-005, 59 FR 34227, July 1, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 9274, Mar. 
7, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 138.15  Implementation schedule.

    (a) A tank vessel is subject to the following implementation 
schedule:
    (1) Until December 28, 1994, a tank vessel is required to carry a 
Certificate issued under parts 130, 131, and 132 of this chapter, as may 
be applicable to that vessel. On or after that date, and until July 1, 
1995, a non-self-propelled tank vessel must carry a Certificate issued 
under parts 130, 131, and 132 of this chapter, as may be applicable to 
that vessel, unless it carries a Certificate issued under this part.
    (2) A self-propelled tank vessel to which this part applies and 
which carries a valid Certificate issued under part 130 of this chapter 
may not operate on or after December 28, 1994, unless the operator of 
that vessel has submitted to the Director, NPFC, before that date 
acceptable evidence of financial responsibility applicable to that 
vessel under this part. A self-propelled tank vessel covered by that 
evidence of financial responsibility before December 28, 1994, may 
continue to operate with the Certificate issued under part 130 of this 
chapter. The expiration date of the Certificate issued under part 130 of 
this chapter for that vessel will be deemed to be December 28, 1995, 
regardless of the expiration date appearing on the Certificate. 
Thereafter, a Certificate issued under this part is required.
    (3) A self-propelled tank vessel to which this part applies, but 
which does not carry a valid Certificate issued under part 130 of this 
chapter before December 28, 1994, may not operate on or after that date 
unless it carries a Certificate under this part.
    (4) A non-self-propelled tank vessel to which this part applies may 
not operate on or after July 1, 1995, without a Certificate issued under 
this part. A non-self-propelled tank vessel may continue to operate with 
a Certificate issued under parts 130, 131, and 132 of this chapter, as 
may be applicable to that vessel, until that date.
    (b) A vessel that is not a tank vessel (non-tank vessel) is subject 
to the following implementation schedule:
    (1) Until December 28, 1997, a non-tank vessel is required to carry 
a Certificate issued under parts 130 and 132 of this chapter, as may be 
applicable to that vessel, unless that vessel carries a Certificate 
issued under this part. On or after December 28, 1997, each non-tank 
vessel subject to this part must carry a Certificate issued under this 
part.

[[Page 79]]

    (2) A Certificate is issued, on and after December 28, 1994, and 
before December 28, 1997, under parts 130 and 132 of this chapter only 
to replace a lost Certificate or to replace a Certificate due to a 
vessel or operator name change (a change of legal identity, such as 
reincorporation or other reorganization, is not considered a name 
change). The expiration date that will appear on the replacement 
Certificate will be the same as the expiration date of the Certificate 
being replaced. During that three-year time period, with respect to part 
132 of this chapter, the expiration date that will appear on a 
Certificate being replaced, or on an existing Certificate being renewed, 
will be adjusted to coincide with the expiration date of the 
Certificate, if any, for that vessel issued under part 130 of this 
chapter.
    (3) A non-tank vessel that has a Certificate issued before December 
28, 1994, under part 130 of this chapter is not required to carry a 
Certificate under this part until the date of expiration of the 
Certificate issued under part 130 of this chapter.
    (4) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, a 
Certificate issued on and after July 1, 1994, and before December 28, 
1994, under parts 130 and 132 of this chapter is issued with an 
expiration date three years from the date of issuance.
    (5) If a Certificate issued under part 130 of this chapter with an 
expiration date of December 28, 1994, or later is surrendered, and a new 
Certificate is requested for the same non-tank vessel before December 
28, 1994, the new Certificate will have the same expiration date as that 
of the surrendered Certificate.
    (c) On or after July 1, 1994, a vessel that is subject to either 
part 131 or 132, or both, of this chapter but that is not subject to 
part 130 of this chapter because the vessel is 300 gross tons or less is 
not required to comply with part 131 or 132 of this chapter, unless that 
vessel is subject to this part under Sec. 138.12(a)(1).


<R05>
Sec. 138.20  Definitions.

    (a) As used in this part (including the appendices to this part), 
the following terms have the same meaning as set forth in--
    (1) Section 1001 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (33 U.S.C. 2701), 
respecting the financial responsibility referred to in 
Sec. 138.10(b)(1): claimant, damages, discharge, exclusive economic 
zone, navigable waters, mobile offshore drilling unit, natural 
resources, offshore facility, oil, person, remove, removal, removal 
costs, and United States; and
    (2) Section 101 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation, and Liability Act (42 U.S.C. 9601), respecting the 
financial responsibility referred to in Sec. 138.10(b)(2): claimant, 
damages, environment, hazardous substance, navigable waters, natural 
resources, person, release, remove, removal, and United States.
    (b) As used in this part (including the appendices to this part)--
    Acts means OPA 90 and CERCLA.
    Applicant means an operator who has applied for a Certificate or for 
the renewal of a Certificate under this part.
    Application means ``Application for Vessel Certificate of Financial 
Responsibility (Water Pollution)'', as illustrated in Appendix A of this 
part.
    Cargo means goods or materials on board a vessel for purposes of 
transportation, whether proprietary or nonproprietary. A hazardous 
substance or oil carried solely for use aboard the carrying vessel is 
not ``cargo''.
    CERCLA means title I of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.).
    Certificant means an operator who has been issued a Certificate 
under this part.
    Certificate means a ``Vessel Certificate of Financial Responsibility 
(Water Pollution)'' issued under this part, unless otherwise indicated.
    Director, NPFC, means the head of the U.S. Coast Guard National 
Pollution Funds Center (NPFC).
    Financial responsibility means statutorily required financial 
ability to meet liability under the Acts.
    Fish tender vessel and fishing vessel have the same meaning as set 
forth in 46 U.S.C. 2101.
    Fuel means any oil or hazardous substance used or capable of being 
used to produce heat or power by burning, including power to operate 
equipment. A hand-carried pump with not more than

[[Page 80]]

five gallons of fuel capacity, that is neither integral to nor regularly 
stored aboard a non-self-propelled barge, is not equipment.
    Guarantor means any person who provides evidence of financial 
responsibility, under the Acts, on behalf of a vessel owner, operator, 
and demise charterer. A vessel operator who can qualify as a self-
insurer may act as both a self-insurer of vessels it operates and as a 
financial guarantor of other vessels, under Sec. 138.80(b)(4).
    Hazardous material means a liquid material or substance that is--
    (1) Flammable or combustible;
    (2) Designated a hazardous substance under section 311(b) of the 
Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1221); or
    (3) Designated a hazardous material under section 104 of the 
Hazardous Material Transportation Act (49 App. U.S.C. 1803).
    Incident means any occurrence or series of occurrences having the 
same origin, involving one or more vessels, facilities, or any 
combination thereof, resulting in the discharge or substantial threat of 
discharge of oil into or upon the navigable waters or adjoining 
shorelines or the exclusive economic zone.
    Insurer is a type of guarantor and means one or more insurance 
companies, associations of underwriters, shipowners' protection and 
indemnity associations, or other persons, each of which must be 
acceptable to the Coast Guard.
    Master Certificate means a Certificate issued under this part to a 
person acting as vessel operator in its capacity as a builder, repairer, 
scrapper, or seller of vessels.
    Offshore supply vessel has the same meaning as set forth in 46 
U.S.C. 2101.
    OPA 90 means title I of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (33 U.S.C. 
2701 et seq.).
    Operator means a person who is an owner, a demise charterer, or 
other contractor, who conducts the operation of, or who is responsible 
for the operation of, a vessel. A builder, repairer, scrapper, lessor, 
or seller who is responsible, or who agrees by contract to become 
responsible, for a vessel is an operator.
    Owner means any person holding legal or equitable title to a vessel. 
In a case where a Certificate of Documentation or equivalent document 
has been issued, the owner is considered to be the person or persons 
whose name or names appear thereon as owner. For purposes of CERCLA 
only, ``owner'' does not include a person who, without participating in 
the management of a vessel, holds indicia of ownership primarily to 
protect the owner's security interest in the vessel.
    Public vessel means a vessel
    Owned or bareboat chartered by the United States, or by a State or 
political subdivision thereof, or by a foreign nation, except when the 
vessel is engaged in commerce.
    Self-elevating lift vessel means a vessel with movable legs capable 
of raising its hull above the surface of the sea and that is an offshore 
work boat (such as a work barge) that does not engage in drilling 
operations.
    Tank vessel means a vessel (other than an offshore supply vessel, a 
fishing or fish tender vessel of 750 gross tons or less that transfers 
fuel without charge to a fishing vessel owned by the same person, or a 
towing or pushing vessel (tug) simply because it has in its custody a 
tank barge) that is constructed or adapted to carry, or that carries, 
oil or liquid hazardous material in bulk as cargo or cargo residue, and 
that--
    (1) Is a vessel of the United States;
    (2) Operates on the navigable waters; or
    (3) Transfers oil or hazardous material in a place subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States.
    Total Applicable Amount means the amount determined under 
Sec. 138.80(f)(3).
    Vessel means every description of watercraft or other artificial 
contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation 
on water.

[CGD 91-005, 59 FR 34227, July 1, 1994, as amended by CGD 91-005, 61 FR 
9274, Mar. 7, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 138.30  General.

    (a) The regulations in this part set forth the procedures whereby an 
operator of a vessel subject to this part can demonstrate that it and 
the owner and

[[Page 81]]

demise charterer of the vessel are financially able to meet potential 
liability for costs and damages in the amounts established by this part. 
The owner, operator, and demise charterer are strictly, jointly, and 
severally liable for the costs and damages resulting from an incident or 
a release or threatened release, but together they need only establish 
and maintain an amount of financial responsibility equal to the single 
limit of liability per incident, release, or threatened release. Only 
that portion of the evidence of financial responsibility under this part 
with respect to--
    (1) OPA 90 is required to be made available by a guarantor for the 
costs and damages related to an incident where there is not also a 
release or threatened release; and
    (2) CERCLA is required to be made available by a guarantor for the 
costs and damages related to a release or threatened release where there 
is not also an incident. A guarantor (or a self-insurer for whom the 
exceptions to limitations of liability are not applicable), therefore, 
is not required to apply the entire amount of financial responsibility 
to an incident involving oil alone or a release or threatened release 
involving a hazardous substance alone.
    (b) Where a vessel is operated by its owner, or the owner is 
responsible for its operation, the owner is considered to be the 
operator and shall submit the application for a Certificate. In all 
other cases, the vessel operator shall submit the application. A time or 
voyage charterer that does not assume responsibility for the operation 
of the vessel is not considered an operator for the purposes of this 
part.
    (c) For a United States-flag vessel, the applicable gross tons or 
gross tonnage, as referred to in this part, is determined as follows:
    (1) For a documented U.S. vessel measured under both 46 U.S.C. 
Chapters 143 (Convention Measurement) and 145 (Regulatory Measurement). 
The vessel's regulatory gross tonnage is used to determine whether the 
vessel exceeds 300 gross tons where that threshold applies under the 
Acts. If the vessel's regulatory tonnage is determined under the Dual 
Measurement System in 46 CFR part 69, subpart D, the higher gross 
tonnage is the regulatory tonnage for the purposes of the 300 gross ton 
threshold. The vessel's gross tonnage as measured under the 
International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969 
(``Convention''), is used to determine the vessel's required amount of 
financial responsibility, and limit of liability under section 1004(a) 
of OPA 90 and under section 107(a) of CERCLA.
    (2) For all other United States vessels. The vessel's gross tonnage 
under 46 CFR part 69 is used for determining both the 300 gross ton 
threshold, the required amount of financial responsibility, and limit of 
liability under section 1004(a) of OPA 90 and under section 107(a) of 
CERCLA. If the vessel is measured under the Dual Measurement System, the 
higher gross tonnage is used in all determinations.
    (d) For a vessel of a foreign country that is a party to the 
Convention, gross tonnage, as referred to in this part, is determined as 
follows:
    (1) For a vessel assigned, or presently required to be assigned, 
gross tonnage under Annex I of the Convention. The vessel's gross 
tonnage as measured under Annex I of the Convention is used for 
determining the 300 gross ton threshold, if applicable, the required 
amount of financial responsibility, and limit of liability under section 
1004(a) of OPA 90 and under section 107(a) of CERCLA.
    (2) For a vessel not presently required to be assigned gross tonnage 
under Annex I of the Convention. The highest gross tonnage that appears 
on the vessel's certificate of documentation or equivalent document and 
that is acceptable to the Coast Guard under 46 U.S.C. chapter 143 is 
used for determining the 300 gross ton threshold, if applicable, the 
required amount of financial responsibility, and limit of liability 
under section 1004(a) of OPA 90 and under section 107(a) of CERCLA. If 
the vessel has no document or the gross tonnage appearing on the 
document is not acceptable under 46 U.S.C. chapter 143, the vessel's 
gross tonnage is determined by applying the Convention Measurement 
System under 46 CFR part 69, subpart B, or if applicable, the Simplified 
Measurement System under

[[Page 82]]

46 CFR part 69, subpart E. The measurement standards applied are subject 
to applicable international agreements to which the United States 
Government is a party.
    (e) For a vessel of a foreign country that is not a party to the 
Convention, gross tonnage, as referred to in this part, is determined as 
follows:
    (1) For a vessel measured under laws and regulations found by the 
Commandant to be similar to Annex I of the Convention. The vessel's 
gross tonnage under the similar laws and regulations is used for 
determining the 300 gross ton threshold, if applicable, the required 
amount of financial responsibility, and limit of liability under section 
1004(a) of OPA 90 and under section 107(a) of CERCLA. The measurement 
standards applied are subject to applicable international agreements to 
which the United States Government is a party.
    (2) For a vessel not measured under laws and regulations found by 
the Commandant to be similar to Annex I of the Convention. The vessel's 
gross tonnage under 46 CFR part 69, subpart B, or, if applicable, 
subpart E, is used for determining the 300 gross ton threshold, if 
applicable, the required amount of financial responsibility, and limit 
of liability under section 1004(a) of OPA 90 and under section 107(a) of 
CERCLA. The measurement standards applied are subject to applicable 
international agreements to which the United States is a party.
    (f) A person who agrees to act as a guarantor or a self-insurer is 
bound by the vessel's gross tonnage as determined under paragraphs (c), 
(d), or (e) of this section, regardless of what gross tonnage is 
specified in an application or guaranty form illustrated in the 
appendices to this part. Guarantors, however, may limit their liability 
under a guaranty of financial responsibility to the applicable gross 
tonnage appearing on a vessel's International Tonnage Certificate or 
other official, applicable certificate of measurement and shall not 
incur any greater liability with respect to that guaranty, except when 
the guarantors knew or should have known that the applicable tonnage 
certificate was incorrect.

FR 34714, June 29, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 138.50  Time to apply.

    (a) A vessel operator who wishes to obtain a Certificate shall file 
a completed application form, evidence of financial responsibility and 
appropriate fees at least 21 days prior to the date the Certificate is 
required. The Director, NPFC, may waive this 21-day requirement.
    (b) The Director, NPFC, generally processes applications in the 
order in which they are received at the National Pollution Funds Center.


<R05>
Sec. 138.60  Applications, general instructions.

    (a) The application for a Certificate (Form CG-5585) is illustrated 
in Appendix A of this part. An application and all supporting documents 
must be in English. All monetary terms must be expressed in United 
States dollars.
    (b) An authorized official of the applicant shall sign the 
application. The title of the signer must be shown in the space provided 
on the application.
    (c) The application must be accompanied by a written statement 
providing authority to sign, where the signer is not disclosed as an 
individual (sole proprietor) applicant, a partner in a partnership 
applicant, or a director, chief executive officer, or any other duly 
authorized officer of a corporate applicant.

[[Page 83]]

    (d) If, before the issuance of a Certificate, the applicant becomes 
aware of a change in any of the facts contained in the application or 
supporting documentation, the applicant shall, within five business days 
of becoming aware of the change, notify the Director, NPFC, in writing, 
of the change.


<R05>
Sec. 138.65  Issuance and carriage of Certificates.

    Upon the satisfactory demonstration of financial responsibility and 
payment of fees, the Director, NPFC, issues a Vessel Certificate of 
Financial Responsibility (Water Pollution), the original of which 
(except as provided in Secs. 138.90 (a) and (b) and 138.110(f)) is to be 
carried aboard the vessel covered by the Certificate. The carriage of a 
valid Certificate or authorized copy indicates compliance with these 
regulations. Failure to carry a valid Certificate or authorized copy 
subjects the vessel to enforcement action, except where a Certificate is 
removed temporarily from a vessel for inspection by a United States 
Government official.


<R05>
Sec. 138.70  Renewal of Certificates.

    (a) An operator shall file a written application for the renewal of 
a Certificate at least 21 days, but not earlier than 90 days, before the 
expiration date of the Certificate. Except as provided in paragraph (c) 
of this section, a letter may be used for this purpose. The Director, 
NPFC, may waive this 21-day requirement.
    (b) The applicant shall identify in the renewal application any 
changes which have occurred since the original application for a 
Certificate was filed, and set forth the correct information in full.
    (c) An applicant that applies for the first time for a Certificate 
issued under this part to replace a Certificate issued under part 130 of 
this chapter shall submit an application form illustrated in Appendix A 
of this part. An applicant is not required to pay an application fee 
under Sec. 138.130(c) for this first-time application.


<R05>
Sec. 138.80  Financial responsibility, how established.

    (a) General. In addition to submitting an application and fees, an 
applicant shall submit, or cause to be submitted, evidence of financial 
responsibility in an amount determined under Sec. 138.80(f). A guarantor 
may submit directly to the Director, NPFC, the evidence of financial 
responsibility.
    (b) Methods. An applicant shall establish evidence of financial 
responsibility by one or more of the following methods:
    (1) Insurance. By filing with the Director, NPFC, an insurance 
guaranty form CG-5586, illustrated in Appendix B of this part (or, when 
applying for a Master Certificate, a master insurance guaranty form CG-
5586-1, illustrated in Appendix C of this part), executed by not more 
than four insurers that have been found acceptable by and remain 
acceptable to the Director, NPFC, for purposes of this part.
    (2) Surety bond. By filing with the Director, NPFC, a surety bond 
guaranty form CG-5586-2, illustrated in Appendix D of this part, 
executed by not more than 10 acceptable surety companies certified by 
the United States Department of the Treasury with respect to the 
issuance of Federal bonds in the maximum penal sum of each bond to be 
issued under this part.
    (3) Self-insurance. By filing the financial statements specified in 
paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section for the applicant's last fiscal year 
preceding the date of application and by demonstrating that the 
applicant maintains, in the United States, working capital and net worth 
each in amounts equal to or greater than the total applicable amount 
calculated in accordance with Sec. 138.80(f), based on a vessel carrying 
hazardous substances as cargo. As used in this paragraph, working 
capital means the amount of current assets located in the United States, 
less all current liabilities anywhere in the world; and net worth means 
the amount of all assets located in the United States, less all 
liabilities anywhere in the world. After the initial submission, for 
each of the applicant's fiscal years, the applicant or certificant shall 
submit statements as follows:
    (i) Initial and annual submissions. An applicant or certificant 
shall submit

[[Page 84]]

annual, current, and audited non-consolidated financial statements 
prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, 
and audited by an independent Certified Public Accountant. These 
financial statements must be audited in accordance with Generally 
Accepted Auditing Standards. These financial statements must be 
accompanied by an additional statement from the Treasurer (or equivalent 
official) of the applicant or certificant certifying both the amount of 
current assets and the amount of total assets included in the 
accompanying balance sheet, which are located in the United States. If 
the financial statements cannot be submitted in non-consolidated form, a 
consolidated statement may be submitted if accompanied by an additional 
statement prepared by the same Certified Public Accountant, verifying 
the amount by which the applicant's or certificant's--
    (A) Total assets, located in the United States, exceed its total 
(i.e., worldwide) liabilities; and
    (B) Current assets, located in the United States, exceed its total 
(i.e., worldwide) current liabilities. This additional statement must 
specifically name the applicant or certificant, indicate that the 
amounts so verified relate only to the applicant or certificant, apart 
from any other affiliated entity, and identify the consolidated 
financial statement to which it applies.
    (ii) Semiannual submissions. When the applicant's or certificant's 
demonstrated net worth is not at least ten times the total applicable 
amount of financial responsibility, the applicant's or certificant's 
Treasurer (or equivalent official) shall file affidavits covering the 
first six months of the applicant's or certificant's fiscal year. The 
affidavits must state that neither the working capital nor the net worth 
have, during the first six months of the current fiscal year, fallen 
below the applicant's or certificant's required amount of financial 
responsibility as determined in accordance with this part.
    (iii) Additional submissions. An applicant or certificant--
    (A) Shall, upon request of the Director, NPFC, submit additional 
financial information; and
    (B) Who establishes financial responsibility under paragraph (b)(3) 
of this section shall notify the Director, NPFC, within five business 
days of the date the applicant or certificant knows, or has reason to 
believe, that the working capital or net worth has fallen below the 
amounts required by this part.
    (iv) Time for submissions. All required annual financial statements 
must be received by the Director, NPFC, within 90 days after the close 
of the applicant's or certificant's fiscal year, and all affidavits 
required by paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section within 30 days after 
the close of the applicable six-month period. Upon written request, the 
Director, NPFC, may grant an extension of the time limits for filing the 
annual financial statements or affidavits. An applicant or certificant 
that requests an extension must set forth the reason for the extension 
and deliver the request at least 15 days before the statements or 
affidavits are due. The Director, NPFC, will not consider a request for 
an extension of more than 60 days.
    (v) Failure to submit. The Director, NPFC, may revoke a certificate 
for failure of the certificant to submit any statement, data, 
notification, or affidavit required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (vi) Waiver of working capital. The Director, NPFC, may waive the 
working capital requirement for any applicant or certificant that--
    (A) Is a regulated public utility, a municipal or higher-level 
governmental entity, or an entity operating solely as a charitable, non-
profit making organization qualifying under section 501(c) Internal 
Revenue Code. The applicant or certificant must demonstrate in writing 
that the grant of a waiver would benefit a local public interest; or
    (B) Demonstrates in writing that working capital is not a 
significant factor in the applicant's or certificant's financial 
condition. An applicant's or certificant's net worth in relation to the 
amount of its required amount of financial responsibility and

[[Page 85]]

a history of stable operations are the major elements considered by the 
Director, NPFC.
    (4) Financial Guaranty. By filing with the Director, NPFC, a 
Financial Guaranty Form CG-5586-3, illustrated in Appendix E of this 
part (when applying for a Master Certificate, a Master Financial 
Guaranty Form CG-5586-4, illustrated in Appendix F of this part), 
executed by not more than four financial guarantors, such as a parent or 
affiliate acceptable to the Coast Guard. A financial guarantor shall 
comply with all of the self-insurance provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section. In addition, a person that is a financial guarantor for 
more than one applicant or certificant shall have working capital and 
net worth no less than the aggregate total applicable amounts of 
financial responsibility provided as a guarantor for each applicant or 
certificant, plus the amount required to be demonstrated by a self-
insurer under this part, if also acting as a self-insurer.
    (5) Other evidence of financial responsibility. The Director, NPFC, 
will not accept a self-insurance method other than the one described in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section. An applicant may in writing request 
the Director, NPFC, to accept a method different from one described in 
paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (4) of this section to demonstrate evidence 
of financial responsibility. An applicant submitting a request under 
this paragraph shall submit the request to the Director, NPFC, at least 
45 days prior to the date the Certificate is required. The applicant 
shall describe in detail the method proposed, the reasons why the 
applicant does not wish to use or is unable to use one of the methods 
described in paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (4) of this section, and how the 
proposed method assures that the applicant is able to fulfill its 
obligation to pay costs and damages in the event of an incident or a 
release or threatened release. The Director, NPFC, will not accept a 
method under this paragraph that merely deletes or alters a provision of 
one of the methods described in paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (4) of this 
section (for example, one that alters the termination clause of the 
insurance guaranty form illustrated in Appendix B of this part). An 
applicant that makes a request under this paragraph shall provide the 
Director, NPFC, a proposed guaranty form that includes all the elements 
described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. A decision of the 
Director, NPFC, not to accept a method requested by an applicant under 
this paragraph is final agency action.
    (c) Forms--(1) Multiple guarantors. Four or fewer insurers (a lead 
underwriter is considered to be one insurer) may jointly execute an 
insurance guaranty form. Ten or fewer sureties (including lead sureties) 
may jointly execute a surety bond guaranty form. Four or fewer financial 
guarantors may jointly execute a financial guaranty form. If more than 
one insurer, surety, or financial guarantor executes the relevant form--
    (i) Each is bound for the payment of sums only in accordance with 
the percentage of vertical participation specified on the relevant form 
for that insurer, surety, or financial guarantor. Participation in the 
form of layering (tiers, one in excess of another) is not acceptable; 
only vertical participation on a percentage basis is acceptable unless 
none of the participants specifies a percent of participation. If no 
percentage of participation is specified for an insurer, surety, or 
financial guarantor, the liability of that insurer, surety, or financial 
guarantor is joint and several for the total of the unspecified 
portions; and
    (ii) The guarantors must designate a lead guarantor having authority 
to bind all guarantors for actions required of guarantors under the 
Acts, including but not limited to receipt of designation of source, 
advertisement of a designation, and receipt and settlement of claims.
    (2) Operator name. An applicant shall ensure that each form 
submitted under this part sets forth in full the correct legal name of 
the vessel operator to whom a certificate is to be issued.
    (d) Direct Action. (1) Acknowledgment. Any evidence of financial 
responsibility submitted under this part must contain an acknowledgment 
by the insurer or other guarantor that an action in court by a claimant 
(including a claimant by right of subrogation) for

[[Page 86]]

costs and damage claims arising under the provisions of the Acts, may be 
brought directly against the insurer or other guarantor. The evidence of 
financial responsibility must also provide that, in the event an action 
is brought under the Acts directly against the insurer or other 
guarantor, the insurer or other guarantor may invoke only the following 
rights and defenses:
    (i) The incident, release, or threatened release was caused by the 
willful misconduct of the person for whom the guaranty is provided.
    (ii) Any defense that the person for whom the guaranty is provided 
may raise under the Acts.
    (iii) A defense relating to the amount of a claim or claims, filed 
in any action in any court or other proceeding, that exceeds the amount 
of the guaranty with respect to an incident or with respect to a release 
or threatened release.
    (iv) A defense relating to the amount of a claim or claims that 
exceeds the amount of the guaranty, which amount is based on the gross 
tonnage of the vessel as entered on the vessel's International Tonnage 
Certificate or other official, applicable certificate of measurement, 
except when the guarantor knew or should have known that the applicable 
tonnage certificate was incorrect.
    (v) The claim is not one made under either of the Acts.
    (2) Limitation on guarantor liability. A guarantor that participates 
in any evidence of financial responsibility under this part shall be 
liable because of that participation, with respect to an incident or a 
release or threatened release, in any proceeding only for the amount and 
type of costs and damages specified in the evidence of financial 
responsibility. A guarantor shall not be considered to have consented to 
direct action under any law other than the Acts, or to unlimited 
liability under any law or in any venue, solely because of the 
guarantor's participation in providing any evidence of financial 
responsibility under this part. In the event of any finding that 
liability of a guarantor exceeds the amount of the guaranty provided 
under this part, that guaranty is considered null and void with respect 
to that excess.
    (e) Public access to data. Financial data filed by an applicant, 
certificant, and any other person is considered public information to 
the extent required by the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and 
permitted by the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a).
    (f) Total applicable amount. (1) The applicable amount under OPA 90 
is determined as follows:
    (i) For a tank vessel (except a tank vessel on which no liquid 
hazardous material in bulk is being carried as cargo or cargo residue, 
and on which the only oil carried as cargo or cargo residue is an animal 
fat or vegetable oil, as those terms are used in section 2 of the Edible 
Oil Regulatory Reform Act (Pub. L. 104-55)).
    (A) Over 300 gross tons (and a vessel of 300 gross tons or less 
using the waters of the United States Exclusive Economic Zone to 
transship or lighter oil destined for a place subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States, as specified in Sec. 138.12(a)(1)) 
but not exceeding 3,000 gross tons, the greater of $2,000,000 or $1,200 
per gross ton; and
    (B) Over 3,000 gross tons, the greater of $10,000,000 or $1,200 per 
gross ton.
    (ii) For a vessel other than a tank vessel under paragraph (f)(1)(i) 
of this section that is over 300 gross tons or that is 300 gross tons or 
less using the waters of the Exclusive Economic Zone of the United 
States to transship or lighter oil destined for a place subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States, the greater of $500,000 or $600 per 
gross ton.
    (2) The applicable amount under CERCLA is determined as follows:
    (i) For a vessel over 300 gross tons carrying a hazardous substance 
as cargo, the greater of $5,000,000 or $300 per gross ton.
    (ii) For any other vessel over 300 gross tons, the greater of 
$500,000 or $300 per gross ton.
    (3) The total applicable amount is the maximum applicable amount 
calculated under paragraph (f)(1) of this section plus maximum 
applicable amount calculated under paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 138.90  Individual and Fleet Certificates.

    (a) The Director, NPFC, issues an individual Certificate for each 
vessel listed on a completed application when the Director, NPFC, 
determines that acceptable evidence of financial responsibility has been 
provided and appropriate fees have been paid, except where a Fleet 
Certificate is issued under this section or where a Master Certificate 
is issued under Sec. 138.110. Each Certificate of any type issued under 
this part is issued only in the name of a vessel operator and is 
effective for not more than three years from the date of issue, as 
indicated on each Certificate. An authorized official of the applicant 
may submit to the Director, NPFC, a letter requesting that additional 
vessels be added to a previously submitted application for an individual 
Certificate. The letter must set forth all information required in item 
5 of the application form. The authorized official shall also submit or 
cause to be submitted acceptable evidence of financial responsibility, 
if required, and certification fees for these additional vessels. The 
certificant shall carry the original individual Certificate on the 
vessel named on the Certificate, except that a legible copy (certified 
as accurate by a notary public or other person authorized to take oaths 
in the United States) may be carried instead of the original if the 
vessel is an unmanned barge and does not have a document carrying device 
which the vessel operator believes would offer suitable protection for 
the original Certificate. If a notarized copy of an individual 
Certificate is carried aboard a barge, the Certificate shall retain the 
original in the United States and shall make it readily available for 
inspection by United States Government officials.
    (b) An operator of two or more barges that are not tank vessels and 
that from time to time may be subject to this part (e.g., a hopper barge 
over 300 gross tons when carrying oily metal shavings or similar cargo), 
so long as the operator of such a fleet is a self-insurer or arranges 
with an acceptable guarantor to cover, automatically, all such barges 
for which the operator may from time to time be responsible, may apply 
to the Director, NPFC, for issuance of a Fleet Certificate. A legible 
copy of the Fleet Certificate, certified as accurate by a notary public 
or other person authorized to take oaths in the United States, must be 
carried on each barge when subject to this part. In addition, the 
certificant shall retain in the United States the original Fleet 
Certificate and shall make it readily available for inspection by United 
States Government officials. The original Fleet Certificate, when 
invalid, must be completed on the reverse side and returned immediately 
to the Director, NPFC, and all copies must be destroyed. When the 
certificant ceases to be responsible for a barge covered by a Fleet 
Certificate, the certificant shall immediately destroy the copy of the 
Fleet Certificate carried aboard that barge.
    (c) A person shall not make any alteration on any Certificate issued 
under this part or copy of that Certificate, except the notarized 
certifications permitted in Sec. 138.110(f) and paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section. A Certificate or copy containing any alteration is 
void.
    (d) If, at any time after a Certificate has been issued, a 
certificant becomes aware of a change in any of the facts contained in 
the application or supporting documentation, the certificant shall 
notify the Director, NPFC, in writing within 10 days of becoming aware 
of the change. A vessel or operator name change or change of a guarantor 
shall be reported as soon as possible by telefax or other electronic 
means to the Director, NPFC, and followed by a written notice sent 
within three business days.
    (e) Except as provided in Sec. 138.90(f), at the moment a 
certificant ceases to be the operator of a vessel for any reason, 
including a vessel that is scrapped or transferred to a new operator, 
the individual Certificate naming the vessel, and any copies of the 
Certificate, are void and their further use is prohibited. In that case, 
the certificant shall, within 10 days of the Certificate becoming void, 
complete the reverse side of the original individual Certificate naming 
the involved vessel and return the Certificate to the Director, NPFC. If 
the Certificate cannot be returned

[[Page 88]]

because it has been lost or destroyed, the certificant shall, within 
three business days, submit the following information in writing to the 
Director, NPFC:
    (1) The number of the individual Certificate and the name of the 
vessel.
    (2) The date and reason why the certificant ceased to be the 
operator of the vessel.
    (3) The location of the vessel on the date the certificant ceased to 
be the operator.
    (4) The name and mailing address of the person to whom the vessel 
was sold or transferred.
    (f) In the event of the temporary transfer of custody of an unmanned 
barge certificated under this part, where the certificant transferring 
the barge continues to be liable under the Acts and continues to 
maintain on file with the Director, NPFC, acceptable evidence of 
financial responsibility with respect to the barge, the existing 
individual Certificate remains in effect. A temporary new individual 
Certificate is not required. A transferee is encouraged to require the 
transferring certificant to acknowledge in writing that the transferring 
certificant agrees to remain responsible for pollution liabilities.


<R05>
Sec. 138.100  Non-owning operator's responsibility for identification.

    (a) Each operator that is not an owner of a vessel certificated 
under this part, other than an unmanned barge, shall ensure that the 
original or a legible copy of the demise charter-party (or other written 
document on the owner's letterhead, signed by the vessel owner, which 
specifically identifies the vessel operator named on the Certificate) is 
maintained on board the vessel.
    (b) The demise charter-party or other document required by paragraph 
(a) of this section must be presented, upon request, for examination to 
a United States Government official.


<R05>
Sec. 138.110  Master Certificates.

    (a) A contractor or other person who is responsible for a vessel in 
the capacity of a builder, scrapper, lessor, or seller (including a 
repairer who agrees to be responsible for a vessel under its custody) 
may apply for a Master Certificate instead of applying for an individual 
Certificate for each vessel. A Master Certificate covers all of the 
vessels subject to this part held by the applicant solely for purposes 
of construction, repair, scrapping, lease, or sale. A vessel which is 
being operated commercially in any business venture, including the 
business of building, repairing, scrapping, leasing, or selling (e.g., a 
slop barge used by a shipyard) cannot be covered by a Master 
Certificate. Any vessel for which a Certificate is required, but which 
is not eligible for a Master Certificate, must be covered by either an 
individual Certificate or a Fleet Certificate.
    (b) An applicant for a Master Certificate shall submit an 
application form in the manner prescribed by Sec. 138.60. An applicant 
shall establish evidence of financial responsibility in accordance with 
Sec. 138.80, by submission, for example, of an acceptable Master 
Insurance Guaranty Form, Surety Bond Guaranty Form, Master Financial 
Guaranty Form, or acceptable self-insurance documentation. An 
application must be completed in full, except for Item 5. The applicant 
shall make the following statement in Item 5: ``This is an application 
for a Master Certificate. The largest tank vessel to be covered by this 
application is [insert applicable gross tons] gross tons. The largest 
vessel other than a tank vessel is [insert applicable gross tons] gross 
tons.'' The dollar amount of financial responsibility evidenced by the 
applicant must be sufficient to meet the amount required under this 
part.
    (c) Each Master Certificate issued by the Director, NPFC, indicates-
-
    (1) The name of the applicant (i.e., the builder, repairer, 
scrapper, lessor, or seller);
    (2) The date of issuance and termination, encompassing a period of 
not more than three years; and
    (3) The gross tons of the largest tank vessel and gross tons of the 
largest vessel other than a tank vessel eligible for coverage by that 
Master Certificate. The Master Certificate does not identify the name of 
each vessel covered by the Certificate.

[[Page 89]]

    (d) Each additional vessel which does not exceed the respective 
tonnages indicated on the Master Certificate and which is eligible for 
coverage by a Master Certificate is automatically covered by that Master 
Certificate. Before acquiring a vessel, by any means, including 
conversion of an existing vessel, that would have the effect of 
increasing the certificant's required amount of financial responsibility 
(above that provided for issuance of the existing Master Certificate), 
the certificant shall submit to the Director, NPFC, the following:
    (1) Evidence of increased financial responsibility.
    (2) A new certification fee.
    (3) Either a new application or a letter amending the existing 
application to reflect the new gross tonnage which is to be indicated on 
a new Master Certificate.
    (e) A person to whom a Master Certificate has been issued shall 
submit to the Director, NPFC, every six months beginning the month after 
the month in which the Master Certificate is issued, a report indicating 
the name, previous name, type, and gross tonnage of each vessel covered 
by the Master Certificate during the preceding six-month reporting 
period and indicating which vessels, if any, are tank vessels.
    (f) The certificant shall ensure that a legible copy of the Master 
Certificate (certified as accurate by a notary public or other person 
authorized to take oaths in the United States) is carried aboard each 
vessel covered by the Master Certificate. The certificant shall retain 
the original Master Certificate at a location in the United States and 
shall make it readily available for inspection by United States 
Government officials.
    (g) Upon revocation or other invalidation of the Master Certificate, 
the certificant shall return the original Certificate within 10 days to 
the Director, NPFC. The certificant shall ensure that all copies of the 
Certificate are destroyed.

<R05>
Sec. 138.120  Certificates, denial or revocation.

    (a) The Director, NPFC, may deny a Certificate when an applicant--
    (1) Willfully or knowingly makes a false statement in connection 
with an application for an initial or renewal Certificate;
    (2) Fails to establish acceptable evidence of financial 
responsibility as required by this part;
    (3) Fails to pay the required application or certificate fees;
    (4) Fails to comply with or respond to lawful inquiries, 
regulations, or orders of the Coast Guard pertaining to the activities 
subject to this part; or
    (5) Fails to timely file required statements, data, notifications, 
or affidavits.
    (b) The Director, NPFC, may revoke a Certificate when a certificant-
-
    (1) Willfully or knowingly makes a false statement in connection 
with an application for an initial or a renewal Certificate, or in 
connection with any other filing required by this part;
    (2) Fails to comply with or respond to lawful inquiries, 
regulations, or orders of the Coast Guard pertaining to the activities 
subject to this part; or
    (3) Fails to timely file required statements, data, notifications, 
or affidavits.
    (c) A Certificate is immediately invalid, and considered revoked, 
without prior notice, when the certificant--
    (1) Fails to maintain acceptable evidence of financial 
responsibility as required by this part;
    (2) Is no longer the responsible operator of the vessel in question; 
or
    (3) Alters any Certificate or copy of a Certificate except as 
permitted by this part in connection with notarized certifications of 
copies.
    (d) The Director, NPFC, advises the applicant or certificant, in 
writing, of the intention to deny or revoke a Certificate under 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section and states the reason therefor. 
Written advice from the Director, NPFC, that an incomplete application 
will be considered withdrawn unless it is completed within a stated 
period, is the equivalent of a denial.
    (e) If the intended revocation under paragraph (b) of this section 
is based

[[Page 90]]

on failure to timely file the required financial statements, data, 
notifications, or affidavits, the revocation is effective 10 days after 
the date of the notice of intention to revoke, unless, before 
revocation, the certificant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the 
Director, NPFC, that the required documents were timely filed or have 
been filed.
    (f) If the intended denial is based on paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(4) of 
this section, or the intended revocation is based on paragraph (b)(1) or 
(b)(2) of this section, the applicant or certificant may request, in 
writing, an opportunity to present information for the purpose of 
showing that the applicant or certificant is in compliance with the 
part. The request must be received by the Director, NPFC, within 10 days 
after the date of the notification of intention to deny or revoke. A 
Certificate subject to revocation under this paragraph remains valid 
until the Director, NPFC, issues a written decision revoking the 
Certificate.
    (g) An applicant or certificant whose Certificate has been denied 
under paragraph (a) of this section or revoked under paragraph (b) or 
(c) of this section may request the Director, NPFC, to reconsider the 
denial or revocation. The certificant shall file a request for 
reconsideration, in writing, to the Director, NPFC, within 20 days of 
the date of the denial or revocation. The certificant shall state the 
reasons for reconsideration. The Director, NPFC, issues a written 
decision on the request within 30 days of receipt, except that failure 
to issue a decision within 30 days shall be deemed an affirmance of a 
denial or revocation. Until the Director, NPFC, issues this decision, a 
revoked certificate remains invalid. A decision by the Director, NPFC, 
affirming a denial or revocation, is final agency action.


<R05>
Sec. 138.130  Fees.

    (a) The Director, NPFC, will not issue a Certificate until the fees 
set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section have been paid.
    (b) Fees must be paid in United States currency by check, draft, or 
postal money order made payable to the ``U.S. Coast Guard''. Cash will 
not be accepted.
    (c) Except as provided in Sec. 138.70(c), an applicant that submits 
an application for the first time under this part, shall pay an initial, 
non-refundable application fee of $150 for each type of application 
(i.e., individual Certificate(s), Fleet Certificate, and Master 
Certificate). An applicant that submits an application for an additional 
(i.e., supplemental) individual Certificate, or to replace, amend or 
renew an existing Certificate, is not required to pay a new application 
fee. However, if an applicant for any reason withdraws or permits the 
withdrawal of an application for an individual Certificate(s) and the 
applicant holds no valid individual Certificate(s), in order to reapply 
for an individual Certificate(s) covering the same or different vessels 
the applicant shall submit a new application form and an application fee 
of $150. Similarly, an applicant shall submit a new application form and 
fee to obtain a new Fleet or Master Certificate following invalidation 
of a Fleet or Master Certificate.
    (d) In addition to the application fee of $150, an applicant shall 
also pay a certification fee of $80 for each Certificate requested. An 
applicant shall submit the certification fee for each vessel listed in, 
or later added to, an application for an individual Certificate(s). An 
applicant shall submit the $80 certification fee to renew or to reissue 
a Certificate for any reason, including, but not limited to, a vessel or 
operator name change or a lost certificate.
    (e) A certification fee is refunded, upon receipt of a written 
request, if the application is denied or withdrawn before issuance of 
the Certificate. Overpayments of application and certification fees are 
refunded, on request, only if the refund is for $50 or more. However, 
any overpayments not refunded will be credited, for a period of three 
years from the date of receipt of the monies by the Coast Guard, for the 
applicant's possible future use or transfer to another applicant under 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 138.140  Enforcement.

    (a) Any person who fails to comply with this part with respect to 
evidence of financial responsibility under section 1016 of OPA 90 (33 
U.S.C. 2716) is

[[Page 91]]

subject to a civil penalty. In addition, under section 4303(b) of that 
Act (33 U.S.C. 2716a(b)), the Attorney General may secure such relief as 
may be necessary to compel compliance with this part including 
termination of operations. Further, any person who fails to comply with 
this part with respect to evidence of financial responsibility under 
section 108(a)(1) of CERCLA (42 U.S.C. 9608(a)(1)), is subject to a 
Class I administrative civil penalty and a Class II administrative civil 
penalty or judicial penalty.
    (b) The Secretary of the Treasury shall withhold or revoke the 
clearance required by 46 U.S.C. App. 91 to any vessel subject to this 
part that does not produce evidence of financial responsibility required 
by this part.
    (c) The Coast Guard may deny entry to any port or place in the 
United States or the navigable waters of the United States, and may 
detain at a port or place in the United States in which it is located, 
any vessel subject to this part, which, upon request, does not produce 
evidence of financial responsibility required by this part.
    (d) Any vessel subject to this part which is found in the navigable 
waters without the necessary evidence of financial responsibility is 
subject to seizure by and forfeiture to the United States.
    (e) Knowingly and willfully using an invalid Certificate, or any 
copy thereof, is fraud.

[CGD 91-005, 59 FR 34227, July 1, 1994, as amended by CGD 96-052, 62 FR 
16703, Apr. 8, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 138.150  Service of process.

    (a) When executing the forms required by this part, each applicant 
and guarantor shall designate thereon a person located in the United 
States as its agent for service of process for purposes of this part and 
for receipt of notices of designations and presentations of claims under 
the Acts (collectively referred to as ``service of process''). Each 
designated agent shall acknowledge the designation in writing unless the 
agent has already furnished the Director, NPFC, with a ``master'' (i.e., 
blanket) concurrence showing that it has agreed in advance to act as the 
United States agent for service of process for the applicant, 
certificant, or guarantor in question.
    (b) If any applicant, certificant, or guarantor desires, for any 
reason, to change any designated agent, the applicant, certificant, or 
guarantor shall notify the Director, NPFC, of the change and furnish the 
relevant information, including the new agent's acknowledgment in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, if a ``master'' 
concurrence is not applicable. In the event of death, disability, or 
unavailability of a designated agent, the applicant, certificant, or 
guarantor shall designate another agent in accordance with paragraph (a) 
of this section within 10 days of knowledge of any such event. The 
applicant, certificant, or guarantor shall submit the new designation to 
the Director, NPFC. The Director, NPFC, may revoke a certificate if an 
applicant, certificant, or guarantor fails to designate and maintain an 
agent for service of process.
    (c) If a designated agent can not be served because of death, 
disability, unavailability, or similar event and another agent has not 
been designated under this section, then service of process on the 
Director, NPFC, will constitute valid service of process. Service of 
process on the Director, NPFC, will not be effective unless the server--
    (1) Sends the applicant, certificant, or guarantor (by registered 
mail, at its last known address on file with the Director, NPFC), a copy 
of each document served on the Director, NPFC; and
    (2) Attests to this registered mailing, at the time process is 
served upon the Director, NPFC, indicating that the intent of the 
mailing is to effect service of process on the applicant, certificant, 
or guarantor and that service on the designated agent is not possible, 
stating the reason why.

the opinion of the inspector, cannot be satisfactorily repaired must be 
so mutilated in the presence of the inspector that it cannot be used for 
the purpose for which it was originally intended. Lifesaving and fire 
fighting equipment subsequently determined to be unrepairable must be 
similarly mutilated in the presence of the person making that 
determination.
    (b) Any deficiency or hazard discovered during an inspection by a 
Coast Guard marine inspector or an MMS inspector is reported to the 
unit's owner or operator, who shall have the deficiency or hazard 
corrected or eliminated as soon as practicable and within the period of 
time specified by the inspector.
    (c) Deficiencies and hazards discovered during an inspection of a 
fixed OCS facility under Sec. 140.103(a) must be corrected or 
eliminated, if practicable, before the form CG-5432 is completed. 
Deficiencies and hazards that are not corrected or eliminated by the 
time the form is completed must be indicated on the form as 
``outstanding'' and the form submitted to the appropriate MMS District 
office. Upon receipt of a form CG-5432 indicating outstanding 
deficiencies or hazards, MMS informs, by letter, the owner or operator 
of the fixed OCS facility of the deficiencies or hazards and the time 
period specified to correct or eliminate the deficiencies or hazards.
    (d) For lifesaving and fire fighting equipment deficiencies on fixed 
OCS facilities that cannot be corrected before the submission of form 
CG-5432, the owner or operator must contact the appropriate MMS District 
Supervisor to request a time period for repair of the item. The owner or 
operator must include a description of the deficiency and the time 
period approved by MMS for correction of the deficiency in the comment 
section of form CG-5432.
    (e) Where a deficiency or hazard remains uncorrected or uneliminated 
after the expiration of the time specified for correction or 
elimination, the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection or MMS (for 
deficiencies or hazards discovered by MMS during an inspection of a 
fixed OCS facility), initiates appropriate enforcement measures.

Sec. 145.05  Classification of fire extinguishers.

    (a) Portable and semi-portable extinguishers shall be classified by 
a combination letter and number symbol. The letter indicating the type 
of fire which the unit could be expected to extinguish, and the number 
indicating the relative size of the unit.
    (b) The types of fire will be designated as follows:
    (1) ``A'' for fires in ordinary combustible materials where the 
quenching and cooling effects of quantities of water, or solutions 
containing large percentages of water, are of first importance.
    (2) ``B'' for fires in flammable liquids, greases, etc., where a 
blanketing effect is essential.
    (3) ``C'' for fires in electrical equipment where the use of a non-
conducting extinguishing agent is of first importance.
    (c) The number designations for size will start with ``I'' for the 
smallest to ``V'' for the largest. Sizes I and II are considered 
portable extinguishers. Sizes III, IV and V are considered semi-portable 
extinguishers which shall be fitted with suitable hose and nozzle or 
other practicable means so that all portions of the space concerned may 
be covered. Examples of size graduations for some of the typical 
portable and semi-portable extinguishers are set forth in Table

Sec. 147.1  Purpose of safety zones.

    Safety zones may be established around OCS facilities being 
constructed, maintained, or operated on the Outer Continental Shelf to 
promote the safety of life and property on the facilities, their 
appurtenances and attending vessels, and on the adjacent waters within 
the safety zones. Regulations adopted for safety zones may extend to the 
prevention or control of specific activities and access by vessels or 
persons, and include measures to protect the living resources of the sea 
from harmful agents. The regulations do not encompass the operating 
equipment or procedures used in the drilling for and production of oil, 
gas, or other minerals, or the transportation of oil, gas, or other 
minerals by pipeline except as they relate to the safety of life and 
property on OCS facilities and on the waters adjacent to OCS facilities 
or to the protection of the living resources of the sea within a safety 
zone from harmful agents.


<R05>
Sec. 147.5  Delegation of authority.

    The authority to establish safety zones and to issue and enforce 
safety zone regulations in accordance with the provisions of this part 
is delegated to District Commanders.


<R05>
Sec. 147.10  Establishment of safety zones.

    (a) Whenever it comes to the attention of the District Commander 
that a safety zone and regulations may be required concerning any OCS 
facility being constructed, maintained, or operated on the Outer 
Continental Shelf or its appurtenances and attending vessels, or the 
adjacent waters, the District Commander may initiate appropriate inquiry 
to determine whether a safety zone and regulations should be 
established. In making this determination, the District Commander 
considers all relevant safety factors, including existing or reasonably 
foreseeable congestion of vessels, the presence of unusually harmful or 
hazardous substances, and any obstructions within 500 meters of the OCS 
facility. If the District Commander determines that the circumstances 
warrant the establishment of a safety zone and regulations the District 
Commander takes action as necessary consistent with the provisions of 
this part.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a safety 
zone and necessary regulations may be established concerning any OCS 
facility being constructed, maintained or operated on the Outer 
Continental Shelf, following publication of a notice of proposed rule 
making in the Federal Register and after interested parties have been 
given the opportunity to submit comments. A zone and necessary 
regulations may be in effect during any period when construction 
equipment and materials are within 500 meters of the construction site 
until the removal of all portions of the facility.
    (c) A safety zone and necessary regulations may be established 
without

[[Page 163]]

public rule making procedures when the District Commander determined 
that imminent danger exists with respect to the safety of life and 
property on an OCS facility constructed, maintained, or operated on the 
Outer Continental Shelf, its appurtenances and attending vessels or 
adjacent waters. A safety zone and regulations may be made effective on 
the date the rule is published in the Federal Register. However, if 
circumstances require, they may be placed into effect immediately, 
followed promptly by publication in the Federal Register. The District 
Commander may utilize, in addition to broadcast Notices to Mariners, 
Local Notices to Mariners, and Notices to Mariners, newspapers, and 
broadcasting stations to disseminate information concerning a safety 
zone and regulations pertaining thereto. The public may comment 
concerning the establishment of a safety zone or regulations under this 
paragraph. A safety zone or regulations may be modified or withdrawn, as 
appropriate, based on the comments received.
    (d) Geographic coordinates expressed in terms of latitude or 
longitude, or both, are not intended for plotting on maps or charts 
whose referenced horizontal datum is the North American Datum of 1983 
(NAD 83), unless such geographic coordinates are expressly labeled NAD 
83. Geographic coordinates without the NAD 83 reference may be plotted 
on maps or charts reference to NAD 83 only after application of the 
appropriate corrections that are published on the particular map or 
chart being used.

Sec. 147.15  Extent of safety zones.

    A safety zone establishment under this part may extend to a maximum 
distance of 500 meters around the OCS facility measured from each point 
on its outer edge or from its construction site, but may not interfere 
with the use of recognized sea lanes essential to navigation.


<R05>
Sec. 147.20  Definitions.

    Unless otherwise stated, the term ``attending vessel'' refers to any 
vessel which is operated by the owner or operator of an OCS facility 
located in the safety zone, which is used for the purpose of carrying 
supplies, equipment or personnel to or from the facility, which is 
engaged in construction, maintenance, alteration, or repair of the 
facility, or which is used for further exploration, production, transfer 
or storage of natural resources from the seabed beneath the safety zone.

    Crude oil means a mixture of hydrocarbons that exist in the liquid 
phase in natural underground reservoirs and remains liquid at 
atmospheric pressure after passing through surface separating facilities 
and includes:
    (1) Liquids technically defined as crude oil;
    (2) Small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in the gaseous phase in 
natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric pressure 
after being recovered from oil well (casing head) gas in lease 
separators; and
    (3) Small amounts of non-hydrocarbons produced with the oil.
    Deepwater port means any fixed or floating manmade structures other 
than a vessel, or any group of such structures, located beyond the 
territorial sea and off the coast of the United States and which are 
used or intended for use as a port or terminal for the loading or 
unloading and further handling of oil for transportation to any State, 
except as otherwise provided in section 23 of the Act. The term includes 
all associated components and equipment, including pipelines, pumping 
stations, service platforms, mooring buoys, and similar appurtenances to 
the extent they are located seaward of the high water mark.
    Gross under keel clearance means the distance between the keel of a 
tanker and the ocean bottom when the tanker is moored or anchored in 
calm water free of wind, wave, current, or tide conditions that would 
induce ship motion.
    Marine site means the area in which the deepwater is located, and 
includes the safety zone, attendant ships' routing measures, anchorages 
and all areas seaward of the high water mark in which associated 
components and equipment of the deepwater port are located.
    Miles means nautical miles.
    Net under keel clearance means that distance between the ocean 
bottom and the portion of a tanker's hull closest to the ocean bottom 
when the tanker is underway, moored or anchored, considering ship motion 
in responding to the combination of actual wind, wave, tide, and current 
conditions.
    PAD District means one of the five Petroleum Administration for 
Defense Districts defined by the Bureau of Mines, Department of the

    Refining District means a refining district as defined by the Bureau 
of Mines, Department of the Interior, for reporting refining operations.
    SPM means single point mooring buoy.
    Year-end proved reserves of crude oil means the estimated quantities 
of all liquids statistically defined as crude oil, which geological and 
engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty as of December 31 
of the year concerned to be recoverable in future years from known 
reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Reservoirs 
are considered proved if economic producibility is supported by either 
actual production or conclusive formation tests. The area of an oil 
reservoir considered proved includes:
    (1) That portion delineated by drilling and defined by gas-oil or 
oil-water contacts, if any; and
    (2) The immediately adjoining portions not yet drilled, but which 
can be reasonably judged as economically productive on the basis of 
available geological and engineering data.

In the absence of information on fluid contacts, the lowest known 
structural occurrence of hydrocarbons controls the lower proved limit of 
reservoir. Reserves of crude oil which can be produced economically 
through application of improved recovery techniques (such as fluid 
injection) are included in the ``proved'' classification when successful 
testing by a pilot project, or the operation of an installed program in 
the reservoir, provides support for the engineering analysis on which 
the project or program was based.

Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 
the Secretary determines that there is a risk of damage to the coastal 
environment of the requesting State equal to or greater than the risk 
posed to a State directly connected to the proposed deepwater port, he 
grants the request and designates the requesting State as an adjacent 
coastal State. If he determines that there is not such a risk, he denies 
the request and so notifies the Governor of the requesting State.

<R05>
Sec. 148.323  Criteria and considerations.

    (a) The Secretary approves an application only after he determines 
that:

[[Page 192]]

    (1) The applicant is financially responsible and will carry 
insurance or give evidence of other financial responsibility in the 
amount of $50,000,000 to cover the clean-up costs and damages that could 
result from a discharge of oil from the deepwater port concerned or from 
a vessel moored at the deepwater port;
    (2) The applicant can and will comply with applicable laws, 
regulations, and license conditions;
    (3) The construction and operation of the deepwater port will be in 
the national interest and consistent with national security and other 
national policy goals and objectives, including energy sufficiency and 
environmental quality;
    (4) The deepwater port will not unreasonably interfere with 
international navigation or other reasonable uses of the high seas, as 
defined by treaty, convention, or customary international law;
    (5) In accordance with the environmental review criteria set forth 
in Appendix A to this part, that the applicant has demonstrated that the 
deepwater port will be constructed and operated using the best available 
technology, so as to prevent or minimize adverse impact on the marine 
environment; and
    (6) The adjacent coastal State to which the deepwater port concerned 
is to be connected by pipeline, has developed, or is making, at the time 
the application was submitted, reasonable progress toward developing an 
approved coastal zone management program pursuant to the Coastal Zone 
Management Act of 1972 in the area to be directly and primarily impacted 
by land and water development in the coastal zone resulting from the 
deepwater port or is receiving a planning grant under section 305 of the 
Coastal Zone Management Act.
    (b) In deciding whether to approve or deny an application and in 
making the related preliminary determinations specified in paragraph (a) 
of this section, the Secretary considers:
    (1) The information set forth in the application concerned and any 
other applications for licenses for the same application area submitted 
in accordance with section 5(d)(3) of the Act;
    (2) The information developed during hearings held pursuant to 
Secs. 148.231 through 148.291;
    (3) The final environmental impact statement for the application 
area concerned;
    (4) The views of the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of State, 
and the Secretary of Defense on the adequacy of the application and its 
effects on programs within their respective jurisdictions;
    (5) The views and recommendations of the heads of any other Federal 
departments or agencies having expertise concerning, or jurisdiction 
over, any aspect of the ownership, construction or operation of 
deepwater ports; and
    (6) The opinions of the Federal Trade Commission and the Attorney 
General as to whether issuance of the license would adversely affect 
competition, restrain trade, promote monopolization or otherwise create 
a situation in contravention of the antitrust laws.
    (c) The Secretary does not approve an application if, within the 45-
day period immediately following the completion of the final public 
hearing:
    (1) The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency 
determines that the proposed deepwater port will not conform with all 
applicable provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended, the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, or the Marine Protection, 
Research and Sanctuaries Act, as amended; or
    (2) The Governor of an adjacent coastal State disapproves the 
issuance of the license.

Sec. 148.325  Multiple applications.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, in the case 
of more than one application for a deepwater port license in a 
designated application area, only one application may be approved 
according to the following order of priorities:
    (1) An applicant that is an adjacent coastal State (or combination 
of States), any political subdivision thereof or agency or 
instrumentality, including a wholly owned corporation thereof.
    (2) An applicant who is not:
    (i) Engaged in producing, refining, or marketing oil;

[[Page 193]]

    (ii) An affiliate of any person who is engaged in producing, 
refining or marketing oil; or
    (iii) An affiliate of such an affiliate.

    (b) Notwithstanding the order of priorities listed in paragraph (a) 
of this section, if the Secretary determines that one of the proposed 
deepwater ports will clearly best serve the national interest, he may 
approve the application for that port. In making this determination, the 
Secretary considers:
    (1) The degree to which the proposed deepwater ports affect the 
environment as determined under the review criteria set forth in 
Appendix A to this part;
    (2) Any significant differences between anticipated completion dates 
for the proposed deepwater ports; and
    (3) Any differences in costs of construction and operation of the 
proposed deepwater ports to the extent that such differential may 
significantly affect the ultimate cost of oil to the consumer.


<R05>
Sec. 148.327  Termination of proceeding before approval or denial of an application.

    The Commandant terminates a proceeding if:
    (a) All applications are withdrawn before the decision approving or 
denying them is issued; or

  Appendix A to Part 148--Environmental Review Criteria for Deepwater 
                                  Ports

    I. Authority. The Deepwater Port Act of 1974, Pub. L. 93-627 (33 USC 
1501 et seq.), authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to issue, 
transfer, amend, or renew a license for the ownership, construction, and 
operation of a deepwater port. Section 6 of the Act requires the 
Secretary to establish environmental review criteria which shall be used 
to evaluate a deepwater port as proposed in an application for a 
license. By amendment of Part 1 of Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations 
(49 CFR 1.46(t)), dated April 25, 1975, the Secretary delegated to the 
Commandant of the Coast Guard the responsibility to establish such 
criteria (40 FR 20088-20089). (49 CFR 1.46(t) is presently redesignated 
as 49 CFR 1.46(s) (40 FR 43901-43906)).
    Section 6 of the Act reads as follows:
    Sec. 6. (a) The Secretary, in accordance with the recommendations of 
the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the 
Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and 
after consultation with any other Federal departments and agencies 
having jurisdiction over any aspect of the construction or operation of 
a deepwater port, shall establish, as soon as practicable after the date 
of enactment of this Act, environmental review criteria consistent with 
the National Environmental Policy Act. Such criteria shall be used to 
evaluate a deepwater port as proposed in an application, including:
    (1) the effect on the marine environment;
    (2) the effect on oceanographic currents and wave patterns;
    (3) the effect on alternate uses of the oceans and navigable waters, 
such as scientific study, fishing, and exploitation of other living and 
nonliving resources;
    (4) the potential dangers to a deepwater port from waves, winds, 
weather, and geological conditions, and the steps which can be taken to 
protect against or minimize such dangers;
    (5) effects of land-based developments related to deepwater port 
development;
    (6) the effect on human health and welfare; and
    (7) such other considerations as the Secretary deems necessary or 
appropriate.
    (b) The Secretary shall periodically review and, whenever necessary, 
revise in the same manner as originally developed, criteria established 
pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.
    (c) Criteria established pursuant to this section shall be developed 
concurrently with the regulations in section 5(a) of this Act and in 
accordance with the provisions of that subsection.
    II. Purpose. A. Environmental review criteria shall be used to 
evaluate a deepwater port as proposed in an application for a license to 
own, construct and operate a deepwater port. The criteria shall be 
consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act, Pub. L. 91-190 
(42 USC 4321 et seq.), which declares a national environmental policy. 
The Secretary of Transportation may issue a license in accordance with 
the provisions of the Act if, among other things, he determines:
    --that the construction and operation of the deepwater port will be 
in the national interest and consistent with national security

[[Page 197]]

and other national policy goals and objectives, including energy 
sufficiency and environmental quality; and
    --in accordance with the environmental review criteria established 
pursuant to section 6 of the Act, that the applicant has demonstrated 
that the deepwater port will be constructed and operated using the best 
available technology to prevent or minimize adverse impact on the 
environment. (Sections 4(c)(3) & (5) of the Act.)
    These criteria are therefore intended to be used to evaluate the 
environmental soundness of a proposed deepwater port and to serve as 
basic guidelines for determining what environmental impacts could result 
from deepwater port development and the procedures and technology which 
can be used to prevent or minimize adverse impacts.
    B. In accordance with section 5(f) of the Act, these criteria shall 
also be considered in the preparation of a single, detailed 
environmental impact statement for all timely applications covering a 
single application area. Additionally, section 5(i)(3) of the Act 
specifies that, in the event more than one application is submitted for 
an application area, the criteria shall be used, among other factors, in 
determining whether any one proposed deepwater port clearly best serves 
the national interest.
    III. Environmental review criteria. The environmental review of a 
proposed deepwater port consists of two parts. The first part involves 
assessment of the probable negative and positive environmental impacts 
which will result from construction and operation of the port. The 
second part appriases the effort made by the applicant to prevent or 
minimize adverse environmental effects. Guidelines for such an effort 
are set forth and will be closely considered in the review.
    The overall intent of this review is to arrive at a comprehensive 
evaluation of the significance of the discrete and cumulative 
environmental impacts, adverse and beneficial, of the project as 
proposed and to determine whether or not the applicant has demonstrated 
that the deepwater port will be constructed and operated using the best 
available technology, so as to prevent or minimize adverse impact on the 
marine environment.
    A. The proposed deepwater port will be evaluated to assess the 
magnitude and importance of its probable negative and positive 
environmental impacts. This review will include comparison with 
reasonable alternative actions, such as: the no-action case (alternative 
transportation schemes for imported oil); alternative sites, designs, 
and systems; and other deepwater ports. The information necessary for 
such an evaluation will be provided by the Federal Environmental Impact 
Statement and other sources as necessary. A picture of the relative net 
environmental impact of the proposed project should be obtained. Also, 
identification of actions which might be taken with respect to 
procedures and technology to prevent or minimize probable adverse 
effects will be made. The following are the primary areas of concern:
    1. The Effect on the Marine Environment:
    (Note: The term ``marine environment'' includes the navigable waters 
(including the lands therein and thereunder) and the adjacent shorelines 
(including the waters therein and thereunder); transitional and 
intertidal areas, bays, lagoons, salt marshes, estuaries, beaches, 
waters of the contiguous zone, waters of the high seas; the fish, 
wildlife and other living resources thereof; and the recreational and 
scenic values of such lands, waters and resources.)
    a. The potential effects of surface and bottom disturbances and 
increased turbidity both directly on ecological habitats and on the life 
stages of biological populations and indirectly on such habitats and 
populations through modifications of the physical, geological, and/or 
chemical environment.
    b. The potential effects of pollutants, especially oil, on 
ecological habitats and the life stages of biota.
    c. The potential effects on threatened or endangered species and on 
ecosystems.
    2. The Effect on Oceanographic Currents and Wave Patterns:
    a. The potential primary effects of construction and operation on,
    i. surface, midwater and bottom currents,
    ii. waves,
    iii. tides and tidal currents, especially in constricted coastal 
areas and estuaries,
    iv. ice;
    b. The potential secondary impacts of changes to current and wave 
patterns on sand and sediment transport, turbidity, beach processes, 
salinity and sedimentation rates resulting from changes to current, wave 
and tide patterns; and, the resulting impacts on biological systems, on 
shorelines and beaches, and on their alternate uses.
    3. The Effects on Alternate Uses of the Oceans and Navigable Waters:
    a. Scientific study;
    b. Fishing (commercial and recreational);
    c. Exploitation of other living and non-living resources;
    d. Sanctuary maintenance;
    e. Recreation;
    f. Approved costal zone management plans;
    g. Power generation;
    h. Transportation;
    i. Other commercial, industrial or public uses and the national 
defense.
    4. The Potential Environmental Dangers to a Deepwater Port;
    a. From waves, winds, weather, and geological conditions;
    b. The steps which can be taken to minimize such dangers with 
respect to,
    i. siting,

[[Page 198]]

    ii. design,
    iii. construction,
    iv. operations and procedures.
    5. The Effects of Land-Based Developments Related to Deepwater Port 
Development on:
    a. Stream and river flow, ground and surface water quality and 
supplies;
    b. Marine water quality;
    c. Air quality;
    d. Alternate land and water uses,
    i. wetlands,
    ii. habitats,
    iii. nurseries,
    iv. recreation,
    v. wilderness, preserves, and wild and scenic rivers,
    vi. existing and proposed sanctuaries,
    vii. historical and cultural areas,
    viii. open and green space,
    ix. agricultural and grazing,
    x. residential and commercial,
    xi. industrial,
    xii. transportation,
    xiii. power generation and transmission,
    xiv. others.
    6. The Effect on Human Health and Welfare:
    a. Health:
    i. the physiological effects of reduced or altered air and water 
quality or supply, of altered or increased noise levels or quality, of 
altered community density, etc., and the psychological effects of the 
above;
    ii. the risk of human safety and life posed by a proposed project.
    b. Welfare--the ultimate effects of dynamic economic and social 
change inflicted directly or induced upon the relevant communities, 
including but not limited to the projected changes in employment, 
population density, housing and public services, and tax base.
    B. In this second part, the proposed project will be appraised for 
the effort made to prevent or minimize the probable adverse impacts on 
the environment. This appraisal is primarily concerned with the project 
as proposed and alternatives are relevant only insofar as they may 
represent a spectrum of possible actions against which the proposal will 
be judged. Areas of concern are: siting, design, construction, and 
operation; and, land use and coastal zone management. Specifically, the 
review will consider the degree of adherence to the following 
guidelines.
    1. Siting-- A proposed deepwater port should be sited in an optimum 
location in order to prevent or minimize possibly detrimental 
environmental effects. For example:
    a. The deepwater port and all its components, including receiving 
terminals, inline transportation facilities and stations, ancillary and 
service facilities, and pipeline, should occupy the minimum space 
necessary for safe and efficient operation and should be located, as 
much as possible, in areas in which permanent alteration of wetlands is 
not necessary. Buffer zones should be provided to separate onshore 
facilities from incompatible adjacent land uses.
    b. The deepwater port facility and its offshore components should be 
located in areas which have stable sea-bottom characteristics and, its 
onshore components should be located in areas in which a stable 
foundation can be developed and flood protection levees, if appropriate, 
can be constructed.
    c. The deepwater port facility should be located in an area where 
existing offshore structures and activities will not interfere with its 
safe operation, and where the facility or navigation to and from that 
facility, will not interfere with the safe operation of existing 
offshore structures. Water depths and currents in and around the 
deepwater port and its approaches should pose no undue hazard to safe 
navigation. Extensive dredging or removal of natural obstacles such as 
reefs, should be avoided. The siting procedure should select an area 
where projected weather, wave conditions, and seismic activity minimize 
the probability that damage will occur to the deepwater port, tankers, 
pipeline, and component shoreside facilities from storms, earthquakes, 
or other natural hazards.
    d. Selection of sites should maximize the permitted use of existing 
work areas, facilities and access routes for construction and operations 
activities. Where temporary work areas, facilities, or access routes 
must be used, they should be to the fullest extent possible, designed 
and constructed in such a manner to permit restoration to the 
preconstruction environmental conditions or better.
    e. The deepwater port facility, navigational fairway(s) and 
pipelines should be sited where the interactions of facilities' 
requirements and natural environment are optimized to prevent adverse 
impacts or to produce minimal, acceptably low adverse effects. Key 
factors in assessments should include (but not necessarily be limited 
to) projected winds, waves, current, spill size and frequency, cleanup 
capability, shoreline/estuarine/bay sensitivity; biological resources, 
damage potential and recovery rate; facility design; and project 
economics.
    f. The deepwater port, pipeline, and attendant facilities should be 
located as far as practicable from the vicinity of critical habitats for 
biota, including but not limited to commercial and sports fisheries and 
threatened and endangered species.
    g. Sites should reflect negligible displacement of existing or 
potentially important uses such as the following:
    i. fisheries,
    ii. recreation,
    iii. mining,
    iv. oil and gas production,
    v. transportation.

[[Page 199]]

    h. Siting should favor areas already allocated for similar use and 
the implications of density of such uses.
    i. port facilities--existing tanker and barge traffic--existing 
ports which can be used for service vessels.
    ii. pipelines--use of existing corridors.
    iii. secondary facilities--use of (or expansion of) existing 
storage, refinery, and other support facilities.
    iv. construction facilities--use of existing equipment and personnel 
staging yards.
    i. The deepwater port, pipelines and other offshore facilities 
should be sited so as to not permanently interfere with the natural 
littoral process or to alter significantly any tidal pass or other part 
of the physical environment important to natural currents and wave 
patterns.
    j. Pipelines, or other deepwater port components or facilities 
requiring dredging, should not be located where sediments with high 
levels of heavy metals, biocides, oil, or other pollutants or hazardous 
materials exist.
    2. Design, Construction and Operation-- Selection of design and 
procedures for construction and operation of a deepwater port must 
reflect use of best available technology. For example:
    a. All oil transfer, transportation, and storage facilities, systems 
and equipment should include appropriate safeguards and backup systems 
and/or be operated under procedures to minimize both the possibility of 
pollution incidents resulting from personnel and equipment failures, 
natural calamities and casualties, such as tanker collisions or 
groundings, and the adverse effects of those pollution incidents which 
occur. These facilities, systems, and equipment, should be designed to 
permit safe operation, including appropriate safety margins, under 
maximum operating loads and the most adverse operating conditions to 
which each may be subjected.
    b. All facilities should be provided with a safe, environmentally 
sound method for the collection, storage, and disposal of solid and 
liquid wastes generated by such facilities. When prescribed by law or 
regulation, the deepwater port may be required to be fitted with 
additional facilities for the collection and treatment of ship-generated 
liquid and solid wastes, such as oily bilge and oily ballast water, tank 
cleaning residues, sludge wastes, and sewage and garbage.
    c. The proposed project should be designed, constructed and operated 
so as not to interfere permanently with natural littoral processes or 
other significant aspects of currents and wave patterns. Additionally, 
harmful erosion or accretion, both onshore and offshore, should be 
prevented. Groundwater drawdown or saltwater intrusion should not be 
permitted. Moreover, mixing of salt, brackish, and fresh waters should 
be minimized. Designs should not include factors which will disrupt 
natural sheetflow, water flow, and drainage patterns or systems.
    d. The proposed project should not interfere with biotic 
populations. Potential effects on breeding habitats or migration routes 
should receive particular attention.
    e. The proposed project should be designed, constructed and operated 
so as to make maximum feasible use of already existing local facilities 
such as roads, pipelines, docking facilities and communications 
facilities.
    f. Disposal of spoil and refuse material should be effected only at 
disposal sites specifically selected and approved by competent 
authorities. Whenever and wherever possible, the proposal should provide 
for resource recovery, reclamation of affected areas, or enhancing uses 
of spoil and waste.
    g. Personnel trained in oil spill prevention should be present at 
critical points at the deepwater port (as identified in the accident 
analysis). Personnel should also be trained in oil spill control to 
mitigate the effects of any spill which may occur.
    3. Land Use and Coastal Zone Management-- A deepwater port should 
not conflict with existing or planned land use including management of 
the coastal region. A measure of whether or not conflict exists will be 
made by the following means:
    a. The proposed project should adhere closely to approved master 
plans or other plans of competent local or State authorities in 
designated adjacent coastal States or in other States where significant 
effects are likely to occur. A minimum of special exceptions or zoning 
variances should be required. Non-conforming uses should not be 
prolonged where reasonable alternatives are available.
    b. The proposed project should conform with approved or planned 
coastal zone management programs of the relevant adjacent coastal 
States.
    c. The proposed use of floodplains should not entail loss of 
wetlands nor should such use pose an undue risk of exposure of that use 
to flood damage, increase the potential need for Federal expenditures 
for flood protection or flood disaster relief, decrease the unique 
public value of the floodplain as an environmental resource, or provide 
an incentive for other uses of the floodplains having similar ultimate 
results.
    (d) The use of or effect on wetlands should be considered in the 
following manner,
    i. uses permanently altering or adversely affecting wetlands are to 
be avoided, or
    ii. positive action must be taken to minimize adverse effects on 
wetlands.

                                 annex a

    1. The following environmental criteria are expressly referred to in 
the Deepwater Port Act of 1974:

      Appendix A to Part 150--Deepwater Port Safety Zone Boundaries

    I. Purpose. This appendix contains a general description of the 
deepwater port safety zone designated and developed during the license 
application review process for each deepwater port that has been 
authorized for contruction and operation off the United States 
coastline. Annexes show, to the nearest second of latitude and 
longitude, the geographical boundaries of each resultant safety zone. 
(Shipping safety fairways associated with the Deepwater Ports are 
descibed in Part 166 of this Title.)
    The regulations in Subpart C of this part concerning vessel 
navigation and activities permitted and prohibited at U.S. deepwater 
ports apply only in the safety zone areas and adjacent waters and 
supplement the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at 
Sea.
    II. Authority. Section 10(d) of the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (88 
Stat. 2138 (33 U.S.C. 1509(d))) and Section 4(c) of the Ports and 
Waterways Safety Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1223(c)); 49 CFR 1.46.
    III. General. Deepwater port safety zones are established to promote 
safety of life and property, marine environmental protection and 
navigational safety at any deepwater port and adjacent waters. In a 
deepwater port safety zone no installations, structures, or uses that 
are incompatible with port operations are permitted. The configuration 
of each designated safety zone is depicted on current editions of the 
navigational charts that cover the deepwater port area.
    IV. Modifications. Safety zone boundaries are subject to 
modification as experience is gained in U.S. deepwaters port operations. 
Modifications will be made only after due notification and consideration 
of the views of interested persons.
    V. Geographic coordinates expressed in terms of latitude or 
longitude, or both, are not intended for plotting on maps or charts 
whose referenced horizontal datum is the North American Datum of 1983 
(NAD 83), unless such geographic coordinates are expressly labeled NAD 
83. Geographic coordinates without the NAD 83 reference may be plotted 
on maps or charts referenced to NAD 83 only after application of the 
appropriate corrections that are published on the particular map or 
chart being used.

    (iii) The volume of oily mixtures to be discharged.
    Note: There are Federal, state, or local laws or regulations that 
could require a written description of the oil residues and oily 
mixtures to be discharged. For example, a residue or mixture containing 
oil might have a flashpoint less than 60  deg.C (140  deg.F) and thus 
have the characteristic of ignitability under 40 CFR 261.21, which might 
require a description of the waste for a manifest under 40 CFR Part 262, 
Subpart B. Occupational safety and health concerns may be covered, as 
well as environmental ones.
    The notice required in this section is in addition to those required 
by other Federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Affected

seventh non-mandatory section may be included at the shipowner's 
discretion:
    (1) Introduction. This section must contain the following:
    (i) Introductory text. The introductory text of the plan must 
contain the following language (For ships operating in Antarctica, the 
introductory text of the plan must contain the following language and 
explain that they are in accordance with the Protocol on Environmental 
Protection to the Antarctic Treaty):

    This plan is written in accordance with the requirements of 
Regulation 26 of Annex I of the International Convention for the 
Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 
1978 relating thereto (MARPOL 73/78).
    The purpose of the plan is to provide guidance to the master and 
officers on board the ship with respect to the steps to be taken when a 
pollution incident has occurred or is likely to occur.
    The plan contains all information and operational instructions 
required by the guidelines (Resolution MEPC.54(32)). The appendices 
contain names, telephone numbers, telex numbers, etc. of all contacts 
referenced in the plan, as well as other reference material.
    This plan has been approved by the Coast Guard and, except as 
provided below, no alteration or revision may be made to any part of it 
without the prior approval of the Coast Guard.
    Changes to the seventh section of the plan and the appendices do not 
require approval by the Coast Guard. The appendices must be maintained 
up-to-date by the owners, operators, and managers.

    (ii) General information.

purpose and use of the plan and indicate how the shipboard plan relates 
to other shore-based plans.
    (3) Reporting Requirements. This section of the plan must include 
information relating to the following:
    (i) When to report. A report shall be made whenever an incident 
involves--
    (A) A discharge of oil or oily mixture resulting from damage to the 
ship or its equipment, or for the purpose of securing the safety of a 
ship or saving life at sea;
    (B) A discharge of oil or oily mixture during the operation of the 
ship in excess of the quantities or instantaneous rate permitted in 
Sec. 151.10 of this subpart or in Sec. 157.37 of this subchapter; or
    (C) A probable discharge. Factors to be considered in determining 
whether a discharge is probable include, but are not limited to: ship 
location and proximity to land or other navigational hazards, weather, 
tide, current, sea state, and traffic density. The master must make a 
report in cases of collision, grounding, fire, explosion, structural 
failure, flooding or cargo shifting, or an incident resulting in failure 
or breakdown of steering gear, propulsion, electrical generating system, 
or essential shipborne navigational aids.
    (ii) Information required. This section of the plan must include a 
notification form, such as that depicted in Table 151.26(b)(3)(ii)(A), 
that contains information to be provided in the initial and follow-up 
notifications. The initial notification should include as much of the 
information on the form as possible, and supplemental information, as

included. These procedures must take into account the effect of 
corrective actions on hull stress and stability.
    (ii) Spills resulting from casualties: Each of the casualties listed 
below must be treated in the plan as a separate section comprised of 
various checklists or other means which will ensure that the master 
considers all appropriate factors when addressing the specific casualty. 
These checklists must be tailored to the specific ship. In addition to 
the checklists, specific personnel assignments for anticipated tasks 
must be identified. Reference to existing fire control plans and muster 
lists is sufficient to identify personnel responsibilities in the 
following situations:
    (A) Grounding;
    (B) Fire or explosion;
    (C) Collision;
    (D) Hull failure; and

strength assessments, or contacting classification societies to acquire 
such information. Nothing in this section shall be construed as creating 
a requirement for damage stability plans or calculations beyond those 
required by law or regulation; and
    (C) Lightening procedures to be followed in cases of extensive 
structural damage. The plan must contain information on procedures to be 
followed for ship-to-ship transfer of cargo. Reference may be made in 
the plan to existing company guides. A copy of such company procedures 
for ship-to-ship transfer operations must be kept in the plan. The plan 
must address the coordination of this activity with the coastal or port 
state, as appropriate.
    (5) National and Local Coordination. (i) This section of the plan 
must contain information to assist the master in initiating action by 
the coastal State, local government, or other involved parties. This 
information must include guidance to assist the master with organizing a 
response to the incident should a response not be organized by the shore 
authorities. Detailed information for specific areas may be included as 
appendices to the plan.
    (ii) For Antarctica, a vessel owner or operator must include a plan 
for prompt and effective response action to such emergencies as might 
arise in the performance of its vessel's activities.
    (iii) To comply with paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, an agency 
of the United States government may promulgate a directive providing for 
prompt and effective response by the agency's public vessels operating 
in Antarctica.

              Subpart F--Response Plans for Oil Facilities

    Source: CGD 91-036, 61 FR 7917, Feb. 29, 1996, unless otherwise 
noted.


<R05>
Sec. 154.1010  Purpose.

    This subpart establishes oil spill response plan requirements for 
all marine transportation-related (MTR) facilities (hereafter also 
referred to as facilities) that could reasonably be expected to cause 
substantial harm or significant and substantial harm to the environment 
by discharing oil into or on the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, 
or exclusive economic zone. The development of a response plan prepares 
the facility owner or operator to respond to an oil spill. These 
requirements specify criteria to be used during the planning process to 
determine the appropriate response resources. The specific criteria for 
response resources and their arrival times are not performance 
standards. The criteria are based on a set of assumptions that may not 
exist during an actual oil spill incident.


<R05>
Sec. 154.1015  Applicability.

    (a) This subpart applies to all MTR facilities that because of their 
location could reasonably be expected to cause at least substantial harm 
to the environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters, 
adjoining shorelines, or exclusive economic zone.
    (b) The following MTR facilities that handle, store, or transport 
oil, in bulk, could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to 
the environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters or 
adjoining shorelines and are classified as substantial harm MTR 
facilities:
    (1) Fixed MTR onshore facilities capable of transferring oil to or 
from a vessel with a capacity of 250 barrels or more and deepwater 
ports;
    (2) Mobile MTR facilities used or intended to be used to transfer 
oil to or from a vessel with a capacity of 250 barrels or more; and
    (3) Those MTR facilities specifically designated as substantial harm 
facilities by the COTP under Sec. 154.1016.
    (c) The following MTR facilities that handle, store, or transport 
oil in bulk could not only reasonably be expected to cause substantial 
harm, but also significant and substantial harm, to the environment by 
discharging oil into or on the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, 
or exclusive economic zone and are classified as significant and 
substantial harm MTR facilities:
    (1) Deepwater ports, and fixed MTR onshore facilities capable of 
transferring oil to or from a vessel with a capacity of 250 barrels or 
more except for facilities that are part of a non-transportation-related 
fixed onshore facility with a storage capacity of less than 42,000 
gallons; and
    (2) Those MTR facilities specifically designated as significant and 
substantial harm facilities by the COTP under Sec. 154.1016.
    (d) An MTR facility owner or operator who believes the facility is 
improperly classified may request review and reclassification in 
accordance with Sec. 154.1075.

[[Page 321]]


<R05>
Sec. 154.1016  Facility classification by COTP.

    (a) The COTP may upgrade the classification of:
    (1) An MTR facility not specified in Sec. 154.1015 (b) or (c) to a 
facility that could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to 
the environment; or
    (2) An MTR facility specified in Sec. 154.1015(b) to a facility that 
could reasonably be expected to cause significant and substantial harm 
to the environment.
    (b) The COTP may downgrade, the classification of:
    (1) An MTR facility specified in Sec. 154.1015(c) to a facility that 
could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the 
environment; or
    (2) An MTR facility specified in Sec. 154.1015(b) to a facility that 
could not reasonably be expected to cause substantial, or significant 
and substantial harm to the environment.
    (3) The COTP will consider downgrading an MTR facility's 
classification only upon receiving a written request for a downgrade of 
classification from the facility's owner or operator.
    (c) When changing a facility classification the COTP may, as 
appropriate, consider all relevant factors including, but not limited 
to: Type and quantity of oils handled in bulk; facility spill history; 
age of facility; proximity to public and commercial water supply 
intakes; proximity to navigable waters based on the definition of 
navigable waters in 33 CFR 2.05-25; and proximity to fish and wildlife 
and sensitive environments.

    (b) For the MTR segment of a facility, not less than--
    (1) Where applicable, the loss of the entire capacity of all in-line 
and break out tank(s) needed for the continuous operation of the 
pipelines used for the purposes of handling or transporting oil, in 
bulk, to or from a vessel regardless of the presence of secondary 
containment; plus
    (2) The discharge from all piping carrying oil between the marine 
transfer manifold and the non-transportation-related portion of the 
facility. The discharge from each pipe is calculated as follows: The 
maximum time to discover the release from the pipe in hours, plus the 
maximum time to shut down flow from the pipe in hours (based on historic 
discharge data or the best estimate in the absence of historic discharge 
data for the facility) multiplied by the maximum flow rate expressed in 
barrels per hour (based on the maximum relief valve setting or maximum 
system pressure when relief valves are not provided) plus the total line 
drainage volume expressed in barrels for the pipe between the marine 
manifold and the non-transportation-related portion of the facility; and
    (c) For a mobile facility it means the loss of the entire contents 
of the container in which the oil is stored or transported.

Sec. 154.1040  Specific requirements for facilities that could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the environment.

    (a) The owner or operator of a facility that, under Sec. 154.1015, 
could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the 
environment, shall submit a response plan that meets the requirements of 
Sec. 154.1035, except as modified by this section.
    (b) The facility's response activities section of the response plan 
need not list the facility or corporate organizational structure that 
will be used to manage the response, as required by 
Sec. 154.1035(b)(3)(iii).
    (c) The owner or operator of a facility must ensure the availability 
of response resources required to be identified in 
Sec. 154.1035(b)(3)(iv) by contract or other approved means described in 
Sec. 154.1028.
    (d) A facility owner or operator must have at least 200 feet of 
containment boom and the means of deploying and anchoring the boom 
available at the spill site within 1 hour of the detection of a spill to 
respond to the average most probable discharge in lieu of the quantity

Sec. 154.1045  Response plan development and evaluation criteria for facilities that handle, store, or transport Group I through Group IV petroleum oils.

    (a) The owner or operator of a facility that handles, stores, or 
transports Group I through Group IV petroleum oils shall use the 
criteria in this section to evaluate response resources identified in 
the response plan for the specified operating environment.
    (1) The criteria in Table 1 of appendix C of this part are to be 
used solely for identification of appropriate equipment in a response 
plan. These criteria reflect conditions used for planning purposes to 
select mechanical response equipment and are not conditions that would 
limit response actions or affect normal facility operations.
    (2) The response resources must be evaluated considering limitations 
for the COTP zones in which the facility operates, including but not 
limited to--
    (i) Ice conditions;
    (ii) Debris;
    (iii) Temperature ranges;
    (iv) Weather-related visibility; and
    (v) Other appropriate environmental conditions as determined by the 
COTP.
    (3) The COTP may reclassify a specific body of water or location 
within the COTP zone. Any reclassifications will be identified by the 
COTP in the applicable ACP. Reclassifications may be to--
    (i) A more stringent operating environment if the prevailing wave 
conditions exceed the significant wave height criteria during more than 
35 percent of the year; or
    (ii) A less stringent operating environment if the prevailing wave 
conditions do not exceed the significant wave height criteria for the 
less stringent operating environment during more than 35 percent of the 
year.
    (b) Response equipment must--
    (1) Meet or exceed the operating criteria listed in Table 1 of 
appendix C of this part;
    (2) Function in the applicable operating environment; and
    (3) Be appropriate for the petroleum oil carried.
    (c) The response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or 
transports Group I through Group IV petroleum oils must identify 
response resources that are available, by contract or other approved 
means as described in Sec. 154.1028(a)(1)(4), to respond to the 
facility's average most probable discharge. The response resources must 
include, at a minimum--
    (1) 1,000 feet of containment boom or two times the length of the 
largest vessel that regularly conducts petroleum oil transfers to or 
from the facility, whichever is greater, and the means of deploying and 
anchoring the boom available at the spill site within 1 hour of the 
detection of a spill; and
    (2) Oil recovery devices and recovered oil storage capacity capable 
of being at the spill site within 2 hours of the discovery of a 
petroleum oil discharge from a facility.
    (d) The response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or 
transports Group I through Group IV petroleum oils must identify 
response resources that are available, by contract or other approved 
means as described in Sec. 154.1028(a)(1)(4), to respond to a discharge 
up to the facility's maximum most probable discharge volume.
    (1) The response resources must include sufficient containment boom, 
oil recovery devices, and storage capacity for any recovery of up to the 
maximum most probable discharge planning volume, as contained in 
appendix C.
    (2) The response resources must be appropriate for each group of 
petroleum oil identified in Sec. 154.1020 that is handled, stored, or 
transported by the facility.
    (3) These response resources must be positioned such that they can 
arrive at the scene of a discharge within the following specified times:
    (i) The equipment identified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this 
section or in Sec. 154.1040(d) must arrive within the times specified in 
those paragraphs or that section, as appropriate.

resources must be capable of arriving on scene within 6 hours of the 
discovery of an petroleum oil discharge from a facility.
    (iii) In all other locations, response resources must be capable of 
arriving on scene within 12 hours of the discovery of a petroleum oil 
discharge from a facility.

[[Page 334]]

    (4) The COTP may determine that mobilizing response resources to an 
area beyond the response times indicated in this paragraph invalidates 
the response plan. In this event, the COTP may impose additional 
operational restrictions (e.g., limitations on the number of transfers 
at a facility), or, at the COTP's discretion, the facility may operate 
with temporarily modified response plan development and evaluation 
criteria (e.g., modified response times, alternate response resources, 
etc.).
    (e) The response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or 
transports Group I through Group IV petroleum oils must identify the 
response resources that are available, by contract or other approved 
means as described in Sec. 154.1028(a)(1)(4), to respond to the worst 
case discharge volume of petroleum oil to the maximum extent 
practicable.
    (1) The location of these response resources must be suitable to 
meet the response times identified in paragraph (f) of this section for 
the applicable geographic area(s) of operation and response tier.
    (2) The response resources must be appropriate for--
    (i) The volume of the facility's worst case discharge;
    (ii) Group(s) of petroleum oil as identified in Sec. 154.1020 that 
are handled, stored, or transported by the facility; and
    (iii) The geographic area(s) in which the facility operates.
    (3) The response resources must include sufficient boom, oil 
recovery devices, and storage capacity to recover the worst case 
discharge planning volumes.
    (4) The guidelines in appendix C of this part must be used for 
calculating the quantity of response resources required to respond at 
each tier to the worst case discharge to the maximum extent practicable.
    (5) When determining response resources necessary to meet the 
requirements of this section, a portion of those resources must be 
capable of use in close-to-shore response activities in shallow water. 
The following percentages of the response equipment identified for the 
applicable geographic area must be capable of operating in waters of 6 
feet or less depth.
    (i) Offshore--10 percent.
    (ii) Nearshore/inland/Great Lakes/rivers and canals--20 percent.
    (6) The COTP may determine that mobilizing response resources to an 
area beyond the response times indicated in this paragraph invalidates 
the response plan. In this event, the COTP may impose additional 
operational restrictions (e.g., limitations on the number of transfers 
at a facility), or, at the COTP's discretion, the facility may be 
permitted to operate with temporarily modified response plan development 
and evaluation criteria (e.g., modified response times, alternate 
response resources, etc.).
    (f) Response equipment identified in a response plan for a facility 
that handles, stores, or transports Group I through Group IV petroleum 
oils must be capable of arriving on scene within the times specified in 
this paragraph for the applicable response tier in a higher volume port 
area, Great Lakes, and in other areas. Response times for these tiers 
from the time of discovery of a discharge are--

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                Tier 1   Tier 2   Tier 3
                                                (hrs.)   (hrs.)   (hrs.)

All other river and canal, inland, nearshore,       12       36       60
 and offshore areas..........................
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (g) For the purposes of arranging for response resources for a 
facility that handles, stores, or transports Group I through Group IV 
petroleum oils, by contract or other approved means as described in 
Sec. 154.1028(a)(1)-(4), response equipment identified for Tier 1 plan 
credit must be capable of being mobilized and en route to the scene of a 
discharge within 2 hours of notification. The notification procedures 
identified in the plan must provide for notification and authorization 
of mobilization of identified Tier 1 response resources--
    (1) Either directly or through the qualified individual; and
    (2) Within 30 minutes of a discovery of a discharge or substantial 
threat of discharge.

[[Page 335]]

    (h) Response resources identified for Tier 2 and Tier 3 plan credit 
must be capable of arriving on scene within the time specified for the 
applicable tier.
    (i) The response plan for a facility that is located in any 
environment with year-round preapproval for use of dispersants and that 
handles, stores, or transports Group II or III persistent petroleum oils 
may request a credit for up to 25 percent of the on-water recovery 
capability set forth by this part. To receive this credit, the facility 
owner or operator must identify in the plan and ensure, by contract or 
other approved means as described in Sec. 154.1028(a)(1)-(4), the 
availability of specified resources to apply the dispersants and to 
monitor their effectiveness. The extent of the credit will be based on 
the volumes of the dispersant available to sustain operations at the 
manufacturers' recommend dosage rates. Resources identified for plan 
credit should be capable of being on scene within 12 hours of a 
discovery of a discharge. Identification of these resources does not 
imply that they will be authorized for use. Actual authorization for use 
during a spill response will be governed by the provisions of the NCP 
and the applicable ACP.
    (j) A response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or 
transports Group I through Group IV petroleum oils must identify 
response resources with firefighting capability. The owner or operator 
of a facility that does not have adequate firefighting resources located 
at the facility or that can not rely on sufficient local firefighting 
resources must identify and ensure, by contract or other approved means 
as described in Sec. 154.1028(a)(1)-(4), the availability of adequate 
firefighting resources. The response plan must also identify an 
individual located at the facility to work with the fire department for 
petroleum oil fires. This individual shall also verify that sufficient 
well-trained firefighting resources are available within a reasonable 
time to respond to a worst case discharge. The individual may be the 
qualified individual as defined in Sec. 154.1020 and identified in the 
response plan or another appropriate individual located at the facility.
    (k) The response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or 
transports Groups I through IV petroleum oils must identify equipment 
and required personnel available, by contract or other approved means as 
described in Sec. 154.1028(a) (1)-(4), to protect fish and wildlife and 
sensitive environments.
    (1) Except as set out in paragraph (k)(2) of this section, the 
identified response resources must include the quantities of boom 
sufficient to protect fish and wildlife and sensitive environments as 
required by Sec. 154.1035(b)(4).
    (2) The resources and response methods identified in a facility 
response plan must be consistent with the required resources and 
response methods to be used in fish and wildlife and sensitive 
environments, contained in the appropriate ACP. Facility owners or 
operators shall ensure that their response plans are in accordance with 
the ACP in effect 6 months prior to initial plan submission or the 
annual plan review required under Sec. 154.1065(a). Facility owners or 
operators are not required to, but may at their option, conform to an 
ACP which is less than 6 months old at the time of plan submission.
    (l) The response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or 
transports Groups I through IV petroleum oils must identify an oil spill 
removal organization(s) with response resources that are available, by 
contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 154.1028(a) (1)-
(4), to effect a shoreline cleanup operation commensurate with the 
quantity of emulsified petroleum oil to be planned for in shoreline 
cleanup operations.
    (1) Except as required in paragraph (l)(2) of this section, the 
shoreline cleanup response resources required must be determined as 
described in appendix C of this part.
    (2) The resources and response methods identified in a facility 
response plan must be consistent with the required shoreline cleanup 
resources and methods contained in the appropriate ACP. Facility owners 
or operators shall ensure that their response plans are in accordance 
with the ACP in effect 6 months prior to initial plan submission or the 
annual plan review required under Sec. 154.1065(a). Facility owners or 
operators are not required to, but may at their option, conform to an

[[Page 336]]

ACP which is less than 6 months old at the time of plan submission.
    (m) Appendix C of this part describes the procedures to determine 
the maximum extent practicable quantity of response resources that must 
be identified and available, by contract or other approved means as 
described in Sec. 154.1028(a) (1)-(4), for the maximum most probable 
discharge volume, and for each worst case discharge response tier.
    (1) Included in appendix C of this part is a cap that recognizes the 
practical and technical limits of response capabilities that an 
individual facility owner or operator can be expected to contract for in 
advance.
    (2) Table 5 in appendix C of this part lists the caps that apply in 
February 18, 1993, and February 18, 1998. Depending on the quantity and 
type of petroleum oil handled by the facility and the facility's 
geographic area of operations, the resource capability caps in this 
table may be reached. The owner or operator of a facility whose 
estimated recovery capacity exceeds the applicable contracting caps in 
Table 5 shall identify sources of additional equipment equal to twice 
the cap listed in Tiers 1, 2, and 3 or the amount necessary to reach the 
calculated planning volume, whichever is lower. The identified resources 
must be capable of arriving on scene not later than the Tier 1, 2, and 3 
response times in this section. No contract is required. While general 
listings of available response equipment may be used to identify 
additional sources, a response plan must identify the specific sources, 
locations, and quantities of equipment that a facility owner or operator 
has considered in his or her planning. When listing Coast Guard 
classified oil spill removal organization(s) which have sufficient 
removal capacity to recover the volume above the response capability cap 
for the specific facility, as specified in Table 5 in appendix C of this 
part, it is not necessary to list specific quantities of equipment.
    (n) The Coast Guard will initiate a review of cap increases and 
other requirements contained within this subpart that are scheduled to 
be phased in over time. Any changes in the requirements of this section 
will occur through a public notice and comment process.
    (1) During this review, the Coast Guard will determine if the 
scheduled increase for February 1998 remains practicable, and will also 
establish a specific cap for 2003. The review will include but is not 
limited to--
    (i) Increase in skimming efficiencies and design technology;
    (ii) Oil tracking technology;
    (iii) High rate response techniques;
    (iv) Other applicable response technologies; and
    (v) Increases in the availability of private response resources.
    (2) All scheduled future requirements will take effect unless the 
Coast Guard determines that they are not practicable. Scheduled changes 
will be effective in February 1998 and 2003 unless the review of the 
additional requirements has not been completed by the Coast Guard. If 
this occurs, the additional requirements will not be effective until 90 
days after publication of a Federal Register notice with the results of 
the review.

not have adequate firefighting resources located at the facility or that 
can not rely on sufficient local firefighting resources must identity 
and ensure, by contract or other approved means as described in 
Sec. 154.1028, the availability of adequate firefighting resources. The 
response plan must also identify an individual located at the facility 
to work with the fire department for petroleum oil fires. This 
individual shall also verify that sufficient well-trained firefighting 
resources are available within a reasonable response time to a worst 
case scenario. The individual may be the qualified individual as defined 
in Sec. 154.1020 and identified in the response plan or another 
appropriate individual located at the facility.

Sec. 154.1050  Training.

    (a) A response plan submitted to meet the requirements of 
Secs. 154.1035 or 154.1040, as appropriate, must identify the training 
to be provided to each individual with responsibilities under the plan. 
A facility owner or operator must identify the method to be used for 
training any volunteers or casual laborers used during a response to 
comply with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.120.
    (b) A facility owner or operator shall ensure the maintenance of 
records sufficient to document training of facility personnel; and shall 
make them available for inspection upon request by the U.S. Coast Guard. 
Records for facility personnel must be maintained at the facility for 3 
years.
    (c) Where applicable, a facility owner or operator shall ensure that 
an oil spill removal organization identified in a response plan to meet 
the requirements of this subpart maintains records sufficient to 
document training for the organization's personnel and shall make them 
available for inspection upon request by the facility's management 
personnel, the qualified individual, and U.S. Coast Guard. Records must 
be maintained for 3 years following completion of training.
    (d) The facility owner or operator remains responsible for ensuring 
that all private response personnel are trained to meet the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards for emergency response 
operations in 29 CFR 1910.120.


<R05>

(c) of this section must be capable of commencing an effective on-scene 
response within the times specified in this paragraph for the applicable 
operating area:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                    Tier 1   Tier   Tier
                                                    (hrs.)    2      3

All other river and canal, inland, nearshore, and       12    N/A    N/A
 offshore areas...................................
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) A response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or 
transports other non-petroleum oils must identify response resources 
with firefighting capability. The owner or operator of a facility that 
does not have adequate firefighting resources located at the facility or 
that cannot rely on sufficient local firefighting resources must 
identify and ensure, by contract or other approved means as described in 
Sec. 154.1028(a), the availability of adequate firefighting resources. 
The response plan must also identify an individual located at the 
facility to work with the fire department on other non-petroleum oil 
fires. This individual shall also verify that sufficient well-trained 
firefighting resources are available within a reasonable response time 
to a worst case scenario. The individual may be the qualified individual 
as defined in Sec. 154.1020 and identified in the response plan or 
another appropriate individual located at the facility.
    (f) The response plan for a facility that is located in any 
environment with year-round preapproval for use of dispersants and that 
handles, stores, or transports other non-petroleum oils may request a 
credit for up to 25 percent of the worst case planning volume set forth 
by subpart F of this part. To receive this credit, the facility owner or 
operator must identify in the plan and ensure, by contract or other 
approved means as described in Sec. 154.1028(a), the availability of 
specified resources to apply the dispersants and to monitor their 
effectiveness. The extent of the credit will be based on the volumes of 
the dispersant available to sustain operations at the manufacturers' 
recommended dosage rates. Identification of these resources does not 
imply that they will be authorized for use. Actual authorization for use 
during a spill response will be governed by the provisions of the NCP 
and the applicable ACP.

    Appendix A to Part 154--Guidelines for Detonation Flame Arresters

    This appendix contains the draft ASTM standard for detonation flame 
arresters. Devices meeting this standard will be accepted by the 
Commandant (G-MSO).

    1. Scope
    1.1  This standard provides the minimum requirements for design, 
construction, performance and testing of detonation flame arresters.
    2. Intent
    2.1  This standard is intended for detonation flame arresters 
protecting systems containing vapors of flammable or combustible liquids 
where vapor temperatures do not exceed 60  deg.C. For all tests, the 
test media defined in 14.1.1 can be used except where detonation flame 
arresters protect systems handling vapors with a maximum experimental 
safe gap (MESG) below 0.9 millimeters. Detonation flame arresters 
protecting such systems must be tested with appropriate media (the same 
vapor or a media having a MESG no greater than the vapor). Various gases 
and their respective MESG are listed in attachment 1.
    2.2  The tests in this standard are intended to qualify detonation 
flame arresters for all in-line applications independent of piping 
configuration provided the operating pressure is equal to or less than 
the maximum operating pressure limit specified in the manufacturer's 
certification and the diameter of the piping system in which the 
detonation arrester is to be installed is equal to or less than the 
piping diameter used in the testing.
    Note: Detonation flame arresters meeting this standard as Type I 
devices, which are certified to be effective below 0  deg.C and which 
can sustain three stable detonations without being damaged or 
permanently deformed, also comply with the minimum requirements of the 
International Maritime Organization, Maritime Safety Committee Circular 
No. 373 (MSC/Circ. 373/Rev.1).

    4. Terminology
    4.1  [Delta] P/P<INF>o</INF>--The dimensionless ratio, for any 
deflagration and detonation test of 14.3, of the maximum pressure 
increase (the maximum pressure minus the initial pressure), as measured 
in the piping system on the side of the arrester where ignition begins 
by the device described in paragraph 14.3.3, to the initial absolute 
pressure in the piping system. The initial pressure should be greater 
than or equal to the maximum operating pressure specified in paragraph 
11.1.7.
    4.2  Deflagration--A combustion wave that propagates subsonically 
(as measured at the pressure and temperature of the flame front) by the 
transfer of heat and active chemical species to the unburned gas ahead 
of the flame front.
    4.3  Detonation--A reaction in a combustion wave propagating at 
sonic or supersonic (as measured at the pressure and temperature of the 
flame front) velocity. A detonation is stable when it has a velocity 
equal to the speed of sound in the burnt gas or may be unstable 
(overdriven) with a higher velocity and pressure.
    4.4  Detonation flame arrester--A device which prevents the 
transmission of a detonation and a deflagration.
    4.5  Flame speed--The speed at which a flame propagates along a pipe 
or other system.
    4.6  Flame Passage--The transmission of a flame through a device.
    4.7  Gasoline Vapors--A non-leaded petroleum distillate consisting 
essentially of aliphatic hydrocarbon compounds with a boiling range 
approximating 65  deg.C/75  deg.C.
    5. Classification
    5.1  The two types of detonation flame arresters covered in this 
specification are classified as follows:
    5.1.1  Type I--Detonation flame arresters acceptable for 
applications where stationary flames may rest on the device.
    5.1.2  Type II--Detonation flame arresters acceptable for 
applications where stationary flames are unlikely to rest on the device, 
and further methods are provided to prevent flame passage when a 
stationary flame occurs. One example of ``further methods'' is a 
temperature monitor and an automatic shutoff valve.

change of model for the purpose of this paragraph.
    9.2.1  The detonation flame arrester shall have the same dimensions, 
configuration, and most unfavorable clearances expected in production 
units.
    9.2.2  A corrosion test shall be conducted. In this test, a complete 
detonation flame arrester, including a section of pipe similar to that 
to which it will be fitted, shall be exposed to a 20% sodium chloride 
solution spray at a temperature of 25  deg.C for a period of 240 hours, 
and allowed to dry for 48 hours. Following this exposure, all movable 
parts shall operate properly and there shall be no corrosion deposits 
which cannot be washed off.

hydrostatic pressure test of

[[Page 350]]

at least 350 psig for ten minutes without rupturing, leaking, or showing 
permanent distortion.

unit tested in accordance with this standard.
    13.2  The detonation flame arrester manufacturer shall maintain the 
quality of the arresters that are designed, tested and marked in 
accordance with this standard. At no time shall a detonation flame 
arrester be sold with this standard designation that does not meet the 
requirements herein.
    14. Test Procedures for Detonation Arresters
    14.1  Media/Air Mixtures
    14.1.1  For vapors from flammable or combustible liquids with a MESG 
greater than or equal to 0.9 mm, technical grade hexane or gasoline 
vapors shall be used for all tests in this section except technical 
grade propane may be used for the deflagration/detonation tests in 
section 14.3. For vapors with a MESG less than 0.9 mm, the specific 
vapor (or alternatively, a media with a MESG less than or equal to the 
MESG of the vapor) must be used as the test medium in all Section 14 
tests.
    14.1.2  Hexane, propane, gasoline and other test vapors shall be 
mixed with air to form the most easily ignitable mixture. (5)
    14.2  Endurance Burn Test Procedure
    14.2.1  An endurance burning test shall be carried out as follows:
    14.2.1.1  The test rig shall consist of an apparatus producing an 
explosive mixture, a small tank with a diaphragm, a prototype of the 
detonation flame arrester and a firing source in close proximity to the 
test device

[[Page 351]]

(see Figure 1). The detonation flame arrester shall be installed so that 
the mixture emission is vertically upwards, or installed in the position 
for which it is designed and which will cause the most severe heating of 
the device under the prescribed endurance burn conditions. In this 
position the mixture shall be ignited.
    14.2.1.2  Endurance burn test shall start by using the most easily 
ignitable test vapor/air mixture with the aid of a pilot flame or a 
spark igniter at the outlet. The flammable mixture may be reignited as 
necessary in the course of the endurance burn.
    14.2.1.3  Temperature measurement will be performed on the surface 
of the arrester element half way between the center and its edge.
    14.2.1.4  By varying the proportions of the flammable mixture and 
the flow rate, the detonation flame arrester shall be heated by a stable 
flame on the surface of the arrester until the highest obtainable 
temperature is reached on the ignited side or until the temperature on 
the side which was not ignited (protected side) rises 100  deg.C.
    14.2.1.5  The flammable mixture proportions will then be varied 
again until the conditions which result in the highest temperature on 
the protected side are achieved. This temperature shall be maintained 
for a period of ten minutes, after which the flow shall be stopped and 
the conditions observed. The highest attainable temperature is 
considered to have been reached when any subsequent rise of temperature 
does not exceed 0.5  deg.C per minute over a ten minute period.
    14.2.1.6  If difficulty arises in establishing the highest 
attainable temperature on the protected side, the following criteria 
shall apply. When the increase in temperature on the protected side 
occurs so slowly that its temperature does not rise 100  deg.C, the 
conditions which produced the highest temperature on the ignited side of 
the arrester will be maintained for two hours. For the condition in 
which the temperature on the protected side continues to rise at a rate 
in excess of 0.5  deg.C per minute for a 10 minute period, endurance 
burning shall be continued, using the most severe conditions of 
flammable mixtures and flow rate, for a period of two hours. In either 
of these cases, at the end of the two hour period, the flow shall be 
stopped and the conditions observed. The two hour interval shall be 
measured commencing with the setting of the conditions which produced 
the most severe conditions of mixture and flow rate. For Type I 
detonation flame arresters, flame passage shall not occur during this 
test. For Type II detonation flame arresters, the maximum temperature 
obtained, and the time elapsed from the time when the most severe 
conditions are set to when flame passage occurs, shall be recorded. 
However, for Type II detonation flame arresters the test may be 
terminated 15 minutes after setting the most severe conditions on the 
protected side.
    14.3  Deflagration/Detonation Test Procedure
    14.3.1  A detonation flame arrester shall be installed at one end of 
a pipe of the same diameter as the inlet of the detonation flame 
arrester (see Figure 2). The length and configuration of the test pipe 
shall develop a stable detonation (6) at the device and shall be 
capable, by change in its length or configuration, of developing 
deflagrations and unstable (overdriven) detonations as measured on the 
side of the pipe where ignition occurs (run-up side). For deflagration 
testing, two test piping arrangements shall be used on the outlet side 
of the detonation flame arrester (the side which is not ignited). In 
both of the following end arrangements, the outlet side pipe diameter 
shall be equal to that on the run-up side. In one arrangement, the 
outlet side pipe shall be at least 10 pipe diameters long with a plastic 
bag over the free end. (Alternate end of pipe closures are also 
acceptable provided they easily give way during the course of the test, 
and the closure allows the required gas concentration to be maintained 
throughout the test piping arrangement.) In the other arrangement the 
outlet side pipe shall be fitted with a restriction located 0.6 meters 
from the outlet side arrester flange. The size of the restriction for 
each nominal size detonation flame arrester shall be as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Nominal pipe diameter (inches)       Restriction diameter (inches)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 3                                  \1/2\
                 4                                  \1/2\
                 6                                    1
                 8                                  1\1/2\
                 10                                 1\1/2\
                 12                                   2
                 18                                   2
                 24                                   2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The entire pipe shall be filled with the most easily ignitable vapor/air 
mixture to a test pressure corresponding to or greater than the upper 
limit of the device's maximum operating pressure (see 11.1.7). In order 
to obtain this test pressure, a device such as a bursting disc may be 
fitted on the open end of the device in place of the plastic bag. The 
concentration of the mixture should be verified by appropriate testing 
of the gas composition. The vapor/air mixture shall then be ignited.
    14.3.2  Flame speeds shall be measured by optical devices capable of 
providing accuracy of +/- 5%. These devices shall be situated no more 
than a distance equal to 3% of the length of the run-up pipe apart with 
one device no more than 8 inches from the end of the test pipe to which 
the detonation flame arrester is attached. In addition, each outlet 
arrangement described in paragraph 14.3.1 shall be fitted with an 
optical device located

[[Page 352]]

no more than 8 inches from the detonation flame arrester outlet. (7)
    14.3.3  Explosion pressures within the pipe shall be measured by a 
high frequency transducer situated in the test pipe no more than 8 
inches from the run-up side of the housing of the detonation flame 
arrester.
    14.3.4  Using the first end arrangement (10 pipe diameter outlet) 
described in paragraph 14.3.1, a series of tests shall be conducted to 
determine the test pipe length and configuration that results in the 
maximum unstable (overdriven) detonation having the maximum measured 
flame speed at the detonation flame arrester. (These tests may also be 
carried out using a single length of pipe with igniters spaced at 
varying distances from the arrester.) The flame speeds, explosion 
pressures and test pipe configurations shall be recorded for each of 
these tests. The piping configuration that resulted in the highest 
recorded unstable (overdriven) detonation flame speed shall be used, and 
the device shall be subjected to at least four additional unstable 
(overdriven) detonations. In the course of testing, the device shall 
also demonstrate its ability to withstand five stable detonations, five 
deflagrations (as determined by flame speed) where [Delta] P/
P<INF>o</INF> was less than 1 and five deflagrations (as determined by 
flame speed) where [Delta] P/P<INF>o</INF> was greater than 1 but less 
than 10. Initiation of deflagrations shall be at several locations to 
generate a range for [Delta] P/P<INF>o</INF>. Deflagration tests using 
the restricted outlet arrangement described in paragraph 14.3.1 shall 
then be conducted. In these tests the device shall demonstrate its 
ability to stop five deflagrations (as determined by flame speed) 
generated by the same configurations which resulted in [Delta] P/
P<INF>o</INF> being less than 1 during the deflagration tests which were 
conducted without the restricted end arrangements, and five 
deflagrations (as determined by flame speed) generated by the same 
configurations which resulted in [Delta] P/P<INF>o</INF> being greater 
than 1 but less than 10 during the deflagration tests which were 
conducted without the restricted end arrangements. No evidence of flame 
passage shall occur during these tests. The flame speeds and explosion 
pressures for each of these tests shall be recorded.
    14.3.5  A device that successfully passes the tests of 14.3.4 shall 
be considered to be directional (suitable for arresting a detonation 
advancing only from the direction as tested) except;
    14.3.5.1  A device may be tested according to 14.3.4 for detonations 
approaching from either direction, or
    14.3.5.2  The design of the device is symmetrical where each end may 
be considered to be identical when approached by a detonation from 
either direction.

   Appendix B to Part 154--Standard Specification for Tank Vent Flame 
                                Arresters

    1. Scope
    1.1  This standard provides the minimum requirements for design, 
construction, performance and testing of tank vent flame arresters.
    2. Intent
    2.1  This standard is intended for flame arresters protecting 
systems containing vapors of flammable or combustible liquids with a 
flashpoint that does not exceed 60  deg.C. The test media defined in 
14.1.1 can be used except where arresters protect systems handling 
vapors with a maximum experimental safe gap (MESG) below 0.9 
millimeters. Flame arresters protecting such systems must be tested with 
appropriate media (the same vapor or a media having a MESG no greater 
than the vapor). Various gases and their respective MESG are listed in 
Attachment 1.

    Note: Flame arresters meeting this standard also comply with the 
minimum requirements of the International Maritime Organization, 
Maritime Safety Committee Circular No. 373 (MSC/Circ. 373/Rev. 1).

with this standard. At no time shall a flame arrester be sold with this 
standard designation that does not meet the requirements herein.
    14. Test Procedures for Flame Arresters
    14.1  Media/Air Mixtures

[[Page 358]]

    14.1.1  For vapors from flammable or combustible liquids with a MESG 
greater than or equal to 0.9 mm, technical grade hexane or gasoline 
vapors shall be used for all tests in this section except technical 
grade propane may be used for the flashback test in Section 14.2. For 
vapors with a MESG less than 0.9 mm, the specific vapor (or 
alternatively, a media with a MESG less than or equal to the MESG of the 
vapor) must be used as the test medium in all section 14 tests.
    14.1.2  Hexane, propane, gasoline and chemical vapors shall be mixed 
with air to form the most easily ignitable mixture.(5)
    14.2  Flashback Test
    14.2.1  A flashback test shall be carried out as follows:
    14.2.1.1  The test rig shall consist of an apparatus producing an 
explosive mixture, a small tank with a diaphragm, a prototype of the 
flame arrester, a plastic bag (6) and a firing source in three positions 
(see Figure 1).(7)
    14.2.1.2  The tank, flame arrester assembly and the plastic bag 
enveloping the prototype flame arrester shall be filled so that this 
volume contains the most easily ignitable vapor/air mixture.(8) The 
concentration of the mixture should be verified by appropriate testing 
of the gas composition in the plastic bag. Three ignition sources shall 
be installed along the axis of the bag, one close to the flame arrester, 
another as far away as possible therefrom, and the third at the midpoint 
between these two. These three sources shall be fired in succession, one 
during each of the three tests. Flame passage shall not occur during 
this test.
    14.2.1.3  If flame passage occurs, the tank diaphragm will burst and 
this will be audible and visible to the operator by the emission of a 
flame. Flame, heat and pressure sensors may be used as an alternative to 
a bursting diaphragm.
    14.3  Endurance Burn Test
    14.3.1  An endurance burning test shall be carried out as follows:
    14.3.1.1  The test rig as referred to in 14.2 may be used, without 
the plastic bag. The flame arrester shall be so installed that the 
mixture emission is vertical. In this position the mixture shall be 
ignited.
    14.3.1.2  Endurance burning shall be achieved by using the most 
easily ignitable test vapor/air mixture with the aid of a pilot flame or 
a spark igniter at the outlet. By varying the proportions of the 
flammable mixture and the flow rate, the arrester shall be heated until 
the highest obtainable temperature on the cargo tank side of the 
arrester is reached. The highest attainable temperature may be 
considered to have been reached when the rate of rise of temperature 
does not exceed 0.5  deg.C per minute over a ten minute period. This 
temperature shall be maintained for a period of ten minutes, after which 
the flow shall be stopped and the conditions observed. If difficulty 
arises in establishing the highest attainable temperature, the following 
criteria shall apply. When the temperature appears to be approaching the 
maximum temperature, using the most severe conditions of flammable 
mixtures and flow rate, but increases at a rate in excess of 0.5  deg.C 
per minute over a ten minute period, endurance burning shall be 
continued for a period of two hours after which the flow shall be 
stopped and the conditions observed. Flame passage shall not occur 
during this test.

    (5) See IEC Publication 79-1.
    (6) The dimensions of the plastic bag are dependent on those of the 
flame arrester. The plastic bag may have a circumference of 2 m, a 
length of 2.5 m and a wall thickness of .05 m.
    (7) In order to avoid remnants of the plastic bag from falling back 
on to the flame arrester being tested after ignition of the fuel/air 
mixture, it may be useful to mount a coarse wire frame across the flame 
arrester within the plastic bag. The frame should be constructed so as 
not to interfere with the test result.
    (8) See IEC Publication 79-1.

   Appendix C to Part 154--Guidelines for Determining and Evaluating 
         Required Response Resources for Facility Response Plans

                               1. Purpose

    1.1  The purpose of this appendix is to describe the procedures for 
identifying response resources to meet the requirements of subpart F of 
this part. These guidelines will be used by the facility owner or 
operator in preparing the response plan and by the Captain of the Port 
(COTP) when reviewing them. Response resources identified in subparts H 
and I of this part should be selected using the guidelines in section 2 
and Table 1 of this appendix.

                 2. Equipment Operability and Readiness

    2.1  All equipment identified in a response plan must be designed to 
operate in the conditions expected in the facility's geographic area. 
These conditions vary widely based on location and season. Therefore, it 
is difficult to identify a single stockpile of response equipment that 
will function effectively in each geographic location.
    2.2  Facilities handling, storing, or transporting oil in more than 
one operating environment as indicated in Table 1 of this appendix must 
identify equipment capable of successfully functioning in each operating 
environment.
    2.3  When identifying equipment for response plan credit, a facility 
owner or operator must consider the inherent limitations in the 
operability of equipment components and response systems. The criteria 
in Table 1 of this appendix should be used for evaluating the 
operability in a given environment. These criteria reflect the general 
conditions in certain operating areas.
    2.3.1  The Coast Guard may require documentation that the boom 
identified in a response plan meets the criteria in Table 1. Absent 
acceptable documentation, the Coast Guard may require that the boom be 
tested to demonstrate that it meets the criteria in Table 1. Testing 
must be in accordance with ASTM F 715 (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 154.106), or other tests approved by the Coast Guard.
    2.4  Table 1 of this appendix lists criteria for oil recovery 
devices and boom. All other equipment necessary to sustain or support 
response operations in the specified operating environment must be 
designed to function in the same conditions. For example, boats which 
deploy or support skimmers or boom must be capable of being safely 
operated in the significant wave heights listed for the applicable 
operating environment.
    2.5  A facility owner or operator must refer to the applicable local 
contingency plan or ACP, as appropriate, to determine if ice, debris, 
and weather-related visibility are significant factors in evaluating the 
operability of equipment. The local contingency plan or ACP will also 
identify the average temperature ranges expected in the facility's 
operating area. All equipment identified in a response plan must be 
designed to operate within those conditions or ranges.
    2.6  The requirements of subparts F, G, H and I of this part 
establish response resource mobilization and response times. The 
distance of the facility from the storage location of the response 
resources must be used to determine whether the resources can arrive on 
scene within the stated time. A facility owner or operator shall include 
the time for notification, mobilization, and travel time of response 
resources identified to meet the maximum most probable discharge and 
Tier 1 worst case discharge response time requirements. For subparts F 
and G, tier 2 and 3 response resources must be notified and

[[Page 361]]

mobilized as necessary to meet the requirements for arrival on scene in 
accordance with Secs. 154.1045 or 154.1047 of subpart F, or 
Sec. 154.1135 of subpart G, as appropriate. An on water speed of 5 knots 
and a land speed of 35 miles per hour is assumed unless the facility 
owner or operator can demonstrate otherwise.
    2.7  For subparts F and G, in identifying equipment, the facility 
owner or operator shall list the storage location, quantity, and 
manufacturer's make and model. For oil recovery devices, the effective 
daily recovery capacity, as determined using section 6 of this appendix 
must be included. For boom, the overall boom height (draft plus 
freeboard) should be included. A facility owner or operator is 
responsible for ensuring that identified boom has compatible connectors.
    2.8  For subparts H and I, in identifying equipment, the facility 
owner or operator shall list the storage location, quantity, and 
manufacturer's make and model. For boom, the overall boom height (draft 
plus freeboard) should be included. A facility owner or operator is 
responsible for ensuring that identified boom has compatible connectors.

3. Determining Response Resources Required for the Average Most Probable 
                                Discharge

    3.1  A facility owner or operator shall identify sufficient response 
resources available, through contract or other approved means as 
described in Sec. 154.1028(a), to respond to the average most probable 
discharge. The equipment must be designed to function in the operating 
environment at the point of expected use.
    3.2  The response resources must include:
    3.2.1  1,000 feet of containment boom or two times the length of the 
largest vessel that regularly conducts oil transfers to or from the 
facility, whichever is greater, and a means deploying it available at 
the spill site within 1 hour of the discovery of a spill.
    3.2.2  Oil recovery devices with an effective daily recovery 
capacity equal to the amount of oil discharged in an average most 
probable discharge or greater available at the facility within 2 hours 
of the detection of an oil discharge.
    3.2.3  Oil storage capacity for recovered oily material indicated in 
section 9.2 of this appendix.

4. Determining Response Resources Required for the Maximum Most Probable 
                                Discharge

    4.1  A facility owner or operator shall identify sufficient response 
resources available, by contract or other approved means as described in 
Sec. 154.1028(a), to respond to discharges up to the maximum most 
probable discharge volume for that facility. This will require response 
resources capable of containing and collecting up to 1,200 barrels of 
oil or 10 percent of the worst case discharge, whichever is less. All 
equipment identified must be designed to operate in the applicable 
operating environment specified in Table 1 of this appendix.
    4.2  Oil recovery devices identified to meet the applicable maximum 
most probable discharge volume planning criteria must be located such 
that they arrive on scene within 6 hours in higher volume port areas (as 
defined in 154.1020) and the Great Lakes and within 12 hours in all 
other areas.
    4.3  Because rapid control, containment, and removal of oil is 
critical to reduce spill impact, the effective daily recovery capacity 
for oil recovery devices must equal 50 percent of the planning volume 
applicable for the facility as determined in section 4.1 of this 
appendix. The effective daily recovery capacity for oil recovery devices 
identified in the plan must be determined using the criteria in section 
6 of this appendix.
    4.4  In addition to oil recovery capacity, the plan must identify 
sufficient quantities of containment boom available, by contract or 
other approved means as described in Sec. 154.1028(a), to arrive within 
the required response times for oil collection and containment and for 
protection of fish and wildlife and sensitive environments. While the 
regulation does not set required quantities of boom for oil collection 
and containment, the response plan must identify and ensure, by contract 
or other approved means as described in Sec. 154.1028(a), the 
availability of the boom identified in the plan for this purpose.
    4.5  The plan must indicate the availability of temporary storage 
capacity to meet the guidelines of section 9.2 of this appendix. If 
available storage capacity is insufficient to meet this level, then the 
effective daily recovery capacity must be derated to the limits of the 
available storage capacity.
    4.6  The following is an example of a maximum most probable 
discharge volume planning calculation for equipment identification in a 
higher volume port area: The facility's worst case discharge volume is 
20,000 barrels. Ten percent of this is 2,000 barrels. Since this is 
greater than 1,200 barrels, 1,200 barrels is used as the planning 
volume. The effective daily recovery capacity must be 50 percent of 
this, or 600 barrels per day. The ability of oil recovery devices to 
meet this capacity will be calculated using the procedures in section 6 
of this appendix. Temporary storage capacity available on scene must 
equal twice the daily recovery rate as indicated in section 9 of this 
appendix, or 1,200 barrels per day. This is the information the facility 
owner or operator will use to identify and ensure the availability of, 
through contract or other approved means as described in 
Sec. 154.1028(a), the required response resources. The facility owner 
will also

[[Page 362]]

need to identify how much boom is available for use.

5. Determining Response Resources Required for the Worst Case Discharge 
                    to the Maximum Extent Practicable

    5.1  A facility owner or operator shall identify and ensure 
availability of, by contract or other approved means, as described in 
Sec. 154.1028(a), sufficient response resources to respond to the worst 
case discharge of oil to the maximum extent practicable. Section 7 of 
this appendix describes the method to determine the required response 
resources.
    5.2  Oil spill response resources identified in the response plan 
and available through contract or other approved means, as described in 
Sec. 154.1028(a), to meet the applicable worst case discharge planning 
volume must be located such that they can arrive at the scene of a 
discharge within the times specified for the applicable response tiers 
listed in Sec. 154.1045.
    5.3  The effective daily recovery capacity for oil recovery devices 
identified in a response plan must be determined using the criteria in 
section 6 of this appendix. A facility owner or operator shall identify 
the storage locations of all response resources that must be used to 
fulfill the requirements for each tier. The owner or operator of a 
facility whose required daily recovery capacity exceeds the applicable 
response capability caps in Table 5 of this appendix shall identify 
sources of additional equipment, their locations, and the arrangements 
made to obtain this equipment during a response. The owner or operator 
of a facility whose calculated planning volume exceeds the applicable 
contracting caps in Table 5 shall identify sources of additional 
equipment equal to twice the cap listed in Tiers 1, 2, and 3 or the 
amount necessary to reach the calculated planning volume, whichever is 
lower. The resources identified above the cap must be capable of 
arriving on scene not later than the Tiers 1, 2, and 3 response times in 
Sec. 154.1045. No contract is required. While general listings of 
available response equipment may be used to identify additional sources, 
a response plan must identify the specific sources, locations, and 
quantities of equipment that a facility owner or operator has considered 
in his or her planning. When listing Coast Guard classified oil spill 
removal organization(s) which have sufficient removal capacity to 
recover the volume above the response capability cap for the specific 
facility, as specified in Table 5 of this appendix, it is not necessary 
to list specific quantities of equipment.
    5.4  A facility owner or operator shall identify the availability of 
temporary storage capacity to meet the requirements of section 9.2 of 
this appendix. If available storage capacity is insufficient to meet 
this requirement, then the effective daily recovery capacity must be 
derated to the limits of the availabile storage capacity.
    5.5  When selecting response resources necessary to meet the 
response plan requirements, the facility owner or operator must ensure 
that a portion of those resources are capable of being used in close-to-
shore response activities in shallow water. The following percentages of 
the on-water response equipment identified for the applicable geographic 
area must be capable of operating in waters of 6 feet or less depth:
    (i) Offshore--10 percent
    (ii) Nearshore/inland/Great Lakes/rivers and canals--20 percent.
    5.6  In addition to oil spill recovery devices, a facility owner or 
operator shall identify sufficient quantities of boom that are 
available, by contract or other approved means as described in 
Sec. 154.1028(a), to arrive on scene within the required response times 
for oil containment and collection. The specific quantity of boom 
required for collection and containment will depend on the specific 
recovery equipment and strategies employed. A facility owner or operator 
shall also identify sufficient quantities of oil containment boom to 
protect fish and wildlife and sensitive environments for the number of 
days and geographic areas specified in Table 2. Sections 
154.1035(b)(4)(iii) and 154.1040(a), as appropriate, shall be used to 
determine the amount of containment boom required, through contract or 
other approved means as described in Sec. 154.1028(a), to protect fish 
and wildlife and sensitive environments.
    5.7  A facility owner or operator must also identify, through 
contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 154.1028(a), the 
availability of an oil spill removal organization capable of responding 
to a shoreline cleanup operation involving the calculated volume of oil 
and emulsified oil that might impact the affected shoreline. The volume 
of oil that must be planned for is calculated through the application of 
factors contained in Tables 2 and 3. The volume calculated from these 
tables is intended to assist the facility owner or operator in 
identifying a contractor with sufficient resources and expertise. This 
planning volume is not used explicitly to determine a required amount of 
equipment and personnel.

   6. Determining Effective Daily Recovery Capacity for Oil Recovery 
                                 Devices

    6.1  Oil recovery devices identified by a facility owner or operator 
must be identified by manufacturer, model, and effective daily recovery 
capacity. These rates must be used to determine whether there is 
sufficient capacity to meet the applicable planning critieria for the 
average most probable discharge, maximum most probable discharge, and 
worst case discharge to the maximum extent practicable.

[[Page 363]]

    6.2  For the purpose of determining the effective daily recovery 
capacity of oil recovery devices, the formula listed in section 6.2.1 of 
this appendix will be used. This method considers potential limitations 
due to available daylight, weather, sea state, and percentage of 
emulsified oil in the recovered material. The Coast Guard may assign a 
lower efficiency factor to equipment listed in a response plan if it 
determines that such a reduction is warranted.
    6.2.1  The following formula must be used to calculate the effective 
daily recovery capacity:

R=Tx24 hoursxE

R=Effective daily recovery capacity
T=Throughout rate in barrels per hour (nameplate capacity)
E=20 percent Efficiency factor (or lower factor as determined by Coast 
          Guard)
    6.2.2  For those devices in which the pump limits the throughput of 
liquid, throughput rate will be calculated using the pump capacity.
    6.2.3  For belt or mop type devices, the throughput rate will be 
calculated using the speed of the belt or mop through the device, 
assumed thickness of oil adhering to or collected by the device, and 
surface area of the belt or mop. For purposes of this calculation, the 
assumed thickness of oil will be 1/4 inch.
    6.2.4  Facility owners or operators including oil recovery devices 
whose throughput is not measurable using a pump capacity or belt/mop 
speed may provide information to support an alternative method of 
calculation. This information must be submitted following the procedures 
in paragraph 6.3.2 of this appendix.
    6.3  As an alternative to 6.2, a facility owner or operator may 
submit adequate evidence that a different effective daily recovery 
capacity should be applied for a specific oil recovery device. Adequate 
evidence is actual verified performance data in spill conditions or 
tests using ASTM F 631 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 154.106), or 
an equivalent test approved by the Coast Guard.
    6.3.1  The following formula must be used to calculate the effective 
daily recovery capacity under this alternative:

R=DxU

R=Effective daily recovery capacity
D=Average Oil Recovery Rate in barrels per hour (Item 26 in ASTM F 808; 
          Item 13.2.16 in ASTM F 631; or actual performance data)
U=Hours per day that a facility owner or operator can document 
          capability to operate equipment under spill conditions. Ten 
          hours per day must be used unless a facility owner or operator 
          can demonstrate that the recovery operation can be sustained 
          for longer periods.
    6.3.2  A facility owner or operator proposing a different effective 
daily recovery rate for use in a response plan shall provide data for 
the oil recovery devices listed. The following is an example of these 
calculations:
    A weir skimmer identified in a response plan has a manufacturer's 
rated throughput at the pump of 267 gallons per minute (gpm).

267 gpm=381 barrels per hour
R=381x24x.2=1829 barrels per day
    After testing using ASTM procedures, the skimmer's oil recovery rate 
is determined to be 220 gpm. The facility owner of operator identifies 
sufficient response resources available to support operations 12 hours 
per day.

220 gpm=314 barrels per hour
R=314x12=3768 barrels per day
    The facility owner or operator will be able to use the higher rate 
if sufficient temporary oil storage capacity is available. 
Determinations of alternative efficiency factors under paragraph 6.2 or 
alternative effective daily recovery capacities under paragraph 6.3 of 
this appendix will be made by Commandant, (G-MOR), Coast Guard 
Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593. Response 
contractors or equipment manufacturers may submit required information 
on behalf of multiple facility owners or operators directly in lieu of 
including the request with the response plan submission.

        7. Calculating the Worst Case Discharge Planning Volumes

    7.1  The facility owner or operator shall plan for a response to a 
facility's worst case discharge. The planning for on-water recovery must 
take into account a loss of some oil to the environment due to 
evaporative and natural dissipation, potential increases in volume due 
to emulsification, and the potential for deposit of some oil on the 
shoreline.
    7.2  The following procedures must be used to calculate the planning 
volume used by a facility owner or operator for determining required on 
water recovery capacity:
    7.2.1  The following must be determined: The worst case discharge 
volume of oil in the facility; the appropriate group(s) for the type of 
oil handled, stored, or transported at the facility (non-persistent 
(Group I) or persistent (Groups II, III, or IV)); and the facility's 
specific operating area. Facilities which handle, store, or transport 
oil from different petroleum oil groups must calculate each group 
separately. This information is to be used with Table 2 of this appendix 
to determine the percentages of the total volume to be used for removal 
capacity planning. This table divides the volume into three categories: 
Oil lost to the environment; oil deposited on the shoreline; and oil 
available for on-water recovery.
    7.2.2  The on-water oil recovery volume must be adjusted using the 
appropriate emulsification factor found in Table 3 of this appendix. 
Facilities which handle, store, or

[[Page 364]]

transport oil from different petroleum groups must assume that the oil 
group resulting in the largest on-water recovery volume will be stored 
in the tank or tanks identified as constituting the worst case 
discharge.
    7.2.3  The adjusted volume is multiplied by the on-water oil 
recovery resource mobilization favor found in Table 4 of this appendix 
from the appropriate operating area and response tier to determine the 
total on-water oil recovery capacity in barrels per day that must be 
identified or contracted for to arrive on-scene with the applicable time 
for each response tier. Three tiers are specified. For higher volume 
port areas, the contracted tiers of resources must be located such that 
they can arrive on scene within 6, 30, and 54 hours of the discovery of 
an oil discharge. For all other river, inland, nearshore, offshore 
areas, and the Great Lakes, these tiers are 12, 36, and 60 hours.
    7.2.4  The resulting on-water recovery capacity in barrels per day 
for each tier must be used to identify response resources necessary to 
sustain operations in the applicable operating area. The equipment must 
be capable of sustaining operations for the time period specified in 
Table 2 of this appendix. The facility owner or operator must identify 
and ensure the availability, through contract or other approved means as 
described in Sec. 154.1028(a), of sufficient oil spill recovery devices 
to provide the effective daily recovery oil recovery capacity required. 
If the required capacity exceeds the applicable cap specified in Table 5 
of this appendix, then a facility owner or operator shall ensure, by 
contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 154.1028(a), only 
for the quantity of resources required to meet the cap, but shall 
identify sources of additional resources as indicated in 
Sec. 154.1045(m). The owner or operator of a facility whose planning 
volume exceeds the cap for 1993 must make arrangements to identify and 
ensure the availability, through contract or other approved means as 
described in Sec. 154.1028(a), of the additional capacity in 1998 or 
2003, as appropriate. For a facility that handles, stores, or transports 
multiple groups of oil, the required effective daily recovery capacity 
for each group is calculated before applying the cap.
    7.3  The following procedures must be used to calculate the planning 
volume for identifying shoreline cleanup capacity:
    7.3.1  The following must be determined: The worst case discharge 
volume of oil for the facility; the appropriate group(s) for the type of 
oil handled, stored, or transported at the facility (non-persistent 
(Group I) or persistent (Groups II, III, or IV)); and the operating 
area(s) in which the facility operates. For a facility storing oil from 
different groups, each group must be calculated separately. Using this 
information, Table 2 of this appendix must be used to determine the 
percentages of the total planning volume to be used for shoreline 
cleanup resource planning.
    7.3.2  The shoreline cleanup planning volume must be adjusted to 
reflect an emulsification factor using the same procedure as described 
in section 7.2.2.
    7.3.3  The resulting volume will be used to identify an oil spill 
removal organization with the appropriate shoreline cleanup capability.
    7.3.4  The following is an example of the procedure described above: 
A facility receives oil from barges via a dock located on a bay and 
transported by piping to storage tanks. The facility handles Number 6 
oil (specific gravity .96) and stores the oil in tanks where it is held 
prior to being burned in an electric generating plant. The MTR segment 
of the facility has six 18-inch diameter pipelines running one mile from 
the dock-side manifold to several storage tanks which are located in the 
non-transportation-related portion of the facility. Although the 
facility piping has a normal working pressure of 100 pounds per square 
inch, the piping has a maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP) of 150 
pounds per square inch. At MAWP, the pumping system can move 10,000 
barrels (bbls) of Number 6 oil every hour through each pipeline. The 
facility has a roving watchman who is required to drive the length of 
the piping every 2 hours when the facility is receiving oil from a 
barge. The facility operator estimates that it will take approximately 
10 minutes to secure pumping operations when a discharge is discovered. 
Using the definition of worst case discharge provided in 
Sec. 154.1029(b)(ii), the following calculation is provided:

 
                                                                   bbls.
 
2 hrs + 0.17 hour x 10,000 bbls per hour......................    21,700
Piping volume = 37,322 ft \3\ / 5.6 ft \3\/bbl................    +6,664
                                                               ---------
Discharge volume per pipe.....................................    28,364
Number of pipelines...........................................        x6
                                                               ---------
Worst case discharge from MTR facility........................   170,184
 

    To calculate the planning volumes for onshore recovery:

Worst case discharge: 170,184 bbls. Group IV oil
Emulsification factor (from Table 3): 1.4
Operating Area impacted: Inland
Planned percent oil onshore recovery (from Table 2): Inland 70%
Planning volumes for onshore recovery: Inland 170,184 x.7 x 1.4 = 
166,780 bbls.

    Conclusion: The facility owner or operator must contract with a 
response resource capable of managing a 166,780 barrel shoreline 
cleanup.
    To calculate the planning volumes for on-water recovery:


[[Page 365]]


Worst case discharge: 170,184 bbls. Group IV oil
Emulsification factor (from Table 3): 1.4
Operating Area impacted: Inland
Planned percent oil on-water recovery (from Table 2): Inland 50%
Planning volumes for on-water recovery: Inland 170,184 x .5 x 1.4 = 
119,128 bbls.

    To determine the required resources for on-water recovery for each 
tier, use the mobilization factors from Table 4:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                Tier 1   Tier 2   Tier 3
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inland = 119,128 bbls........................    x .15    x .25    x .40
                                              --------------------------
Barrels per day (pbd)........................   17,869   29,782   47,652
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Conclusion: Since the requirements for all tiers for inland exceed 
the caps, the facility owner will only need to contract for 10,000 bpd 
for Tier 1, 20,000 bpd for Tier 2, and 40,000 bpd for Tier 3. Sources 
for the bpd on-water recovery resources above the caps for all three 
Tiers need only be identified in the response plan.
    Twenty percent of the capability for Inland, for all tiers, must be 
capable of operating in water with a depth of 6 feet or less.
    The facility owner or operator will also be required to identify or 
ensure, by contract or other approved means as described in 
Sec. 154.1028(a), sufficient response resources required under 
Secs. 154.1035(b)(4) and 154.1045(k) to protect fish and wildlife and 
sensitive environments identified in the response plan for the worst 
case discharge from the facility.
    The COTP has the discretion to accept that a facility can operate 
only a limited number of the total pipelines at a dock at a time. In 
those circumstances, the worst case discharge must include the drainage 
volume from the piping normally not in use in addition to the drainage 
volume and volume of oil discharged during discovery and shut down of 
the oil discharge from the operating piping.

     8. Determining the Availability of Alternative Response Methods

    8.1  Response plans for facilities that handle, store, or transport 
Groups II or III persistent oils that operate in an area with year-round 
preapproval for dispersant use may receive credit for up to 25 percent 
of their required on-water recovery capacity for 1993 if the 
availability of these resources is ensured by contract or other approved 
means as described in Sec. 154.1028(a). For response plan credit, these 
resources must be capable of being on-scene within 12 hours of a 
discharge.
    8.2  To receive credit against any required on-water recover 
capacity a response plan must identify the locations of dispersant 
stockpiles, methods of shipping to a staging area, and appropriate 
aircraft, vessels, or facilities to apply the dispersant and monitor its 
effectiveness at the scene of an oil discharge.
    8.2.1  Sufficient volumes of dispersants must be available to treat 
the oil at the dosage rate recommended by the dispersant manufacturer. 
Dispersants identified in a response plan must be on the NCP Product 
Schedule that is maintained by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
(Some states have a list of approved dispersants and within state waters 
only they can be used.)
    8.2.2  Dispersant application equipment identified in a response 
plan for credit must be located where it can be mobilized to shoreside 
staging areas to meet the time requirements in section 8.1 of this 
appendix. Sufficient equipment capacity and sources of appropriate 
dispersants should be identified to sustain dispersant application 
operations for at least 3 days.
    8.2.3  Credit against on-water recovery capacity in preapproved 
areas will be based on the ability to treat oil at a rate equivalent to 
this credit. For example, a 2,500 barrel credit against the Tier 1 
10,000 barrel on-water cap would require the facility owner or operator 
to demonstrate the ability to treat 2,500 barrel/day of oil at the 
manufacturers recommended dosage rate. Assuming a dosage rate of 10:1, 
the plan would need to show stockpiles and sources of 250 barrels of 
dispersants at a rate of 250 barrels per day and the ability to apply 
the dispersant at that daily rate for 3 days in the geographic area in 
which the facility is located. Similar data would need to be provided 
for any additional credit against Tier 2 and 3 resources.
    8.3  In addition to the equipment and supplies required, a facility 
owner or operator shall identify a source of support to conduct the 
monitoring and post-use effectiveness evaluation required by applicable 
regional plans and ACPs.
    8.4  Identification of the response resources for dispersant 
application does not imply that the use of this technique will be 
authorized. Actual authorization for use during a spill response will be 
governed by the provisions of the NCP and the applicable regional plan 
or ACP. A facility owner or operator who operates a facility in areas 
with year-round preapproval of dispersant can reduce the required on-
water recovery capacity for 1993 up to 25 percent. A facility owner or 
operator may reduce the required on water recovery cap increase for 1998 
and 2003 up to 50 percent by identifying pre-approved alternative 
response methods.
    8.5  In addition to the credit identified above, a facility owner or 
operator that operates in a year-round area pre-approved for dispersant 
use may reduce their required on water recovery cap increase for 1998 
and 2003 by up to 50 percent by identifying non-mechanical methods.

[[Page 366]]

    8.6  The use of in-situ burning as a non-mechanical response method 
is still being studied. Because limitations and uncertainties remain for 
the use of this method, it may not be used to reduce required oil 
recovery capacity in 1993.

    9. Additional Equipment Necessary to Sustain Response Operations

    9.1  A facility owner or operator is responsible for ensuring that 
sufficient numbers of trained personnel and boats, aerial spotting 
aircraft, containment boom, sorbent materials, boom anchoring materials, 
and other supplies are available to sustain response operations to 
completion. All such equipment must be suitable for use with the primary 
equipment identified in the response plan. A facility owner or operator 
is not required to list these response resources, but shall certify 
their availability.
    9.2  A facility owner or operator shall evaluate the availability of 
adequate temporary storage capacity to sustain the effective daily 
recovery capacities from equipment identified in the plan. Because of 
the inefficiencies of oil spill recovery devices, response plans must 
identify daily storage capacity equivalent to twice the effective daily 
recovery rate required on scene. This temporary storage capacity may be 
reduced if a facility owner or operator can demonstrate by waste stream 
analysis that the efficiencies of the oil recovery devices, ability to 
decant waste, or the availability of alternative temporary storage or 
disposal locations will reduce the overall volume of oily material 
storage requirement.
    9.3  A facility owner or operator shall ensure that his or her 
planning includes the capability to arrange for disposal of recovered 
oil products. Specific disposal procedures will be addressed in the 
applicable ACP.

 Appendix D to Part 154--Training Elements for Oil Spill Response Plans

                               1. General

    1.1  The portion of the plan dealing with training is one of the key 
elements of a response plan. This concept is clearly expressed by the 
fact that Congress, in writing OPA 90, specifically included training as 
one of the sections required in a vessel or facility response plan. In 
reviewing submitted response plans, it has been noted that the plans 
often do not provide sufficient information in the training section of 
the plan for either the user or the reviewer of the plan. In some cases, 
plans simply state that the crew and others will be trained in their 
duties and responsibilities, with no other information being provided. 
In other plans, information is simply given that required parties will 
receive the necessary worker safety training (HAZWOPER).
    1.2  The training section of the plan need not be a detailed course 
syllabus, but it must contain sufficient information to allow the user 
and reviewer (or evaluator) to have an understanding of those areas that 
are believed to be critical. Plans should identify key skill areas and 
the training that is required to ensure that the individual identified 
will be capable of performing the duties prescribed to them. It should 
also describe how the training will be delivered to the various 
personnel. Further, this section of the plan must work in harmony with 
those sections of the plan dealing with exercises, the spill management 
team, and the qualified individual.
    1.3  The material in this appendix D is not all-inclusive and is 
provided for guidance only.

                       2. Elements To Be Addressed

    2.1  To assist in the preparation of the training section of a 
facility response plan, some of the key elements that should be 
addressed are indicated in the following sections. Again, while it is 
not necessary that the comprehensive training program for the company be 
included in the response plan, it is necessary for the plan to convey 
the elements that define the program as appropriate.
    2.2  An effective spill response training program should consider 
and address the following:
    2.2.1  Notification requirements and procedures.
    2.2.2  Communication system(s) used for the notifications.
    2.2.3  Procedures to mitigate or prevent any discharge or a 
substantial threat of a discharge of oil resulting from failure of 
manifold, mechanical loading arm, or other transfer equipment or hoses, 
as appropriate;
    2.2.3.1  Tank overfill;

[[Page 368]]

    2.2.3.2  Tank rupture;
    2.2.3.3  Piping rupture;
    2.2.3.4  Piping leak, both under pressure and not under pressure, if 
applicable;
    2.2.3.5  Explosion or fire;
    2.2.3.6  Equipment failure (e.g., pumping system failure, relief 
valve failure, or other general equipment relevant to operational 
activities associated with internal or external facility transfers).
    2.2.4  Procedures for transferring responsibility for direction of 
response activities from facility personnel to the spill management 
team.
    2.2.5  Familiarity with the operational capabilities of the 
contracted oil spill removal organizations and the procedures to notify 
the activate such organizations.
    2.2.6  Familiarity with the contracting and ordering procedures to 
acquire oil spill removal organization resources.
    2.2.7  Familiarity with the ACP(s).
    2.2.8  Familiarity with the organizational structures that will be 
used to manage the response actions.
    2.2.9  Responsibilities and duties of the spill management team 
members in accordance with designated job responsibilities.
    2.2.10  Responsibilities and authority of the qualified individual 
as described in the facility response plan and company response 
organization.
    2.2.11  Responsibilities of designated individuals to initiate a 
response and supervise response resources.
    2.2.12  Actions to take, in accordance with designated job 
responsibilities, in the event of a transfer system leak, tank overflow, 
or suspected cargo tank or hull leak.
    2.2.13  Information on the cargoes handled by the vessel or 
facility, including familiarity with--
    2.2.13.1  Cargo material safety data sheets;
    2.2.13.2  Chemical characteristic of the cargo;
    2.2.13.3  Special handling procedures for the cargo;
    2.2.13.4  Health and safety hazards associated with the cargo; and
    2.2.13.5  Spill and firefighting procedures for cargo.
    2.2.14  Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements 
for worker health and safety (29 CFR 1910.120).

                        3. Further Considerations

    In drafting the training section of the facility response plan, some 
further considerations are noted below (these points are raised simply 
as a reminder):
    3.1  The training program should focus on training provided to 
facility personnel.
    3.2  An organization is comprised of individuals, and a training 
program should be structured to recognize this fact by ensuring that 
training is tailored to the needs of the individuals involved in the 
program.
    3.3  An owner or operator may identify equivalent work experience 
which fulfills specific training requirements.
    3.4  The training program should include participation in periodic 
announced and unannounced exercises. This participation should 
approximate the actual roles and responsibilities of individual 
specified in the plan.
    3.5  Training should be conducted periodically to reinforce the 
required knowledge and to ensure an adequate degree of preparedness by 
individuals with responsibilities under the facility response plan.
    3.6  Training may be delivered via a number of different means; 
including classroom sessions, group discussions, video tapes, self-study 
workbooks, resident training courses, on-the-job training, or other 
means as deemed appropriate to ensure proper instruction.
    3.7  New employees should complete the training program prior to 
being assigned job responsibilities which require participation in 
emergency response situations.

                              4. Conclusion

    The information in this appendix is only intended to assist response 
plan preparers in reviewing the content of and in modifying the training 
section of their response plans. It may be more comprehensive than is 
needed for some facilities and not comprehensive enough for others. The 
Coast Guard expects that plan preparers have determined the training 
needs of their organizations created by the development of the response 
plans and the actions identified as necessary to increase the 
preparedness of the company and its personnel to respond to actual or 
threatened discharges of oil from their facilities.

Sec. 155.200  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart:
    Inland oil barge means a tank barge carrying oil in bulk as cargo 
certificated by the Coast Guard under 46 CFR chapter I, subchapter D for 
river or canal service or lakes, bays, and sounds service.
    On-deck spill means a discharge of oil on the deck of a vessel 
during loading, unloading, transfer, or other shipboard operations. An 
on-deck spill could result from a leaking fitting, an overfill, a bad 
connection, or similar operational mishap. The term on-deck spill is 
used to differentiate these operational discharges from those caused by 
collision or grounding where the hull is punctured and a tank is 
ruptured, resulting in an uncontrolled discharge of oil into the marine 
environment.
    Offshore oil barge means a tank barge carrying oil in bulk as cargo, 
including dual-mode integrated tug-barges, certificated by the Coast 
Guard under 46 CFR chapter I, subchapter D, for navigation in waters 
outside the Boundary Lines, as defined in 46 CFR part 7, in any ocean or 
the Gulf of Mexico; any tank barge in Great Lakes service; or any 
foreign flag tank barge.
    Oil tanker means a self-propelled vessel carrying oil in bulk as 
cargo, including integrated tug-barges designed for push-mode operation.
    Vessel carrying oil as secondary cargo means a vessel carrying oil 
pursuant to a permit issued under 46 CFR 30.01-5, 46 CFR 70.05-30, or 46 
CFR 90.05-35 or pursuant to an International Oil Pollution Prevention 
(IOPP) or Noxious Liquid Substance (NLS) certificate required by 
Secs. 151.33 or 151.35 of this chapter; or any uninspected vessel that 
carries oil in bulk as cargo.

Sec. 155.230  Emergency control systems for tank barges.

    (a) Application. This section does not apply to foreign vessels 
engaged in innocent passage (that is, neither entering nor leaving a 
U.S. port); it applies to tank barges and vessels towing them on the 
following waters:
    (1) On the territorial sea of the U.S. [as defined in Presidential 
Proclamation 5928 of December 27, 1988, it is the belt of waters 12 
nautical miles wide with its shoreward boundary the baseline of the 
territorial sea], unless--
    (i) The barge is being pushed ahead of, or towed alongside, the 
towing vessel; and
    (ii) The barge's coastwise route is restricted, on its certificate 
of inspection (COI), so the barge may operate ``in fair weather only, 
within 20 miles of shore,'' or with words to that effect. The Officer in 
Charge, Marine Inspection, may define ``fair weather'' on the COI.
    (2) In Great Lakes service unless--
    (i) The barge is being pushed ahead of, or towed alongside, the 
towing vessel; and
    (ii) The barge's route is restricted, on its certificate of 
inspection (COI), so the barge may operate ``in fair weather only, 
within 5 miles of a harbor,'' or with words to that effect. The Officer 
in Charge, Marine Inspection, may define ``fair weather'' on the COI.
    (3) On Long Island Sound. For the purposes of this section, Long 
Island

[[Page 374]]

Sound comprises the waters between the baseline of the territorial sea 
on the eastern end (from Watch Hill Point, Rhode Island, to Montauk 
Point, Long Island) and a line drawn north and south from Premium Point, 
New York (about 40 deg.54.5[min]N, 73 deg.45.5[min]W), to Hewlett Point, 
Long Island (about 40 deg.50.5[min]N, 73 deg.45.3[min]W), on the western 
end.
    (4) In the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
    (5) On the waters of Admiralty Inlet north of Marrowstone Point 
(approximately 48 deg.06[min]N, 122 deg.41[min]W).
    (b) Safety program. If you are the owner or operator of a single-
hull tank barge or of a vessel towing it, you must adequately man and 
equip either the barge or the vessel towing it so the crew can arrest 
the barge by employing Measure 1, described in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section. Moreover, the crew must be able to arrest or retrieve the barge 
by employing either Measure 2 or Measure 3, described in paragraphs 
(b)(2) and (3) of this section, respectively. If you are the owner or 
operator of a double-hull tank barge, you must adequately equip it and 
train its crew or, if it is unmanned, train the crew of the vessel 
towing it, so the crew can retrieve the barge by employing Measure 2 
described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (1) Measure 1. Each single-hull tank barge, whether manned or 
unmanned, must be equipped with an operable anchoring system that 
conforms to 46 CFR 32.15-15; except that, for barges operating only on 
the West Coast of the U.S., a system comprising heavy surge gear and 
bridle legs may serve instead of the anchoring system. Because these 
systems will also serve as emergency control systems, the owner or 
operator must ensure that they meet the following criteria:
    (i) Operation and performance. When the barge is underway--
    (A) The system is ready for immediate use;
    (B) No more than two crewmembers are needed to operate the system 
and anchor the barge or arrest its movement;
    (C) While preparing to anchor the barge or arrest its movement, the 
operator of the system should confer with the master or mate of the 
towing vessel regarding appropriate length of cable or chain to use; and
    (D) Each operator of the system should wear a safety belt or harness 
secured by a lanyard to a lifeline, drop line, or fixed structure such 
as a welded padeye, if the sea or the weather warrants this precaution. 
Each safety belt, harness, lanyard, lifeline, and drop line must meet 
the specifications of ANSI A10.14.
    (ii) Maintenance and inspections. The owner or operator of the 
system shall inspect it annually. The inspection must verify that the 
system is ready for immediate use, and must include a visual inspection 
of the equipment that comprises the system in accordance with the 
manufacturer's recommendations. The inspection must also verify that the 
system is being maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's 
recommendations. The inspection need not include actual demonstration of 
the operation of the equipment or system.
    (iii) Training. On each manned barge, every crewmember must be 
thoroughly familiar with the operation of the system. On each vessel 
towing an unmanned barge, every deck crewmember must be thoroughly 
familiar with the operation of the system installed on the barge. If 
during the last 12 months the system was not used to anchor or arrest 
the movement of the barge, then a drill on the use of the system must be 
conducted within the next month. The drill need not involve actual 
deployment of the system. However, it must allow every participant to 
demonstrate the competencies (that is, the knowledge, skills, and 
abilities) needed to ensure that everyone assigned a duty in anchoring 
or arresting the movement of the barge is ready to do his or her duty.
    (2) Measure 2. If you are the owner or operator of a tank barge or a 
vessel towing it and this section applies to you by virtue of paragraph 
(a) of this section, you must have installed an emergency retrieval 
system or some other measure acceptable to the Coast Guard, as provided 
in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Any such system must meet the 
following criteria:
    (i) Design. The system must use an emergency towline with at least 
the

[[Page 375]]

same pulling strength as required of the primary towline. The emergency 
towline must be readily available on either the barge or the vessel 
towing it. The towing vessel must have on board equipment to regain 
control of the barge and continue towing (using the emergency towline), 
without having to place personnel on board the barge.
    (ii) Operation and performance. The system must use a stowage 
arrangement that ensures the readiness of the emergency towline and the 
availability of all retrieval equipment for immediate use in an 
emergency whenever the barge is being towed astern.
    (iii) Maintenance and inspection. The owner or operator of the 
system shall inspect it annually. The inspection must verify that the 
emergency retrieval system is ready for immediate use, and must include 
a visual inspection of the equipment that comprises the system in 
accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The inspection must 
also verify that the system is being maintained in accordance with the 
manufacturer's recommendations. The inspection need not include actual 
demonstration of the operation of the equipment or system. Details 
concerning maintenance of towlines appear in 33 CFR 164.74(a)(3) and 
Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC) No. 5-92. Our NVICs are 
available online at http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-m/nvic/index.htm.
    (iv) Training. Barge-retrieval drills must take place annually, and 
not more than one month after a master or mate responsible for 
supervising barge retrieval begins employment on a vessel that tows tank 
barges.
    (A) Each drill must allow every participant to demonstrate the 
competencies (that is, the knowledge, skills, and abilities) needed to 
ensure that everyone assigned a duty in barge retrieval is ready to do 
his or her part to regain control of a drifting barge.
    (B) If the drill includes actual operation of a retrieval system, it 
must be conducted under the supervision of the master or mate 
responsible for retrieval, and preferably in open waters free from 
navigational hazards so as to minimize risk to personnel and the 
environment.
    (3) Measure 3. If you are the owner or operator of a tank barge or a 
vessel towing it and this section applies to you by virtue of paragraph 
(a) of this section, you may use an alternative measure or system fit 
for retrieving a barge or arresting its movement as a substitute for 
Measure 2, described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Before you use 
such a measure or system, however, it must receive the approval of the 
Commandant (G-MSE). It will receive this approval if it provides 
protection against grounding of the tank vessel comparable to that 
provided by one of the other two measures described in this section.

notice. After considering all relevant material presented, the COTP or 
OCMI shall notify the vessel operator of any amendment required or 
adopted, or the COTP or OCMI may rescind the notice. The amendment 
becomes effective 30 days after the vessel operator receives the notice, 
unless the vessel operator petitions the Commandant to review the COTP 
or OCMI notice, in which case its effective date is delayed pending a 
decision by the Commandant. Petitions to the Commandant must be 
submitted in writing via the COTP or OCMI who issued the requirement to 
amend.
    (c) If the COTP or OCMI finds that there is a condition requiring 
immediate action to prevent the discharge or risk of discharge that 
makes the procedure in paragraph (b) of this section impractical or 
contrary to the public interest, he or she may issue an amendment 
effective on the date the vessel operator receives notice of it. In such 
a case, the COTP or OCMI includes a brief statement of the reasons for 
the findings in the notice, and the vessel operator may petition the 
Commandant, in any manner, to review the amendment. The petition does 
not postpone the amendment.

noted.


<R05>
Sec. 155.1010  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to establish requirements for oil 
spill response plans for certain vessels. The planning criteria in this 
subpart are intended for use in response plan development and the 
identification of resources necessary to respond to the oil spill 
scenarios prescribed during the planning process. The development of a 
response plan prepares the vessel owner or operator and the vessel's 
crew to respond to an oil spill. The specific criteria for response 
resources and their arrival times are not performance standards. They 
are planning criteria based on a set of assumptions that may not exist 
during an actual oil spill incident.


<R05>
Sec. 155.1015  Applicability.

    (2) Operates on the navigable waters of the United States; or
    (3) Transfers oil in a port or place subject to the jurisdiction of 
the United States.
    (b) This subpart also applies to vessels which engage in oil 
lightering operations in the marine environment beyond the baseline from 
which the territorial sea is measured, when the cargo lightered is 
destined for a port or place subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States.
    (c) This subpart does not apply to the following types of vessels:
    (1) Public vessels and vessels deemed public vessels under 14 U.S.C. 
827.
    (2) Vessels that, although constructed or adapted to carry oil in 
bulk as cargo or oil cargo residue, are not storing or carrying oil in 
bulk as cargo or oil cargo residue.
    (3) Dedicated response vessels when conducting response operations.
    (4) Vessels of opportunity when conducting response operations in a 
response area.
    (5) Offshore supply vessels as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101.
    (6) Fishing or fishing tender vessels as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101

industry.
    (7) Foreign flag vessels engaged in innocent passage.

[[Page 389]]

    (d) Vessels covered by this subpart that are not operating within 
the navigable waters or the exclusive economic zone of the United States 
must meet all requirements of this subpart except for--
    (1) Identifying and ensuring, through contract or other approved 
means, the availability of response resources including the shore-based 
spill management team;
    (2) Providing the geographic-specific appendices required in 
Sec. 155.1035, 155.1040, or 155.1045, as appropriate; and

    (a) The following criteria must be used to evaluate the operability 
of response resources identified in the response plan for the specified 
operating environment:
    (1) Table 1 of Appendix B of this part.
    (i) The criteria in Table 1 of Appendix B of this part are to be 
used solely for identification of appropriate equipment in a response 
plan.
    (ii) These criteria reflect conditions used for planning purposes to 
select mechanical response equipment and are not conditions that would 
limit response actions or affect normal vessel operations.
    (2) Limitations that are identified in the Area Contingency Plans 
for the COTP zones in which the vessel operates, including--
    (i) Ice conditions;
    (ii) Debris;
    (iii) Temperature ranges; and
    (iv) Weather-related visibility.
    (b) The COTP may reclassify a specific body of water or location 
within the COTP zone. Any reclassifications will be identified in the 
applicable Area Contingency Plan. Reclassifications may be to--
    (1) A more stringent operating environment if the prevailing wave 
conditions exceed the significant wave height criteria during more than 
35 percent of the year; or
    (2) A less stringent operating environment if the prevailing wave 
conditions do not exceed the significant wave height criteria for the 
less stringent operating environment during more than 35 percent of the 
year.
    (c) Response equipment must--
    (1) Meet or exceed the criteria listed in Table 1 of Appendix B of 
this part;
    (2) Be capable of functioning in the applicable operating 
environment; and
    (3) Be appropriate for the petroleum oil carried.
    (d) The owner or operator of a vessel that carries groups I through 
IV petroleum oil as a primary cargo shall identify in the response plan 
and ensure the availability of, through contract or other approved 
means, the response resources that will respond to a discharge up to the 
vessel's average most probable discharge.
    (1) For a vessel that carries groups I through IV petroleum oil as 
its primary cargo, the response resources must include--
    (i) Containment boom in a quantity equal to twice the length of the 
largest vessel involved in the transfer and capable of being deployed at 
the site of oil transfer operations--
    (A) Within 1 hour of detection of a spill, when the transfer is 
conducted between 0 and 12 miles from the nearest shoreline; or
    (B) Within 1 hour plus travel time from the nearest shoreline, based 
on an on-water speed of 5 knots, when the transfer is conducted over 12 
miles up to 200 miles from the nearest shoreline; and
    (ii) Oil recovery devices and recovered oil storage capacity capable 
of being at the transfer site--
    (A) Within 2 hours of the detection of a spill during transfer 
operations, when the transfer is conducted between 0 and 12 miles from 
the nearest shoreline; or
    (B) Within 1 hour plus travel time from the nearest shoreline, based 
on an on-water speed of 5 knots, when the transfer is conducted over 12 
miles up to 200 miles from the nearest shoreline.
    (2) For locations of multiple vessel transfer operations, a vessel 
may identify the same equipment as identified by other vessels, provided 
that each vessel has ensured access to the equipment through contract or 
other approved means. Under these circumstances, prior approval by the

[[Page 408]]

Coast Guard is not required for temporary changes in the contracted oil 
spill removal organization under Sec. 155.1070(c)(5).
    (3) The owner or operator of a vessel conducting transfer operations 
at a facility required to submit a response plan under 33 CFR 154.1017 
is required to plan for and identify the response resources required in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section. However, the owner or operator is not 
required to ensure by contract or other means the availability of such 
resources.
    (e) The owner or operator of a vessel carrying groups I through IV 
petroleum oil as a primary cargo must identify in the response plan and 
ensure the availability of, through contract or other approved means, 
the response resources necessary to respond to a discharge up to the 
vessel's maximum most probable discharge volume.
    (1) These resources must be positioned such that they can arrive at 
the scene of a discharge within--
    (i) 12 hours of the discovery of a discharge in higher volume port 
areas and the Great Lakes;
    (ii) 24 hours of the discovery of a discharge in all rivers and 
canals, inland, nearshore and offshore areas; and
    (iii) 24 hours of the discovery of a discharge plus travel time from 
shore for open ocean areas.
    (2) The necessary response resources include sufficient containment 
boom, oil recovery devices, and storage capacity for any recovery of up 
to the maximum most probable discharge planning volume.
    (3) The response plan must identify the storage location, make, 
model, and effective daily recovery capacity of each oil recovery device 
that is identified for plan credit.
    (4) The response resources identified for responding to a maximum 
most probable discharge must be positioned to be capable of meeting the 
planned arrival times in this paragraph. The COTP with jurisdiction over 
the area in which the vessel is operating must be notified whenever the 
identified response resources are not capable of meeting the planned 
arrival times.
    (f) The owner or operator of a vessel carrying groups I through IV 
petroleum oil as a primary cargo must identify in the response plan and 
ensure the availability of, through contract or other approved means, 
the response resources necessary to respond to discharges up to the 
worst case discharge volume of the oil cargo to the maximum extent 
practicable.
    (1) The location of these resources must be suitable to meet the 
response times identified for the applicable geographic area(s) of 
operation and response tier.
    (2) The response resources must be appropriate for--
    (i) The capacity of the vessel;
    (ii) Group(s) of petroleum oil carried as cargo; and
    (iii) The geographic area(s) of vessel operation.
    (3) The resources must include sufficient boom, oil recovery 
devices, and storage capacity to recover the planning volumes.
    (4) The response plan must identify the storage location, make, 
model, and effective daily recovery capacity of each oil recovery device 
that is identified for plan credit.
    (5) The guidelines in Appendix B of this part must be used for 
calculating the quantity of response resources required to respond at 
each tier to the worst case discharge to the maximum extent practicable.
    (6) When determining response resources necessary to meet the

    (b) Annually, at least one of the exercises listed in 
Sec. 155.1060(a) (2) and (4) must be unannounced. An unannounced 
exercise is one in which the personnel participating in the exercise 
have not been advised in advance of the exact date, time, and scenario 
of the exercise.
    (c) A vessel owner or operator shall participate in unannounced 
exercises, as directed by the Coast Guard COTP. The objectives of the 
unannounced exercises will be to evaluate notifications and equipment 
deployment for responses to average most probable discharge spill 
scenarios outlined in vessel response plans. The unannounced exercises 
will be limited to four per area per year, an area being that geographic 
area for which a separate and distinct Area Contingency Plan has been 
prepared, as described in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. After 
participating in an unannounced exercise directed by a COTP, the owner 
or operator will not be required to participate in another unannounced 
exercise for at least 3 years from the date of the exercise.
    (d) A vessel owner or operator shall participate in area exercises 
as directed by the applicable on-scene coordinator. The area exercises 
will involve equipment deployment to respond to the spill scenario 
developed by the exercise design team, of which the vessel owner or 
operator will be a member. After participating in an area exercise, a 
vessel owner or operator will not be required to participate in another 
area exercise for at least 6 years.
    (e) The vessel owner or operator shall ensure that adequate exercise 
records are maintained. The following records are required:
    (1) On board the vessel, records of the qualified individual 
notification exercises and the emergency procedures exercises. These 
exercises may be documented in the ship's log or may be kept in a 
separate exercise log.
    (2) At the United States' location of either the qualified 
individual, spill management team, the vessel owner or operator, or the 
oil spill removal organization, records of exercises conducted off the 
vessel. Response plans must indicate the location of these records.
    (f) Records described in paragraph (e) of this section must be 
maintained and available to the Coast Guard for 3 years following 
completion of the exercises.
    (g) The response plan submitted to meet the requirements of this 
subpart must specify the planned exercise program. The plan shall detail 
the exercise program, including the types of exercises, frequencies, 
scopes, objectives, and the scheme for exercising the entire response 
plan every 3 years.
    (h) Compliance with the National Preparedness for Response Exercise 
Program (PREP) Guidelines will satisfy the vessel response plan exercise 
requirements. These guidelines are available from the United States 
Government Printing Office, North Capitol and H Sts., NW., Washington, 
DC 20402.

  Appendix B to Part 155--Determining and Evaluating Required Response 
                   Resources for Vessel Response Plans

                               1. Purpose

    1.1  The purpose of this appendix is to describe the procedures for 
identifying response resources to meet the requirements of subparts D, 
E, F, and G of this part. These guidelines will be used by the vessel 
owner or operator in preparing the response plan and by the Coast Guard 
to review vessel response plans. Response plans submitted under subparts 
F and G of this part will be evaluated under the guidelines in section 2 
and Table 1 of this appendix.

                 2. Equipment Operability and Readiness

    2.1  All equipment identified in a response plan must be capable of 
operating in the conditions expected in the geographic area in which a 
vessel operates. These conditions vary widely based on the location and 
season. Therefore, it is difficult to identify a single stockpile of 
response equipment that will function effectively in every geographic 
location.
    2.2  Vessels storing, handling, or transporting oil in more than one 
operating environment as indicated in Table 1 must identify equipment 
capable of successfully functioning in each operating environment. For 
example, vessels moving from the ocean to a river port must identify 
appropriate equipment designed to meet the criteria for transiting 
oceans, inland waterways, rivers, and canals. This equipment may be 
designed to operate in all of these environments or, more likely, 
different equipment may be designed for use in each area.
    2.3  When identifying equipment for response plan credit, a vessel 
owner or operator must consider the inherent limitations in the 
operability of equipment components and response systems. The criteria 
in Table 1 of this appendix must be used for evaluating the operability 
in a given environment. These criteria reflect the general conditions in 
certain operating areas.
    2.4  Table 1 of this appendix lists criteria for oil recovery 
devices and boom. All other equipment necessary to sustain or support 
response operations in a geographic area must be designed to function in 
the same conditions. For example, boats which deploy or support skimmers 
or boom must be capable of being safely operated in the significant wave 
heights listed for the applicable operating environment. The Coast Guard 
may require documentation that the boom identified in a response plan 
meets the criteria in Table 1 of this appendix. Absent acceptable 
documentation, the Coast Guard may require that the boom be tested to 
demonstrate that it meets the criteria in Table 1 of this appendix. 
Testing must be in accordance with certain American Society for Testing 
Materials (ASTM) standards [ASTM F 715 (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 155.140) Standard Methods of Testing Spill Control Barrier Membrane 
Materials], or other tests approved by the Coast Guard.
    2.5  A vessel owner or operator must refer to the applicable Area 
Contingency Plan to determine if ice, debris, and weather-related 
visibility are significant factors in evaluating the operability of 
equipment. The Area

[[Page 423]]

Contingency Plan will also identify the average temperature ranges 
expected in a geographic area in which a vessel operates. All equipment 
identified in a response plan must be designed to operate within those 
conditions or ranges.
    2.6  The requirements of subparts D, E, F, and G of this part 
establish response resource mobilization and response times. The 
location that the vessel operates farthest from the storage location of 
the response resources must be used to determine whether the resources 
are capable of arriving on scene within the time required. A vessel 
owner or operator shall include the time for notification, mobilization, 
and travel time of resources identified to meet the maximum most 
probable discharge and Tier 1 worst case discharge requirements. For 
subparts D and E of this part, tier 2 and 3 resources must be notified 
and mobilized as necessary to meet the requirements for arrival on 
scene. An on-water speed of 5 knots and a land speed of 35 miles per 
hour is assumed, unless the vessel owner or operator can demonstrate 
otherwise.
    2.7  For subparts D and E of this part, in identifying equipment, 
the vessel owner or operator shall list the storage location, quantity, 
and manufacturer's make and model, unless the oil spill removal 
organization(s) providing the necessary response resources have been 
evaluated by the Coast Guard, and their capability has been determined 
to equal or exceed the response capability needed by the vessel. For oil 
recovery devices, the effective daily recovery capacity, as determined 
using section 6 of this appendix, must be included. For boom, the 
overall boom height (draft plus freeboard) must be included. A vessel 
owner or operator is responsible for ensuring that identified boom has 
compatible connectors.
    2.8  For subparts F and G of this part, in identifying equipment, 
the vessel owner or operator shall list the storage location, quantity, 
and manufacturer's make and model, unless the oil spill removal 
organization(s) providing the necessary response resources have been 
evaluated by the Coast Guard, and their capability has been determined 
to equal or exceed the response capability needed by the vessel. For 
boom, the overall boom height (draft plus freeboard) must be included. A 
vessel owner of operator is responsible for ensuring that identified 
boom has compatible connectors.

3. Determining Response Resources Required for the Average Most Probable 
                                Discharge

    3.1  A vessel owner or operator shall identify and ensure, by 
contract or other approved means, that sufficient response resources are 
available to respond to the 50-barrel average most probable discharge at 
the point of an oil transfer involving a vessel that carries oil as a 
primary cargo. The equipment must be designed to function in the 
operating environment at the point of oil transfer. These resources must 
include--
    3.1.1  Containment boom in a quantity equal to twice the length of 
the largest vessel involved in the transfer capable of being deployed 
within 1 hour of the detection of a spill at the site of oil transfer 
operations. If the transfer operation is more than 12 miles from shore, 
the containment boom must be deployed within 1 hour plus the travel time 
from the nearest shoreline at a speed of 5 knots.
    3.1.2  Oil recovery devices with an effective daily recovery 
capacity of 50 barrels or greater available at the transfer site within 
2 hours of the detection of an oil discharge.
    3.1.3  Oil storage capacity for recovered oily material indicated in 
section 9.2 of this appendix.

4. Determining Response Resources Required for the Maximum Most Probable 
                                Discharge

    4.1  A vessel owner or operator shall identify and ensure, by 
contract or other approved means, that sufficient response resources are 
available to respond to discharges up to the maximum most probable 
discharge volume for that vessel. The resources should be capable of 
containing and collecting up to 2,500 barrels of oil. All equipment 
identified must be designed to operate in the applicable operating 
environment specified in table 1 of this appendix.
    4.2  To determine the maximum most probable discharge volume to be 
used for planning, use the lesser of--
    4.2.1  2500 barrels; or
    4.2.2  10 percent of the total oil cargo capacity.
    4.3  Oil recovery devices necessary to meet the applicable maximum 
most probable discharge volume planning criteria must be located such 
that they arrive on scene within 12 hours of the discovery of a 
discharge in higher volume port areas and the Great Lakes, 24 hours in 
all other rivers and canals, inland, nearshore, and offshore areas, and 
24 hours plus travel time from shore in all open ocean areas.
    4.3.1  Because rapid control, containment, and removal of oil is 
critical to reduce spill impact, the effective daily recovery capacity 
for oil recovery devices must equal 50% of the planning volume 
applicable for the vessel as determined in section 4.2 of this appendix. 
The effective daily recovery capacity for oil recovery devices 
identified in the plan must be determined using the criteria in section 
6 of this appendix.
    4.4  In addition to oil recovery capacity, the vessel owner or 
operator must identify in the response plan and ensure the availability 
of, through contract or other approved means, sufficient boom available 
within the required response times for oil connection and containment, 
and for protection of

[[Page 424]]

shoreline areas. While the regulation does not set required quantities 
of boom for oil collection and containment, the owner or operator of a 
vessel must still identify in a response plan and ensure, through 
contract or other approved means, the availability of the boom 
identified in the plan for this purpose.
    4.5  The plan must indicate the availability of temporary storage 
capacity to meet the requirements of section 9.2 of this appendix. If 
available storage capacity is insufficient to meet this requirement, the 
effective daily recovery capacity must be downgraded to the limits of 
the available storage capacity.
    4.6  The following is an example of a maximum most probable 
discharge volume planning calculation for equipment identification in a 
higher volume port area:
    The vessel's cargo capacity is 10,000 barrels, thus the planning 
volume is 10 percent or 1,000 barrels. The effective daily recovery 
capacity must be 50 percent of the planning volume, for 500 barrels per 
day. The ability of oil recovery devices to meet this capacity will be 
calculated using the procedures in section 6 of this appendix. Temporary 
storage capacity available on scene must equal twice the daily recovery 
capacity as indicated in section 9 of this appendix, or 1000 barrels per 
day. This figure would represent the information the vessel owner or 
operator would use to identify and ensure the availability of, through 
contract or other approved means, the required response resources. The 
vessel owner would also need to identify how much boom was available for 
use.

5. Determining Response Resources Required for the Worst Case Discharge 
                    to the Maximum Extent Practicable

    5.1  A vessel owner or operator shall identify and ensure, by 
contract or other approved means, that sufficient response resources are 
available to respond to the worst case discharge of oil cargo to the 
maximum extent practicable. Section 7 of this appendix describes the 
method to determine the required response resources.
    5.2  Oil spill recovery devices identified to meet the applicable 
worst case discharge planning volume must be located such that they can 
arrive at the scene of a discharge within the time specified for the 
applicable response tier listed in Sec. 155.1050(g).
    5.3  The effective daily recovery capacity for oil recovery devices 
identified in a response plan must be determined using the criteria in 
section 6 of this appendix. A vessel owner or operator shall identify 
the storage locations of all equipment that must be used to fulfill the 
requirements for each tier.
    5.4  A vessel owner or operator shall identify the availability of 
temporary storage capacity to meet the requirements of section 9.2 of 
this appendix. If available storage capacity is insufficient to meet 
this requirement, then the effective daily recovery capacity must be 
downgraded to the limits of the available storage capacity.
    5.5  When selecting response resources necessary to meet the 
response plan requirements, the vessel owner or operator must ensure 
that a portion of those resources are capable of being used in close-to-
shore response activities in shallow water. The following percentages of 
the on-water response equipment identified for the applicable geographic 
area must be capable of operating in waters of 6 feet or less depth:
    (i) Open ocean--none.
    (ii) Offshore--10 percent.
    (iii) Nearshore, inland, Great Lakes, and rivers and canals--20 
percent.
    5.6  In addition to oil spill recovery devices and temporary storage 
capacity, a vessel owner or operator shall identify in the response plan 
and ensure the availability of, through contract or other approved 
means, sufficient boom that can arrive on scene within the required 
response times for oil containment and collection. The specific quantity 
of boom required for collection and containment will depend on the 
specific recovery equipment and strategies employed. Table 2 of this 
appendix lists the minimum quantities of additional boom required for 
shoreline protection that a vessel owner or operator shall identify in 
the response plan and ensure the availability of, through contract or 
other approved means.
    5.7  A vessel owner or operator shall also identify in the response 
plan and ensure, by contract or other approved means, the availability 
of an oil spill removal organization capable of responding to a 
shoreline cleanup operation involving the calculated volume of 
emulsified oil that might impact the affected shoreline. The volume of 
oil for which a vessel owner or operator should plan should be 
calculated through the application of factors contained in Tables 3 and 
4 of this appendix. The volume calculated from these tables is intended 
to assist the vessel owner or operator in identifying a contractor with 
sufficient resources. This planning volume is not used explicitly to 
determine a required amount of equipment and personnel.

   6. Determining Effective Daily Recovery Capacity for Oil Recovery 
                                 Devices

    6.1  Oil recovery devices identified by a vessel owner or operator 
must be identified by manufacturer, model, and effective daily recovery 
capacity. These capacities must be to meet the applicable planning 
criteria for the average most probable discharge; maximum most probable 
discharge; and worst case discharge to the maximum extent practicable.
    6.2  For the purposes of determining the effective daily recovery 
capacity of oil recovery devices, the following method will be

[[Page 425]]

used. This method considers potential limitations due to available 
daylight, weather, sea state, and percentage of emulsified oil in the 
recovered material. The Coast Guard may assign a lower efficiency factor 
to equipment listed in a response plan if it determines that such a 
reduction is warranted.
    6.2.1  The following formula must be used to calculate the effective 
daily recovery capacity:

R=Tx24xE

R--Effective daily recovery capacity
T--Throughput rate in barrels per hour (nameplate capacity)
E--20% efficiency factor (or lower factor as determined by the Coast 
          Guard)
    6.2.2  For those devices in which the pump limits the throughput of 
liquid, throughput rate will be calculated using the pump capacity.
    6.2.3  For belt or mop type devices, the throughput rate will be 
calculated using data provided by the manufacturer on the nameplate 
rated capacity for the device.
    6.2.4  Vessel owners or operators including in the response plan oil 
recovery devices whose throughput is not measurable using a pump 
capacity or belt or mop capacity may provide information to support an 
alternative method of calculation. This information must be submitted 
following the procedures in section 6.5 of this appendix.
    6.3  As an alternative to section 6.2 of this appendix, a vessel 
owner or operator may submit adequate evidence that a different 
effective daily recovery capacity should be applied for a specific oil 
recovery device. Adequate evidence is actual verified performance data 
in spill conditions or test using certain ASTM standards [ASTM F 631 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 155.140) Standard Method for 
Testing Full Scale Advancing Spill Removal Devices], or an equivalent 
test approved by the Coast Guard.
    6.3.1  The following formula must be used to calculate the effective 
daily recovery capacity under this alternative:

R=DxU

R--Effective daily recovery capacity
D--Average Oil Recovery Rate in barrels per hour (Item 13.2.16 in ASTM F 
          631; or actual performance data)
U--Hours per day that a vessel owner or operator can document capability 
          to operate equipment under spill conditions. Ten hours per day 
          must be used unless a vessel owner or operator can demonstrate 
          that the recovery operation can be sustained for longer 
          periods.
    6.4  A vessel owner or operator submitting a response plan shall 
provide data that supports the effective daily recovery capacities for 
the oil recovery devices listed. The following is an example of these 
calculations:
    A weir skimmer identified in a response plan has a manufacturer's 
rated throughput at the pump of 267 gallons per minute (gpm).

267 gpm=381 barrels per hour
R=381x24x.2=1,829 barrels per day

    After testing using ASTM procedures, the skimmer's oil recovery rate 
is determined to be 220 gpm. The vessel owner or operator identifies 
sufficient resources available to support operations 12 hours per day.

220 gpm=314 barrels per hour
R=314x12=3,768 barrels per day

    A vessel owner or operator will be able to use the higher capacity 
if sufficient temporary oil storage capacity is available.
    6.5  Determinations of alternative efficiency factors under section 
6.2 or alternative effective daily recovery capacities under section 6.3 
of this appendix will be made by Commandant (G-MOR), Coast Guard 
Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593. Oil spill 
removal organizations or equipment manufacturers may submit required 
information on behalf of multiple vessel owners or operators.

        7. Calculating the Worst Case Discharge Planning Volumes

    7.1  A vessel owner or operator shall plan for a response to a 
vessel's worst case discharge volume of oil cargo. The planning for on-
water recovery must take into account a loss of some oil to the 
environment due to evaporations and natural dissipation, potential 
increases in volume due to emulsification, and the potential for deposit 
of some oil on the shoreline.
    7.2  The following procedures must be used to calculate the planning 
volume used by a vessel owner or operator for determining required on-
water recovery capacity:
    7.2.1  The following must be determined: the total volume of oil 
cargo carried; the appropriate cargo group for the type of petroleum oil 
carried [persistent (groups II, III, and IV) or non-persistent (group 
I)]; and the geographic area(s) in which the vessel operates. For 
vessels carrying mixed cargoes from different petroleum oil groups, each 
group must be calculated separately. This information is to be used with 
Table 3 of this appendix to determine the percentages of the total cargo 
volume to be used for removal capacity planning. This table divides the 
cargo volume into three categories: oil lost to the environment; oil 
deposited on the shoreline; and oil available for on-water recovery.
    7.2.2  The on-water oil recovery volume must be adjusted using the 
appropriate emulsification factor found in Table 4 of this appendix.
    7.2.3  The adjusted volume is multiplied by the on-water oil 
recovery resource mobilization factor found in Table 5 of this appendix

[[Page 426]]

from the appropriate operating area and response tier to determine the 
total on-water oil recovery capacity in barrels per day that must be 
identified or contracted for to arrive on scene within the applicable 
time for each response tier. Three tiers are specified. For higher 
volume port areas, the contracted tiers of resources must be located 
such that they can arrive on scene within 12, 36, and 60 hours of the 
discovery of an oil discharge. For the Great Lakes, these tiers are 18, 
42, and 66 hours. For rivers and canals, inland, nearshore, and 
offshore, these tiers are 24, 48, and 72 hours. For the open ocean area, 
these tiers are 24, 48, and 72 hours with an additional travel time 
allowance of 1 hour for every additional 5 nautical miles from shore.
    7.2.4  The resulting on-water recovery capacity in barrels per day 
for each tier is used to identify response resources necessary to 
sustain operations in the applicable geographic area. The equipment must 
be capable of sustaining operations for the time period specified in 
Table 3 of this appendix. A vessel owner or operator shall identify and 
ensure the availability of, through contract or other approved means, 
sufficient oil spill recovery devices to provide the effective daily oil 
recovery capacity required. If the required capacity exceeds the 
applicable cap described in Table 6 of this appendix, then a vessel 
owner or operator must contract only for the quantity of resources 
required to meet the cap, but shall identify sources of additional 
resources as indicated in Sec. 155.1050(o). The owner or operator of a 
vessel whose planning volume exceeded the cap in 1993 should plan for 
additional capacity to be under contract by 1998 or 2003, as 
appropriate. For a vessel that carries multiple groups of oil, the 
required effective daily recovery capacity for each group is calculated 
and summed before applying the cap.
    7.3  The following procedures must be used to calculate the planning 
volume for identifying shoreline cleanup capacity:
    7.3.1  The following must be determined: the total volume of oil 
cargo carried; the appropriate cargo group for the type of petroleum oil 
carried [persistent (groups II, III, and IV) or non-persistent (group 
I)]; and the geographic area(s) in which the vessel operates. For a 
vessel carrying cargoes from different oil groups, each group must be 
calculated separately. Using this information, Table 3 of this appendix 
must be used to determine the percentages of the total cargo volume to 
be used for shoreline cleanup resource planning.
    7.3.2  The shoreline cleanup planning volume must be adjusted to 
reflect an emulsification factor using the same procedure as described 
in section 7.2.2 of this appendix.
    7.3.3  The resulting volume will be used to identify an oil spill 
removal organization with the appropriate shoreline cleanup capability.
    7.4  The following is an example of the procedure described above:
    A vessel with a 100,000 barrel capacity for <greek-i>6 oil (specific 
gravity .96) will move from a higher volume port area to another area. 
The vessel's route will be 70 miles from shore.

Cargo carried: 100,000 bbls. Group IV oil Emulsification factor (from 
          Table 4 of this appendix): 1.4 Areas transited: Inland, 
          Nearshore, Offshore, Open ocean
Planned % on-water recovery (from Table 3 of this appendix):
    Inland 50%
    Nearshore 50%
    Offshore 40%
    Open ocean 20%
Planned % oil onshore recovery (from Table 3 of this appendix):
    Inland 70%
    Nearshore 70%
    Offshore 30%
    Open ocean 30%

General formula to determine planning volume:
(planning volume)=(capacity)x(% from Table 3 of this 
          appendix)x(emulsification factor from Table 4 of this 
          appendix)
Planning volumes for on-water recovery:
    Inland 100,000x.5x1.4=70,000 bbls
    Nearshore 100,000x.5x1.4=70,000 bbls
    Offshore 100,000x.4x1.4=56,000 bbls
    Open ocean 100,000x.2x1.4=28,000 bbls
Planning volumes for on shore recovery:
    Inland 100,000x.7x1.4=98,000 bbls
    Nearshore 100,000x.7x1.4=98,000 bbls
    Offshore 100,000x.3x1.4=42,000 bbls
    The vessel owner or operator must contract with a response resource 
capable of managing a 98,000-barrel shoreline cleanup in those areas 
where the vessel comes closer than 50 miles to shore.
    Determining required resources for on-water recovery for each tier 
using mobilization factors: (barrel per day on-water recovery 
requirements)=(on-water planning volume as calculated 
above)x(mobilization factor from Table 5 of this appendix).

Open ocean 28,000..............   x         .06         .10          .12
 
                        equals (barrels per day)

[[Page 427]]

 
Open ocean.....................           1,680    2,800           3,360
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Since the requirements for Tier 1 for inland and nearshore exceed 
the caps, the vessel owner would only need to contract for 10,000 
barrels per day for Tier 1. No additional equipment would be required to 
be identified because the required Tier 3 resources are below the Tier 3 
caps.
    10% of the on-water recovery capability for offshore, and 20% of the 
capability for inland/nearshore, for all tiers, must be capable of 
operating in water with a depth of 6 feet or less.
    The vessel owner or operator would also be required to identify or 
contract for quantities of boom identified in Table 2 of this appendix 
for the areas in which the vessel operates.

      8. Determining the Availability of High-Rate Response Methods

    8.1  Response plans for a vessel carrying group II or III persistent 
oil as a primary cargo that operates in an area with year-round pre-
approval for dispersant use may receive credit for up to 25 percent of 
their required on-water recovery capacity in that area for 1993 if the 
availability of these resources are ensured by contract or other 
approved means. For response plan credit, these resources must be 
capable of being on scene within 12 hours of the discovery of a 
discharge.
    8.2  To receive credit against any required on-water recovery 
capacity, a response plan must identify the locations of dispersant 
stockpiles, methods of transporting to a shoreside staging area, and 
appropriate aircraft or vessels to apply the dispersant and monitor its 
effectiveness at the scene of an oil discharge.
    8.2.1  Sufficient volumes of dispersants must be available to treat 
the oil at the dosage rate recommended by the dispersant manufacturer. 
Dispersants identified in a response plan must be on the National 
Contingency Plan Product Schedule maintained by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency. (Some States have a list of approved dispersants and 
within State waters only they can be used.)
    8.2.2  Dispersant application equipment identified in a response 
plan for credit must be located such that it can be mobilized to 
shoreside staging areas to meet the time requirements in section 8.1 of 
this appendix. Sufficient equipment capacity and sources of appropriate 
dispersants must be identified to sustain dispersant operations for at 
least 3 days.
    8.2.3  Credit against on-water recovery capacity in pre-approved 
areas will be based on the ability to treat oil at a rate equivalent to 
this credit. For example, a 2,500 barrels per day credit against the 
10,000 barrels per day on-water Tier 1 cap would require the vessel 
owner or operator to demonstrate the ability to treat 2,500 barrels per 
day of oil at the manufacturer's recommended dosage rate. Assuming a 
dosage rate of 10:1, the plan would need to show stockpiles and sources 
of 750 barrels of dispersants that would be available on scene at a rate 
of 250 barrels per day and the ability to apply the dispersant at the 
daily rate for 3 days in the area in which the vessel operates. Similar 
data would need to be provided for any additional credit against Tier 2 
and 3 resources.
    8.3  In addition to the equipment and supplies required, a vessel 
owner or operator shall identify a source of support to conduct the 
monitoring and post-use effectiveness evaluation required by applicable 
Local and Area Contingency Plans.
    8.4  Identification of the resources for dispersant application does 
not imply that the use of this technique will be authorized. Actual 
authorization for use during a spill response will be governed by the 
provisions of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Contingency Plan 
(40 CFR part 300) and the applicable Local or Area Contingency Plan.
    8.5  In addition to the credit identified above, a vessel owners or 
operators that operates in areas pre-approved for dispersant use may 
reduce their required on-water recovery cap increases for 1998 and 2003 
by up to 50% by identifying non-mechanical methods.
    8.6  The use of in-situ burning as a non-mechanical response method 
is still being studied. Because limitations and uncertainties remain for 
the use of this method, it may not be used to reduce required oil 
recovery capacity in 1993. Use of this or other alternative high-rate 
methods for a portion of the required cap increase in 1998 will be 
determined during the cap increase review in 1996.

    9. Additional Equipment Necessary to Sustain Response Operations

    9.1  A vessel owner or operator is responsible for ensuring that 
sufficient numbers of trained personnel, boats, aerial spotting 
aircraft, sorbent materials, boom anchoring materials, and other 
resources are a available to sustain response operations to completion. 
All such equipment must be suitable for use with the primary equipment 
identified in the response plan. A vessel owner or

[[Page 428]]

operator is not required to list these resources in the response plan, 
but shall certify their availability.
    9.2  A vessel owner or operator shall evaluate the availability of 
adequate temporary storage capacity to sustain the effective daily 
recovery capacities from equipment identified in the plan. Because of 
the inefficiencies of oil spill recovery devices, response plans must 
identify daily storage capacity equivalent to twice the effective daily 
recovery capacity required on scene. This temporary storage capacity may 
be reduced if a vessel owner or operator can demonstrate by waste stream 
analysis that the efficiencies of the oil recovery devices, ability to 
decant water, or the availability of alternative temporary storage or 
disposal locations in the area(s) the vessel will operate will reduce 
the overall volume of oily material storage requirements.
    9.3  A vessel owner or operator shall ensure that their planning 
includes the capability to arrange for disposal of recovered oil 
products. Specific disposal procedures will be addressed in the 
applicable Area Contingency Plan.

 Appendix C to Part 155--Training Elements for Oil Spill Response Plans

                               1. General

    1.1  The portion of the plan dealing with training is one of the key 
elements of a response plan. This concept is clearly expressed by the 
fact that Congress, in writing the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, 
specifically included training as one of the sections required in a 
vessel or facility response plan. In reviewing submitted response plans, 
it has been noted that the plans often do not provide sufficient 
information in the training section of the plan for either the user or 
the reviewer of the plan. In some cases, plans simply state that the 
crew and others will be training in their duties and responsibilities, 
with no other information being provided. In other plans, information is 
simply given that required parties will receive the necessary worker 
safety training (HAZWOPER).
    1.2  The training section of the plan need not be a detailed course 
syllabus, but it must contain sufficient information to allow the user 
and reviewer (or evaluator) to have an understanding of those areas that 
are believed to be critical. Plans should identify key skill areas and 
the training that is required to ensure that the individual identified 
will be capable of performing the duties prescribed to them. It should 
also describe how the training will be delivered to the various 
personnel. Further, this section of the plan must work in harmony with 
those sections of the plan dealing with exercises, the spill management 
team, and the qualified individual.
    1.3  The material in this appendix C is not all-inclusive and is 
provided for guidance only.

                       2. Elements to be Addressed

    2.1  To assist in the preparation of the training section of a 
vessel response plan, some of the key elements that should be addressed 
are indicated in the following sections. Again, while it is not 
necessary that the comprehensive training program for the company be 
included in the response plan, it is necessary for the plan to convey 
the elements that define the program as appropriate.
    2.2  An effective spill response training program should consider 
and address the following:
    2.2.1  Notification requirements and procedures.
    2.2.2  Communication system(s) used for the notifications.
    2.2.3  Procedures to mitigate or prevent any discharge or a 
substantial threat of a discharge of oil resulting from--
    2.2.3.1  Operational activities associated with internal or external 
cargo transfers;
    2.2.3.2   Grounding or stranding;
    2.2.3.3  Collision;
    2.2.3.4  Explosion or fire;
    2.2.3.5  Hull failure;
    2.2.3.6  Excessive list; or
    2.2.3.7  Equipment failure.
    2.2.4  Procedures and arrangements for emergency towing.
    2.2.5  When performing shipboard mitigation measures--
    2.2.5.1  Ship salvage procedures;
    2.2.5.2  Damage stability; and
    2.2.5.3  Hull stress considerations.
    2.2.6  Procedures for transferring responsibility for direction of 
response activities from vessel and facility personnel to the spill 
management team.
    2.2.7  Familiarity with the operational capabilities of the 
contracted oil spill removal organizations and the procedures to notify 
and activate such organizations.
    2.2.8  Familiarity with the contracting and ordering procedures to 
acquire oil spill removal organization resources.
    2.2.9  Familiarity with the Area Contingency Plans.
    2.2.10  Familiarity with the organizational structures that will be 
used to manage the response actions.
    2.2.11  Responsibilities and duties of the spill management team 
members in accordance with designated job responsibilities.
    2.2.12  Responsibilities and authority of the qualified individual 
as described in the vessel response plan and company response 
organization.
    2.2.13  Responsibilities of designated individuals to initiate a 
response and supervise shore-based response resources.
    2.2.14  Actions to take, in accordance with designated job 
responsibilities, in the event of a transfer system leak, tank overflow, 
or suspected cargo tank or hull leak.
    2.2.15  Information on the cargoes handled by the vessel or 
facility, including familiarity with--
    2.2.15.1  Cargo material safety data sheets;
    2.2.15.2  Chemical characteristics of the cargo;
    2.2.15.3  Special handling procedures for the cargo;
    2.2.15.4  Health and safety hazards associated with the cargo; and
    2.2.15.5  Spill and firefighting procedures for the cargo.
    2.2.16  Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements 
for worker health and safety (29 CFR 1910.120).

                        3. Further Considerations

    In drafting the training section of the response plan, some further 
considerations are noted below (these points are raised simply as a 
reminder):
    3.1  The training program should focus on training provided to 
vessel personnel.

[[Page 434]]

    3.2  An organization is comprised of individuals, and a training 
program should be structured to recognize this fact by ensuring that 
training is tailored to the needs of the individuals involved in the 
program.
    3.3  An owner or operator may identify equivalent work experience 
which fulfills specific training requirements.
    3.4  The training program should include participation in periodic 
announced and unannounced exercises. This participation should 
approximate the actual roles and responsibilities of individuals as 
specified in the response plan.
    3.5  Training should be conducted periodically to reinforce the 
required knowledge and to ensure an adequate degree of preparedness by 
individuals with responsibilities under the vessel response plan.
    3.6  Training may be delivered via a number of different means; 
including classroom sessions, group discussions, video tapes, self study 
workbooks, resident training courses, on-the-job training, or other 
means as deemed appropriate to ensure proper instruction.
    3.7  New employees should complete the training program prior to 
being assigned job responsibilities which require participation in 
emergency response situations.

                              4. Conclusion

    The information in this appendix is only intended to assist response 
plan preparers in reviewing the content of and in modifying the training 
section of their response plans. It may be more comprehensive than is 
needed for some vessels and not comprehensive enough for others. The 
Coast Guard expects that plan preparers have determined the training 
needs of their organizations created by the development of the response 
plans and the actions identified as necessary to increase the 
preparedness of the company and its personnel to respond to actual or 
threatened discharges of oil from their vessels.

Sec. 156.205  Definitions.

    (a) In addition to the terms defined in this section, the 
definitions in Sec. 154.105 of this chapter apply to this subpart and to 
subpart C.
    (b) As used in this subpart and subpart C:
    Lightering or Lightering operation means the transfer of a cargo of 
oil or a hazardous material in bulk from one vessel to another, 
including all phases of the operation from the beginning of the mooring 
operation to the departure of the service vessel from the vessel to be 
lightered, except when that cargo is intended only for use as fuel or 
lubricant aboard the receiving vessel.
    Marine environment means--
    (1) The navigable waters of the United States;
    (2) The waters of an area over which the United States asserts 
exclusive fishery management authority; and
    (3) The waters superadjacent to the Outer Continental Shelf of the 
United States.
    Service vessel means the vessel which receives a cargo of oil or a 
hazardous material from another vessel in a lightering operation.
    Vessel to be lightered means the vessel which transports a cargo of 
oil or a hazardous material to a place within the marine environment for 
transfer of that cargo to another vessel for further transport to a port 
or place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The term 
``vessel to be lightered'' does not include drilling rigs, or offshore 
supply vessels transferring cargo intended for use as fuel or lubricant 
aboard the receiving vessel.
    Work includes any administrative duties associated with the vessel 
whether performed on board the vessel or onshore.

Sec. 156.210  General.

    (a) No vessel may transfer oil or hazardous materials in a port or 
place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, if the cargo has 
been lightered from another vessel, unless:
    (1) The regulations in this subpart have been complied with;
    (2) Both the vessel to be lightered and service vessel have, on 
board, at the time of transfer, a valid Certificate of Inspection, 
Certificate of Compliance, or a Tank Vessel Examination Letter, as would 
have been required under 46 U.S.C. 3710 or 3711, had the transfer taken 
place in a port or place subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States;
    (3) The delivering and receiving vessels have on board at the time 
of transfer, evidence that each vessel is operating in compliance with 
section 311(j) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 
1321(j)) and applicable regulations issued under the authority of 
section 311(j) in the form of a Declaration of Inspection as required by 
Sec. 156.150 and a vessel response plan if required under part 155 of 
this chapter; and
    Note: Under 46 U.S.C. 3715, the delivering and receiving vessels 
must have on board at the time of transfer, a Certificate of Financial 
Responsibility that would be required if the transfer had taken place in 
a location subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Regulations 
concerning Certificates of Financial Responsibility for vessels using 
the navigable waters of the U.S. are in part 130 of this chapter.
    (4) The vessel to be lightered has on board, at the time of 
transfer, an International Oil Pollution Prevention (IOPP) Certificate 
or equivalent documentation of compliance with Annex I of the 
International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 
1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL 73/
78), as would be required by Part 151 of this chapter for vessels in 
navigable waters of the United States. The IOPP Certificate or 
documentation of compliance shall be that prescribed by Secs. 151.19 and 
151.21 of this chapter, and shall be effective under the same timetable 
as specified in Sec. 151.19.
    (b) Lightering operations involving hazardous materials, other than 
oil, may be conducted only with the specific approval of the Commandant. 
A request to lighter hazardous materials, other than oil, must be 
submitted to Commandant (G-M) prior to the planned beginning of 
lightering operations. The request must include the information 
described in Sec. 156.215(a) to

[[Page 443]]

the extent known, for the initial transfer, and the estimated frequency 
of subsequent lightering operations. After the entry into force of Annex 
II to MARPOL 73/78, vessels lightering hazardous materials shall carry 
an International Pollution Prevention Certificate for the Carriage of 
Noxious Liquid Substances in Bulk (1973), if required by Annex II to 
MARPOL 73/78, or equivalent documentation of compliance with the annex.
    (c) In an emergency, the COTP, upon request, may authorize a 
deviation from any rule in this part if the COTP determines that its 
application will endanger persons, property, or the environment.
    (d) On vessels conducting lightering operations in a designated 
lightering zone, a licensed individual or seaman may not work, except in 
an emergency or a drill, more than 15 hours in any 24-hour period, or 
more than 36 hours in any 72-hour period, including the 24-hour and 72-

Sec. 157.09  Segregated ballast.

    (a) A new vessel of 70,000 tons DWT or more must have segregated 
ballast tanks that have a total capacity to allow the vessel to meet the 
draft and trim requirements in paragraph (b) of this section without 
recourse to the use of oil tanks for water ballast.
    (b) In any ballast condition during any part of a voyage, including 
that of lightweight with only segregated ballast, the vessel's drafts 
and trim must have the capability of meeting each of the following 
requirements:
    (1) The molded draft amidship (dm) in meters without taking into 
account vessel deformation must not be less than dm in the following 
mathematical relationship:

dm=2.0+0.02L
    (2) The drafts at the forward and after perpendiculars must 
correspond to those determined by the draft amidship as specified in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, in association with the trim by the 
stern of no more than 0.015L.
    (3) The minimum allowable draft at the after perpendicular is that 
which is necessary to obtain full immersion of the propeller.
    (c) The vessel may be designed to carry ballast water in cargo tanks 
during the condition described in Sec. 157.35.
    (d) Segregated ballast spaces, voids, and other noncargo-carrying 
spaces for a vessel of conventional form must be distributed:
    (1) So that the mathematical average of the hypothetical collision 
(O<INF>c</INF>) and the hypothetical stranding (O<INF>s</INF>) outflows 
as determined by the application of the procedures in Sec. 157.19 and 
Appendix B is 80 percent or less of the maximum allowable outflow 
(O<INF>A</INF>) as determined by Sec. 157.19(b)(1); and
    (2) To protect at least 45 percent of the sum of the side and bottom 
shell areas, based upon projected molded dimensions, within the cargo 
tank length. When the vessel design configuration does not provide for 
the spaces to be distributed to protect at least 45 percent of the side 
and bottom shell areas, the spaces must be distributed so that the 
mathematical average of the hypothetical collision (O<INF>c</INF>) and 
the hypothetical stranding (O<INF>s</INF>) outflows, determined by 
application of the procedures in Sec. 157.19 and Appendix B, is a 
further 2 percent less than the maximum allowable outflow 
(O<INF>a</INF>) for each 1 percent by which the shell area protection 
coverage required is not achieved.
    (e) A ballast space, void or other non-cargo-carrying space used to 
meet requirements in paragraph (d) of this section must separate the 
cargo tank boundaries from the shell plating of the vessel by at least 2 
meters.
    (f) A vessel of conventional form for application of this section 
has:
    (1) A block coefficient of .80 or greater,
    (2) A length to depth ratio between 12 and 16, and
    (3) A breadth to depth ratio between 1.5 and 3.5.
    (g) Segregated ballast spaces, voids, and other noncargo-carrying 
spaces for a vessel not of conventional form must be distributed in a 
configuration acceptable to the Coast Guard.

Sec. 157.21  Subdivision and stability.

    A new vessel that is a U.S. vessel must meet the following 
subdivision and damage stability criteria after assuming side and bottom 
damages, as defined in Appendix B of this Part. A U.S. vessel that meets 
the requirements in this section is considered by the Coast Guard as 
meeting 46 CFR 42.20-5.
    (a) The final waterline, taking into account sinkage, heel, and 
trim, must be below the lower edge of an opening through which 
progressive flooding may take place, such as an air pipe, or any opening 
that is closed by means of a weathertight door or hatch cover. This 
opening does not include an opening closed by a:
    (1) Watertight manhole cover;
    (2) Flush scuttle;
    (3) Small watertight cargo tank hatch cover that maintains the high 
integrity of the deck;
    (4) Remotely operated watertight sliding door; or
    (5) Side scuttle of the non-opening type.
    (b) In the final stage of flooding, the angle of heel due to 
unsymmetrical flooding must not exceed 25 degrees, except that this 
angle may be increased to 30 degrees if no deck edge immersion occurs.
    (c) For acceptable stability in the final stage of flooding, the 
righting lever curve must have a range of at least 20 degrees beyond the 
position of equilibrium in association with a maximum residual righting 
lever of at least 0.1 meter. For the calculations required in this 
section, weathertight openings or openings fitted with automatic 
closures (e.g., a vent fitted with a ball check valve), need not be 
considered as points of downflooding within the range of residual 
stability, but other openings must be accounted for in the calculation.

Sec. 157.102 to determine whether or not, when entering a port, the 
cargo tanks that carry crude oil meet the following:
    (1) After each tank is crude oil washed but not water rinsed, except 
the bottom of the tank may be flushed with water and stripped, each tank 
is essentially free of oil residues to a degree acceptable to the Coast 
Guard inspector.
    (2) After the tanks that are to be used as ballast tanks when 
leaving the port are crude oil washed and stripped but not water rinsed 
or bottom flushed, they are filled with water and the total volume of 
crude oil floating on top of the water in these tanks is 0.085 percent 
or less of the total volume of these tanks.
    (b) Except on a tank vessel under Sec. 157.10(e), if the initial 
inspection under paragraph (a) of this section has been passed and the

 Appendix A to Part 157--Damage Assumptions, Hypothetical Outflows, and 
                    Cargo Tank Size and Arrangements

    1. Source. The procedures for the damage assumption calculations 
contained in this Appendix conform to Regulations 22, 23, and 24 of 
Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of the 
Pollution from Ships, 1973, done at London, November 2, 1973.
    2. Assumptions. For the purpose of calculating hypothetical outflow 
from tank vessels, three dimensions of the extent of damage of a 
parallelepiped on the side and bottom of the vessel are assumed.
    (a) For side damage, the conditions are as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  Damage                             Conditions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Longitudinal extent l<INF>c</INF>................  \1/3\ L<SUP>2[sol]3</SUP> or 14.5 m,
                                             whichever is less.
(2) Transverse extent (t<INF>c</INF>) (inboard from    B
 the vessel's side at right angles to the   --or 11.5 m, whichever is 5
 centerline at the level corresponding to    less.
 the assigned summer freeboard).
(3) Vertical extent (v<INF>c</INF>)..................  From the base line upwards
                                             without limit.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) For bottom damage, two conditions to be applied individually to 
the stated portions of the vessel, as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                               Conditions
                              ------------------------------------------
            Damage                For 0.3L from the
                                forward perpendicular    Any other part
                                       of ship               of ship
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Longitudinal extent (l s)  L/10...................  L/10 or 5
                                                         meters,
                                                         whichever is
                                                         less.
(2) Transverse extent (t s)..  B/6 or 10 meters,        5 meters.
                                whichever is less but
                                not less than 5 meters.
(3) Vertical extent from the   B/15 or 6 meters,        B/15 or 6
 base line (v<INF>s</INF>).                whichever is less.       meters,
                                                         whichever is
                                                         less.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3. Hypothetical Outflow of Oil. (a) The hypothetical outflow of oil 
in the case of side damage (O<INF>c</INF>) and bottom damage 
(O<INF>s</INF>) is calculated by the following formula with respect to 
compartments breached by damage to all conceivable locations along the 
length of the vessel to the extent as defined in section 2 of this 
Appendix.

    (1) For side damages: Formula
    O<INF>c</INF> = <INF>[Sigma]</INF> W<INF>i</INF>+<INF>[Sigma]</INF> 
K<INF>i</INF>C<INF>i
    </INF>(2) For bottom damage: Formula II
    O<INF>s</INF> = \1/3\(<INF>[Sigma]</INF> 
Z<INF>i</INF>W<INF>i</INF>+<INF>[Sigma]</INF> 
Z<INF>i</INF>C<INF>i</INF>)
Where:
W<INF>i</INF>=Volume of a wing tank assumed to be breached by the damage 
as specified in section 2 of this Appendix; W<INF>i</INF> for a 
segregated ballast tank may be taken equal to zero;
C<INF>i</INF>=Volume of a center tank assumed to be breached by the 
damage as specified in section 2 of this Appendix; C<INF>i</INF> for a 
segregated ballast tank may be taken equal to zero;
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.180

when b<INF>i</INF> is equal to or greater than t<INF>c</INF>, K<INF>i</INF> 
is equal to zero;
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.181

when h<INF>i</INF> is equal to or greater than v<INF>s</INF>, Z<INF>i</INF> 
is equal to zero;
b<INF>i</INF>=Minimum width of wing tank under consideration measured 
inboard from the vessel's side at right angles to the centerline at the 
level corresponding to the assigned summer freeboard; and
h<INF>i</INF>=Minimum depth of the double bottom under consideration; 
where no double bottom is fitted, h<INF>i</INF> is equal to zero.
    (b) If a void space or segregated ballast tank of a length less than 
l<INF>c</INF> is located between wing oil tanks, O<INF>c</INF> in 
formula I of this section may be calculated on the basis of volume 
W<INF>i</INF> being the actual volume of one such tank (where they are 
of equal capacity) or the smaller of the two tanks (if they differ in 
capacity), adjacent to such space, multiplied by S<INF>i</INF> as 
defined below and taking for all other wing tanks involved in such a 
collision the value of the actual full volume.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.182

Where l<INF>i</INF>=length of void space or segregated ballast tank 
under consideration.
    (c) Credit is only given in respect to double bottom tanks which are 
either empty or carrying clean water when cargo is carried in the tanks 
above.
    (1) If the double bottom does not extend for the full length and 
width of the tank involved, the double bottom is considered nonexistent 
and the volume of the tanks above the area of the bottom damage must be 
included in formula II of this section even if the tank is not 
considered breached because of the installation of such a partial double 
bottom.
    (2) Suction wells may be neglected in the determination of the value 
h<INF>i</INF> if such wells are not excessive in area and extend below

[[Page 494]]

the tank for a minimum distance and in no case more than half the height 
of the double bottom. If the depth of such a well exceeds half the 
height of the double bottom, h<INF>i</INF> is taken equal to the double 
bottom height minus the well height.
    (d) In the case where bottom damage simultaneously involves four 
center tanks, the value of O<INF>s</INF> may be calculated according to 
formula III as follows:
    O<INF>s</INF> = \1/4\(<INF>[Sigma]</INF> 
Z<INF>i</INF>W<INF>i</INF>+<INF>[Sigma]</INF> 
Z<INF>i</INF>C<INF>i</INF>)
    (e) Credit for reduced oil outflow from bottom damage may be applied 
to formula III for an installed emergency high suction cargo transfer 
system that:
    (1) transfers within two hours oil equal to one half of the volume 
of the largest tank involved;
    (2) has sufficient ballast or cargo tankage available to receive the 
transferred oil; and
    (3) has the high suction piping installed at a height not less than 
the vertical extent of bottom damage (v<INF>s</INF>).
    4. Allowable volumes of cargo tanks.
    (a) The allowable volume of a wing cargo tank (VOL<INF>w</INF>) is 
equal to seventy-five percent of O<INF>A</INF>. In a segregated ballast 
tank vessel VOL<INF>w</INF> may equal O<INF>A</INF> for a wing cargo oil 
tank located between two segregated ballast tanks each of length greater 
than l<INF>c</INF> and width greater than t<INF>c</INF>.
    (b) The allowable volume of a center cargo tank (VOL<INF>c</INF>) is 
50,000 cubic meters.
    5. Allowable length of cargo tanks.
    The length of each cargo tank (1 a) must not exceed 10 meters or the 
distance calculated from (a), (b), or (c), as appropriate, whichever is 
greater:
    (a) Where no longitudinal bulkhead is provided inside the cargo 
tanks: 1 a=[0.5(bi/B)+0.1] L, but not to exceed 0.2L.
    (b) Where a centerline longitudinal bulkhead is provided inside the 
cargo tanks: 1 a=[0.25(bi/B)+0.15] L, but not to exceed 0.2L.
    (c) Where two or more longitudinal bulkheads are provided inside the 
cargo tanks:
    (1) For wing cargo tanks: 1 a = 0.2L.
    (2) For center cargo tanks:
    (i) If (bi/B) is equal to or greater than 0.2, 1 a = 0.2L.
    (ii) If (bi/B) is less than 0.2:
    (A) Where no centerline longitudinal bulkhead is provided, 1 a = 
[0.5(bi/B) + 0.1] L.
    (B) Where a centerline longitudinal bulkhead is provided, 1 a = 
[0.25(bi/B) + 0.15] L.
    (d) ``bi'' is the minimum distance from the ship's side to the outer 
longitudinal bulkhead of the tank in question, measured inboard at right 
angles to the centerline at the level corresponding to the assigned 
summer freeboard.

      Appendix B to Part 157--Subdivision and Stability Assumptions

    1. Source. The procedures for the loading assumption calculations 
contained in this Appendix conform to Regulation 25 of Annex I of the 
International Convention for the Prevention of the Pollution from Ships, 
1973, done at London, November 2, 1973.
    2. Loading Assumptions. For the purpose of calculating subdivision 
and damage stability for a tank vessel, the operating drafts must 
reflect actual partial or full load conditions consistent with trim and 
strength of the vessel. Ballast conditions need not be considered if the 
tank vessel is not carrying oil in cargo tanks excluding oily residues. 
Loading condition must reflect the specific gravities of the cargo.
    3. Damage Assumptions.
    (a) Damage is applied to all conceivable locations along the length 
of the vessel as follows:
    (1) For a vessel of more than 225 meters in length, anywhere in the 
vessel's length.
    (2) For a vessel of more than 150 meters, but not exceeding 225 
meters in length, anywhere in the vessel's length except where the after 
or forward bulkhead bounding a machinery space located aft is involved 
in the damage assumption. The machinery space is calculated as a single 
floodable compartment.
    (3) For a vessel 150 meters or less in length, anywhere in the 
vessel's length between adjacent transverse bulkheads except the 
machinery space.
    (b) The extent and the character of the assumed side or bottom 
damage, as defined in section 2 of Appendix A of this part, must be 
applied except longitudinal bottom damage within 0.3L from the forward 
perpendicular must be assumed to be the same as that for side damage. If 
any damage of lesser extent results in a more severe condition, such 
damage must be assumed.
    (c) If damage involves transverse bulkheads as specified in 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, transverse watertight 
bulkheads must be spaced at least at a distance equal to the 
longitudinal extent of the assumed damage specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section in order to be considered effective. Where transverse 
bulkheads are spaced at a lesser distance, one or more of these 
bulkheads within such extent of damage must be assumed as nonexistent 
for the purpose of determining flooded compartments.
    (d) If the damages between adjacent transverse watertight bulkheads 
is within the definition contained in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, 
no main transverse bulkhead or a transverse bulkhead bounding side tanks 
or double bottom tanks is to be assumed damaged, unless:
    (1) the spacing of the adjacent bulkheads is less than the 
longitudinal extent of assumed

[[Page 495]]

damage defined in paragraph (b) of this section; or
    (2) there is a step or a recess in a transverse bulkhead of more 
than 3.05 meters in length, located within the extent of penetrations of 
assumed damage. The step formed by the after peak bulkhead and after 
peak tank top is not regarded as a step for these calculations.
    (e) If pipes, ducts, or tunnels are situated within the assumed 
extent of damage, there must be arrangements so that progressive 
flooding may not thereby extend to compartments other than those assumed 
to be floodable for each case of damage.
    (f) For oil tankers of 20,000 DWT and above, the damage assumptions 
must be supplemented by the following assumed bottom raking damage:
    (1) Longitudinal extent:
    (i) For ships of 75,000 DWT and above, 0.6L measured from the 
forward perpendicular.
    (ii) For ships of less than 75,000 DWT, 0.4L measured from the 
forward perpendicular.
    (2) Transverse extent: B/3 anywhere in the bottom.
    (3) Vertical extent: Breach of the outer hull.
    4. Characteristic and Condition Assumption for Calculations.
    (a) Account must be taken of any empty or partially filled tanks, 
the specific gravity of cargoes carried, and any outflow of liquids from 
damaged compartments.
    (b) The permeabilities are assumed as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Intended space use                      Permeability
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stores....................................................          0.60
Accommodation.............................................          0.95
Machinery.................................................          0.85
Voids.....................................................          0.95
Consumable liquids........................................      \1\ 0 or
                                                                    0.95
Other liquids.............................................     \2\ 10 or
                                                                    0.95
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Whichever results in the more severe requirements.
\2\ The permeability of partially filled compartments must be consistent
  with actual density and the amount of liquid carried.

    (c) The buoyancy of any superstructure directly above the side 
damage is to be disregarded. The unflooded parts of superstructures 
beyond the extent of damage may be taken into consideration if they are 
separated from the damaged space by watertight bulkheads and no 
progressive flooding of these intact spaces takes place. Class I doors 
are allowed in watertight bulkheads in the superstructure.
    (d) The free surface effect is to be calculated:
    (1) at an angle of heel of 5 degrees for each individual 
compartment; or
    (2) by assessing the shift of liquids by moment of transference 
calculations.
    (e) In calculating the effect of free surfaces of consumable 
liquids, it is to be assumed that, for each type of liquid, at least one 
transverse pair or a single centerline tank has a free surface and the 
tank or combination of tanks to be taken into account is to be those 
where the effect of free surface is the greatest.

   Appendix C to Part 157--Procedure for Determining Distribution of 
 Segregated Ballast Tanks To Provide Protection Against Oil Outflow in 
              the Event of Grounding, Ramming, or Collision

    1. Source. The procedure for determining the distribution of 
segregated ballast tanks contained in this appendix conforms to 
Regulation 13E of the MARPOL Protocol.
    2. Procedure. Protective location of segregated ballast tanks, 
voids, and other spaces that do not carry cargo which are within the 
cargo tank length is determined from the following:
    <INF>[Sigma]</INF> PA<INF>c</INF> + <INF>[Sigma]</INF> PA<INF>s</INF> 
= J[L<INF>t</INF>(B + 2D)]
Where:

PA<INF>c</INF>=the side shell area in square meters based on projected 
          molded dimensions for each segregated ballast tank, void, or 
          other space that does not carry cargo and which complies with 
          paragraph 2(b) of this appendix;
PA<INF>s</INF>=the bottom shell area in square meters based on projected 
          molded dimensions for each segregated ballast tank, void, or 
          other space that does not carry cargo and which complies with 
          paragraph 2(b) of this appendix;
L<INF>t</INF>=the length in meters between the forward and after 
          extremities of the cargo tanks;

D=the molded depth in meters measured vertically from the top of the 
          keel plate to the top of the freeboard deck beam at the side 
          amidships. In tank vessels having rounded gunwales, the molded 
          depth is measured from the top of the keel plate to the point 
          of intersection of the molded lines of the deck and side shell 
          plating, the lines being extended as though the gunwale were 
          of angular design.

a=0.25 for tank vessels of 200,000 DWT.
a=0.40 for tank vessels of 300,000 DWT.
a=0.50 for tank vessels of 420,000 DWT.
    For values of DWT between 200,000 and 300,000 DWT, 300,000 and 
420,000 DWT, and greater than 420,000 DWT, the value of ``a'' is 
determined by linear interpolation.

          this part.
    (3) For values of DWT between 20,000 and 200,000 DWT, the value of 
``J'' is determined by linear interpolation between 0.45 and 0.30 
respectively.
    (b) PA<INF>c</INF> and PA<INF>s:</INF> Criteria for determining the 
segregated ballast tanks, voids, and other spaces that do not carry 
cargo.
    The following criteria are to be met for a segregated ballast tank, 
void, or space that does not carry cargo, to be used in determining 
PA<INF>c</INF> and PA<INF>s:
    </INF>(1) The minimum width of each wing tank or space, either of 
which extends for the full depth of the vessel's side or from the main 
deck to the top of the double bottoms is 2 meters or more. The width is 
measured inboard from the vessel's side shell plating at right angles to 
the vessel's center line. If a wing tank or space has a width anywhere 
within it that is less than 2 meters, that wing tank or space is not 
used when calculating PA<INF>c</INF>.
    (2) The minimum vertical depth of each double bottom tank or space 
is B/15 or 2 meters, whichever is smaller. If a double bottom tank or 
space has a depth less than B/15 or 2 meters, whichever is smaller, 
anywhere within it, the double bottom or space is not to be used when 
calculating PA<INF>s</INF>.
    (3) The minimum width of a wing tank or space is not measured in the 
way of--
    (i) the turn of the bilge area; or
    (ii) a rounded gunwale area.
    (4) The minimum depth of a double bottom tank or space is not 
measured in the way of the turn of the bilge area.

Appendix E to PArt 157--Specifications for the Design, Installation and 
   Operation of a Part Flow System for Control of Overboard Discharges

    Source. Appendix 2 to Annex 5 of IMO's Marine Environment Protection 
Committee document MEPC/Circ. 97. Paragraphs 1 and 2 are printed for 
information. Paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 are incorporated into Secs. 157.11 
and 157.37.
    Note: Information in square brackets on Figure 1 has been added by 
the Coast Guard for clarity.

                               1  Purpose

    The purpose of these Specifications is to provide specific design 
criteria and installation and operational requirements for the part flow 
system referred to in Regulation 18(6)(e) of Annex I of the 
International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 
1973 as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto.

                             2  Application

    2.1  Existing oil tankers may, in accordance with Regulation 
18(6)(e) of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78, discharge dirty ballast water and 
oil contaminated water from cargo tank areas below the waterline, 
provided part of the flow is led through permanent piping to a readily 
accessible location on the upper deck or above where it may be visually 
observed during the discharge operation and provided that the 
arrangements comply with the requirements established by the 
Administration and which shall at least contain all the provisions of 
these Specifications.
    2.2  The part flow concept is based on the principle that the 
observation of a representative part flow of the overboard effluent is 
equivalent to observing the entire effluent stream. These specifications 
provide the details of the design installation, and operation of a part 
flow system.

                          3  General Provisions

    3.1  The part flow system shall be so fitted that it can effectively 
provide a representative sample of the overboard effluent for visual 
display under all normal operating conditions.
    3.2  The part flow system is in many respects similar to the 
sampling system for an oil discharge monitoring and control system but 
shall have pumping and piping arrangements separate from such a system, 
or combined equivalent arrangements acceptable to the Administration.
    3.3  The display of the part flow shall be arranged in a sheltered 
and readily accessible location on the upper deck or above, approved by 
the Administration (e.g. the entrance to the pump room). Regard should 
be given to effective communication between the location of the part 
flow display and the discharge control position.
    3.4  Samples shall be taken from relevant sections of the overboard 
discharge piping and be passed to the display arrangement through a 
permanent piping system.
    3.5  The part flow system shall include the following components:
    .1  Sampling probes;
    .2  Sample water piping system;
    .3  Sample feed pump(s);
    .4  Display arrangement;
    .5  Sample discharge arrangement; and, subject to the diameter of 
the sample piping:
    .6  Flushing arrangement.
    .3.6  The part flow system shall comply with the applicable safety 
requirements.

                          4  System Arrangement

    4.1  Sampling points.
    4.1.1  Sampling point locations:
    .1  Sampling points shall be so located that relevant samples can be 
obtained of the effluent being discharged through outlets below the 
waterline which are being used for operational discharges.
    .2  Sampling points shall as far as practicable be located in pipe 
sections where a turbulent flow is normally encountered.
    .3  Sampling points shall as far as practicable be arranged in 
accessible locations in vertical sections of the discharge piping.
    4.1.2  Sampling probes:
    .1  Sampling probes shall be arranged to protrude into the pipe a 
distance of about one fourth of the pipe diameter.
    .2  Sampling probes shall be arranged for easy withdrawal for 
cleaning.
    .3  The part flow system shall have a stop valve fitted adjacent to 
each probe, except that were the probe is mounted in a cargo line, two 
stop valves shall be fitted in series, in the sample line.
    .4  Sampling probes should be of corrosion resistant and oil 
resistant material, of adequate strength, properly jointed and 
supported.
    .5  Sampling probes shall have a shape that is not prone to becoming 
clogged by particle contaminants and should not generate high 
hydrodynamic pressures at the sampling probe tip. Figure 1 is an example 
of one suitable shape of a sampling probe.

[[Page 498]]

    .6  Sampling probes shall have the same nominal bore as the sample 
piping.
    4.2  Sample piping:
    .1  The sample piping shall be arranged as straight as possible 
between the sampling points and the display arrangement. Sharp bends and 
pockets where settled oil or sediment may accumulate should be avoided.
    .2  The sample piping shall be so arranged that sample water is 
conveyed to the display arrangement within 20 seconds. The flow velocity 
in the piping should not be less than 2 metres per second.
    .3  The diameter of the piping shall not be less than 40 millimetres 
if no fixed flushing arrangement is provided and shall not be less than 
25 millimetres if a pressurized flushing arrangement as detailed in 
paragraph 4.4 is installed.
    .4  The sample piping should be of corrosion-resistant and oil-
resistant material, of adequate strength, properly jointed and 
supported.
    .5  Where several sampling points are installed the piping shall be 
connected to a valve chest at the suction side of the sample feed pump.
    4.3  Sample feed pump:
    .1  The sample feed pump capacity shall be suitable to allow the 
flow rate of the sample water to comply with 4.2.2.
    4.4  Flushing arrangement:
    .1  If the diameter of sample piping is less than 40 millimetres, a 
fixed connexion from a pressurized sea or fresh water piping system 
shall be installed to enable flushing of the sample piping system.
    4.5  Display arrangement:
    .1  The display arrangement shall consist of a display chamber 
provided with a sight glass. The chamber should be of a size that will 
allow a free fall stream of the sample water to be clearly visible over 
a length of at least 200 millimetres. The Administration may approve 
equivalent arrangements.
    .2  The display arrangement shall incorporate valves and piping in 
order to allow a part of the sample water to bypass the display chamber 
to obtain a laminar flow for display in the chamber.
    .3  The display arrangement shall be designed to be easily opened 
and cleaned.
    .4  The internal of the display chamber shall be white except for 
the background wall which shall be so coloured in order to facilitate 
the observation of any change in the quality of the sample water.
    .5  The lower part of the display chamber shall be shaped as a 
funnel for collection of the sample water.
    .6  A test cock for taking a grab sample shall be provided in order 
that a sample of the water can be examined independent of that in the 
chamber.
    .7  The display arrangement shall be adequately lighted to 
facilitate visual observation of the sample water.
    4.6  Sample discharge arrangement:
    .1  The sample water leaving the display chamber shall be routed to 
the sea or to a slop tank through piping of adequate diameter.

                              5  Operation

    5.1  When a discharge of dirty ballast water or other oil 
contaminated water from the cargo tank area is taking place through an 
outlet below the waterline, the part flow system shall provide sample 
water from the relevant discharge outlet at all times.
    5.2  The sample water should be observed particularly during those 
phases of the discharge operation when the greatest possibility of oil 
contamination occurs. The discharge shall be stopped whenever any traces 
of oil are visible in the flow and when the oil content meter reading 
indicates oil content exceeds permissible limits.
    5.3  On those systems that are fitted with flushing arrangements, 
the sample piping should be flushed after contamination has been 
observed and additionally it is recommended that the sample piping be 
flushed after each period of usage.
    5.4  The ship's cargo and ballast handling manuals and, where 
applicable, those manuals required for crude oil washing systems or 
dedicated clean ballast tanks operation shall clearly describe the use 
of the part flow system in conjunction with the ballast discharge and 
the slop tank decanting procedures.

Appendix F to Part 157--Guidelines and Specifications for Oil Discharge 
               Monitoring and Control Systems for Tankers

    Source. IMO Resolution A.496(XII). Paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and 7 are 
printed for information. Paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 are incorporated into 
Sec. 157.12.
    Mandatory Language. Wherever the word ``should'' is used in this 
appendix, substitute the word ``shall''. Compliance with these 
provisions is mandatory.
    Note. Numbered footnotes have been added by the Coast Guard for 
clarity. Footnotes in the original text have been inserted 
parenthetically in the text and are identified by an asterisk.

                               1  Purpose

    1.1  The purpose of these Guidelines and Specifications is:
    .1  To provide a uniform interpretation of the requirements of 
Regulation 15(3)(a) of Annex I to the MARPOL 73/78 Convention(1), and
    .2  To assist Administrations in determining appropriate design, 
construction and operational parameters for oil discharge monitoring and 
control systems when such systems are fitted in ships flying the flag of 
their State.

                              2  Background

    2.1  The requirements of Annex I to the MARPOL 73/78 Convention 
relating to oil content monitoring of oil tanker ballast and tank 
washing water are contained in Regulation 15(3)(a), which stipulates 
that oil tankers of 150 tons gross tonnage and above shall be equipped 
with an approved oil discharge monitoring and control system and that 
the system shall record continuously:
    .1  The discharge of oil in litres per nautical mile and total 
quantity of oil discharge; or
    .2  In lieu of the total quantity of oil discharged, the oil content 
of the effluent and rate of discharge.

In both cases the record shall be ``identifiable as to time and date'' 
and shall be kept for at least three years.
    2.2  Regulation 15 also stipulates that the system shall come into 
operation when there is any discharge of effluent into the sea and shall 
be such as will ensure that any discharge of oily mixture is 
automatically stopped when the instantaneous rate of discharge of oil 
exceeds that permitted by Regulation 9(1)(a). In existing oil tankers 
the stopping of the discharge may be performed manually and the rate of 
discharge may be estimated from the pump characteristics.
    2.3  A test and performance specification for the basic oil content 
meter, indicating oil content in ppm, has been adopted by Resolution 
A.393(X).
    2.4  Resolution A.445(XI) recognizes the need for early installation 
of oil discharge monitoring and control systems in order that 
operational experience can be gained. That resolution further invites 
the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) to develop guidelines 
for the progressive installation of oil discharge monitoring and control 
systems for new and existing oil tankers.

                             3  Application

    3.1  An oil discharge monitoring and control system, approved by the 
Administration, shall be fitted in every oil tanker of 150 tons gross 
tonnage and above, and shall be fitted in:
    .1  New (*as defined in Regulation 1(6))(2) tankers, on the date of 
entry into force of the Convention;
    .2  Existing tankers, within three years of the date of entry into 
force of the Convention.
    3.2  Existing tankers operating with a tank cleaning procedure using 
crude oil washing in accordance with Regulation 13(8) or with dedicated 
clean ballast tanks in accordance with Regulation 13(9) must fit an oil 
content meter not later than the first scheduled shipyard visit after 
entry into force of the Convention.
    3.3  An incentive scheme to encourage the early installation of oil 
discharge monitoring and control systems (Resolution A.445(XI)) has been 
developed which allows different requirements depending on the date of 
installation of the system and the size and building date of the oil 
tanker. The terms used in the description of the various requirements 
are defined in section 4 below.

                     5  Implementation Requirements

    5.1  To assist in the implementation of Resolution A.445(XI), an 
implementation scheme has been developed by the MEPC which provides 
slightly different requirements for oil discharge monitoring and control 
systems depending on size and building date of the oil tanker. The 
scheme also allows for different requirements, depending on the 
installation date of the system.
    5.2  Under the implementation scheme contained in paragraph 5.4 oil 
tankers of 150 tons gross tonnage and above have been arranged into five 
categories. Each category of oil tanker shall be fitted with an oil 
discharge monitoring and control system as set out below. The 
definitions given in section 4 should be consulted for a description of 
the different systems.
    5.3  The implementation scheme set out in paragraph 5.4 gives 
details, with reference to paragraph 4, of the minimum equipment 
required to comply with this scheme. Where it is expedient to fit 
equipment of a higher category than required no objection shall be 
raised to this arrangement.
    5.4  Implementation scheme:
    5.4.1  Category I--
    .1  An oil tanker of this category is of 4,000 tons deadweight and 
above and is a ``new ship'' as defined in Regulation 1(6) of Annex I of 
MARPOL 73/78 and the oil discharge monitoring and control system is 
installed on or after 1 June 1982.

discharge valve control.
    5.4.3  Category III--
    .1  An oil tanker of this category is of 150 tons gross tonnage and 
above, but less than 4,000 tons deadweight and is a ``new ship'' as 
defined in Regulation 1(6) of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78.

[[Page 502]]

    .2  This category of ship shall be fitted with a computing unit as 
defined under paragraph 4.3.
    .3  No automatic devices are required to activate overboard 
discharge valve closure, neither is a starting interlock required.
    5.4.4  Category IV(a)--
    .1  An oil tanker of this category is of 20,000 tons deadweight and 
above and is an ``existing ship'' as defined in Regulation 1(7) of Annex 
I of MARPOL 73/78 and the oil discharge monitoring and control system is

    .3  The system shall also be fitted with a starting interlock, but 
need not be fitted with a discharge valve control.
    .4  For oil tankers within this category up to and including 100,000 
tons deadweight, where the overboard discharge has local manual control 
or where control is provided by means of extension rods, Administrations 
may grant waivers or exemptions from the requirement to fit a starting 
interlock system (3).
    5.4.5  Category IV(b)--
    .1  An oil tanker of this category is of 20,000 tons deadweight and 
above and is an ``existing ship'' as defined in Regulation 1(7) of Annex 
I of MARPOL 73/78 and the oil discharge monitoring and control system is 
installed not later than one year after the date of entry into force of

                       6  Technical Specifications

    6.1  Oil discharge monitoring and control system:
    6.1.1  The oil discharge monitoring and control system shall be so 
fitted that it can effectively monitor and control the discharge of any 
effluent into the sea through those overboard discharge outlets 
permitted by Regulation 18(2) which in the opinion of the Administration 
are necessary to fulfill the operational requirements of the tanker (5). 
The system should additionally cover:
    .1  The gravitational discharge of ballast water from cargo tanks; 
and
    .2  The midship cargo manifold arrangement when used to meet the 
requirements of Regulation 18.
    6.1.2  The discharge of dirty ballast water or oil contaminated 
water into the sea through outlets which are not controlled by the 
monitoring and control system is an infringement of the Convention (6).
    6.1.3  The system should function effectively, according to the 
criteria shown below, under all environmental conditions which vessels 
are normally assumed to encounter, and shall be designed and constructed 
to withstand the environmental conditions as specified in paragraph 
6.1.6 of these Guidelines and Specifications:
    .1  Except where manual operation of the system is permitted the 
system shall be so designed that no ballast discharge can take place 
unless the monitor is in the normal operating mode and the relevant 
sampling point has been connected to the monitor.
    .2  Preferably the system should have a minimum number of discharge 
outlets and sampling points so arranged that discharge can take place 
via only one sampling point at a time.
    .3  Where it is intended that more than one line is used for 
simultaneous discharge purposes, one oil content meter (7 ), together 
with a flow meter, shall be installed per discharge line. These 
instruments shall be connected to a common processing unit.
    .4  In order to avoid alarms due to short term high oil 
concentration signals (spikes) causing indications of high instantaneous 
rates of discharge, the short term high ppm signal may be suppressed for 
a maximum of 10 seconds by employing a delay relay. Alternatively, the 
instantaneous rate of discharge may be the average during the preceding 
20

[[Page 503]]

seconds or less as computed from instantaneous ppm values produced by 
the oil content meter with intervals of a maximum of 5 seconds.
    6.1.4  The system should comprise the following:
    .1  An oil content meter to measure the oil content of the effluent 
in parts per million. This meter shall be approved in accordance with 
the provisions contained in resolution A.393(X)(8) and certified to take 
into account the range of cargoes carried;
    .2  A flow rate system to indicate the quantity of effluent being 
discharged in a unit of time (see also paragraphs 6.3.7 and 6.3.8);
    .3  A vessel speed indicating device; to give the vessel's speed in 
knots (see also paragraphs 6.4.2 and 6.4.3);
    .4  A sampling system to convey a representative sample of the 
effluent to the oil content meter;
    .5  A control section which includes:
    .5.1  A processor, which accepts signals of oil content, flow rate 
and the vessel's speed and converts them into litres per nautical mile 
and the total quantity of oil discharged (see also paragraph 6.5.3);
    .5.2  A transmitting device to provide alarms and, where required, 
command signals to the discharge control arrangement;
    .5.3  A recording device to provide, where required, a continuous 
record of the effluent discharge;
    .5.4  A manual override system to be used in the event of failure of 
the monitoring and control system; and
    .5.5  Where required a transmitting device to provide signals to a 
starting interlock preventing the discharge of effluent before the oil 
content meter is fully operative.
    6.1.5  The electrical components of the system installed in a 
hazardous area of a vessel shall meet the appropriate safety 
requirements (*As contained in the provisions of IEC Publication 92 or 
its equivalent.) (9) provided for these areas.
    6.1.6  The control section of an oil discharge monitoring and 
control system shall be capable of operating satisfactorily under the 
following environmental conditions:

25  deg.C to 55  deg.C on open decks
.2  Vibration: 2.0 Hz to 13.2 Hz, with displacement amplitude of 
<plus-minus>1.0 mm 13.2 Hz to 80.0 Hz, with an acceleration amplitude of 
<plus-minus>0.7 g
.3  Voltage variations for alternating current: permanent variation of 
<plus-minus>10%
.4  Inclination: inclination at angles of up to 22.5 deg. in any place 
from the normal operational position
    6.2  Sampling system:
    6.2.1  Sampling points should be so located that relevant samples 
can be obtained from those outlets that are used for operational 
discharges in accordance with paragraph 6.1.1. The sampling probes 
located in the overboard discharge lines and the piping system 
connecting the sampling probes to the oil content meter should meet the 
following requirements:
    .1  The piping and probes shall be of corrosion-resistant and oil-
resistant material, of adequate strength, properly jointed and 
supported;
    .2  The system shall have a stop valve fitted adjacent to each 
probe, except that where the probe is mounted in a cargo line, e.g. to 
the midship cargo manifold arrangement, two stop valves shall be fitted, 
in series, in the sample line;
    .3  Sampling probes should be arranged for easy withdrawal and 
should as far as practicable be mounted at an accessible location in a 
vertical section of the discharge line. If a sampling point has to be 
made in a horizontal section then suitable arrangements should be made 
to obtain representative samples. Sampling probes should normally 
penetrate inside the discharge pipe to a distance of one quarter the 
diameter of that pipe;
    .4  Means shall be provided for cleaning the probes and piping 
system by the provision of permanent clean water flushing arrangements 
or some other equivalent method, especially in the case of probes 
mounted in a cargo line. The design of the probes and piping should be 
such as to minimize their clogging by oil, oily residue and other 
matter;
    .5  The velocity of the fluid in the piping shall be such that, 
taking into consideration the length of the piping, the overall response 
time should be as short as possible between an alteration in the mixture 
being pumped and the alteration in the meter reading and in any case not 
more than 40 seconds;
    .6  The location of sampling probes in relation to any point of flow 
diversion to a slop tank shall be selected with regard to the need for 
sampling the oily water in the recirculation mode;
    .7  The arrangements for driving the sampling pump or any other 
pumps such as those provided for washing windows shall have regard to 
the safety requirements of the space in which the pump is located;
    .8  The flushing arrangements should be such that where necessary 
they can be utilized for stabilizing the oil content meter and for 
correcting zero setting;
    .9  Sample water when returned to the slop tank shall not be allowed 
to free fall into the tank.
    6.3  Flow rate indicating system:
    6.3.1  A flow meter for measuring the rate of discharge should be 
installed in a vertical section of a discharge line or in any other 
section of discharge line as appropriate, so as to be always filled with 
the liquid.

[[Page 504]]

    6.3.2  A flow meter should employ an operating principle which is 
suitable for shipboard use and, where relevant, can be used in large 
diameter pipes.
    6.3.3  A flow meter should be suitable for the full range of flow 
rates that may be encountered during normal operation. Alternatively, 
arrangements such as the use of two flow meters of different ranges or a 
restriction of the operational flow rate range may be necessary to meet 
this requirement.
    6.3.4  The flow meter, as installed, should have an accuracy of 
<plus-minus>15 percent, or better, of the instantaneous rate throughout 
the operating range.
    6.3.5  Any component part of the flow meter in contact with the 
effluent discharge including associated piping, if fitted, shall be of 
corrosion-resistant and oil-resistant material of adequate strength.
    6.3.6  The design of the flow metering arrangements shall have 
regard to the safety requirements of the space in which such metering 
arrangements are located.
    6.3.7  In ships fitted with a computing unit the flow rate may be 
determined from the pump characteristics and the data manually inserted 
into the unit.
    6.3.8  In ships fitted with a calculating unit the flow rate may be 
manually inserted into the unit. The flow rate is to be estimated from 
the best available source e.g. pump characteristics, speed of pump(s), 
ullages or knowledge of pumping rates for particular tanks on the ship.
    6.3.9  In oil tankers where the gravitational discharges of ballast 
water from the cargo tanks is an established practice, in accordance 
with Regulation 18(6)(d), means, such as calibration curves, shall be 
provided to estimate the flow rate of discharge.
    6.4  Vessel's speed indicating system:
    6.4.1  The automatic speed signal required for the control unit 
shall be obtained from the vessel's speed indicating device (*See 
``Recommendation on Performance Standards for Devices to Indicate Speed 
and Distance (Annex to Resolution A.478(XII)).) by means of a repeater 
signal. This information shall be readily available in a form that can 
be accepted by a processor. The speed information used may be either 
speed over the ground or speed through the water depending upon the 
speed measuring equipment installed on board.
    6.4.2  In ships where a computing unit is required the vessel's 
speed may be manually inserted into the unit. This data shall be 
obtained from the ship's log or from an indicating device which 
transmits signals which need not be in a form which can be accepted by a 
computer system.
    6.4.3  The vessel's speed on ships required to install a calculating 
unit may be obtained from the ship's log or from the navigation charts 
and shall be estimated from the most reliable source.
    6.5  Processor and transmitting device:
    6.5.1  The processor should receive, at time intervals not exceeding 
5 seconds, signals from the oil content meter, the flow rate measuring 
system, and the vessel's speed indicator and automatically compute the 
following:
    .1  Instantaneous rate of discharge of oil in litres per nautical 
mile; and
    .2  Total quantity of oil discharged per voyage in cubic meters or 
litres.
    6.5.2  When the calculations of the processor exceed the limits 
imposed by Regulation 9(1)(a) (iv) and (v) (10) the transmitting device 
will provide alarms and, in new ships, it will also provide command 
signals to the discharge valve control which will cause the discharge of 
effluent into the sea to stop.
    6.5.3  In existing ships fitted with a calculating unit where the 
unit is installed early, the total quantity of oil discharged may be 
computed manually.
    6.6  Recording devices:

that meet the requirements in Sec. 157.10d(c) and Sec. 157.10d(d). To 
determine a tank vessel's double hull compliance date under OPA 90, use 
the vessel's hull configuration (i.e., single hull; single hull with 
double sides; or single hull with double bottom) on August 18, 1990. The 
conversion of a single hull tank vessel to include only double sides or 
only a double bottom after August 18, 1990, will not result in a change 
of the vessel's originally scheduled phase-out date. The conversion of a 
single hull tank vessel to a double hull tank vessel meeting the 
requirements of Sec. 157.10d complies with OPA 90.

penalty by the Secretary or his delegatee.
    (2) Classes of penalties. (i) Class I. The amount of a class I civil 
penalty under this section may not exceed $10,000 per violation, except 
that the maximum amount of any class I civil penalty under this section 
shall not exceed $25,000. Before assessing a civil penalty under this 
subparagraph, the Secretary or his delegatee shall give to the person to 
be assessed such penalty written notice of the Secretary's proposal to 
assess the penalty and the opportunity to request, within 30 days of the 
date the notice is received by such person, a hearing on the proposed 
penalty. Such hearing shall not be subject to 5 U.S.C. 554 or 556, but 
shall provide a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present 
evidence.
    (ii) Class II. The amount of a class II civil penalty under this 
section may not exceed $10,000 per day for each day during which the 
violation continues, except that the maximum amount of any class II 
civil penalty under this section shall not exceed $125,000. Except as 
otherwise provided in paragraph (a) of this section, a class II civil 
penalty shall be assessed and collected in the same manner, and subject 
to the same provisions as in the case of civil penalties assessed and 
collected after notice and an opportunity for hearing on the record in 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554. Proceedings to assess a class II 
administrative civil penalty under this section will be governed by 33 
CFR Part 20.
    (3) Rights of interested persons. (i) Public notice. Before issuing 
an order assessing a class II civil penalty under this paragraph, the 
Secretary shall provide public notice of and reasonable opportunity to 
comment on the proposed issuance of each order.
    (ii) Presentation of evidence. Any person who comments on a proposed 
assessment of a class II civil penalty under this section shall be given 
notice of any hearing held under paragraph (a) of this section, and of 
the order assessing such penalty. In any hearing held under paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section, such person shall have a reasonable opportunity 
to be heard and present evidence.
    (iii) Rights of interested persons to a hearing. If no hearing is 
held under paragraph (a)(2) of this section before issuance of an order 
assessing a class II civil penalty under this section, any person who 
commented on the proposed assessment may petition, within 30 days after 
the issuance of such an order, the Secretary or his delegatee to set 
aside such order and provide a hearing on the penalty. If the evidence 
presented by the petitioner in support of the petition is material and 
was not considered in the issuance of the order,

[[Page 535]]

the Secretary, or his delegatee, shall immediately set aside such order 
and provide a hearing in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section. If the Secretary or his delegatee denies a hearing under this 
clause, the Secretary or his delegatee shall provide to the petitioner 
and publish in the Federal Register notice of and the reasons for such 
denial.
    (b) Civil judicial penalties. (1) Generally. Any person who violates 
this subpart shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 
per day for each violation. Each day a violation continues constitutes a 
separate violation.
    (2) Limitation. A person is not liable for a civil judicial penalty 
under this paragraph for a violation if the person has been assessed a 
civil administrative penalty under paragraph (a) of this section for the 
violation.
    (c) Determination of amount. In determining the amount of a civil 
penalty under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, the court or the 
Secretary or his delegatee shall consider the seriousness of the 
violation, any history of such violations, any good-faith efforts to 
comply with applicable requirements, the economic impact of the penalty 
on the violator, and other such matters as justice may require.
    (d) Criminal penalties. (1) Negligent violations. Any person who 
negligently violates this subpart commits a Class A misdemeanor.
    (2) Knowing violations. Any person who knowingly violates this 
subpart commits a Class D felony.
    (3) False statements. Any person who knowingly makes any false 
statement, representation, or certification in any record, report or

who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any testing 
or monitoring device or method required to be maintained under this 
subpart commits a Class D felony.
    (e) Awards. (1) The Secretary or his delegatee or the court, when 
assessing any fines or civil penalties, as the case may be, may pay from 
any fines or civil penalties collected under this section an amount not 
to exceed one-half of the penalty or fine collected to any individual 
who furnished information which leads to the payment of the penalty or 
fine. If several individuals provide such information, the amount shall 
be divided equitably among such individuals. No officer or employee of 
the United States, the State of Alaska or any Federally recognized Tribe 
who furnishes information or renders service in the performance of his 
or her official duties shall be eligible for payment under this 
paragraph.
    (2) The Secretary, his delegatee, or a court, when assessing any 
fines or civil penalties, as the case may be, may pay, from any fines or 
civil penalties collected under this section, to the State of Alaska or 
any Federally recognized Tribe providing information or investigative 
assistance which leads to payment of the penalty or fine, an amount 
which reflects the level of information or investigative assistance 
provided. Should the State of Alaska or a Federally recognized Tribe and 
an individual under paragraph (e)(1) of this section be eligible for an 
award, the Secretary, his delegatee, or the court, as the case may be, 
shall divide the amount equitably.
    (f) Liability in rem. A cruise vessel operated in violation of this 
subpart is liable in rem for any fine imposed under paragraph (c) of 
this section or for any civil penalty imposed under paragraphs (a) or 
(b) of this section, and may be proceeded against in the United States 
district court of any district in which the cruise vessel may be found.

                   Subpart A--Vessel Traffic Services

                              General Rules


<R05>
Sec. 161.1  Purpose and Intent.

    (a) The purpose of this part is to promulgate regulations 
implementing and enforcing certain sections of the Ports and Waterways 
Safety Act (PWSA) setting up a national system of Vessel Traffic 
Services that will enhance navigation, vessel safety, and marine 
environmental protection, and promote safe vessel movement by reducing 
the potential for collisions, rammings, and groundings, and the loss of 
lives and property associated with these incidents within VTS areas 
established hereunder.
    (b) Vessel Traffic Services provide the mariner with information 
related to the safe navigation of a waterway. This information, coupled 
with the mariner's compliance with the provisions set forth in this 
part, enhances the safe routing of vessels through congested waterways 
or waterways of particular hazard. Under certain circumstances, a VTS 
may issue directions to control the movement of vessels in order to 
minimize the risk of collision between vessels, or damage to property or 
the environment.
    (c) The owner, operator, charterer, master, or person directing the 
movement of a vessel remains at all times responsible for the manner in 
which the vessel is operated and maneuvered, and is responsible for the 
safe navigation of the vessel under all circumstances. Compliance with 
these rules or with a direction of the VTS is at all times contingent 
upon the exigencies of safe navigation.
    (d) Nothing in this part is intended to relieve any vessel, owner, 
operator, charterer, master, or person directing the movement of a 
vessel from the consequences of any neglect to comply with this part or 
any other applicable law or regulation (e.g., the International 
Regulations for Prevention of Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS) or 
the Inland Navigation Rules) or of the neglect of any precaution which 
may be required by the ordinary practice of

[[Page 563]]

seamen, or by the special circumstances of the case.


<R05>
Sec. 161.2  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this part:
    Cooperative Vessel Traffic Services (CVTS) means the system of 
vessel traffic management established and jointly operated by the United 
States and Canada within adjoining waters. In addition, CVTS facilitates 
traffic movement and anchorages, avoids jurisdictional disputes, and 
renders assistance in emergencies in adjoining United States and 
Canadian waters.
    Hazardous Vessel Operating Condition means any condition related to 
a vessel's ability to safely navigate or maneuver, and includes, but is 
not limited to:
    (1) The absence or malfunction of vessel operating equipment, such 
as propulsion machinery, steering gear, radar system, gyrocompass, depth 
sounding device, automatic radar plotting aid (ARPA), radiotelephone, 
Automatic Identification System equipment, navigational lighting, sound 
signaling devices or similar equipment.
    (2) Any condition on board the vessel likely to impair navigation, 
such as lack of current nautical charts and publications, personnel 
shortage, or similar condition.
    (3) Vessel characteristics that affect or restrict maneuverability, 
such as cargo arrangement, trim, loaded condition, underkeel clearance, 
speed, or similar characteristics.
    Precautionary Area means a routing measure comprising an area within 
defined limits where vessels must navigate with particular caution and 
within which the direction of traffic may be recommended.
    Towing Vessel means any commercial vessel engaged in towing another 
vessel astern, alongside, or by pushing ahead.
    Vessel Movement Reporting System (VMRS) is a system used to manage 
and track vessel movements within a VTS area. This is accomplished by a 
vessel providing information under established procedures as set forth 
in this part, or as directed by the VTS.
    Vessel Movement Reporting System (VMRS) User means a vessel, or an 
owner, operator, charterer, master, or person directing the movement of 
a vessel, that is required to participate in a VMRS within a VTS area. 
VMRS participation is required for:
    (1) Every power-driven vessel of 40 meters (approximately 131 feet) 
or more in length, while navigating;
    (2) Every towing vessel of 8 meters (approximately 26 feet) or more 
in length, while navigating; or
    (3) Every vessel certificated to carry 50 or more passengers for 
hire, when engaged in trade.
    Vessel Traffic Center (VTC) means the shore-based facility that 
operates the vessel traffic service for the Vessel Traffic Service area 
or sector within such an area.
    Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) means a service implemented by the 
United States Coast Guard designed to improve the safety and efficiency 
of vessel traffic and to protect the environment. The VTS has the 
capability to interact with marine traffic and respond to traffic 
situations developing in the VTS area.
    Vessel Traffic Service Area or VTS Area means the geographical area 
encompassing a specific VTS area of service. This area of service may be 
subdivided into sectors for the purpose of allocating responsibility to 
individual Vessel Traffic Centers or to identify different operating 
requirements.
    Note: Although regulatory jurisdiction is limited to the navigable 
waters of the United States, certain vessels will be encouraged or may 
be required, as a condition of port entry, to report beyond this area to 
facilitate traffic management within the VTS area.
    VTS Special Area means a waterway within a VTS area in which special 
operating requirements apply.
    VTS User means a vessel, or an owner, operator, charterer, master, 
or person directing the movement of a vessel, that is:
    (a) Subject to the Vessel Bridge-to-Bridge Radiotelephone Act; or
    (b) Required to participate in a VMRS within a VTS area (VMRS User).
    VTS User's Manual means the manual established and distributed by 
the VTS to provide the mariner with a description of the services 
offered and rules in force for that VTS. Additionally, the manual may 
include chartlets showing the area and sector boundaries, general

[[Page 564]]

navigational information about the area, and procedures, radio 
frequencies, reporting provisions and other information which may assist 
the mariner while in the VTS area.

[CGD 90-020, 59 FR 36324, July 15, 1994, as amended by CGE 97-023, 62 FR 
33364, June 19, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 161.3  Applicability.

    The provisions of this subpart shall apply to each VTS User and may 
also apply to any vessel while underway or at anchor on the navigable 
waters of the United States within a VTS area, to the extent the VTS 
considers necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 161.4  Requirement to carry the rules.

    Each VTS User shall carry on board and maintain for ready reference 
a copy of these rules.
    Note: These rules are contained in the applicable U.S. Coast Pilot, 
the VTS User's Manual which may be obtained by contacting the 
appropriate VTS, and periodically published in the Local Notice to 
Mariners. The VTS User's Manual and the World VTS Guide, an 
International Maritime Organization (IMO) recognized publication, 
contain additional information which may assist the prudent mariner 
while in the appropriate VTS area.


<R05>
Sec. 161.5  Deviations from the rules.

    (a) Requests to deviate from any provision in this part, either for 
an extended period of time or if anticipated before the start of a 
transit, must be submitted in writing to the appropriate District 
Commander. Upon receipt of the written request, the District Commander 
may authorize a deviation if it is determined that such a deviation 
provides a level of safety equivalent to that provided by the required 
measure or is a maneuver considered necessary for safe navigation under 
the circumstances. An application for an authorized deviation must state 
the need and fully describe the proposed alternative to the required 
measure.
    (b) Requests to deviate from any provision in this part due to 
circumstances that develop during a transit or immediately preceeding a 
transit, may be made verbally to the appropriate VTS Commanding Officer. 
Requests to deviate shall be made as far in advance as practicable. Upon 
receipt of the request, the VTS Commanding Officer may authorize a 
deviation if it is determined that, based on vessel handling 
characteristics, traffic density, radar contacts, environmental 
conditions and other relevant information, such a deviation provides a 
level of safety equivalent to that provided by the required measure or 
is a maneuver considered necessary for safe navigation under the 
circumstances.

  congestion on a designated VTS frequency, communications may be established on an alternate VTS frequency. The
  bridge-to-bridge navigational frequency, 156.650 MHz (Channel 13), is monitored in each VTS area; and it may
  be used as an alternate frequency, however, only to the extent that doing so provides a level of safety beyond
  that provided by other means.
<SUP>2</SUP> Designated frequency monitoring is required within U.S. navigable waters. In areas which are outside the U.S.
  navigable waters, designated frequency monitoring is voluntary. However, prospective VTS Users are encouraged
  to monitor the designated frequency.
<SUP>3</SUP> VMRS participants shall make their initial report (Sail Plan) to New York Traffic on Channel 11 (156.550 MHz).
  All other reports, including the Final Report, shall be made on Channel 14 (156.700 MHz). VMRS and other VTS
  Users shall monitor Channel 14 (156.700 MHz) while transiting the VTS area. New York Traffic may direct a
  vessel to monitor and report on either primary frequency depending on traffic density, weather conditions, or
  other safety factors. This does not require a vessel to monitor both primary frequencies.
<SUP>4</SUP> A Cooperative Vessel Traffic Service was established by the Untied States and Canada within adjoining waters.
  The appropriate vessel traffic Center administers the rules issued by both nations; however, it will enforce
  only its own set of rules within its jurisdiction.
<SUP>5</SUP> Seattle traffic may direct a vessel to monitor the other primary VTS frequency 156.250 MHz or 156.700 MHz
  (Channel 5A or 14) depending on traffic density, weather conditions, or other safety factors, rather than
  strictly adhering to the designated frequency required for each monitoring area as defined above. This does
  not require a vessel to monitor both primary frequencies.
<SUP>6</SUP> A portion of Tofino Sector's monitoring area extends beyond the defined CVTS area. Designated frequency
  monitoring is voluntary in these portions outside of VTS jurisdiction, however, prospective VTS Users are
  encouraged to monitor the designated frequency.
<SUP>7</SUP> The bridge-to-bridge navigational frequency, 156.650 MHz (Channel 13), is used in these VTSs because the level
  of radiotelephone transmissions does not warrant a designated VTS frequency. The listening watch required by
  26.05 of this chapter is not limited to the monitoring area.

    (c) As soon as is practicable, a VTS User shall notify the VTS of 
any of the following:
    (1) A marine casualty as defined in 46 CFR 4.05-1;
    (2) Involvement in the ramming of a fixed or floating object;
    (3) A pollution incident as defined in Sec. 151.15 of this chapter;
    (4) A defect or discrepancy in an aid to navigation;
    (5) A hazardous condition as defined in Sec. 160.203 of this 
chapter;
    (6) Improper operation of vessel equipment required by Part 164 of 
this chapter;
    (7) A situation involving hazardous materials for which a report is 
required by 49 CFR 176.48; and
    (8) A hazardous vessel operating condition as defined in Sec. 161.2.

Sec. 161.13  VTS Special Area operating requirements.

    The following operating requirements apply within a VTS Special 
Area:
    (a) A VTS User shall, if towing astern, do so with as short a hawser 
as safety and good seamanship permits.
    (b) A VMRS User shall: (1) Not enter or get underway in the area 
without prior approval of the VTS;
    (2) Not enter a VTS Special Area if a hazardous vessel operating 
condition or circumstance exists;
    (3) Not meet, cross, or overtake any other VMRS User in the area 
without prior approval of the VTS; and
    (4) Before meeting, crossing, or overtaking any other VMRS User in 
the area, communicate on the designated vessel bridge-to-bridge 
radiotelephone frequency, intended navigation movements, and any other 
information necessary in order to make safe passing arrangements. This 
requirement does not relieve a vessel of any duty prescribed by the 
International Regulations for Prevention of Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 
COLREGS) or the Inland Navigation Rules.

               Subpart B--Vessel Movement Reporting System


<R05>
Sec. 161.15  Purpose and intent.

    (a) A Vessel Movement Reporting System (VMRS) is a system used to 
manage and track vessel movements within a VTS area. This is 
accomplished by requiring that vessels provide information under 
established procedures as set forth in this part, or as directed by the 
VTS.
    (b) To avoid imposing an undue reporting burden or unduly congesting 
radiotelephone frequencies, reports shall be limited to information 
which is essential to achieve the objectives of the VMRS. These reports 
are consolidated into four reports (sailing plan, position, sailing plan 
deviation and final).


<R05>
Sec. 161.16  Applicability.

    The provisions of this subpart shall apply to the following VMRS 
Users:
    (a) Every power-driven vessel of 40 meters (approximately 131 feet) 
or more in length, while navigating;
    (b) Every towing vessel of 8 meters (approximately 26 feet) or more 
in length, while navigating; or
    (c) Every vessel certificated to carry 50 or more passengers for 
hire, when engaged in trade.


<R05>
Sec. 161.17  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart: Published means available in a widely-
distributed and publicly available medium (e.g., VTS User's Manual, 
ferry schedule, Notice to Mariners).


<R05>
Sec. 161.18  Reporting requirements.

    (a) A VTS may: (1) Direct a vessel to provide any of the information 
set forth in Table 161.18(a) (IMO Standard Ship Reporting System);

Sec. 162.40  Inland waterway from Delaware River to Chesapeake Bay, Del. and Md. (Chesapeake and Delaware Canal).

    (a) Applicability. The regulations in this section are applicable to 
that part of the inland waterway from Delaware River to Chesapeake Bay, 
Del. and Md., between Reedy Point, Delaware River, and Old Town Point 
Wharf, Elk River.
    (b) Speed. No vessel in the waterway shall be raced or crowded 
alongside another vessel. Vessels of all types, including pleasure 
craft, are required to travel at all times at a safe speed throughout 
the canal and its approaches so as to avoid damage by suction or wave 
wash to wharves, landings, riprap protection, or other boats, or injury 
to persons. Pilots and vessel operators transiting the canal and its 
approaches are warned that violation of this rule may result in having 
their privilege to transit the canal suspended. Passages of vessels 
through the canal will be monitored and specific cases will be 
investigated where damage by suction or wave wash does occur. Owners and 
operators of yachts, motorboats, rowboats and other craft are cautioned 
that large deep draft ocean-going vessels and other large commercial 
vessels ply the canal, and such owners and operators should be 
particularly careful to moor or anchor well away from the main ship 
channels, with moorings and lines which are sufficient and proper.
    (c) Right-of-way. All vessels proceeding with the current shall have 
the right-of-way over those proceeding against the current. Large 
vessels or tows must not overtake and attempt to pass other large 
vessels or tows in the waterway. All small pleasure craft shall 
relinquish the right-of-way to deeper draft vessels, which have a 
limited maneuvering ability due to their draft and size.
    (d) Stopping in waterway. Vessels will not be permitted to stop or 
anchor in the ship channel.
    (e) Water skiing. Water skiing in the waterway is prohibited between 
Reedy Point and Welch Point.
    (f) Sailboats. Transiting the canal by vessels under sail is not 
permitted between Reedy Point and Welch Point.
    Note: The Corps of Engineers also has regulations dealing with this 
section in 33 CFR Part 207.

Sec. 162.65  All waterways tributary to the Atlantic Ocean south of Chesapeake Bay and all waterways tributary to the Gulf of Mexico east and south of St. 
          Marks, Fla.

    (a) Description. This section applies to the following:
    (1) Waterways. All navigable waters of the United States, natural or 
artificial, including bays, lakes, sounds, rivers, creeks, intracoastal 
waterways, as well as canals and channels of all types, which are 
tributary to or connected by other waterways with the Atlantic Ocean 
south of Chesapeake Bay or with the Gulf of Mexico east and south of St. 
Marks, Florida.
    (2) United States property. All river and harbor lands owned by the 
United States in or along the waterways described in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this paragraph, including lock sites and all

[[Page 580]]

structures thereon, other sites for Government structures and for the 
accommodation and use of employees of the United States, and rights of 
way and spoil disposal areas to the extent of Federal interest therein.
    (3) Vessels and rafts. The term ``vessel'' as used in this section 
includes all floating things moved over these waterways other than 
rafts.
    (b) Waterways--(1) Fairway. A clear channel shall at all times be 
left open to permit free and unobstructed navigation by all types of 
vessels and rafts that normally use the various waterways or sections 
thereof. The District Commander may specify the width of the fairway 
required in the various waterways under his charge.
    (2) Stoppage in waterway, anchorage or mooring. (i) No vessels or 
rafts shall anchor or moor in any of the land cuts or other narrow parts 
of the waterway, except in case of an emergency. Whenever it becomes 
necessary for a vessel or raft to stop in any such portions of the 
waterway it shall be securely fastened to one bank and as close to the 
bank as possible. This shall be done only at such a place and under such 
conditions as will not obstruct or prevent the passage of other vessels 
or craft. Stoppages shall be only for such periods as may be necessary.
    (ii) No vessel or raft will be allowed to use any portion of the 
fairway as a mooring place except temporarily as authorized above 
without the written permission from the District Commander.
    (iii) When tied up, all vessels must be moored by bow and stern 
lines. Rafts and tows shall be secured at sufficiently close intervals 
to insure their not being drawn away from the bank by winds, currents or 
the suction of passing vessels. Tow lines shall be shortened so that the 
different parts of the tow shall be as close together as possible. In 
narrow sections, no vessel or raft shall be tied abreast of another.
    (iv) Lights shall be displayed in accordance with provisions of the 
Navigation Rules, International-Inland, Commandant Instruction M16672.2 
(series).
    (v) No vessel, even if fastened to the bank as prescribed in 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, shall be left without a sufficient 
crew to care for it properly.
    (vi) Vessels will not be permitted to load or unload in any of the 
land cuts except as a regular established landing or wharf without 
written permission secured in advance from the District Commander.
    (vii) No vessel, regardless of size, shall anchor in a dredged 
channel or narrow portion of a waterway for the purpose of fishing, if 
navigation is obstructed, thereby.
    (viii) Except in cases of emergency the dropping of anchors, 
weights, or other ground tackle, within areas occupied by submarine 
cable or pipe crossings, is prohibited. Such crossings will ordinarily 
be marked by signboards on each bank of the shore or indicated on coast 
charts.
    (3) Speed. (i) Vessels shall proceed at a speed which will not 
endanger other vessels or structures and will not interfere with any 
work in progress incident to maintaining, improving, surveying or 
marking the channel.
    (ii) Official signs indicating limiting speeds through critical 
portions of the waterways shall be strictly obeyed.
    (iii) Vessels approaching and passing through a bridge shall so 
govern their speed as to insure passage through the bridge without 
damage to the bridge or its fenders.
    (4) Assembly and handling of tows. (i) All vessels drawing tows and 
equipped with rudders shall use two tow lines or a bridle and shorten 
them to the greatest possible extent so as to have full control at all 
times. The various parts of a tow shall be securely assembled with the 
individual units connected by lines as short as practicable. If 
necessary, as in the case of lengthy or cumbersome tows or tows in 
restricted channels, the District Commander may require that tows be 
broken up and may require the installation of a rudder, drag or other 
approved steering device on the tow in order to avoid obstructing 
navigation or damaging the property of others, including aids to 
navigation maintained by the United States or under its authorization, 
by collision or otherwise.
    (ii) No tow shall be drawn by a vessel that has insufficient power 
or crew to

[[Page 581]]

permit ready maneuverability and safe handling.
    (iii) Tows desiring to pass a bridge shall approach the opening 
along the axis of the channel so as to pass through without danger of 
striking the bridge or its fenders. No vessel or tow shall navigate 
through a drawbridge until the movable span is fully opened.
    (iv) In the event that it is evident to the master of a towing 
vessel that a tow cannot be safely handled through a bridge, it will be 
brought to anchor and the towed vessels will be taken through the bridge 
in small units, or singly if necessary, or the tow will wait until 
navigation conditions have improved to such an extent that the tow can 
pass through the bridge without damage.
    (5) Projections from vessels. No vessel carrying a deck load which 
overhangs or projects over the side of said vessel, or whose rigging 
projects over the side of the vessel so as to endanger passing vessels, 
wharves or other property, will enter or pass through any of the narrow 
parts of the waterway.
    (6) Meeting and passing. Vessels, on meeting or overtaking, shall 
give the proper signals and pass in accordance with the Navigation 
Rules, International-Inland, Commandant Instruction M16672.2 (series). 
Rafts shall give to vessels the side demanded by proper signal. All 
vessels approaching dredges or other plant engaged on improvements to a 
waterway, shall give the signal for passing and slow down sufficiently 
to stop if so ordered or if no answering signal is received. On 
receiving the answering signal, they shall then proceed to pass at a 
speed sufficiently slow to insure safe navigation.
    Note: The Corps of Engineers also has regulations dealing with this 
section in 33 CFR Part 207.

Sec. 162.75  All waterways tributary to the Gulf of Mexico (except the Mississippi River, its tributaries, South and Southwest Passes and Atchafalaya River) 
          from St. Marks, Fla., to the Rio Grande.

    (a) The regulations in this section shall apply to:
    (1) Waterways. All navigable waters of the U.S. tributary to or 
connected by other waterways with the Gulf of Mexico between St. Marks, 
Fla., and the Rio Grande, Tex. (both inclusive), and the Gulf 
Intracoastal Waterway; except the Mississippi River, its tributaries, 
South and Southwest Passes, and the Atchafalaya River above its junction 
with the Morgan City-Port Allen Route.
    (2) Bridges, wharves, and other structures. All bridges, wharves, 
and other structures in or over these waterways.
    (3) Vessels. The term ``vessels'' as used in this section includes 
all floating craft other than rafts.
    (b) Waterways:
    (1) A clear channel shall at all times be left open to permit free 
and unobstructed navigation by all types of vessels and tows normally 
using the various waterways covered by the regulations of this section
    (2) Fairway: The District Commander may specify the width of the 
fairway required in the various waterways under his charge.
    (3) Anchoring or mooring:
    (i) Vessels or tows shall not anchor or moor in any of the land cuts 
or other narrow parts of the waterway, except in an emergency, or with 
permission of the District Commander. Whenever it becomes necessary for 
a vessel or tow to stop in any such protions of the waterway, it shall 
be securely fastened to one bank and as close to the bank as possible. 
This shall be done only at such a place and under such conditions as 
will not obstruct or prevent the passage of other vessels or tows. 
Stoppages shall be only for such periods as may be necessary.
    (ii) When tied up individually, all vessels and tows shall be moored 
by bow and stern lines. Tows shall be secured at sufficiently frequent 
intervals to insure their not being drawn away form the bank by winds, 
currents, or the suction of passing vessels. Lines shall be shortened so 
that the various barges in a tow will be as close together as possible.
    (iii) Lights shall be displayed in accordance with provisions of the 
Navigation Rules, International-Inland, Commandant Instruction M16672.2 
(series).

[[Page 582]]

    (iv) Whenever any vessel or tow is moored to the bank (paragraph 
(b)(3)(i) of this section) at least one crew member shall always remain 
on board to see that proper signals are displayed and that the vessel or 
tow is properly moored at all times.
    (v) No vessel, regardless of size, shall anchor in a dredged channel 
or narrow portion of a waterway for the purpose of fishing if navigation 
is obstructed thereby.
    (4) Speed: Speeding in narrow sections is prohibited. Official signs 
indicating limited speeds shall be obeyed. Vessels shall reduce speed 
sufficiently to prevent damage when passing over vessels or structures 
in or along the waterway.
    (5) Size, assembly, and handling of tows:
    (i) On waterways 150 feet wide or less, tows which are longer than 
1,180 feet, including the towing vessel, but excluding the length of the 
hawser, or wider than one-half of the bottom width of the channel or 55 
feet, whichever is less will not be allowed, except when the District 
Commander has given special permission or the waterway has been exempted 
from these restrictions by the District Commander. Before entering any 
narrow section of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, tows in excess of one-
half the channel width, or 55 feet, will be required to stand by until 
tows which are less than one-half the channel width or 55 feet wide have 
cleared the channel. When passing is necessary in narrow channels, 
overwidth tows shall yield to the maximum. Separate permission must be 
received from the District Commander for each overlength or overwidth 
movement. In addition, the following exceptions are allowed:
    (ii) Gulf Intracoastal Waterway--Between mile 6.2 EHL (Inner Harbor 
Navigation Canal Lock) and mile 33.6 EHL tows of 78 feet in width will 
be allowed.
    (iii) Gulf Intercoastal Waterway--Between mile 33.6 EHL and the 
Mobile Bay Ship Channel, tows of 108 feet in width will be allowed if 
under 750 feet in length including the towboat but excluding the length 
of the hawser.
    (iv) Gulf Intracoastal Waterway--Mobile Bay Ship Channel to St. 
Marks, Fla., for tows made up of empty barges on the off or shallow 
side, a width of 75 feet will be allowed.
    (v) All vessels pulling tows not equipped with rudders in restricted 
channels and land cuts shall use two towlines, or a bridle on one 
towline, shortened as much as safety of the towing vessel permits, so as 
to have maximum control at all times. The various parts of a tow shall 
be securely assembled with the individual units connected by lines as 
short as practicable. In open water, the towlines and fastenings between 
barges may be lengthened so as to accommodate the wave surge. In the 
case of lengthy or cumbersome tows, or tows in restricted channels, the 
District Commander may require that tows be broken up, and may require 
the installation of a rudder or other approved steering device on the 
tow in order to avoid obstructing navigation or damaging the property of 
others. Pushing barges with towing vessel astern, towing barges with 
towing vessel alongside, or pushing and pulling barges with units of the 
tow made up both ahead and astern of the towing vessel are permissible 
provided that adequate power is employed to keep the tows under full 
control at all times. No tow shall be drawn by a vessel that has 
insufficient power or crew to permit ready maneuverability and safe 
handling.
    (vi) All tows navigating the Pass Manchac bridges in Louisiana are 
limited to no more than two barges, not to exceed a combined tow length 
of 400 feet (excluding the towboat). Vessel operators for tows exceeding 
these limits must request and receive permission from the COTP New 
Orleans prior to navigating the bridges. Requests should be made by 
telephoning the COTP at 504-589-7101. Any decision made by the COTP is 
final agency action.
    (6) Projections from vessels: Vessels or tows carrying a deck load 
which overhangs or projects over the side, or whose rigging projects 
over the side, so as to endanger passing vessels, wharves, or other 
property, shall not enter or pass through any of the narrow parts of the 
waterway without prior approval of the District Commander.

[[Page 583]]

    (7) Meeting and passing: Passing vessels shall give the proper 
signals and pass in accordance with the International Rules, the 
Navigation Rules, International-Inland, Commandant Instruction M16672.2 
(Series), where applicable. At certain intersections where strong 
currents, may be encountered, sailing directions may be issued through 
navigation bulletins or signs posted on each side of the intersections.
    Note: The Corps of Engineers also has regulations dealing with this 
section in 33 CFR 207.

Sec. 162.80  Mississippi River below mouth of Ohio River, including South and Southwest passes.

    (a) Mooring on the Mississippi River between miles 311.5 AHP and 
340.0 AHP. (1) No vessel or craft shall moor along either bank of the 
Mississippi River between miles 311.5 AHP and mile 340.0 AHP except in 
case of an emergency, pursuant to an approved navigation permit, or as 
authorized by the District Commander. Vessels may be moored any place 
outside the navigation channel in this reach in case of an emergency and 
then for only the minimum time required to terminate the emergency. When 
so moored, all vessels shall be securely tied with bow and stern lines 
of sufficient strength and fastenings to withstand currents, winds, wave 
action, suction from passing vessels or any other forces which might 
cause the vessels to break their moorings. When vessels are so moored, a 
guard shall be on board at all times to ensure that proper signals are 
displayed and that the vessels are securely and adequately moored.
    (2) Vessels may be moored any time at facilities constructed in 
accordance with an approved navigation permit or as authorized by the 
District Commander. When so moored, each vessel shall have sufficient 
fastenings to prevent the vessels from breaking loose by wind, current, 
wave action, suction from passing vessels or any other forces which 
might cause the vessel to break its mooring. The number of vessels in 
one fleet and the width of the fleet of vessels tied abreast shall not 
extend into the fairway or be greater than allowed under the permit.
    (3) Mariners should report immediately by radio or fastest available 
means to the lockmaster at Old River Lock or to any government patrol or 
survey boat in the vicinity any emergency mooring or vessels drifting 
uncontrolled within the area described in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section. It is the responsibility and duty of the master of a towing 
vessel releasing or mooring a vessel in this reach of the Mississippi 
River to report such action immediately.
    (b) Mooring on Mississippi River below Baton Rouge, La., including 
South and Southwest Passes. (1) When tied up individually or in fleets, 
vessels shall be moored with sufficient lines and shore fastenings to 
insure their remaining in place and withstanding the action of winds, 
currents and the suction of passing vessels.

waterways under his charge.
    (2) Anchoring or mooring in waterway. (i) No vessels or rafts shall 
anchor or moor in any of the land cuts or other narrow parts of the 
waterway, except in an emergency. Whenever it becomes necessary for a 
vessel or raft to stop in any such portions of the waterway, it shall be 
securely fastened to one bank and as close to the bank as possible. This 
shall be done only at such a place and under such conditions as will not 
obstruct or prevent the passage of other vessels or rafts. Stoppages 
shall be only for such periods as may be necessary.
    (ii) Except temporarily, as authorized in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of 
this section, no vessel or raft will be allowed to use any portion of 
the fairway as a mooring place without written permission from the 
District Commander.
    (iii) When tied up individually, all vessels shall be moored by bow 
and stern lines. Rafts and tows shall be secured at sufficiently close 
intervals to insure their not being drawn away from the bank by winds, 
currents, or the suction of passing vessels. Towlines shall be shortened 
so that the different parts of the tow will be as close together as 
possible. In narrow sections, no vessel or raft shall be tied abreast of 
another if the combined width of vessels or rafts is greater than 70 
feet.
    (iv) When a vessel is moored under an emergency condition, as 
provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, at least one crew 
member shall remain in attendance to display proper lights and signals 
and tend the mooring lines. The crew member shall be provided with an 
adequate means of communication or signalling a warning in the event 
that, for any reason, the vessel or tow should go adrift. Immediately 
after completion of the emergency mooring, the lockmaster of the first 
lock downstream shall be notified of the character and cargo of the 
vessel and the location of such mooring.
    (v) Vessels will not be permitted to load or unload in any of the 
land cuts, except at a regular established landing or wharf, without 
written permission secured in advance from the District Commander.
    (vi) Except in an emergency, no vessel or raft shall anchor over 
revetted banks of the waterway, nor shall any type vessel except 
launches and other small craft land against banks protected by revetment 
except at regular commercial landings.
    (3) Speed. (i) Excessive speed in narrow sections is prohibited. 
Official signs indicating limiting speeds through critical sections 
shall be strictly obeyed.
    (ii) When approaching and passing through a bridge, all vessels and 
rafts, regardless of size, shall control their speed so as to insure 
that no damage will be done to the bridge or its fenders.
    (iii) Within the last mile of approach to unattended, normally open 
automatic, movable span bridges, the factor of river flow velocity, of 
vessel (and tow) velocity, and of vessel power and

[[Page 585]]

crew capability are never to be permitted to result in a condition 
whereby the movement of vessel (and tow) cannot be completely halted or 
reversed within a 3-minute period.
    (iv) A vessel shall reduce its speed sufficiently to prevent any 
damage when approaching another vessel in motion or tied up, a wharf or 
other structure, works under construction, plant engaged in river and 
harbor improvement, levees withstanding floodwaters, buildings submerged 
or partially submerged by high waters, or any other manner of structure 
or improvements likely to be damaged by collision, suction, or wave 
action.
    (4) Assembly and handling of tows. (i) All vessels drawing tows not 
equipped with rudders in restricted channels and land cuts shall use two 
towlines, or a bridlse on one towline, shortened to the greatest 
possible extent so as to have maximum control at all times. The various 
parts of a tow shall be securely assembled with the individual units 
connected by lines as short as practicable. In open water, the towlines 
and fastenings between barges may be lengthened so as to accommodate the 
wave surge. In the case of length or cumbersome tows, or tows in 
restricted channels, the District Commander may require that tows be 
broken up, and may require the installation of a rudder or other 
approved steering device on the tow in order to avoid obstructing 
navigation or damaging the property of others. Pushing barges with 
towing vessel astern, towing barges with towing vessel alongside, or 
pushing and pulling barges with units of the tow made up both ahead and 
astern of the towing vessel is permissible provided that adequate power 
is employed to keep the tow under full control at all times.
    (ii) No tow shall be drawn by a vessel that has insufficient power 
or crew to permit ready maneuverability and safe handling.
    (iii) No vessel or tow shall navigate through a drawbridge until the 
movable span is fully opened.
    (5) Projections from vessels. No vessels carrying a deck load which 
overhangs or projects over the side, or whose rigging projects over the 
side, so as to endanger passing vessels, wharves, or other property, 
shall enter or pass through any of the narrow parts of the waterway.
    (6) Meeting and passing. Vessels on meeting or overtaking shall give 
the proper signals and pass in accordance with the Inland Rules and the 
Pilot Rules for Inland Waters. Rafts shall give to vessels the side 
demanded by proper signal. All vessels approaching dredges or other 
plant engaged on improvements to a waterway shall give the signal for 
passing and slow down sufficiently to stop if so ordered or if no 
answering signal is received. On receiving the answering signal, they 
shall then pass at a speed sufficiently slow to insure safe navigation. 
Vessels approaching an intersection or bend where the view is obstructed 
must exercise due caution. At certain intersections where strong 
currents may be encountered, sailing directions may be issued from time 
to time through navigation bulletins or signs posted on each side of the 
intersections which must be observed.
    Note: The Corps of Engineers also has regulations dealing with this 
section in 33 CFR Part 207.

Sec. 162.100  Ohio River at Louisville, KY.

    (a) Emergency Mooring Buoys. The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers has 
established four pairs of emergency mooring bouys. Each buoy is 10 feet 
in diameter with retro-reflective sides. The two buoys which comprise 
each pair are 585 feet apart and are located approximately at:
    (1) Indiana Bank--Mile 582.3 (near 18 Mile Island);
    (2) Six Mile Island--Mile 597.5;
    (3) Six Mile Island--Mile 598.2; and
    (4) Kentucky Bank--Mile 599.8 (Cox's Park).
    Note: All buoys, except those at Six Mile Island--Mile 598.2, are 
removed between May 1 and September 30. Due to the close proximity of 
the municipal water intakes, mooring of tank vessels laden with 
petroleum products or hazardous materials is not authorized on the 
Kentucky Bank, Mile 599.8 (Cox's Park).
    (b) The regulations. A vessel must not use the emergency mooring 
buoys that have been established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 
unless specifically authorized. The Captain of the Port, upon request, 
may authorize the

[[Page 586]]

use of the emergency mooring buoys by downbound towing vessels that are 
awaiting Vessel Traffic Center approval to proceed.

Sec. 162.105  Missouri River; administration and navigation.

    (a) Supervision. The District Commander, Eighth Coast Guard 
District, has certain administrative supervision overreaches of the 
river within the limits of his district and is charged with the 
enforcement under his direction of emergency regulations to govern 
navigation on the river.
    (b) Navigation. During critical flood stages on any particular 
limited reach of the Missouri River when lives, floating plant, or major 
shore installations and levees are endangered, the District Commander in 
charge of the locality shall have the authority to declare the reach of 
the river closed to navigation or to prescribe temporary speed 
regulations whenever it appears to him that such action is necessary to 
prevent immediate human suffering or to mitigate major property damage 
or destruction from wave action. The period of closure and all speed 
regulations prescribed by the District Commander shall be for the 
duration of the emergency as determined by the District Commander and 
shall be terminated at the earliest practicable time that improved river 
conditions permit.

Sec. 162.117  St. Marys River, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.

    (a) The area. The waters of the St. Marys River and lower Whitefish 
Bay from 45 deg.5[min] N. (De Tour Reef Light) to the south, to 
46 deg.38.7[min] N. (Ile Parisienne Light) to the north, except the 
waters of the St. Marys Falls Canal, and to the east along a line from 
La Pointe to Sims Point, within Potagannissing Bay and Worsley Bay.
    (b) Definitions. As used in this section:
    Two-way route means a directional route within defined limits inside 
which two-way traffic is established, and which is intended to improve 
safety in waters where navigation is difficult.
    Two-way traffic means that traffic flow is permitted in opposing 
directions, but a vessel may not meet, cross, nor overtake any other 
vessel in such a manner that it would be abreast of more than one other 
vessel within the defined limits of a waterway.
    (c) Anchoring Rules.
    (1) A vessel must not anchor:
    (i) within the waters between Brush Point and the waterworks intake 
crib off Big Point southward of the Point Aux Pins range; or
    (ii) within 0.2 nautical miles of the intake crib off Big Point.
    (2) In an emergency, vessels may anchor in a dredged channel. 
Vessels shall anchor as near to the edge of the channel as possible and 
shall get underway as soon as the emergency ceases, unless otherwise 
directed. Vessel Traffic Services St. Marys River must be advised of any 
emergency anchoring as soon as is practicable.
    (3) Vessels collected in any part of the VTS Area by reason of 
temporary closure of a channel or an impediment to navigation shall get 
underway and

[[Page 587]]

depart in the order in which they arrived, unless otherwise directed by 
Vessel Traffic Service St. Marys River. Vessel Traffic Service St. Marys 
River may advance any vessel in the order of departure to expedite the 
movement of mails, passengers, cargo of a perishable nature, to 
facilitate passage of vessels through any channel by reason of special 
circumstance, or to facilitate passage through the St. Marys Falls 
Canal.
    (d) Traffic Rules. (1) A vessel must proceed only in the established 
direction of traffic flow in the following waters:
    (i) West Neebish Channel from Buoy ``53'' to Buoy ``1''--downbound 
traffic only;

of Pipe Island Twins from Watson Reefs Light to Sweets Point--upbound 
traffic only.
    (2) A vessel 350 feet or more in length must not overtake or 
approach within .2 nautical miles of another vessel proceeding in the 
same direction in the following waterways:
    (i) West Neebish Channel between Nine Mile Point and Munuscong Lake 
Junction Lighted Bell Buoy;
    (ii) Middle Neebish Channel between Munuscong Lake Junction Lighted 
Bell Buoy and Nine Mile Point; and
    (iii) Little Rapids Cut from Six Mile Point to Buoy ``102''.
    (3) When two-way traffic is authorized in Middle Neebish Channel, a 
vessel 350 feet or more in length must not meet, cross, or overtake 
another vessel at:
    (i) Johnson Point from Buoy ``18'' to Buoy ``22'';
    (ii) Mirre Point from Buoy ``26'' to Buoy ``28''; or
    (iii) Stribling Point from Buoy ``39'' to Buoy ``43''.
    (4) Paragraph (d)(2) of this section does not apply to a vessel 
navigating through an ice field.
    (e) Winter Navigation. During the winter navigation season, the 
following waterways are normally closed:
    (1) West Neebish Channel, from Buoy ``53' to Buoy ``1'';
    (2) Pipe Island Passage to the east of Pipe Island Shoal; and
    (3) North of Pipe Island Twins, from Watson Reef Light to Sweets 
Point.
    (f) Alternate Winter Navigation Routes. (1) When West Neebish 
Channel is closed, Middle Neebish Channel (from Buoy ``2'' to Buoy 
``76'') will be open either as a two-way route or an alternating one way 
traffic lane.
    (i) When Middle Neebish Channel is a two-way route:
    (A) An upbound vessel must use the easterly 197 feet of the channel. 
However, a vessel of draft 20 feet or more must not proceed prior to 
Vessel Traffic Center approval; and
    (B) A downbound vessel must use the westerly 295 feet of the 
channel.
    (ii) When Middle Neebish Channel is an alternating one-way traffic 
lane. A vessel must use the westerly 295 feet of the channel in the 
established direction of traffic flow.
    (2) When Pipe Island Passage is closed, Pipe Island Course is a two-
way route.
    Note: The Vessel Traffic Service closes or opens these channels as 
ice conditions require after giving due consideration to the protection 
of the marine environment, waterway improvements, aids to navigation, 
the need for cross channel traffic (e.g., ferries), the availability of 
icebreakers, and the safety of the island residents who, in the course 
of their daily business, must use naturally formed ice bridges for 
transportation to and from the mainland. Under normal seasonal 
conditions, only one closing each winter and one opening each spring are 
anticipated. Prior to closing or opening these channels, interested 
parties including both shipping entities and island residents, will be 
given at least 72 hours notice by the Coast Guard.

    (a) Detroit River. The following traffic rules apply in the Detroit 
River:
    (1) The West Outer Channel is restricted to downbound vessels.
    (2) The Livingston Channel, west of Bois Blanc Island, is restricted 
to downbound vessels.
    Note: The Amherstburg Channel, in Canadian waters east of Bois Blanc 
Island, is normally restricted to upbound vessels. No vessel may proceed 
downbound in the Amherstburg Channel without authorization from the 
Regional Director General.
    (3) Between Fighting Island Channel South Light and Bar Point Pier 
Light 29D, no vessels shall meet or overtake in such a manner that more 
than two vessels would be abreast at any time.
    (4) Between the west end of Belle Isle and Peche Island Light, 
vessels may only overtake vessels engaged in towing.
    (b) River Rouge. In the River Rouge, no vessel shall overtake 
another vessel.
    (c) St. Clair River. The following traffic rules apply in the St. 
Clair River:
    (1) Between St. Clair Flats Canal Light 2 and Russell Island Light 
33, vessels may only overtake vessels engaged in towing.
    (2) Between Lake Huron Cut Lighted Buoy 1 and Port Huron Traffic 
Lighted Buoy there is a zone of alternating one way traffic. Masters 
shall coordinate their movements in accordance with the following rules;
    (i) Vessels shall not overtake.
    (ii) Vessels shall not come about.
    (iii) Vessels shall not meet.
    (iv) Downbound vessels which have passed Lake Huron Cut Lighted Buoy 
7 have the right of way over upbound vessels which have not reached the 
Port Huron Traffic Lighted Buoy. Upbound vessels awaiting transit of 
downbound vessels will maintain position south of the Port Huron Traffic 
Lighted Buoy.
    (v) Vessels transiting the zone shall coordinate passage by using 
communication procedures in Sec. 162.132.
    (vi) Transiting vessels shall have the right of way over moored 
vessels getting underway within the zone.
    (d) In the waters described in Sec. 162.130(a), the District 
Commander or Captain of the Port may establish temporary traffic rules 
for reasons which

[[Page 591]]

include but are not limited to: channel obstructions, winter navigation, 
unusual weather conditions, or unusual water levels.
    (e) The requirements of this section do not apply to public vessels 
of the U.S. or Canada engaged in icebreaking or servicing aids to 
navigation or to vessels engaged in river and harbor improvement work.
    (f) The prohibitions in this section on overtaking in certain areas 
do not apply to vessels operating in the nondisplacement mode. In this 
section, ``nondisplacement mode'' means a mode of operation in which the 
vessel is supported by hydrodynamic forces, rather than displacement of 
its weight in the water, to an extent such that the wake which would 
otherwise be generated by the vessel is significantly reduced.

<R05>
Sec. 162.205  Suisun Bay, San Joaquin River, Sacramento River, and connecting waters, CA.

    (a) San Joaquin River Deep Water Channel between Suisun Bay and the 
easterly end of the channel at Stockton; use, administration and 
navigation--(1) Maximum speed. The maximum speed for all ocean-going 
craft shall not exceed 10 miles per hour above the lower end of New York 
Slough, seven miles per hour above Criminal Point, or five miles per 
hour while passing any wharf, dock, or moored craft. As used in this 
paragraph, the speed of a vessel when navigating with the current shall 
be its rate of movement in excess of the velocity of the current.
    (2) Passing. All craft passing other boats, barges, scows, etc., in 
motion, moored or anchored, shall slow down and take every necessary 
precaution to avoid damage.
    (3) Right of way. (i) United States dredges, tugs, launches, derrick 
boats, and similar plant of contractors executing river and harbor 
improvement work for the United States, and displaying the signals 
prescribed by the regulations contained in Part 80 of this chapter shall 
have the right of way and other craft shall exercise special caution to 
avoid interference with the work on which the plant is engaged. Dredges, 
whether Federal or contractors' plant, working the channel must however, 
take special care to give ocean-going vessels sufficient room for 
passing, and must lift both spuds and the ladder, and pull clear, if an 
adequate width of clear channelway cannot otherwise be provided. Ocean-
going vessels may show at the masthead a black ball not more than 20 
inches in diameter as a signal to the dredge, and may also blow five 
long blasts of the whistle when within reasonable hearing distance of 
the dredge, such signal to be followed at the proper time by the passing 
signal described in the local pilot rules. The dredge shall promptly 
acknowledge both signals in the usual manner.
    (ii) Light-draft vessels when meeting or being overtaken by ocean-
going vessels, shall give the right of way to such vessels by making use 
of the shallower portions of the waterway.
    (iii) Rafts and tows must promptly give the channel side demanded 
upon proper signal by a vessel, and must be handled in such a manner as 
not to obstruct or interfere with the free use of the waterway by other 
craft.
    (4) Collisions. (i) Ocean-going vessels in collision in the channel 
or turning basin must, if still afloat and in a condition making 
anchorage necessary, be immediately removed to an approved anchorage 
ground, or if in such condition that beaching is necessary, they shall 
be temporarily beached on the northwest side of Mandeville Island or in 
the Old River.
    (ii) Light-draft vessels suffering collision shall be disposed of as 
directed by the District Commander or his authorized representative.

[[Page 594]]

    (5) Wrecks. In no case following accidents of fire or collision will 
a vessel be allowed to remain either anchored or grounded in the 
channel, or beached at any place where it endangers other vessels, while 
settlement is pending with the underwriters.
    (6) Other laws and regulations. In all other respects, the existing 
Federal laws and rules and regulations affecting navigable waters of the 
United States will govern in this channel.
    (b) Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel between Suisun Bay and 
easterly end of Turning Basin at West Sacramento; use, administration, 
and navigation--(1) Maximum speed for all ocean going craft--(i) Between 
Tolands Landing (Mile 6.2) and Rio Vista Bridge. When going against a 
current of two knots or more, the maximum speed over the bottom shall 
not exceed 8 knots. When going with the current, in slack water, or 
against a current of two knots or less, the maximum speed through the 
water shall not exceed 10 knots.
    (ii) Between Rio Vista Bridge and Port of Sacramento. When going 
against a current of two knots or more, the maximum speed over the 
bottom shall not exceed 5 knots. When going with the current, in slack 
water, or against a current of two knots or less, the maximum speed 
through the water shall not exceed 7 knots.
    (iii) Speed past docks or moored craft. Within 550 feet of the 
centerline of the channel the speed shall be the minimum required to 
maintain steerageway; wind, tide, current, etc., being taken into 
consideration.
    (iv) Passing. All craft passing other boats, barges, scows, etc., 
underway, moored or anchored, shall take every necessary precaution to 
avoid damage.
    (v) Speed, high-water precautions. When passing another vessel 
(underway, anchored, or tied up); a wharf or other structure; work under 
construction; plant engaged in river and harbor improvement; levees 
withstanding flood waters; buildings partially or wholly submerged by 
high water; or any other structure liable to damage by collision, 
suction or wave action; vessels shall give as much leeway as 
circumstances permit and reduce their speed sufficiently to preclude 
causing damage to the vessel or structure being passed. As deemed 
necessary for public safety during high river stages, floods, or other 
emergencies, the District Commander may prescribe, by navigation 
bulletins or other means, the limiting speed in knots or temporarily 
close the waterway or any reach of it to traffic. Since this 
subparagraph pertains directly to the manner in which vessels are 
operated, masters of vessels shall be held responsible for strict 
observance and full compliance herewith.
    (2) Right of way. (i) Dredges, tugs, launches, derrick boats and 
other similar equipment, executing river and harbor improvement work for 
the United States, and displaying the signals prescribed by the 
regulations contained in Part 80, of this Chapter, shall have the right-
of-way and other craft shall exercise special caution to avoid 
interference with the work on which the plant is engaged. Dredges, 
whether Federal or contractor's plant, working the channel must however, 
take special care to give ocean-going vessels sufficient room for 
passing, and must lift both spuds and the ladder, and pull clear, if an 
adequate width of clear channelway cannot otherwise be provided.
    (ii) Vessels intending to pass dredges or other types of floating 
plant working in navigable channels, when within a reasonable distance 
therefrom and not in any case over a mile, shall indicate such intention 
by one long blast of the whistle, and shall be directed to the proper 
side for passage by the sounding, by the dredge or other floating plant, 
of the signal prescribed in the inland pilot rules for vessels underway 
and approaching each other from opposite directions, which shall be 
answered in the usual manner by the approaching vessel. If the channel 
is not clear, the floating plant shall sound the alarm or danger signal 
and the approaching vessel shall slow down or stop and await further 
signal from the plant.
    (iii) When the pipeline from a dredge crosses the channel in such a 
way that an approaching vessel cannot pass safely around the pipeline or 
dredge, there shall be sounded immediately from the dredge the alarm or 
danger signal and the approaching vessel shall slow down or stop and 
await further signal from

[[Page 595]]

the dredge. The pipeline shall then be opened and the channel cleared as 
soon as practicable; when the channel is clear for passage the dredge 
shall so indicate by sounding the usual passing signal as prescribed in 
paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. The approaching vessel shall 
answer with a corresponding signal and pass promptly.
    (iv) When any pipeline or swinging dredge shall have given an 
approaching vessel or tow the signal that the channel is clear, the 
dredge shall straighten out within the cut for the passage of the vessel 
or tow.
    (v) Shallow draft vessels when meeting or being overtaken by ocean-
going vessels, shall give the right-of-way to such vessels by making use 
of the shallower portions of the waterway, wherever possible.
    (vi) Tows should promptly give the channel side requested by proper 
signal from a vessel, and should be handled in such a manner as not to 
obstruct or interfere with the free use of the waterway by other craft.
    (3) Obstruction of traffic. (i) Except as provided in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section no person shall willfully or carelessly obstruct 
the free navigation of the waterway, or delay any vessel having the 
right to use the waterway.
    (ii) No vessel shall anchor within the channel except in distress or 
under stress of weather. Any vessel so anchored shall be moved as 
quickly as possible to such anchorage as will leave the channel clear 
for the passage of vessels.
    (iii) Motorboats, sailboats, rowboats, and other small craft shall 
not anchor or drift in the regular ship channel except under stress of 
weather or in case of breakdown. Such craft shall be so operated that 
they will not interfere with or endanger the movement of commercial or 
public vessels.
    (4) Collisions. (i) Ocean-going vessels in collision in the channel 
or turning basin, must if still afloat and in a condition making 
anchorage necessary, be immediately removed to an approved anchorage 
ground, or if in such condition that beaching is necessary, they shall 
be temporarily beached on the southwest side of Ryer Island from Mile 
15.0 to Mile 16.3 or in the Harbor and Turning Basin at West Sacramento.
    (ii) Light-draft vessels suffering collision shall be disposed of as 
directed by the District Commander or his authorized representative.
    (5) Marine accidents. Masters, mates, pilots, owners, or other 
persons using the waterway to which this paragraph applies shall notify 
the District Commander and in the case of undocumented vessels, the 
State Division of Small Craft Harbors also, by the most expeditious 
means available of all marine accidents, such as fire, collision, 
sinking or stranding, where there is possible obstruction of the channel 
or interference with navigation or where damage to Government property 
is involved, furnishing a clear statement as to the name, address, and 
ownership of the vessel or vessels involved, the time and place, and the 
action taken. In all cases, the owner of the sunken vessel shall take 
immediate steps to mark the wreck properly.
    (6) Other laws and regulations. In all other respects, existing 
Federal laws and rules and regulations affecting navigable waters of the 
United States will govern in this channel.
    (c) Sacramento River, Decker Island Restricted Anchorage for Vessels

Sec. 164.11  Navigation under way: General.

    The owner, master, or person in charge of each vessel underway shall 
ensure that:
    (a) The wheelhouse is constantly manned by persons who:

[[Page 603]]

    (1) Direct and control the movement of the vessel; and
    (2) Fix the vessel's position;
    (b) Each person performing a duty described in paragraph (a) of this 
section is competent to perform that duty;
    (c) The position of the vessel at each fix is plotted on a chart of 
the area and the person directing the movement of the vessel is informed 
of the vessel's position;
    (d) Electronic and other navigational equipment, external fixed aids 
to navigation, geographic reference points, and hydrographic contours 
are used when fixing the vessel's position;
    (e) Buoys alone are not used to fix the vessel's position;
    Note: Buoys are aids to navigation placed in approximate positions 
to alert the mariner to hazards to navigation or to indicate the 
orientation of a channel. Buoys may not maintain an exact position 
because strong or varying currents, heavy seas, ice, and collisions with 
vessels can move or sink them or set them adrift. Although buoys may 
corroborate a position fixed by other means, buoys cannot be used to fix 
a position: however, if no other aids are available, buoys alone may be 
used to establish an estimated position.
    (f) The danger of each closing visual or each closing radar contact 
is evaluated and the person directing the movement of the vessel knows 
the evaluation;
    (g) Rudder orders are executed as given;
    (h) Engine speed and direction orders are executed as given;
    (i) Magnetic variation and deviation and gyrocompass errors are 
known and correctly applied by the person directing the movement of the 
vessel;
    (j) A person whom he has determined is competent to steer the vessel 
is in the wheelhouse at all times; \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See also 46 U.S.C. 8702(d), which requires an able seaman at the 
wheel on U.S. vessels of 100 gross tons or more in narrow or crowded 
waters during low visibility.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (k) If a pilot other than a member of the vessel's crew is employed, 
the pilot is informed of the draft, maneuvering characteristics, and 
peculiarities of the vessel and of any abnormal circumstances on the 
vessel that may affect its safe navigation.
    (l) Current velocity and direction for the area to be transited are 
known by the person directing the movement of the vessel;
    (m) Predicted set and drift are known by the person directing 
movement of the vessel;
    (n) Tidal state for the area to be transited is known by the person 
directing movement of the vessel;
    (o) The vessel's anchors are ready for letting go;
    (p) The person directing the movement of the vessel sets the 
vessel's speed with consideration for:
    (1) The prevailing visibility and weather conditions;
    (2) The proximity of the vessel to fixed shore and marine 
structures;
    (3) The tendency of the vessel underway to squat and suffer 
impairment of maneuverability when there is small underkeel clearance;
    (4) The comparative proportions of the vessel and the channel;
    (5) The density of marine traffic;
    (6) The damage that might be caused by the vessel's wake;
    (7) The strength and direction of the current; and
    (8) Any local vessel speed limit;
    (q) The tests required by Sec. 164.25 are made and recorded in the 
vessel's log; and
    (r) The equipment required by this part is maintained in operable 
condition.
    (s) Upon entering U.S. waters, the steering wheel or lever on the 
navigating bridge is operated to determine if the steering equipment is 
operating properly under manual control, unless the vessel has been 
steered under manual control from the navigating bridge within the 
preceding 2 hours, except when operating on the Great Lakes and their 
connecting and tributary waters.
    (t) At least two of the steering-gear power units on the vessel are 
in operation when such units are capable of simultaneous operation, 
except when the vessel is sailing on the Great Lakes and their 
connecting and tributary waters, and except as required by paragraph (u) 
of this section.
    (u) On each passenger vessel meeting the requirements of the 
International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1960 (SOLAS 60) 
and on each cargo vessel meeting the requirements of

[[Page 604]]

SOLAS 74 as amended in 1981, the number of steering-gear power units 
necessary to move the rudder from 35 deg. on either side to 30 deg. on 
the other in not more than 28 seconds must be in simultaneous operation.

  Appendix A to Sec. 164.38--Performance Standards For Automatic Radar 
                          Plotting Aids (ARPA)

                             1  Introduction

    1.1  The Automatic Radar Plotting Aids (ARPA) should, in order to 
improve the standard of collision avoidance at sea:
    .1  Reduce the work-load of observers by enabling them to 
automatically obtain information so that they can perform as well with 
multiple targets as they can by manually plotting a single target; and
    .2  Provide continuous, accurate and rapid situation evaluation.


[[Page 609]]


    1.2  In addition to the General Requirements for Electronic 
Navigational Aids ([IMO] Res. A.281(VII)), the ARPA should comply with 
the following minimum performance standards.

                             2  Definitions

    2.1  Definitions of terms in these performance standards are given 
in Annex 1.

                        3  Performance Standards

    3.1  Detection
    3.1.1  Where a separate facility is provided for detection of 
targets, other than by the radar observer, it should have a performance 
not inferior to that which could be obtained by the use of the radar 
display.
    3.2  Acquisition
    3.2.1  Target acquisition may be manual or automatic. However, there 
should always be a facility to provide for manual acquisition and 
cancellation. ARPA with automatic acquisition should have a facility to 
suppress acquisition in certain areas. On any range scale where 
acquisition is suppressed over a certain area, the area of acquisition 
should be indicated on the display.
    3.2.2  Automatic or manual acquisition should have a performance not 
inferior to that which could be obtained by the user of the radar 
display.
    3.3  Tracking
    3.3.1  The ARPA should be able to automatically track, process, 
simultaneously display and continuously update the information on at 
least:

    .1  20 targets, if automatic acquisition is provided, whether 
automatically or manually acquired; or
    .2  10 targets, if only manual acquisition is provided.

    3.3.2  If automatic acquisition is provided, description of the 
criteria of selection of targets for tracking should be provided to the 
user. If the ARPA does not track all targets visible on the display, 
targets which are being tracked should be clearly indicated on the 
display. The reliability of tracking should not be less than that 
obtainable using manual recording of successive target positions 
obtained from the radar display.
    3.3.3  Provided the target is not subject to target swop, the ARPA 
should continue to track an acquired target which is clearly 
distinguishable on the display for 5 out of 10 consecutive scans.
    3.3.4  The possibility of tracking errors, including target swop, 
should be minimized by ARPA design. A qualitative description of the 
effects of error sources on the automatic tracking and corresponding 
errors should be provided to the user, including the effects of low 
signal to noise and low signal to clutter ratios caused by sea returns, 
rain, snow, low clouds and non-synchronous emission.
    3.3.5  The ARPA should be able to display on request at least four 
equally time-spaced past positions of any targets being tracked over a 
period of at least eight minutes.
    3.4  Display
    3.4.1  The Display may be a separate or integral part of the ship's 
radar. However, the ARPA display should include all the data required to 
be provided by a radar display in accordance with the performance 
standards for navigational radar equipment adopted by the Organization.
    3.4.2 The design should be such that any malfunction of ARPA parts 
producing information additional to information to be produced by the 
radar as required by the performance standards for navigational 
equipment adopted by IMO should not affect the integrity of the basic 
radar presentation.
    3.4.3 The display on which ARPA information is presented should have 
an effective diameter of at least 340 mm.
    3.4.4  The ARPA facilities should be available on at least the 
following range scales:

    .1  12 or 16 miles;
    .2  3 or 4 miles.

    3.4.5  There should be a positive indication of the range scale in 
use.
    3.4.6  The ARPA should be capable of operating with a relative 
motion display with ``north-up'' and either ``head-up'' or ``course-up'' 
azimuth stabilization. In addition, the ARPA may also provide for a true 
motion display. If true motion is provided, the operator should be able 
to select for his display either true or relative motion. There should 
be a positive indication of the display mode and orientation in use.
    3.4.7  The course and speed information generated by the ARPA for 
acquired targets should be displayed in a vector or graphic form which 
clearly indicates the target's predicted motion. In this regard:

    .1  ARPA presenting predicted information in vector form only should 
have the option of both true and relative vectors;
    .2  An ARPA which is capable of presenting target course and speed 
information in graphic form, should also, on request, provide the 
target's true and/or relative vector;
    .3  Vectors displayed should be either time adjustable or have a 
fixed time-scale;
    .4  A positive indication of the time-scale of the vector in use 
should be given.

    3.4.8  The ARPA information should not obscure radar information in 
such a manner as to degrade the process of detecting targets. The 
display of ARPA data should be under the control of the radar observer. 
It should be possible to cancel the display of unwanted ARPA data.
    3.4.9  Means should be provided to adjust independently the 
brilliance of the ARPA data and radar data, including complete 
elimination of the ARPA data.

[[Page 610]]

    3.4.10  The method of presentation should ensure that the ARPA data 
is clearly visible in general to more than one observer in the 
conditions of light normally experienced on the bridge of a ship by day 
and by night. Screening may be provided to shade the display from 
sunlight but not to the extent that it will impair the observer's 
ability to maintain a proper lookout. Facilities to adjust the 
brightness should be provided.
    3.4.11  Provisions should be made to obtain quickly the range and 
bearing of any object which appears on the ARPA display.
    3.4.12  When a target appears on the radar display and, in the case 
of automatic acquisition, enters within the acquisition area chosen by 
the observer or, in the case of manual acquisition, has been acquired by 
the observer, the ARPA should present in a period of not more than one 
minute an indication of the target's motion trend and display within 
three minutes the target's predicted motion in accordance with 
paragraphs 3.4.7, 3.6, 3.8.2 and 3.8.3.
    3.4.13  After changing range scales on which the ARPA facilities are 
available or resetting the display, full plotting information should be 
displayed within a period of time not exceeding four scans.
    3.5  Operational Warnings
    3.5.1  The ARPA should have the capability to warn the observer with 
a visual and/or audible signal of any distinguishable target which 
closes to a range or transits a zone chosen by the observer. The target 
causing the warning should be clearly indicated on the display.
    3.5.2  The ARPA should have the capability to warn the observer with 
a visual and/or audible signal of any tracked target which is predicted 
to close to within a minimum range and time chosen by the observer. The 
target causing the warning should be clearly indicated on the display.
    3.5.3  The ARPA should clearly indicate if a tracked target is lost, 
other than out of range, and the target's last tracked position should 
be clearly indicated on the display.
    3.5.4  It should be possible to activate or de-activate the 
operational warnings.
    3.6  Data Requirements
    3.6.1  At the request of the observer the following information 
should be immediately available from the ARPA in alphanumeric form in 
regard to any tracked target:

1. Present range to the target;
2. Present bearing of the target;.
.3  Predicted target range at the closest point of approach (CPA);
.4  Predicted time to CPA (TCPA);
.5  Calculated true course of target;
.6  Calculated true speed of target.
    3.7  Trial Manoeuvre
    3.7.1  The ARPA should be capable of simulating the effect on all 
tracked targets of an own ship manoeuvre without interrupting the 
updating of target information. The simulation should be initiated by 
the depression either of a spring-loaded switch, or of a function key, 
with a positive identification on the display.
    3.8  Accuracy
    3.8.1  The ARPA should provide accuracies not less than those given 
in paragraphs 3.8.2 and 3.8.3 for the four scenarios defined in Annex 2. 
With the sensor errors specified in Annex 3, the values given relate to 
the best possible manual plotting performance under environmental 
conditions of plus and minus ten degrees of roll.
    3.8.2  An ARPA should present within one minute of steady state 
tracking the relative motion trend of a target with the following 
accuracy values (95 percent probability values):

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3.8.4  When a tracked target, or own ship, has completed a 
manoeuvre, the system should present in a period of not more than one 
minute an indication of the target's motion trend, and display within 
three minutes the target's predicted motion in accordance with 
paragraphs 3.4.7, 3.6, 3.8.2 and 3.8.3
    3.8.5  The ARPA should be designed in such a manner that under the 
most favorable

[[Page 611]]

conditions of own ship motion the error contribution from the ARPA 
should remain insignificant compared to the errors associated with the 
input sensors, for scenarios of Annex 2.
    3.9  Connections with other equipment
    3.9.1  The ARPA should not degrade the performance of any equipment 
providing sensor inputs. The connection of the ARPA to any other 
equipment should not degrade the performance of that equipment.
    3.10  Performance test and warnings
    3.10.1  The ARPA should provide suitable warnings of ARPA 
malfunction to enable the observer to monitor the proper operation of 
the system. Additionally test programmes should be available so that the 
overall performance of ARPA can be assessed periodically against a known 
solution.
    3.11  Equipment used with ARPA
    3.11.1  Log and speed indicators providing inputs to ARPA equipment 
should be capable of providing the ship's speed through the water.

   Appendix B to Sec. 164.38--U.S. Maritime Administration Collision 
                     Avoidance System Specification

    A collision system designed as a supplement to both surface search 
navigational radars via interswitching shall be installed. The system 
shall provide unattended monitoring of all radar echoes and automatic 
audio and visual alarm signals that will alert the watch officer of a 
possible threat. The display shall be contained within a console capable 
of being installed adjacent to the radar displays in the wheelhouse and 
may form a part of the bridge console.
    Provision for signal input from the ship's radars, gyro compass, and 
speed log, without modification to these equipments shall be made. The 
collision avoidance system, whether operating normally or having failed, 
must not introduce any spurious signals or otherwise degrade the 
performance of the radars, the gyro compass or the speed log.
    Computer generated display data for each acquired target shall be in 
the form of a line or vector indicating true or relative target course, 
speed and both present and extrapolated future positions. Data shall be 
automatically displayed on a cathode ray tube or other suitable display 
contrivance sufficiently bright and unobstructed to permit viewing by 
more than one person at a time.
    In addition to displaying the collision potential of the most 
threatening fixed and moving targets, the system shall be capable of 
simultaneously showing land masses.
    The system display shall include a heading indication and bearing 
ring. The system shall also have the capability of allowing the operator 
to select ``head-up'' and to cancel the vector or line presentation of 
any of the targets. The presentation shall be non-smearing when changing 
modes or display scales in order to permit rapid evaluation of the 
displayed data.
    Target acquisition, for display data purposes, may be manual, 
automatic or both, as specified by Owner.
    For any manual acquisition system the alarms shall be initiated by a 
preset minimum range; and likewise for any automatic acquisition system 
the alarms shall be initiated by a preset minimum acceptable passing 
distance (CPA--Closest Point of Approach) and a preset advance warning 
time (TCPA--Time to Closest Point of Approach). Means shall be provided 
to silence the audio

[[Page 613]]

alarm for a given threat but the alarm shall resound upon a subsequent 
threat. The visual alarm shall continue to operate until all threats 
have been eliminated. If the collision avoidance system fails to perform 
as indicated above, after the system is set for unattended monitoring, 
the system shall produce both audio and visual warning alarms.
    The system shall be capable of simulating a trial maneuver.
    In addition to the target display, an alpha-numeric readout shall be 
provided which can present range, bearing, course, speed, CPA and TCPA 
for any selected target, either on the target display or by other 
display means.
    The collision avoidance system shall be energized from the interior 
communications panel board in the wheelhouse.
    The collision avoidance function may be incorporated in an 
integrated conning system, provided that failure of any other integrated 
system component will not degrade the collision avoidance function.

Sec. 164.74  Towline and terminal gear for towing astern.

    (a) Towline. The owner, master, or operator of each vessel towing 
astern shall ensure that the strength of each towline is adequate for 
its intended service, considering at least the following factors:
    (1) The size and material of each towline must be--
    (i) Appropriate for the horsepower or bollard pull of the vessel;
    (ii) Appropriate for the static loads and dynamic loads expected 
during the intended service;
    (iii) Appropriate for the sea conditions expected during the 
intended service;
    (iv) Appropriate for exposure to the marine environment and to any 
chemicals used or carried on board the vessel;
    (v) Appropriate for the temperatures of normal stowage and service 
on board the vessel;
    (vi) Compatible with associated navigational-safety equipment; and
    (vii) Appropriate for the likelihood of mechanical damage.
    (2) Each towline as rigged must be--
    (i) Free of knots;
    (ii) Spliced with a thimble, or have a poured socket at its end; and
    (iii) Free of wire clips except for temporary repair, for which the 
towline must have a thimble and either five wire clips or as many wire 
clips as the manufacturer specifies for the nominal diameter and 
construction of the towline, whichever is more.
    (3) The condition of each towline must be monitored through the--
    (i) Keeping on board the towing vessel or in company files of a 
record of the towline's initial minimum breaking strength as determined 
by the manufacturer, by a classification (``class'') society authorized 
in Sec. 157.04 of this chapter, or by a tensile test that meets API 
Specification 9A, Specification for Wire Rope, Section 3; ASTM D 4268 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 164.03), Standard Test Method for 
Testing Fiber Ropes; or Cordage Institute CIA 3, Standard Test Methods 
for Fiber Rope Including Standard Terminations;
    (ii) If the towline is purchased from another owner, master, or 
operator of a vessel with the intent to use it as a towline or if it is 
retested for any reason, keeping on board the towing vessel or in 
company files of a record of each retest of the towline's minimum 
breaking strength as determined by a class society authorized in 
Sec. 157.04 of this chapter or by a tensile test that meets API 
Specification 9A, Section 3; ASTM D 4268 (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 164.03) or Cordage Institute CIA 3, Standard Test Methods;
    (iii) Conducting visual inspections of the towline in accordance 
with the manufacturer's recommendations, or at least monthly, and 
whenever the serviceability of the towline is in doubt (the inspections 
being conducted by the owner, master, or operator, or by a person on 
whom the owner, master, or operator confers the responsibility to take 
corrective measures appropriate for the use of the towline);
    (iv) Evaluating the serviceability of the whole towline or any part 
of the towline, and removing the whole or part from service either as 
recommended by the manufacturer or a class society authorized in 
Sec. 157.04 of this chapter or in accordance with a replacement schedule 
developed by the owner, master, or operator that accounts for at least 
the--
    (A) Nautical miles on, or time in service of, the towline;
    (B) Operating conditions experienced by the towline;
    (C) History of loading of the towline;
    (D) Surface condition, including corrosion and discoloration, of the 
towline;
    (E) Amount of visible damage to the towline;
    (F) Amount of material deterioration indicated by measurements of 
diameter and, if applicable, measurements of lay extension of the 
towline; and
    (G) Point at which a tensile test proves the minimum breaking 
strength of the towline inadequate by the standards of paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section, if necessary; and
    (v) Keeping on board the towing vessel or in company files of a 
record of the material condition of the towline when inspected under 
paragraphs (a)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section. Once this record lapses 
for three months or more, except when a vessel is laid up or

[[Page 621]]

out of service or has not deployed its towline, the owner, master, or 
operator shall retest the towline or remove it from service.
    (b) Terminal gear. The owner, master, or operator of each vessel 
towing astern shall ensure that the gear used to control, protect, and 
connect each towline meets the following criteria:
    (1) The material and size of the terminal gear are appropriate for 
the strength and anticipated loading of the towline and for the 
environment;
    (2) Each connection is secured by at least one nut with at least one 
cotter pin or other means of preventing its failure;
    (3) The lead of the towline is appropriate to prevent sharp bends in 
the towline from fairlead blocks, chocks, or tackle;
    (4) There is provided a method, whether mechanical or non-
mechanical, that does not endanger operating personnel but that easily 
releases the towline;
    (5) The towline is protected from abrasion or chafing by chafing 
gear, lagging, or other means;
    (6) Except on board a vessel towing in ice on Western Rivers or one 
using a towline of synthetic or natural fiber, there is fitted a winch 
that evenly spools and tightly winds the towline; and
    (7) If a winch is fitted, there is attached to the main drum a brake 
that has holding power appropriate for the horsepower or bollard pull of 
the vessel and can be operated without power to the winch.

<R05>
Sec. 164.76  Towline and terminal gear for towing alongside and pushing ahead.

    The owner, master, or operator of each vessel towing alongside or 
pushing ahead shall ensure that the face wires, spring lines, and push 
gear used--
    (a) Are appropriate for the vessel's horsepower;
    (b) Are appropriate for the arrangement of the tow;
    (c) Are frequently inspected; and
    (d) Remain serviceable.

[CGD 94-020, 61 FR 35075, July 3, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 164.78  Navigation under way: Towing vessels.

    (a) The owner, master, or operator of each vessel towing shall 
ensure that each person directing and controlling the movement of the 
vessel--
    (1) Understands the arrangement of the tow and the effects of 
maneuvering on the vessel towing and on the vessel, barge, or object 
being towed;
    (2) Can fix the position of the vessel using installed navigational 
equipment, aids to navigation, geographic reference-points, and 
hydrographic contours;
    (3) Does not fix the position of the vessel using buoys alone (Buoys 
are aids to navigation placed in approximate positions either to alert 
mariners to hazards to navigation or to indicate the orientation of a 
channel. They may not maintain exact charted positions, because strong 
or varying currents, heavy seas, ice, and collisions with vessels can 
move or sink them or set them adrift. Although they may corroborate a 
position fixed by other means, they cannot fix a position; however, if 
no other aids are available, buoys alone may establish an estimated 
position.);
    (4) Evaluates the danger of each closing visual or radar contact;
    (5) Knows and applies the variation and deviation, where a magnetic 
compass is fitted and where charts or maps have enough detail to enable 
this type of correction;
    (6) Knows the speed and direction of the current, set, drift, and 
tidal state for the area to be transited; and
    (7) Proceeds at a speed prudent for the weather, visibility, traffic 
density, tow draft, possibility of wake damage, speed of the current, 
and local speed-limits.
    (b) The owner, master, or operator of each vessel towing shall 
ensure that the tests and inspections required by Sec. 164.80 are 
conducted and that the results are entered in the log or other record 
carried on board.

<R05>
Sec. 164.80  Tests and inspections.

    (a) The owner, master, or operator of each towing vessel of less 
than 1,600 GT shall ensure that the following tests and inspections of 
gear occur before the vessel embarks on a voyage of more than 24 hours 
or when each new master or operator assumes command:
    (1) Steering-systems. A test of the steering-gear-control system; a 
test of the main steering gear from the alternative power supply, if 
installed; a verification of the rudder-angle indicator relative to the 
actual position of the rudder; and a visual inspection of the steering 
gear and its linkage.
    (2) Navigational equipment. A test of all installed navigational 
equipment.
    (3) Communications. Operation of all internal vessel control 
communications and vessel-control alarms, if installed.
    (4) Lights. Operation of all navigational lights and all 
searchlights.
    (5) Terminal gear. Visual inspection of tackle; of connections of 
bridle and towing pendant, if applicable; of chafing gear; and of the 
winch brake, if installed.
    (6) Propulsion systems. Visual inspection of the spaces for main 
propulsion machinery, of machinery, and of devices for monitoring 
machinery.
    (b) The owner, master, or operator of each towing vessel of 1,600 GT 
or more shall ensure that the following tests of equipment occur at the 
frequency required by Sec. 164.25 and that the following inspections of 
gear occur before the vessel embarks on a voyage of more than 24 hours 
or when each new master or operator assumes command:
    (1) Navigational equipment. Tests of onboard equipment as required 
by Sec. 164.25.
    (2) Terminal gear. Visual inspection of tackle; of connections of 
bridle and towing pendant, if applicable; of chafing gear; and of the 
winch brake, if installed.

[CGD 94-020, 61 FR 35075, July 3, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 164.82  Maintenance, failure, and reporting.

    (a) Maintenance. The owner, master, or operator of each towing 
vessel shall maintain operative the navigational-safety equipment 
required by Sec. 164.72.
    (b) Failure. If any of the navigational-safety equipment required by 
Sec. 164.72 fails during a voyage, the owner, master, or operator of the 
towing vessel shall exercise due diligence to repair it at the earliest 
practicable time. He or she shall enter its failure in the log or other 
record carried on board. The failure of equipment, in itself, does not 
constitute a violation of this rule; nor does it constitute 
unseaworthiness; nor does it obligate an owner, master, or operator to 
moor or anchor the vessel. However, the owner, master, or operator shall 
consider the state of the equipment--along with such factors as weather, 
visibility, traffic, and the dictates of good seamanship--in deciding 
whether it is safe for the vessel to proceed.
    (c) Reporting. The owner, master, or operator of each towing vessel 
whose equipment is inoperative or otherwise impaired while the vessel is 
operating within a Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) Area shall report the 
fact as required by 33 CFR 161.124. (33 CFR 161.124 requires that each 
user of a VTS report to the Vessel Traffic Center as soon as 
practicable:
    (1) Any absence or malfunction of vessel-operating equipment for 
navigational safety, such as propulsion machinery, steering gear, radar, 
gyrocompass, echo depth-sounding or other sounding device, automatic 
dependent surveillance equipment, or navigational lighting;
    (2) Any condition on board the vessel likely to impair navigation, 
such as shortage of personnel or lack of current nautical charts or 
maps, or publications; and
    (3) Any characteristics of the vessel that affect or restrict the 
maneuverability of the vessel, such as arrangement of cargo, trim, 
loaded condition, under-keel clearance, and speed.)
    (d) Deviation and authorization. The owner, master, or operator of 
each towing vessel unable to repair within 96 hours an inoperative 
marine radar required by Sec. 164.72(a) shall so notify the Captain of 
the Port (COTP) and shall seek from the COTP both a deviation from the 
requirements of this section and an authorization for continued 
operation in the area to be transited.

[[Page 623]]

Failure of redundant navigational-safety equipment, including but not 
limited to failure of one of two installed radars, where each satisfies 
Sec. 164.72(a), does not necessitate either a deviation or an 
authorization.
    (1) The initial notice and request for a deviation and an 
authorization may be spoken, but the request must also be written. The 
written request must explain why immediate repair is impracticable, and 
state when and by whom the repair will be made.
    (2) The COTP, upon receiving even a spoken request, may grant a 
deviation and an authorization from any of the provisions of 
Secs. 164.70 through 164.82 for a specified time if he or she decides 
that they would not impair the safe navigation of the vessel under 
anticipated conditions.

waters, an official referenced in paragraph (c)(2) of this section may 
require the master, owner, or person in charge of a vessel within the 
security zone, including all auxiliary vessels, to provide verbal 
assurance that the vessel will not enter Cuban territorial waters as a 
condition for a vessel to get underway from a berth, pier, mooring, or 
anchorage in the security zone, or depart from the security zone. The 
failure of a vessel master, owner, or person in charge of a vessel 
within the Security Zone, including all auxiliary vessels, to provide 
requested verbal assurances shall not be used as the sole basis for 
seizing the vessel for forfeiture under the Security Zone. In addition, 
an official referenced in paragraph (c)(2) may require the master, 
owner, or person in charge of the vessel to identify all persons on 
board the vessel and provide verbal assurances that all persons on board 
have received actual notice of the regulations in this section.

Sec. 165.810  Mississippi River, LA-regulated navigation area.

    (a) Purpose and applicability. This section prescribes rules for all 
vessels operating in the Lower Mississippi River below mile 233.9 above 
Head of Passes including South Pass and Southwest Pass, to assist in the 
prevention of allisions; collisions and groundings so as to ensure port 
safety and protect the navigable waters of the Mississippi River from 
environmental harm resulting from those incidents, and to enhance the 
safety of passenger vessels moored or anchored in the Mississippi River.

[[Page 694]]

    (b) Lower Mississippi River below mile 233.9 above Head of Passes 
including South and Southwest Passes:
    (1) Supervision. The use, administration, and navigation of the 
waterways to which this paragraph applies shall be under the supervision 
of the District Commander, Eighth Coast Guard District.
    (2) Speed; high-water precautions. When passing another vessel (in 
motion, anchored, or tied up), a wharf or other structure, work under 
construction, plant engaged in river and harbor improvement, levees 
withstanding flood waters, building partially or wholly submerged by 
high water, or any other structure liable to damage by collision, 
suction or wave action, vessels shall give as much leeway as 
circumstances permit and reduce their speed sufficiently to preclude 
causing damages to the vessel or structure being passed. Since this 
subparagraph pertains directly to the manner in which vessels are 
operated, masters of vessels shall be held responsible for strict 
observance and full compliance therewith. During high river stages, 
floods, or other emergencies, the District Commander may prescribe by 
navigation bulletins or other means the limiting speed in land miles per 
hour deemed necessary for the public safety for the entire section or 
any part of the waterways covered by this paragraph, and such limiting 
speed shall be strictly observed.
    (3) Towing. Towing in any formation by a vessel with insufficient 
power to permit ready maneuverability and safe handling is prohibited.
    (c) Movement of vessels in vicinity of Algiers Point, New Orleans 
Harbor:
    (1) Control lights. When the Mississippi River reaches 8 feet on the 
Carrollton Gage on a rising stage, and until the gage reads 9 feet on a 
falling stage, the movement of all tugs with tows and all ships, whether 
under their own power or in tow, but excluding tugs or towboats without 
tows or river craft of comparable size and maneuverability operating 
under their own power, in the vicinity of Algiers Point shall be 
governed by red and green lights designated and located as follows: 
Governor Nicholls Light located on the left descending bank on the wharf 
shed at the upstream end of Esplanade Avenue Wharf, New Orleans, 
approximately 94.3 miles above Head of Passes; and Gretna Light located 
on the right descending bank on top of the levee at the foot of Ocean 
Avenue, Gretna, approximately 96.6 miles above Head of Passes. Governor 
Nicholls Light has lights visible from both upstream and downstream, and 
Gretna Light has lights visible from upstream, all indicating by proper 
color the direction of traffic around Algiers Point. From downstream, 
Gretna Light always shows green. All lights are visible throughout the 
entire width of the river and flash once every second. A green light 
displayed ahead of a vessel (in the direction of travel) indicates that 
Algiers Point is clear and the vessel may proceed. A red light displayed 
ahead of a vessel (in the direction of travel) indicates that Algiers 
Point is not clear and the vessel shall not proceed. Absence of lights 
shall be considered a danger signal and no attempt shall be made to 
navigate through the restricted area.
    Note: To provide advance information to downbound vessels whether 
the control light at Gretna (Gretna Light) is red or green, a traffic 
light is located at Westwego on the right descending bank, on the river 
batture at the end of Avenue B, approximately 101.4 miles above Head of 
Passes.
    (2) Ascending vessels. Ascending vessels shall not proceed farther 
up the river than a line connecting the upper end of Atlantic Street 
Discharge Light (on right descending bank) with the lower end of Desire 
Street Wharf (on left descending bank) when a red light is displayed. 
Vessels waiting for a change of signal shall keep clear of descending 
vessels.
    (3) Descending vessels. (i) Descending vessels shall not proceed 
farther down the river than a line connecting the lower end of Julia 
Street Wharf (on left descending bank) with the vertical flagpole at 
Eastern Associated Terminals (on right descending bank) when a red light 
is displayed. Vessels shall round to and be headed upstream before they 
reach that line, if the signal remains against the vessel. Vessels 
waiting for a change of signal shall keep clear of ascending vessels.
    (ii) Vessels destined to a wharf above the lower end of Julia Street 
Wharf

[[Page 695]]

shall signal the Gretna towerman three long blasts and one short blast 
of a whistle or horn to indicate that the vessel is not bound below the 
Julia Street Wharf.
    (iii) The master, pilot, or authorized representative of any vessel 
scheduled to depart from a wharf between Governor Nicholls Light and 
Louisiana Avenue, bound downstream around Algiers Point, shall 
communicate with the Governor Nicholls Light towerman by telephone to 
determine whether the channel at Algiers Point is clear before 
departure. When the point is clear, vessels shall then proceed promptly 
so that other traffic will not be unnecessarily delayed.
    Note: Telephone numbers of both signal towers will be published in 
navigation bulletins in advance of each operating period.
    (4) Minor changes. The District Commander is authorized to waive 
operation or suspension of the lights whenever prospective river stages 
make it appear that the operation or suspension will be required for 
only a brief period of time or when river stages will rise or fall below 
the critical stage which is established for operation or suspension by 
only a few tenths on the Carrollton Gage.
    (5) Underpowered vessels. When the Carrollton Gage reads 12 feet or 
higher, any vessel which is considered by the master or pilot as being 
underpowered or a poor handler shall not navigate around Algiers Point 
without the assistance of a tug or tugs.
    (6) Towing. When the Carrollton Gage reads 12 feet or higher, towing 
on a hawser in a downstream direction between Julia Street and Desire 
Street is prohibited except by special permission of the District 
Commander.
    (d) Navigation of South and Southwest Passes.
    (1) No vessel, except small craft and towboats and tugs without 
tows, shall enter either South Pass or Southwest Pass from the Gulf 
until after any descending vessel which has approached within two and 
one-half (2\1/2\) miles of the outer end of the jetties and visible to 
the ascending vessel shall have passed to sea.
    (2) No vessel having a speed of less than ten mph shall enter South 
Pass from the Gulf when the stage of the Mississippi River exceeds 15 
feet on the Carrollton Gage at New Orleans. This paragraph does not 
apply when Southwest Pass is closed to navigation.
    (3) No vessel, except small craft and towboats and tugs without 
tows, ascending South Pass shall pass Franks Crossing Light until after 
a descending vessel shall have passed Depot Point Light.
    (4) No vessel, except small craft and towboats and tugs without 
tows, shall enter the channel at the head of South Pass until after an 
ascending vessel which has reached Franks Crossing Light shall have 
passed through into the river.
    (5) When navigating South Pass during periods of darkness no tow 
shall consist of more than one towed vessel other than small craft, and 
during daylight hours no tow shall consist of more than two towed 
vessels other than small craft. Tows may be in any formation. When 
towing on a hawser, the hawser shall be as short as practicable to 
provide full control at all times.
    (6) When towing in Southwest Pass during periods of darkness no tow 
shall consist of more than two towed vessels other than small craft, and 
during daylight hours no tow shall consist of more than three towed 
vessels other than small craft.
    (e) Watch requirements for anchored and moored passenger vessels.
    (1) Passenger vessels. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section, each passenger vessel with one or more passengers on 
board, must--
    (i) Keep a continuously manned pilothouse; and
    (ii) Monitor river activities and marine VHF, emergency and working 
frequencies of the port, so as to be immediately available to take 
necessary action to protect the vessel, crew, and passengers if an 
emergency radio broadcast, danger signal, or visual or other indication 
of a problem is received or detected.
    (2) Each ferryboat, and each small passenger vessel to which 46 CFR 
175.110 applies, may monitor river activities using a portable radio 
from a vantage point other than the pilothouse.

[[Page 696]]

    (f) Each self-propelled vessel of 1,600 or more gross tons subject 
to 33 CFR part 164 shall also comply with the following:
    (1) While under way in the RNA, each vessel must have an engineering 
watch capable of monitoring the propulsion system, communicating with 
the bridge, and implementing manual-control measures immediately when 
necessary. The watch must be physically present in the machinery spaces 
or in the machinery-control spaces and must consist of at least a 
licensed engineer.
    (2) Before embarking a pilot when entering or getting under way in 
the RNA, the master of each vessel shall ensure that the vessel is in 
compliance with 33 CFR part 164.
    (3) The master shall ensure that the chief engineer has certified 
that the following additional operating conditions will be satisfied so 
long as the vessel is under way within the RNA:
    (i) The main propulsion plant is in all respects ready for 
operations including the main-propulsion air-start systems, fuel 
systems, lubricating systems, cooling systems, and automation systems;
    (ii) Cooling, lubricating, and fuel-oil systems are at proper 
operating temperatures;
    (iii) Main propulsion machinery is available to immediately respond 
to the full range of maneuvering commands any load-limiting programs or 
automatic acceleration-limiting programs that would limit the speed of 
response to engine orders beyond that needed to prevent immediate damage 
to the propulsion machinery are capable of being overridden immediately.
    (iv) Main-propulsion standby systems are ready to be immediately 
placed in service.

Sec. 165.1301   Puget Sound and Adjacent Waters in Northwestern Washington--Regulated Navigation Area.

    The following is a regulated navigation area--All of the following 
northwestern Washington waters under the jurisdiction of the Captain of 
the Port, Puget Sound: Puget Sound, Hood Canal, Possession Sound, 
Elliott Bay, Commencement Bay, the San Juan Archipelago, Rosario Strait, 
Guemes Channel, Bellingham Bay, U.S. waters of the Strait of the Strait 
of Juan de Fuca, Haro Strait, Boundary Pass, and Georgia Strait, and all 
lesser bays and harbors adjacent to the above.
    (a) Definitions as used in this section:
    (1) Vessels engaged in fishing are as identified in the definition 
found in Rule 3 of the International Regulations for Prevention of 
Collisions at Sea, 1972, (72 COLREGS), found in Appendix A, Part 81 of 
this chapter.
    (2) Hazardous levels of vessel traffic congestion are as defined at 
the time by Puget Sound Vessel Traffic Service.
    (b) Nothing in this section shall be construed as relieving any 
party from their responsibility to comply with applicable rules set 
forth in the 72 COLREGS.
    (c) General Regulations: The provisions of this paragraph apply at 
all times.
    (1) Vessels engaged in fishing or other operations--that are 
distinct

[[Page 726]]

from vessels following a TSS or a connecting precautionary area east of 
New Dungeness and which are not required by the Bridge to Bridge 
Radiotelephone Regulations to maintain a listening watch, are highly 
encouraged to maintain a listening watch on the Puget Sound Vessel 
Traffic Service (PSVTS) VHF-FM radio frequency for the area in which the 
vessel is operating. A safe alternative to the radio listening watch is 
to stay clear of the TSS and connecting precautionary area.
    (2) Vessels engaged in gill net fishing at any time between sunset 
and sunrise in any of the waters defining the regulated navigation are 
of this section shall, in addition to the navigation lights and shapes 
required by Part 81 of this title (72 COLREGS), display at the end of 
the net most distant from the vessel on all-round (32-point) white light 
visible for a minimum of two nautical miles and displayed from at least 
three feet above the surface of the water.
    (3) Vessels engaged in fishing, including gillnet and purse seine 
fishing, are prohibited in the following Prohibited Fishing Area: The 
Hood Canal Bridge, to include the waters within a one-half nautical mile 
radius of the center of the main ship channel draw span during the 
immediate approach and transit of the draw by public vessels of the 
United States.
    (4) East of New Dungeness, vessels engaged in fishing in a traffic 
lane or connecting precautionary area shall tend nets or other gear 
placed in the water so as to facilitate the movement of the vessel or 
gear from the traffic lane or precautionary area upon the approach of a 
vessel following the TSS.
    (d) Congested Regulations: The provisions under this paragraph apply 
only when imposed in specific locations by Puget Sound Vessel Traffic 
Service. They are intended to enhance vessel traffic safety during 
periods and in locations where hazardous levels of vessel traffic 
congestion are deemed to exist by Puget Sound Vessel Traffic Service. 
Operations potentially creating vessel traffic congestion include, but 
are not limited to, vessels engaged in fishing, including gillnet or 
purse seine, recreational fishing derbies, regattas, or permitted marine 
events.
    (1) Vessels engaged in fishing or other operations--that are 
distinct from vessels following a Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) or a 
connecting precautionary area east of New Dungeness, may not remain in, 
nor their gear remain in, a traffic lane or a connecting precautionary 
area east of New Dungeness when a vessel following a TSS approaches. 
Such vessels not following a TSS or a connecting precautionary area 
shall draw in their gear, maneuver, or otherwise clear these areas so 
that their action is complete at least fifteen minutes before the 
arrival of a vessel following the TSS. Vessels which are required by 
this paragraph to remain clear of a connecting precautionary area east 
of New Dungeness or a traffic lane must also remain clear of the 
adjacent separation zone when in a TSS east of New Dungeness.
    (2) A vessel following the TSS may not exceed a speed of 11 knots 
through the water.
    (3) Vessels engaged in fishing, including gillnet and purse seine 
fishing, are prohibited in the following Prohibited Fishing Area: 
Edmonds/Kingston ferry crossing lanes, to include the waters within one-
quarter nautical mile on either side of a straight line connecting the 
Edmonds and Kingston ferry landings during the hours that the ferry is 
operating.
    (e) Authorization to deviate from this section.
    (1) Commander, Thirteenth Coast Guard District may, upon written 
request, issue an authorization to deviate from this section if the 
proposed deviation provides a level of safety equivalent to or beyond 
that provided by the required procedure. An application for 
authorization must state the need for the deviation and describe the 
proposed alternative operation.
    (2) PSVTS may, upon verbal request, authorize a deviation from this 
section for a voyage, or part of a voyage, if the proposed deviation 
provides a level of safety equivalent to or beyond that provided by the 
required procedure. The deviation request must be made well in advance 
to allow the requesting vessel and the Vessel Traffic Center (VTC) 
sufficient time to assess the

[[Page 727]]

safety of the proposed deviation. Discussions between the requesting 
vessel and the VTC should include, but are not limited to, information 
on vessel handling characteristics, traffic density, radar contracts, 
and environmental conditions.
    (3) In an emergency, the master, pilot, or person directing the 
movement of the vessel following the TSS may deviate from this section 
to the extent necessary to avoid endangering persons, property, or the

at 48 deg.02.25[min]N, 124 deg.42.1[min]W. Datum: NAD 1983.
    (b) During a whale hunt, while the international numeral pennant 
five (5) is flown by a Makah whale hunt vessel, the following area 
within the RNA is a Moving Exclusion Zone: The column of water from the 
surface to the seabed with a radius of 500 yards centered on the Makah 
whale hunt vessel displaying international numeral pennant five (5). 
This Moving Exclusionary Zone is activated only when surface visibility 
exceeds one nautical mile, between sunrise and sunset, and the Makah 
whale hunt vessel displays the international numeral pennant five (5). 
The Moving Exclusionary Zone is deactivated upon sunset, visibility is 
reduced to less than one nautical mile, or when the Makah hunt vessel 
strikes international numeral pennant five (5).
    (c) Unless otherwise authorized by the Commander, Thirteenth Coast 
Guard District or his or her representative, no person or vessel may 
enter the active Moving Exclusionary Zone except for:
    (1) Authorized Makah whale hunt vessel actively engaged in hunting 
operations under direction of the master of the Makah vessel flying 
international numeral pennant five (5), and
    (2) A single authorized media pool vessel operating in accordance 
with paragraph (f) of this section.
    (d) The international numeral pennant five (5) is only authorized to 
be displayed from one Makah whale hunt vessel during actual whale hunt 
operations. No other vessels may display this pennant within the RNA at 
any time. Whale hunt operations commence when a whale hunt vessel is 
underway and its master intends to have a whale killed during the 
voyage. Whale hunt operations cease once this intent is abandoned, a 
whale is landed, or when the international numeral pennant five (5) is 
struck.
    (e) The Makah Tribe shall make SECURITE broadcasts beginning one 
half hour before the commencement of a hunt and every half hour 
thereafter until hunting activities are concluded. This broadcast shall 
be made on channel 16 VHF-FM and state:

    A whale hunt is proceeding today within the Regulated Navigation 
Area established for Makah whaling activities. The (name of vessel) is a 
(color and description of vessel) and will be flying international 
numeral pennant five (5) while engaged in whaling operations. This 
pennant is yellow and blue in color. Mariners are required by federal 
regulation to stay 500 yards away from (name of vessel), and are 
strongly urged to remain

[[Page 731]]

even further away from whale hunt activities as an additional safety 
measure.

    (f)(1) Credentialed members of the media interested in entering the 
Moving Exclusionary Zone may request permission to operate a single 
media vessel in the Moving Exclusionary Zone by telephoning Coast Guard 
Public Affairs, as soon as practicable at (206) 220-7237 during normal 
working hours, and (206) 220-7001 after hours. Coast Guard 
preauthorization is required prior to entry into the Moving Exclusionary 
Zone by a single media pool vessel.
    (2) The media pool vessel must be a U.S. documented vessel. The 
media pool vessel must be under command at all times within the Moving 
Exclusionary zone by a master licensed in the U.S. to carry passenger 
for hire. All expenses, liabilities and risks associated with operation 
of the media pool vessel lie with members of the pool and the pool 
vessel owners and operators.
    (3) The master of the media pool vessel shall maneuver to avoid 
positioning the pool vessel between whales and hunt vessel(s), out of 
the line of fire, at a prudent distance and location relative to whale 
hunt operations, and in a manner that avoids hindering the hunt or path 
of the whale in any way.
    (4) Although permitted to maneuver within the Moving Exclusionary 
Zone, personnel aboard the media pool vessel are still required to 
follow safety and law enforcement related instructions of Coast Guard 
personnel.

Sec. 166.200  Shipping safety fairways and anchorage areas, Gulf of Mexico.

    (a) Purpose. Fairways and anchorage areas as described in this 
section are established to control the erection of structures therein to 
provide safe approaches through oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico to 
entrances to the major ports along the Gulf Coast.
    (b) Special Conditions for Fairways in the Gulf of Mexico. Temporary 
anchors and attendant cables or chains attached to floating or 
semisubmersible drilling rigs outside a fairway may be placed within a 
fairway described in this section for the Gulf of Mexico, provide the 
following conditions are met:
    (1) Anchors installed within fairways to stablize semisubmersible 
drilling rigs shall be allowed to remain 120 days. This period may be 
extended by the Army Corps of Engineers, as provided by Sec. 209.135(b).

[[Page 741]]

    (2) Drilling rigs must be outside of any fairway boundary to 
whatever distance is necessary to ensure that the minimum depth of water 
over an anchor line within a fairway is 125 feet.
    (3) No anchor buoys or floats or related rigging will be allowed on 
the surface of the water or to a depth of at least 125 feet from the 
surface, within a fairway.
    (4) Aids to Navigation or danger markings must be installed as 
required by 33 CFR Subchapter C.
    (c) Special Conditions for Fairway Anchorages in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Structures may be placed within an area designated as a fairway 
anchorage, but the number of structures will be limited by spacing as 
follows:
    (1) The center of a structure to be erected shall not be less than 
two (2) nautical miles from the center of any existing structure.
    (2) In a drilling or production complex, associated structures 
connected by walkways shall be considered one structure for purposes of 
spacing, and shall be as close together as practicable having due 
consideration for the safety factors involved.
    (3) A vessel fixed in place by moorings and used in conjunction with 
the associated structures of a drilling or production complex, shall be 
considered an attendant vessel and the extent of the complex shall 
include the vessel and its moorings.
    (4) When a drilling or production complex extends more than five 
hundred (500) yards from the center, a new structure shall not be 
erected closer than two (2) nautical miles from the outer limit of the

<R05>
Sec. 167.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of the regulations in this part is to establish and 
designate traffic separation schemes and precautionary areas to provide 
access routes for vessels proceeding to and from U.S. ports.


<R05>
Sec. 167.3  Geographic coordinates.

    Geographic coordinates are defined using North American 1927 Datum 
(NAD 27) unless indicated otherwise.

<R05>
Sec. 167.5  Definitions.

    (a) Area to be avoided means a routing measure comprising an area 
within defined limits in which either navigation is particularly 
hazardous or it is exceptionally important to avoid casualties and which 
should be avoided by all ships or certain classes of ships.
    (b) Traffic separation scheme (TSS) means a designated routing 
measure which is aimed at the separation of opposing streams of traffic 
by appropriate means and by the establishment of traffic lanes.
    (c) Traffic lane means an area within defined limits in which one-
way traffic is established. Natural obstacles, including those forming 
separation zones, may constitute a boundary.
    (d) Separation zone or line means a zone or line separating the 
traffic lanes in which ships are proceeding in opposite or nearly 
opposite directions; or separating a traffic lane from the adjacent sea 
area; or separating traffic lanes designated for particular classes of 
ships proceeding in the same direction.
    (e) Precautionary area means a routing measure comprising an area 
within defined limits where ships must navigate with particular caution 
and within which the direction of traffic flow may be recommended.
    (f) Deep-water route means an internationally recognized routing 
measure primarily intended for use by ships that, because of their draft 
in relation to the available depth of water in the area concerned, 
require the use of such a route.
    (g) Two-way route means a route within defined limits inside which 
two-way traffic is established, aimed at providing safe passage of ships

<R05>
Sec. 167.15  Modification of schemes.

    (a) A traffic separation scheme or precautionary area described in 
this Part may be permanently amended in accordance with 33 U.S.C. 1223 
(92 Stat. 1473), and with international agreements.
    (b) A traffic separation scheme or precautionary area in this Part 
may be temporarily adjusted by the Commandant of the Coast Guard in an 
emergency, or to accommodate operations which would create an undue 
hazard for vessels using the scheme or which would contravene Rule 10 of 
the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972. 
Adjustment may be in the form of a temporary traffic lane shift, a 
temporary suspension of a section of the scheme, a temporary 
precautionary area overlaying a lane, or other appropriate measure. 
Adjustments will only be made where, in the judgment of the Coast Guard, 
there is no reasonable alternative means of conducting an operation and 
navigation safety will not be jeopardized by the adjustment. Notice of 
adjustments will be made in the appropriate Notice to Mariners and in 
the Federal Register. Requests by members of the public for temporary 
adjustments to traffic separation schemes must be submitted 150 days 
prior to the time the adjustment is desired. Such Requests, describing 
the interference that would otherwise occur to a TSS, should be 
submitted to the District Commander of the Coast Guard District in which 
the TSS is located.

U.S.C. 3703 note).

    Source: CGD 91-202, 59 FR 42968, Aug. 19, 1994, unless otherwise 
noted.


<R05>
Sec. 168.01  Purpose.

    (a) This part prescribes regulations in accordance with section 
4116(c) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101-380). The 
regulations will reduce the risk of oil spills from laden, single hull 
tankers over 5,000 GT by requiring that these tankers be escorted by at 
least two suitable escort vessels. The escort vessels will be 
immediately available to influence the tankers' speed and course in the 
event of a steering or propulsion equipment failure, thereby reducing 
the possibility of groundings or collisions.
    (b) The regulations in this part establish minimum escort vessel 
requirements. Nothing in these regulations should be construed as 
relieving the master of a tanker from the duty to operate the vessel in 
a safe and prudent manner, taking into account the navigational 
constraints of the waterways to be traversed, other vessel traffic, and 
anticipated weather, tide, and sea conditions, which may require reduced 
speeds, greater assistance from escort vessels, or other operational 
precautions.


<R05>
Sec. 168.05  Definitions.

    As used in this part--
    Disabled tanker means a tanker experiencing a loss of propulsion or 
steering control.
    Escort transit means that portion of the tanker's voyage through 
waters where escort vessels are required.
    Escort vessel means any vessel that is assigned and dedicated to a 
tanker during the escort transit, and that is fendered and outfitted 
with towing gear as appropriate for its role in an emergency response to 
a disabled tanker.
    Laden means transporting in bulk any quantity of applicable cargo, 
except for clingage and residue in otherwise empty cargo tanks.
    Single hull tanker means any self-propelled tank vessel that is not 
constructed with both double bottom and double sides in accordance with 
the provisions of 33 CFR 157.10d.
    Tanker master means the licensed onboard person in charge of the 
tanker.
    Tanker owner or operator means the owner or shoreside organization 
(individual, corporation, partnership, or association), including a 
demise charterer, responsible for the overall management and operation 
of the tanker.


<R05>
Sec. 168.10  Responsibilities.

    (a) The tanker owner or operator shall:
    (1) select escort vessels that can meet the performance requirements 
of this part; and
    (2) inform the tanker master of the performance capabilities of the 
selected escort vessels. This information must be provided to the master 
before beginning the escort transit.
    (b) The tanker master shall operate the tanker within the 
performance capabilities of the escort vessels, taking into account 
speed, sea and weather conditions, navigational considerations, and 
other factors that may change or arise during the escort transit.
    (c) In an emergency, the tanker master may deviate from the 
requirements of this part to the extent necessary to avoid endangering 
persons, property, or the environment, but shall immediately report the 
deviation to the cognizant Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP).


<R05>
Sec. 168.20  Applicable vessels.

    The requirements of this part apply to laden, single hull tankers of 
5,000 gross tons or more.


<R05>
Sec. 168.30  Applicable cargoes.

bays, harbors, and ports, including the navigable waters of the United 
States within a line drawn from Cape Hinchinbrook Light, to Seal Rocks 
Light, to a point on Montague Island at 60 deg.14.6[min] North, 
146 deg.59[min] West, and the waters of Montague Strait east of a line 
between Cape Puget and Cape Cleare.
    (b) Puget Sound and certain associated waters: Each tanker to which 
this part applies must be escorted by at least two escort vessels in 
those navigable waters of the United States and Washington State east of 
a line connecting New Dungeness Light with Discovery Island Light and 
all points in the Puget Sound area north and south of these lights. This 
area includes all the navigable waters of the United States within Haro 
Strait, Rosario Strait, the Strait of Georgia, Puget Sound, and Hood 
Canal, as well as those portions of the Strait of Juan de Fuca east of

such that timely response to a propulsion or steering failure can be 
effected.
    (3) Must not exceed a speed beyond which the escort vessels can 
reasonably be expected to safely bring the tanker under control within 
the navigational limits of the waterway, taking into consideration 
ambient sea and weather conditions, surrounding vessel traffic, hazards, 
and other factors that may reduce the available sea room.
    (b) The escort vessels, acting singly or jointly in any combination 
as needed, and considering their applied force vectors on the tanker's 
hull, must be capable of--
    (1) Towing the tanker at 4 knots in calm conditions, and holding it 
in steady position against a 45-knot headwind;
    (2) Stopping the tanker within the same distance that it could 
crash-stop itself from a speed of 6 knots using its own propulsion 
system;
    (3) Holding the tanker on a steady course against a 35-degree locked 
rudder at a speed of 6 knots; and
    (4) Turning the tanker 90 degrees, assuming a free-swinging rudder 
and a speed of 6 knots, within the same distance (advance and transfer) 
that it could turn itself with a hard-over rudder.

    Effective Date Note: At 59 FR 54519, Nov. 1, 1994, Sec. 168.50 was 
amended by suspending paragraph (b)(2), effective November 17, 1994.

    Each of the hull identification numbers required by Sec. 181.23 must 
consist of twelve characters, uninterrupted by slashes, hyphens, or 
spaces, as follows:
    (a) The first three characters must be a manufacturer identification 
code assigned under Sec. 181.31(a) or the importer designation assigned 
under Sec. 181.31(b).
    (b) Characters four through eight must be a serial number assigned 
by the manufacturer in letters of the English alphabet, or Arabic 
numerals, or both, except the letters I, O, and Q.
    (c) Characters nine and ten must indicate the month and year of 
certification when a date of certification is required. In all other 
cases characters nine and ten must indicate the date of manufacture. The 
date indicated can be no earlier than the date construction or assembly 
began and no later than the date the boat leaves the place of 
manufacture or assembly or is imported into the United States for the 
purposes of sale. Character nine must be indicated using letters of the 
English alphabet. The first month of the year, January, must be 
designated by the letter ``A'', the second month, February, by the 
letter ``B'', and so on until the last month of the year, December. 
Character ten must be the last digit of the year of manufacture or

    If additional information is displayed on the boat within two inches 
of the hull identification number, that information must be separated 
from the hull identification number by means of borders or must be on a 
separate label so that it will not be interpreted as part of the hull 
identification number.


<R05>
Sec. 181.29  Hull identification number display.

    Two identical hull identification numbers are required to be 
displayed on each boat hull.
    (a) The primary hull identification number must be affixed--
    (1) On boats with transoms, to the starboard outboard side of the 
transom within two inches of the top of the transom, gunwale, or hull/
deck joint, whichever is lowest.
    (2) On boats without transoms or on boats on which it would be 
impractical to use the transom, to the starboard outboard side of the 
hull, aft, within one foot of the stern and within two inches of the top 
of the hull side, gunwale or hull/deck joint, whichever is lowest.
    (3) On catamarans and pontoon boats which have readily replaceable 
hulls, to the aft crossbeam within one foot of the starboard hull 
attachment.
    (4) If the hull identification number would not be visible, because 
of rails, fittings, or other accessories, the number must be affixed as 
near as possible to the location specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (b) The duplicate hull identification number must be affixed in an 
unexposed location on the interior of the boat or beneath a fitting or 
item of hardware.
    (c) Each hull identification number must be carved, burned, stamped, 
embossed, molded, bonded, or otherwise permanently affixed to the boat 
so that alteration, removal, or replacement would be obvious. If the 
number is on a separate plate, the plate must be fastened in such a 
manner that its removal would normally cause some

[[Page 802]]

scarring of or damage to the surrounding hull area. A hull 
identification number must not be attached to parts of the boat that are 
removable.
    (d) The characters of each hull identification number must be no 
less than one-fourth of an inch high.

Sec. 181.31  Manufacturer identification code assignment.

    (a) Each person required by Sec. 181.23 to affix hull 
identifications numbers must request a manufacturer identification code 
in writing from the Recreational Boating Product Assurance Division, 
2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001. The request must 
indicate the manufacturer's name and U.S. address along with the general 
types and lengths of boats that will be manufactured.
    (b) For boats manufactured outside of the jurisdiction of the United 
States, a U.S. importer must obtain a manufacturer identification code 
as required by paragraph (a) of this section. The request of an 
importer, as defined in Sec. 181.3 of this subpart, must indicate the 
importer's name and U.S. address along with a list of the manufacturers, 
their addresses, and the general types and sizes of boats that will be 
imported. If a nation has a hull identification number system which has 
been accepted by the U.S. Coast Guard for the purpose of importing 
boats, it may be used by the importer instead of the one specified 
within this subpart. To request a list of those nations having such a 
numbering system, write to the Recreational Boating Product Assurance 
Division, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001.
    (c) Persons who are required to identify boats under Sec. 181.23(b) 
must obtain the required hull identification number from the State 
Boating Law Administrator of the State where the boat will be 
principally used, or, if the State Boating Law Administrator does not 
assign these numbers, from the Coast Guard District office in the area 
of principal use.

Sec. 183.1  Purpose and applicability.

    This part prescribes standards and regulations for boats and 
associated equipment to which 46 U.S.C. Chapter 43 applies and to which 
certification requirements in Part 181 of this subchapter apply.

[CGD 85-098, 52 FR 19728, May 27, 1987]

Sec. 183.3  Definitions.

    Beam means the transverse distance between the outer sides of the 
boat excluding handles, and other similar fittings, attachments, and 
extensions.
    Boat means any vessel--
    (1) Manufactured or used primarily for noncommercial use;
    (2) Leased, rented, or chartered to another for the latter's 
noncommercial use; or

[[Page 805]]

    (3) Operated as an uninspected passenger vessel subject to the 
requirements of 46 CFR chapter I, subchapter C.
    Full transom means a transom with a maximum width which exceeds one-
half the maximum beam of the boat.
    Length means the straight line horizontal measurement of the overall 
length from the foremost part of the boat to the aftermost part of the 
boat, measured from end to end over the deck excluding sheer, and 
measured parallel to the centerline. Bow sprits, bumpkins, rudders, 
outboard motor brackets, handles, and other similar fittings, 
attachments, and extensions are not included in the measurement.
    Monohull boat means a boat on which the line of intersection of the 
water surface and the boat at any operating draft forms a single closed 
curve. For example, a catamaran, trimaran, or a pontoon boat is not a 
monohull boat.
    Motorwell means any arrangement of bulkheads or structures that 
prevents water from entering the passenger carrying area of the boat 
through any cutout area in the transom for mounting an outboard motor.
    Motorwell height means the vertical distance from the lowest point 
of water ingress along the top of the motorwell to a line representing a 
longitudinal extension of the centerline of the boat's bottom surface, 
excluding keels. This distance is measured as a projection on the 
centerline plane of the boat. See Figure 183.3.
    Permanent appurtenances means equipment that is mounted or fastened, 
so that it is not removable without the use of tools. Seats, inboard 
engines, windshields, helm stations, or hardtops are permanent 
appurtenances. Outboard motors, controls, batteries, and portable fuel 
tanks are not permanent appurtenances.
    Remote steering means any mechanical assist device which is rigidly 
attached to the boat and used in steering the vessel, including but not 
limited to mechanical, hydraulic, or electrical control systems.
    Sailboat means a boat designed or intended to use sails as the 
primary means of propulsion.
    Sheer means the topmost line in a boat's side. The sheer intersects 
the vertical centerline plane of the boat at the forward end and 
intersects the transom (stern) at the aft end. For the purposes of this 
definition, the topmost line in a boat's side is the line defined by a 
series of points of contact with the boat structure, by straight lines 
at 45 degree angles to the horizontal and contained in a vertical plane 
normal to the outside edge of the boat as seen from above and which are 
brought into contact with the outside of the horizontal boat. A boat is 
horizontal when it is transversely level and when the lowest points at 
40 percent and 75 percent of the boat's length behind the most forward 
point of the boat are level.
    Transom means the surface at the stern of a boat projecting or 
facing aft. The upper boundary of the transom is the line defined by a 
series of points of contact, with the boat structure, by straight lines 
at 45 degree angles to the horizontal and contained in a vertical 
longitudinal plane and which are brought into contact with the stern of 
the horizontal boat. A boat is horizontal when it is transversely level 
and when the lowest points at 40 percent and 75 percent of the boat's 
length behind the most forward point of the boat are level.
    Transom height means the vertical distance from the lowest point of 
water ingress along the top of the transom to a line representing a 
longitudinal extension of the centerline of the boat's bottom surface, 
excluding keels. This distance is measured as a projection on the 
centerline plane of the boat. See Figure 183.3.
    Vessel includes every description of watercraft, other than a 
seaplane on the water, used or capable of being used as a means of 
transportation on the water.

                        Subpart D--Safe Powering


<R05>
Sec. 183.51  Applicability.

    This subpart applies to monohull boats less than 20 feet in length, 
except sailboats, canoes, kayaks, and inflatable boats, that are 
designed or intended to use one or more outboard motors for propulsion.


<R05>
Sec. 183.53  Horsepower capacity.

    The maximum horsepower capacity marked on a boat must not exceed the 
horsepower capacity determined by the computation method discussed in 
paragraph (a) of this section, or for certain qualifying boats, the 
performance test method discussed in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (a) The maximum horsepower capacity must be computed as follows:
    (1) Compute a factor by multiplying the boat length in feet by the 
maximum transom width in feet excluding handles and other similar 
fittings, attachments, and extensions. If the boat does not have a full 
transom, the transom width is the broadest beam in the aftermost quarter 
length of the boat.
    (2) Locate horsepower capacity corresponding to the factor in Table 
183.53.
    (3) For a boat with a factor over 52.5, if the horsepower capacity 
calculated in Table 183.53 is not an exact multiple of 5, it may be 
raised to the next exact multiple of 5.
    (4) For flat bottom hard chine boats with a factor of 52 or less, 
the horsepower capacity must be reduced by one horsepower capacity 
increment in Table 183.53.

[Note: For flat bottom hard chine boats, with factor of 52 or less, reduce one capacity limit (e.g. 5 to 3)]


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                No remote steering, or less than 20[sec] transom

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Horsepower capacity is (raise to       (2 X Factor) -90.......  (0.5 X Factor) -15.....  (0.8 X Factor) -25
 nearest multiple of 5).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) For boats qualifying under this paragraph, the performance test 
method described in this paragraph may be used to determine the 
horsepower capacity.
    (1) Qualifying criteria.

    (i) Thirteen feet or less in length;
    (ii) Remote wheel steering;
    (iii) Transom height
    (A) Minimum 19 inch transom height; or,
    (B) For boats with at least a 19 inch motorwell height, a minimum 15 
inch transom height;

    (iv) Maximum persons capacity not over two persons;
    (2) Boat preparation.
    (i) The boat must be rigged with equipment recommended or provided 
by the boat and motor manufacturer and tested with the highest 
horsepower production powerplant for which the boat is to be rated, not 
to exceed 40 horsepower.
    (ii) Standard equipment must be installed in accordance with 
manufacturers' instructions.
    (iii) The lowest ratio (quickest) steering system offered on the 
boat model being tested must be installed.
    (iv) The outboard motor must be fitted with the manufacturer's 
recommended propeller providing maximum speed.
    (v) Standard permanently installed fuel tanks must be no more than 
one-half full. Boats without permanent tanks must be tested with one 
full portable tank.

[[Page 813]]

    (vi) Portable tanks must be in their designated location or placed 
as far aft as possible.
    (vii) The outboard motor must be placed in the lowest vertical 
position on the transom or, if mounting instructions are provided with 
the boat, at the height recommended.
    (viii) Boat bottom, motor and propeller must be in new or almost new 
condition.

    Note: The use of the following special equipment should be 
considered because of the potential for exceeding the capabilities of 
the boat while performing the test:
Racing Type Personal Flotation Device
Helmet.

    (3) Test conditions. Testing must be conducted on smooth, calm water 
with the wind speed below 10 knots. The test must be conducted with no 
load other than a driver who must weigh no more than 200 pounds. The 
motor trim angle must be adjusted to provide maximum full throttle speed 
short of excessive porpoising or propeller ventilation or 
``cavitation'', so that there is no loss of directional control.
    (4) Quick turn test procedure. Set throttle at a low maneuvering 
speed and steer the boat straight ahead. Turn the steering wheel 
180 deg. in the direction of least resistance in \1/2\ second or less 
and hold it at that position without changing the throttle or trim 
settings during or after the wheel change. The boat completes the 
maneuver successfully if it is capable of completing a 90 deg. turn 
without the driver losing control of the boat or reducing the throttle 
setting. Gradually increase the boat's turn entry speed incrementally 
until the boat does not complete the Quick Turn Test successfully or 
successfully completes it at maximum throttle.

    Note: It is recognized that operator skill and familiarity with a 
particular boat and motor combination will affect the test results. It 
is permissible to make a number of practice runs through the quick turn 
test at any throttle setting.

    (5) Test course method. Set throttle for 30 miles per hour boat 
speed and run the test course set up in accordance with Figure 183.53, 
passing outside the designated avoidance marker for 35 to 37.5 miles per 
hour without contacting any of the course markers. If the boat 
successfully completes this run of the test course, increase the 
throttle setting to 35 to 37.5 miles per hour boat speed and run the 
course passing outside the designated avoidance marker for that speed 
without contacting any of the course markers. If the boat successfully 
completes this run of the test course and the motor was not at full 
throttle, increase the throttle setting to 37.5 to 42.5 miles per hour 
boat speed and run the course passing outside the designated avoidance 
marker for that speed without contacting any of the course markers. If 
the boat successfully completes this run of the test course and the 
motor was not at full throttle, increase the throttle setting to 42.5 
miles per hour or more and run the course passing outside the designated 
avoidance marker for that speed without contacting any of the course 
markers. If the boat successfully completes this run of the test course 
and the motor was not at full throttle, continue to increase the 
throttle setting and run the test course passing outside the designated 
avoidance marker for 42.5 miles per hour or more until the boat fails to 
complete the test successfully or the boat completes the test course 
maneuvers successfully at full throttle. The boat successfully completes 
the test course if the driver is able to maneuver it between the 
designated avoidance markers without striking the markers and without 
losing control of the boat or reducing the throttle setting. There must 
be no change in position of any equipment on board and there must be no 
change of position of personnel in order to influence the test results. 
There must be no instability evidenced by oscillating motion in the roll 
or yaw axes exhibited while negotiating the course.

    Note: It is recognized that operator skill and familiarity with a 
particular boat and motor combination will affect the test results. It 
is therefore considered permissible to make a number of practice runs 
through the test course at any throttle setting.

    (6) Maximum horsepower capacity. (i) For boats capable of less than 
35 miles per hour, the maximum horsepower capacity must be the maximum 
horsepower with which the boat was able to successfully complete the 
Quick Turn Test Procedure in Sec. 183.53(b)(4) at full

[[Page 814]]

throttle or the maximum horsepower determined under the calculations in 
Sec. 183.53(a) of this section.
    (ii) For boats capable of 35 miles per hour or more, the maximum 
horsepower capacity must be the maximum horsepower with which the boat 
was able to successfully complete both the Quick Turn Test Procedure in 
Sec. 183.53(b)(4) and the Test Course Method in Sec. 183.53(b)(5) at 
full throttle or the calculations in Sec. 183.53(a) of this section.
    (iii) The maximum horsepower capacity determined in accordance with 
Sec. 183.53(b) must not exceed 40 horsepower.

<R05>
Sec. 183.202  Flotation and certification requirements.

    Each boat to which this subpart applies must be manufactured, 
constructed, or assembled to pass the stability and flotation tests 
prescribed in Secs. 183.225(a), 183.230(a), and 183.235(a).


<R05>
Sec. 183.205  Passenger carrying area.

    (a) For the purpose of this section a boat is level when it is 
supported on its keel at the two points shown in Figure 2.
    (b) As used in this subpart, the term ``passenger carrying area'' 
means each area in a boat in which persons can sit in a normal sitting 
position or stand while the boat is in operation. Passenger carrying 
areas are illustrated in Figures 3 through 8.
    (c) The length of the passenger carrying area is the distance along 
the centerline of the boat between two vertical lines, one at the 
forward end and one at the aft end of the passenger carrying area when 
the boat is level as illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. For boats with a 
curved stem inside the passenger carrying area, the forward vertical 
line is where a line 45 degrees to the horizontal when the boat is level 
is tangent to the curve of the stem, as illustrated in Figure 5. For 
boats with cabins, the forward vertical line is where there is a minimum 
distance of two feet between the inside top of the cabin and the water 
line formed when the boat is swamped and loaded with weights under 
Sec. 183.220 as illustrated in Figure 6.
    (d) The breadth of each passenger carrying area is the distance 
between two vertical lines at the mid-length, excluding consoles, of the 
passenger carrying area when the boat is level as illustrated in Figures 
7 and 8. For boats with round chines inside the passenger carrying area, 
the vertical line is where a transverse line 45 degrees to the 
horizontal is tangent to the arc of the chine, as illustrated in Figure 
8.

<R05>
Sec. 183.210  Reference areas.

    (a) The forward reference area of a boat is the forward most 2 feet 
of the top surface of the hull or deck, as illustrated in Figure 9.
    (b) The aft reference area of a boat is the aft most two feet of the 
top surface of the hull or deck, as illustrated in Figure 9.


<R05>
Sec. 183.215  Reference depth.

    Reference depth is the minimum distance between the uppermost 
surface of the submerged reference area of a boat and the surface of the 
water measured at the centerline of the boat, as illustrated in Figure 
10. If there is no deck surface at the centerline of the boat from which 
a measurement can be made, the reference depth is the average of two 
depth measurements made on opposite sides of, and at an equal distance 
from, the centerline of the boat.


<R05>
Sec. 183.220  Preconditioning for tests.

    A boat must meet the following conditions for at least 18 hours 
before the tests required by Secs. 183.225, 183,230, and 183.235:
    (a) Manufacturer supplied permanent appurtenances such as 
windshields and convertible tops must be installed on the boat.
    (b) The boat must be loaded with a quantity of weight that, when 
submerged, is equal to the sum of the following:

[[Page 817]]

    (1) The sum of 50 percent of the first 550 pounds of the persons 
capacity marked on the boat and 12\1/2\ percent of the remainder of the 
persons capacity.
    (2) Twenty-five percent of the result of the following calculation, 
but not less than zero: The maximum weight capacity marked on the boat; 
less the weight shown in Column 6 of Table 4 for maximum horsepower 
marked on the boat; less the persons capacity marked on the boat.
    (c) The weights required by paragraph (b) of this section must be 
placed in the boat so that the center of gravity of each amount of 
weight required by paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section is 
within the shaded area illustrated in Figure 11. The location and 
dimensions of the shaded area are as follows:
    (1) The shaded area is centered at the mid-length of the passenger 
carrying area and at the mid-breadth of the boat;
    (2) The length of the shaded area, measured along the centerline of 
the boat, is equal to 40 percent of the length of the passenger carrying 
area of the boat; and
    (3) The breadth of the shaded area, measured at the midlength of the 
passenger carrying area, is equal to 40 percent of the breadth of the 
passenger carrying area of the boat.
    (d) Weight must be placed in the normal operating position of the 
motor and controls and the battery in lieu of this equipment. The 
required quantity of weight used for this purpose depends upon the 
maximum rated horsepower of the boat being tested and is specified in 
Columns 2 and 4 of Table 4 for the swamped weight of the motor and 
controls and for the submerged weight or the battery, respectively.
    (e) Permanent fuel tanks must be filled with fuel and each external 
opening into the fuel tank must be sealed.
    (f) The boat must be keel down in the water.
    (g) The boat must be swamped, allowing water to flow between the 
inside and outside of the boat, either over the sides, through a hull 
opening, or both. Entrapped air in the flooded portion of the boat must 
be eliminated.
    (h) Water must flood the two largest air chambers and all air 
chambers integral with the hull.

64 FR 34716, June 29, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 183.302  Flotation requirements.

    Each boat to which this subpart applies must be manufactured, 
constructed, or assembled to pass the stability and flotation tests 
prescribed in Secs. 183.325(a), 183.330(a), and 183.335(a).


<R05>
Sec. 183.305  Passenger carrying area.

    (a) For the purpose of this section, a boat is level when it is 
supported on its keel at the two points shown in Figure 2.
    (b) As used in this subpart, the term ``passenger carrying area'' 
means each area in a boat in which persons can sit in a normal sitting 
position or stand while the boat is in operation. Passenger carrying 
areas are illustrated in Figures 3 through 8.
    (c) The length of each passenger carrying area is the distance along 
the centerline of the boat between two

[[Page 819]]

vertical lines, one at the forward end and one at the aft end of the 
passenger carrying area, when the boat is level, as illustrated in 
Figures 3 and 4. For boats with a curved stem inside the passenger 
carrying area, the forward vertical line is where a line 45 degrees to 
the horizontal when the boat is level is tangent to the curve of the 
stem, as illustrated in Figure 5. For boats with cabins, the forward 
vertical line is where there is a minimum distance of two feet between 
the inside top of the cabin and the water line formed when the boat is 
swamped and loaded with weights under Sec. 183.320 as illustrated in 
Figure 6.
    (d) The breadth of the passenger carrying area is the distance 
beteen two vertical lines at the mid-length, excluding consoles, of the 
passenger carrying area when the boat is level as illustrated in Figures 
7 and 8. For boats with round chines inside the passenger carrying area, 
the vertical line is where a transverse line 45 degrees to the 
horizontal is tangent to the arc of the chine, as illustrated in Figure 
7.

<R05>
Sec. 183.310  Reference areas.

    (a) The forward reference area of a boat is the forwardmost 2 feet 
of the top surface of the hull or deck as illustrated in Figure 9.
    (b) The aft reference area of a boat is the aftmost two feet of the 
top surface of the hull or deck, as illustrated in Figure 9.


<R05>
Sec. 183.315  Reference depth.

    Reference depth is the minimum distance between the uppermost 
surface of the submerged reference area of a boat and the surface of the 
water measured at the centerline of the boat, as illustrated in Figure 
10. If there is no deck surface at the centerline of the boat from which 
a measurement can be made, the reference depth is the average of two 
depth measurements made on opposite sides of, and at an equal distance 
from, the centerline of the boat.


<R05>
Sec. 183.320  Preconditioning for tests.

    A boat must meet the following conditions for at least 18 hours 
before the tests required by Secs. 183.325, 183.330, and 183.335:
    (a) Manufacturer supplied permanent appurtenances such as 
windshields, and convertible tops must be installed on the boat.
    (b) The boat must be loaded with a quantity of weight that, when 
submerged, is equal to the sum of the following:
    (1) Two-fifteenths of the persons capacity marked on the boat.
    (2) Twenty-five percent of the result of the following calculation, 
but not less than zero: the maximum weight capacity marked on the boat; 
less the weight shown in column 6 of Table 4 for the maximum horsepower 
marked on the boat; less the persons capacity marked on the boat.
    (c) The weights required by paragraph (b) of this section are placed 
in the boat so that the center of gravity of each amount of weight 
required by paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section is within the 
shaded area illustrated in Figure 11. The location and dimensions of the 
shaded area are as follows:
    (1) The shaded area is centered at the mid-length of the passenger 
carrying area and at the mid-breadth of the boat;
    (2) The length of the shaded area, measured along the centerline of 
the boat, is equal to 40 percent of the length of the passenger carrying 
area of the boat; and
    (3) The breadth of the shaded area, measured at the mid-length of 
the passenger carrying area, is equal to 40 percent of the breadth of 
the passenger carrying area of the boat.
    (d) Weight must be placed in the normal operating position of the 
motor and controls in lieu of this equipment. The quantity of weight 
used for this purpose depends upon the maximum rated horsepower of the 
boat being tested and is specified in Column 2 of Table 4 for the 
swamped weight of the motor and controls.
    (e) Permanent fuel tanks must be filled with fuel and each external 
opening into the fuel tank must be sealed.
    (f) The boat must be keel down in the water.
    (g) The boat must be swamped, allowing water to flow between the 
inside
