                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2012), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page viii]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

    The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of 
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a 
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used 
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and 
not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.

[[Page ix]]

    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

data will be maintained in the NMFS Alaska Regional Office in Juneau, 
Alaska, where such data will be available for public review.
    (4) No person may falsify any information required to be set forth 
on the reporting form as required by paragraph (e) of this section.
    (5) The Anchorage Field Office of NMFS is located in room 517 of the 
Federal Office Building, 222 West 7th Avenue; its mailing address is: 
NMFS, Box 43, Anchorage, AK. 99513.
    (f) Harvest management of Cook Inlet beluga whales--(1) Cooperative 
management of subsistence harvest. Subject to the provisions of 16 
U.S.C. 1371(b) and any further limitations set forth in Sec. 216.23, 
any taking of a Cook Inlet beluga whale by an Alaska Native must be 
authorized under an agreement for the co-management of subsistence uses 
(hereinafter in this paragraph ``co-management agreement'') between the 
National Marine Fisheries Service and an Alaska Native organization(s).
    (2) Limitations. (i) Sale of Cook Inlet beluga whale parts and 
products. Authentic Native articles of handicraft and clothing made from 
nonedible by-products of beluga whales taken in accordance with the 
provisions of this paragraph may be sold in interstate commerce. The 
sale of any other part or product, including food stuffs, from Cook 
Inlet beluga whales is prohibited, provided that nothing herein shall be 
interpreted to prohibit or restrict customary and traditional 
subsistence practices of barter and sharing of Cook Inlet beluga parts 
and products.
    (ii) Beluga whale calves or adults with calves. The taking of a calf 
or an adult whale accompanied by a calf is prohibited.
    (iii) Season. All takings of beluga whales authorized under Sec. 
216.23(f) shall occur no earlier than July 1 of each year.
    (iv) Taking during 2001-2004. The harvest of Cook Inlet beluga 
whales is restricted during the four-year period of 2001-2004 as 
follows:
    (A) Strike limitations. Subject to the suspension provision of 
subparagraph (C), a total of six (6) strikes, which could result in up 
to six landings, are to be allocated through co-management agreement(s).
    (B) Strike allocations. Four strikes, not to exceed one per year, 
are allocated to the Native Village of Tyonek. The remaining two strikes 
will be allocated over the 4-year period through co-management agreement 
with other Cook Inlet community hunters, with no more than one such 
strike being allocated during every other year.
    (C) Emergency provisions. Takings of beluga whales authorized under 
Sec. 216.23 will be suspended whenever unusual mortalities exceed six 
(6) whales in any year. ``Unusual mortalities'' include all documented 
human-caused mortality (including illegal takings and net entanglements 
but excluding all legally harvested whales) and all documented mortality 
resulting from unknown or natural causes that occur above normal levels, 
considered for the purposes of this provision to be twelve beluga whales 
per year. The level of unusual mortalities shall be calculated by 
documenting mortality for the calendar year and subtracting twelve. The 
sum of this result and the carry over of unusual mortality from any 
previous year

[[Page 21]]

from which the population has not recovered is the level of unusual 
mortalities for the current year. If in any year the number of unusual 
mortalities exceeds six whales, no strikes will be allowed in that year 
or in subsequent years until the population has recovered from those 
mortalities through foregone future harvests and natural recruitment.
    (v) Taking during 2008 and subsequent years. (A) Co-management 
agreements pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section may be 
established for 5-year intervals beginning in 2008. Agreements must 
include specific provisions regarding the number and allocation of 
strikes, hunting practices to promote consistency with limitations in 
paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, and to improve efficiency of the 
harvest, mitigating measures, and enforcement. Agreements may include 
provisions regarding the sex composition of the beluga harvest.
    (B) Strike/harvest levels for each 5-year planning interval 
beginning in 2008 will be determined by the recovery of this stock as 
measured by the average abundance in the prior 5-year interval and the 
best estimate of the population growth rate using information obtained 
in the 10 years prior to each 5-year interval. Criteria for categorizing 
growth rates are presented below as an algorithm using the estimated 
abundance, the distribution statistics for growth rates, and the date. 
Harvest levels are subject to the Expected Mortality Limit. The 
established strike levels are presented in the Harvest Table and the 
following algorithm will be used to determine harvest levels for each 5-
year period beginning in 2008.
    (1) NMFS will calculate the average stock abundance over the 
previous 5-year period.
    (2) NMFS will calculate a population growth rates from abundance 
estimates for the most recent 10-year period prior to the next 5-year 
period.
    (3) Using the abundance and growth information obtained in 
accordance with paragraphs (f)(2)(v)(B)(1) and (f)(2)(v)(B)(2), NMFS 
will calculate the probabilities that the growth rate within the 
population would be less than 1 percent, less than 2 percent, or greater 
than 3 percent. NMFS will then use paragraphs (f)(2)(v)(B)(3(i)) and 
(f)(2)(v)(B)(3)(vi) of this section to select the proper cell from the 
Harvest Table to determine the harvest levels for the next 5-year 
interval.
    (i) Is the average stock abundance over the previous 5-year period 
less than 350 beluga whales? If yes, the Harvest Table provides that the 
harvest is zero during the next 5-year period. If no, go to 
(f)(2)(v)(B)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Is the current year 2035 or later and is there more than a 20 
percent probability the growth rate is less than 1 percent? If yes, the 
harvest is zero during the next 5-year period. If no, go to paragraph 
(f)(2)(v)(B)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (iii) Is the current year between 2020 and 2034 and there is more 
than a 20 percent probability the growth rate is less than 1 percent? If 
yes, the harvest is three whales during the next 5-year period. If no, 
go to paragraph (f)(2)(v)(B)(3)(iv) of this section.
    (iv) Is the current year 2015 or later and is there more than a 25 
percent probability the growth rate is less than 2 percent? If yes, go 
to the harvest table using the ``Low'' growth rate column. If no, go to 
paragraph (f)(2)(v)(B)(3)(vi)) of this section.
    (v) Is the current year prior to 2015 and is there more than a 75 
percent probability the growth rate is less than 2 percent? If yes, go 
to the harvest table using the ``Low'' growth rate column. If no, go to 
paragraph (f)(2)(v)(B)(3)(vi) of this section.
    (vi) Is there more than a 25-percent probability the growth rate is 
more than 3 percent? If yes, go to the harvest table using the ``High'' 
growth rate column. If no, go to the harvest table using the 
``Intermediate'' growth rate column.

                                                                      Harvest Table

    (C) At the beginning of each 5-year period, an Expected Mortality 
Limit is determined from the Harvest Table using the 5-year average 
abundance. During the course of each calendar year, the number of beach 
casts carcasses and carcasses found floating either reported to NMFS or 
observed by NMFS personnel will be the number of mortalities for that 
year. If at the end of each calendar year this number exceeds the 
Expected Mortality Limit, then an unusual mortality event has occurred. 
The Estimated Excess Mortalities will be calculated as twice the number 
of reported dead whales above the Expected Mortality Limit. The harvest 
will then be adjusted as follows:
    (1) The harvest level for the remaining years of the current 5-year 
period will be recalculated by reducing the 5-year average abundance 
from the previous 5-year period by the Estimated Excess Mortalities. The 
revised abundance estimate would then be used in the harvest table for 
the remaining years and the harvest adjusted accordingly.
    (2) For the subsequent 5-year period, for the purpose of calculating 
the 5-year average, the Estimated Excess Mortalities would be subtracted 
from the abundance estimates of the year of the excess mortality event 
so that the average would reflect the loss to the population. This 
average would then be used in the table to set the harvest level.

<R05>
Sec. 216.24  Taking and related acts incidental to commercial fishing
operations by tuna purse seine vessels in the eastern tropical 
Pacific Ocean.

    (a)(1) No marine mammal may be taken in the course of a commercial 
fishing operation by a U.S. purse seine fishing vessel in the ETP unless 
the taking constitutes an incidental catch as defined in Sec. 216.3, 
and vessel and operator permits have been obtained in accordance with 
these regulations, and such taking is not in violation of such permits 
or regulations.
    (2)(i) It is unlawful for any person using a U.S. purse seine 
fishing vessel of 400 short tons (st) (362.8 metric tons (mt)) carrying 
capacity or less to intentionally deploy a net on or to encircle 
dolphins, or to carry more than two speedboats, if any part of its 
fishing trip is in the ETP.
    (ii) It is unlawful for any person using a U.S. purse seine fishing 
vessel of greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) carrying capacity that does not 
have a valid permit obtained under these regulations to catch, possess, 
or land tuna

[[Page 23]]

if any part of the vessel's fishing trip is in the ETP.
    (iii) It is unlawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of 
the United States to receive, purchase, or possess tuna caught, 
possessed, or landed in violation of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section.
    (iv) It is unlawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of 
the United States to intentionally deploy a purse seine net on, or to 
encircle, dolphins from a vessel operating in the ETP when there is not 
a DML assigned to that vessel.
    (v) It is unlawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States to intentionally deploy a purse seine net on, or to 
encircle, dolphins from a vessel operating in the ETP with an assigned 
DML after a set in which the DML assigned to that vessel has been 
reached or exceeded.
    (vi) Alleged violations of the Agreement on the IDCP and/or these 
regulations identified by the International Review Panel will be 
considered for potential enforcement action by NMFS.
    (3) Upon written request made in advance of entering the ETP, the 
limitations in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (e)(1) of this section may be 
waived by the Administrator, Southwest Region, for the purpose of 
allowing transit through the ETP. The waiver will provide, in writing, 
the terms and conditions under which the vessel must operate, including 
a requirement to report to the Administrator, Southwest Region, the 
vessel's date of exit from or subsequent entry into the permit area.
    (b) Permits--(1) Vessel permit. The owner or managing owner of a 
U.S. purse seine fishing vessel of greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) 
carrying capacity that participates in commercial fishing operations in 
the ETP must possess a valid vessel permit issued under paragraph (b) of 
this section. This permit is not transferable and must be renewed 
annually. If a vessel permit holder surrenders his/her permit to the 
Administrator, Southwest Region, the permit will not be returned and a 
new permit will not be issued before the end of the calendar year. 
Vessel permits will be valid through December 31 of each year.
    (2) Operator permit. The person in charge of and actually 
controlling fishing operations (hereinafter referred to as the operator) 
on a U.S. purse seine fishing vessel engaged in commercial fishing 
operations under a vessel permit must possess a valid operator permit 
issued under paragraph (b) of this section. Such permits are not 
transferable and must be renewed annually. To receive a permit, the 
operator must have satisfactorily completed all required training under 
paragraph (c)(5) of this section. The operator's permit is valid only 
when the permit holder is on a vessel with a valid vessel permit. 
Operator permits will be valid through December 31 of each year.
    (3) Possession and display. A valid vessel permit issued pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be on board the vessel while 
engaged in fishing operations, and a valid operator permit issued 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section must be in the possession 
of the operator to whom it was issued. Permits must be shown upon 
request to NMFS enforcement agents, U.S. Coast Guard officers, or 
designated agents of NMFS or the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission 
(IATTC) (including observers). A vessel owner or operator who is at sea 
on a fishing trip when his or her permit expires and to whom a permit 
for the next year has been issued, may take marine mammals under the 
terms of the new permit without having to display it on board the vessel 
until the vessel returns to port.
    (4) Application for vessel permit. ETP tuna purse seine vessel 
permit application forms and instructions for their completion are 
available from NMFS. To apply for an ETP vessel permit, a vessel owner 
or managing owner must complete, sign, and submit the appropriate form 
via fax to (562) 980-4047, for prioritization purposes as described 
under Sec. 300.22(b)(4)(i)(D)(3) of this title, allowing at least 15 
days for processing. To request that a vessel in excess of 400 st (362.8 
mt) carrying capacity be categorized as active on the Vessel Register 
under Sec. 300.22(b)(4)(i) of this title in the following calendar 
year, the owner or managing owner must submit the vessel permit 
application via fax,

[[Page 24]]

payment of the vessel permit application fee, and payment of the vessel 
assessment fee no later than September 15 for vessels for which a DML is 
requested for the following year, and no later than November 30 for 
vessels for which a DML is not requested for the following year.
    (5) Application for operator permit. An applicant for an operator 
permit must complete, sign, and submit the appropriate form obtained 
from NMFS and submit payment of the permit application fee to the 
Administrator, Southwest Region, allowing at least 45 days for 
processing. Application forms and instructions for their completion are 
available from NMFS.
    (6) Fees--(i) Vessel permit application fees. Payment of the permit 
application fee is required before NMFS will issue a permit. The 
Assistant Administrator may change the amount of this fee at any time if 
a different fee is determined in accordance with the NOAA Finance 
Handbook. The amount of the fee will be printed on the vessel permit 
application form provided by the Administrator, Southwest Region.
    (ii) Operator permit fee. The Assistant Administrator may require a 
fee to be submitted with an application for an operator permit. The 
level of such a fee shall be determined in accordance with the NOAA 
Finance Handbook and specified by the Administrator, Southwest Region, 
on the application form.
    (iii) Vessel assessment fee. The vessel assessment fee supports the 
placement of observers on individual tuna purse seine vessels, and 
maintenance of the observer program, as established by the IATTC or 
other approved observer program.
    (A) The owner or managing owner of a purse seine vessel for which a 
DML has been requested must submit the vessel assessment fee, as 
established by the IATTC or other approved observer program, to the 
Administrator, Southwest Region, no later than September 15 of the year 
prior to the calendar year for which the DML is requested. Payment of 
the vessel assessment fee must be consistent with the fee for active 
status on the Vessel Register under Sec. 300.22(b)(4) of this title.
    (B) The owner or managing owner of a purse seine vessel for which 
active or inactive status on the Vessel Register, as defined in Sec. 
300.21 of this title, has been requested, but for which a DML has not 
been requested, must submit payment of the vessel assessment fee, as 
established by the IATTC or other approved observer program, to the 
Administrator, Southwest Region, no later than November 30 of the year 
prior to the calendar year in which the vessel will be listed on the 
Vessel Register. Payment of the vessel assessment fee is required only 
if the vessel is listed as active and is required to carry an observer, 
or if the vessel is listed as inactive and exceeds 400 st (362.8 mt) in 
carrying capacity. Payment of the vessel assessment fee must be 
consistent with the vessel's status, either active or inactive, on the 
Vessel Register in Sec. 300.22(b)(4) of this title.
    (C) The owner or managing owner of a purse seine vessel that is 
licensed under the South Pacific Tuna Treaty must submit the vessel 
assessment fee, as established by the IATTC or other approved observer 
program, to the Administrator, Southwest Region, prior to obtaining an 
observer and entering the ETP to fish. Consistent with Sec. 
300.22(b)(1)(i) of this title, this class of purse seine vessels is not 
required to be listed on the Vessel Register under Sec. 300.22(b)(4) of 
this title in order to purse seine for tuna in the ETP during a single 
fishing trip per calendar year of 90 days or less. Payment of the vessel 
assessment fee must be consistent with the fee for active status on the 
Vessel Register under Sec. 300.22(b)(4) of this title.
    (D) The owner or managing owner of a purse seine vessel listed as 
inactive on the Vessel Register at the beginning of the calendar year 
and who requests to replace a vessel removed from active status on the 
Vessel Register under Sec. 300.22(b)(4) of this title during the year, 
must pay the vessel assessment fee associated with active status, less 
the vessel assessment fee associated with inactive status that was 
already paid, before NMFS will request the IATTC Director change the 
status of the vessel from inactive to active. Payment of the vessel 
assessment fee is required only if the vessel is required to carry an 
observer.

[[Page 25]]

    (E) The owner or managing owner of a purse seine vessel not listed 
on the Vessel Register at the beginning of the calendar year and who 
requests to replace a vessel removed from active status on the Vessel 
Register under Sec. 300.22(b)(4) of this title during the year, must 
pay the vessel assessment fee associated with active status only if the 
vessel is required to carry an observer, before NMFS will request the 
IATTC Director change the status of the vessel to active.
    (F) Payments will be subject to a 10 percent surcharge if received 
under paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(E) of this section for vessels that were 
listed as active on the Vessel Register in the calendar year prior to 
the year for which active status was requested; or if received after the 
dates specified in paragraphs (b)(6)(iii)(A) or (b)(6)(iii)(B) of this 
section for vessels for which active status is requested if the vessel 
was listed as active during the year the request was made. Payments will 
not be subject to a 10 percent surcharge if received under paragraph 
(b)(6)(iii)(C) or (b)(6)(iii)(D) of this section, or if received under 
paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(E) of this section for vessels that were not 
listed as active on the Vessel Register in the calendar year prior to 
the year for which active status was requested. Payments will also not 
be subject to a 10 percent surcharge if received after the date 
specified in paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(B) of this section for vessels for 
which inactive status is requested, or for vessels for which active 
status is requested if the vessel was not listed as active during the 
year the request was made. The Administrator, Southwest Region, will 
forward all vessel assessment fees described in this section to the 
IATTC or to the applicable organization approved by the Administrator, 
Southwest Region.
    (7) Application approval. The Administrator, Southwest Region, will 
determine the adequacy and completeness of an application and, upon 
determining that an application is adequate and complete, will approve 
that application and issue the appropriate permit, except for applicants 
having unpaid or overdue civil penalties, criminal fines, or other 
liabilities incurred in a legal proceeding.
    (8) Conditions applicable to all permits--(i) General conditions. 
Failure to comply with the provisions of a permit or with these 
regulations may lead to suspension, revocation, modification, or denial 
of a permit. The permit holder, vessel, vessel owner, operator, or 
master may be subject, jointly or severally, to the penalties provided 
for under the MMPA. Procedures governing permit sanctions and denials 
are found at subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.
    (ii) Observer placement. By obtaining a permit, the permit holder 
consents to the placement of an observer on the vessel during every trip 
involving operations in the ETP and agrees to payment of the fees for 
observer placement. No observer will be assigned to a vessel unless that 
vessel owner has submitted payment of observer fees to the 
Administrator, Southwest Region. The observers may be placed under an 
observer program of NMFS, IATTC, or another observer program approved by 
the Administrator, Southwest Region.
    (iii) Explosives. The use of explosive devices is prohibited during 
all tuna purse seine operations that involve marine mammals.
    (iv) Reporting requirements. (A) The vessel permit holder of each 
permitted vessel must notify the Administrator, Southwest Region or the 
IATTC contact designated by the Administrator, Southwest Region, at 
least 5 days in advance of the vessel's departure on a fishing trip to 
allow for observer placement on every trip.
    (B) The vessel permit holder must notify the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, or the IATTC contact designated by the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, of any change of vessel operator at least 48 hours 
prior to departing on a fishing trip. In the case of a change in 
operator due to an emergency, notification must be made within 72 hours 
of the change.
    (v) Data release. By using a permit, the permit holder authorizes 
the release to NMFS and the IATTC of all data collected by observers 
aboard purse seine vessels during fishing trips under the IATTC observer 
program or another international observer program approved by the 
Administrator, Southwest Region. The permit holder

[[Page 26]]

must furnish the international observer program with all release forms 
required to authorize the observer data to be provided to NMFS and the 
IATTC. Data obtained under such releases will be used for the same 
purposes as would data collected directly by observers placed by NMFS 
and will be subject to the same standards of confidentiality.
    (9) Mortality and serious injury reports. The Administrator, 
Southwest Region, will provide to the public periodic status reports 
summarizing the estimated incidental dolphin mortality and serious 
injury by U.S. vessels of individual species and stocks.
    (c) Purse seining by vessels with Dolphin Mortality Limits (DMLs). 
In addition to the terms and conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of 
this section, any permit for a vessel to which a DML has been assigned 
under paragraph (c)(9) of this section and any operator permit when used 
on such a vessel are subject to the following terms and conditions:
    (1) A vessel may be used to chase and encircle schools of dolphins 
in the ETP only under the immediate direction of the holder of a valid 
operator's permit.
    (2) No retention of live marine mammals. Except as otherwise 
authorized by a specific permit, live marine mammals incidentally taken 
must be immediately returned to the ocean without further injury. The 
operator of a purse seine vessel must take every precaution to refrain 
from causing or permitting incidental mortality or serious injury of 
marine mammals. Live marine mammals may not be brailed, sacked up, or 
hoisted onto the deck during ortza retrieval.
    (3) Gear and equipment required for valid permit. A vessel 
possessing a vessel permit for purse seining involving the intentional 
taking of marine mammals may not engage in fishing operations involving 
the intentional deployment of the net on or encirclement of dolphins 
unless it is equipped with a dolphin safety panel in its purse seine, 
has the other required gear and equipment, and uses the required 
procedures.
    (i) Dolphin safety panel. The dolphin safety panel must be a minimum 
of 180 fathoms in length (as measured before installation), except that 
the minimum length of the panel in nets deeper than 18 strips must be 
determined in a ratio of 10 fathoms in length for each strip of net 
depth. It must be installed so as to protect the perimeter of the 
backdown area. The perimeter of the backdown area is the length of 
corkline that begins at the outboard end of the last bowbunch pulled and 
continues to at least two-thirds the distance from the backdown channel 
apex to the stern tiedown point. The dolphin safety panel must consist 
of small mesh webbing not to exceed 1\1/4\ inches (3.18 centimeters 
(cm)) stretch mesh extending downward from the corkline and, if present, 
the base of the dolphin apron to a minimum depth equivalent to two 
strips of 100 meshes of 4\1/4\ inches (10.80 cm) stretch mesh webbing. 
In addition, at least a 20-fathom length of corkline must be free from 
bunchlines at the apex of the backdown channel.
    (ii) Dolphin safety panel markers. Each end of the dolphin safety 
panel and dolphin apron, if present, must be identified with an easily 
distinguishable marker.
    (iii) Dolphin safety panel hand holds. Throughout the length of the 
corkline under which the dolphin safety panel and dolphin apron are 
located, hand hold openings must be secured so that they will not allow 
the insertion of a 1\3/8\ inch (3.50 cm) diameter cylindrical-shaped 
object.
    (iv) Dolphin safety panel corkline hangings. Throughout the length 
of the corkline under which the dolphin safety panel and dolphin apron 
if present, are located, corkline hangings must be inspected by the 
vessel operator following each trip. Hangings found to have loosened to 
the extent that a cylindrical-shaped object with a 1\3/8\ inch (3.50 cm) 
diameter can be inserted between the cork and corkline hangings, must be 
tightened so as not to allow the insertion of a cylindrical-shaped 
object with a 1\3/8\ inch (3.50 cm) diameter.
    (v) Speedboats. A minimum of three speedboats in operating condition 
must be carried. All speedboats carried aboard purse seine vessels and 
in operating condition must be rigged with tow lines and towing bridles 
or towing

[[Page 27]]

posts. Speedboat hoisting bridles may not be substituted for towing 
bridles.
    (vi) Raft. A raft suitable to be used as a dolphin observation-and-
rescue platform must be carried.
    (vii) Facemask and snorkel, or viewbox. At least two facemasks and 
snorkels or viewboxes must be carried.
    (viii) Lights. The vessel must be equipped with long-range, high-
intensity floodlights with a sodium lamp of at least 1000 watts, or a 
multivapour lamp of at least 1500 watts, for use in darkness to ensure 
sufficient light to observe that procedures for dolphin release are 
carried out and to monitor incidental dolphin mortality.
    (4) Vessel inspection--(i) Twice per year. At least twice during 
each calendar year, purse seine nets and other gear and equipment 
required under Sec. 216.24(c)(3) must be made available for inspection 
and for a trial set/net alignment by an authorized NMFS inspector or 
IATTC staff as specified by the Administrator, Southwest Region, in 
order to obtain a vessel permit. The first such inspection shall be 
carried out before the vessel's request for a DML is submitted to the 
IATTC. The second such inspection shall be carried out before 
notification of any reallocation of DMLs for vessels with full-year DMLs 
or during the last quarter of the year for vessels with second-semester 
DMLs.
    (ii) Reinspection. Purse seine nets and other gear and equipment 
required by these regulations must be made available for reinspection by 
an authorized NMFS inspector or IATTC staff as specified by the 
Administrator, Southwest Region. The vessel permit holder must notify 
the Administrator, Southwest Region, of any net modification at least 5 
days prior to departure of the vessel in order to determine whether a 
reinspection or trial set/net alignment is required.
    (iii) Failure to pass inspection. Upon failure to pass an inspection 
or reinspection, a vessel may not engage in purse seining involving the 
intentional taking of marine mammals until the deficiencies in gear or 
equipment are corrected as required by NMFS.
    (5) Operator permit holder training requirements. An operator must 
maintain proficiency sufficient to perform the procedures required 
herein, and must attend and satisfactorily complete a formal training 
session approved by the Administrator, Southwest Region, in order to 
obtain his or her permit. At the training session, an attendee will be 
instructed on the relevant provisions and regulatory requirements of the 
MMPA and the IDCP, and the fishing gear and techniques that are required 
for reducing serious injury and mortality of dolphin incidental to purse 
seining for tuna. Operators who have received a written certificate of 
satisfactory completion of training and who possess a current or 
previous calendar year permit will not be required to attend additional 
formal training sessions unless there are substantial changes in the 
relevant provisions or implementing regulations of the MMPA or the IDCP, 
or in fishing gear and techniques. Additional training may be required 
for any operator who is found by the Administrator, Southwest Region, to 
lack proficiency in the required fishing procedures or familiarity with 
the relevant provisions or regulations of the MMPA or the IDCP.
    (6) Marine mammal release requirements. All operators fishing 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section must use the following 
procedures during all sets involving the incidental taking of marine 
mammals in association with the capture and landing of tuna.
    (i) Backdown procedure. Backdown must be performed following a purse 
seine set in which dolphins are captured in the course of catching tuna, 
and must be continued until it is no longer possible to remove live 
dolphins from the net by this procedure. At least one crewmember must be 
deployed during backdown to aid in the release of dolphins. Thereafter, 
other release procedures required will be continued so that all live 
dolphins are released prior to the initiation of the sack-up procedure.
    (ii) Prohibited use of sharp or pointed instrument. The use of a 
sharp or pointed instrument to remove any marine mammal from the net is 
prohibited.
    (iii) Sundown sets prohibited. On every set encircling dolphin, the 
backdown procedure must be completed no later than one-half hour after 
sundown, except as provided here. For the purpose

[[Page 28]]

of this section, sundown is defined as the time at which the upper edge 
of the sun disappears below the horizon or, if the view of the sun is 
obscured, the local time of sunset calculated from tables developed by 
the U.S. Naval Observatory or other authoritative source approved by the 
Administrator, Southwest Region. A sundown set is a set in which the 
backdown procedure has not been completed and rolling the net to sack-up 
has not begun within one-half hour after sundown. Should a set extend 
beyond one-half hour after sundown, the operator must use the required 
marine mammal release procedures including the use of the high intensity 
lighting system. In the event a sundown set occurs where the seine skiff 
was let go 90 or more minutes before sundown, and an earnest effort to 
rescue dolphins is made, the International Review Panel of the IDCP may 
recommend to the United States that in the view of the International 
Review Panel, prosecution by the United States is not recommended. Any 
such recommendation will be considered by the United States in 
evaluating the appropriateness of prosecution in a particular 
circumstance.
    (iv) Dolphin safety panel. During backdown, the dolphin safety panel 
must be positioned so that it protects the perimeter of the backdown 
area. The perimeter of the backdown area is the length of corkline that 
begins at the outboard end of the last bow bunch pulled and continues to 
at least two-thirds the distance from the backdown channel apex to the 
stern tiedown point.
    (7) Experimental fishing operations. The Administrator, Southwest 
Region, may authorize experimental fishing operations, consistent with 
the provisions of the IDCP, for the purpose of testing proposed 
improvements in fishing techniques and equipment that may reduce or 
eliminate dolphin mortality or serious injury, or do not require the 
encirclement of dolphins in the course of fishing operations. The 
Administrator, Southwest Region, may waive, as appropriate, any 
requirements of this section except DMLs and the obligation to carry an 
observer.
    (i) A vessel permit holder may apply for an experimental fishing 
operation waiver by submitting the following information to the 
Administrator, Southwest Region, no less than 90 days before the date 
the proposed operation is intended to begin:
    (A) The name(s) of the vessel(s) and the vessel permit holder(s) to 
participate;
    (B) A statement of the specific vessel gear and equipment or 
procedural requirement to be exempted and why such an exemption is 
necessary to conduct the experiment;
    (C) A description of how the proposed modification to the gear and 
equipment or procedures is expected to reduce incidental mortality or 
serious injury of marine mammals;
    (D) A description of the applicability of this modification to other 
purse seine vessels;
    (E) The planned design, time, duration, and general area of the 
experimental operation;
    (F) The name(s) of the permitted operator(s) of the vessel(s) during 
the experiment;
    (G) A statement of the qualifications of the individual or company 
doing the analysis of the research; and
    (H) Signature of the permitted operator or of the operator's 
representative.
    (ii) The Administrator, Southwest Region, will acknowledge receipt 
of the application and, upon determining that it is complete, will 
publish a notice in the Federal Register summarizing the application, 
making the full application available for inspection and inviting 
comments for a minimum period of 30 days from the date of publication.
    (iii) The Administrator, Southwest Region, after considering the 
information submitted in the application identified in paragraph 
(c)(7)(i) of this section and the comments received, will either issue a 
waiver to conduct the experiment that includes restrictions or 
conditions deemed appropriate, or deny the application, giving the 
reasons for denial.
    (iv) A waiver for an experimental fishing operation will be valid 
only for the vessels and operators named in the permit, for the time 
period and areas specified, for trips carrying an observer designated by 
the Administrator, Southwest Region, and when all the

[[Page 29]]

terms and conditions of the permit are met.
    (v) The Administrator, Southwest Region, may suspend or revoke an 
experimental fishing waiver in accordance with 15 CFR part 904 if the 
terms and conditions of the waiver or the provisions of the regulations 
are not followed.
    (8) Operator permit holder performance requirements. [Reserved]
    (9) Vessel permit holder dolphin mortality limits. For purposes of 
this paragraph, the term ``vessel permit holder'' includes both the 
holder of a current vessel permit and also the holder of a vessel permit 
for the following year.
    (i) By September 1 each year, a vessel permit holder desiring a DML 
for the following year must provide to the Administrator, Southwest 
Region, the name of the U.S. purse seine fishing vessel(s) of carrying 
capacity greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) that the owner intends to use to 
intentionally deploy purse seine fishing nets in the ETP to encircle 
dolphins in an effort to capture tuna during the following year. NMFS 
will forward the list of purse seine vessels to the Director of the 
IATTC on or before October 1, or as otherwise required by the IDCP, for 
assignment of a DML for the following year under the provisions of Annex 
IV of the Agreement on the IDCP.
    (ii) Each vessel permit holder that desires a DML only for the 
period between July 1 to December 31 must provide the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, by September 1 of the prior year, the name of the U.S. 
purse seine fishing vessel(s) of greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) carrying 
capacity that the owner intends to use to intentionally deploy purse 
seine fishing nets in the ETP to encircle dolphins in an effort to 
capture tuna during the period. NMFS will forward the list of purse 
seine vessels to the Director of the IATTC on or before October 1, or as 
otherwise required under the IDCP, for possible assignment of a DML for 
the 6-month period July 1 to December 31. Under the IDCP, the DML will 
be calculated by the IDCP from any unutilized pool of DMLs in accordance 
with the procedure described in Annex IV of the Agreement on the IDCP 
and will not exceed one-half of an unadjusted full-year DML as 
calculated by the IDCP.
    (iii)(A) The Administrator, Southwest Region, will notify vessel 
owners of the DML assigned for each vessel for the following year, or 
the second half of the year, as applicable.
    (B) The Administrator, Southwest Region, may adjust the DMLs in 
accordance with Annex IV of the Agreement on the IDCP. All adjustments 
of full-year DMLs will be made before January 1, and the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, will notify the Director of the IATTC of any 
adjustments prior to a vessel departing on a trip using its adjusted 
DML. The notification will be no later than February 1 in the case of 
adjustments to full-year DMLs, and no later than May 1 in the case of 
adjustments to DMLs for the second half of the year.
    (C) In accordance with the requirements of Annex IV of the Agreement 
on the IDCP, the Administrator, Southwest Region, may adjust a vessel's 
DML if it will further scientific or technological advancement in the 
protection of marine mammals in the fishery or if the past performance 
of the vessel indicates that the protection or use of the yellowfin tuna 
stocks or marine mammals is best served by the adjustment, within the 
mandates of the MMPA. Experimental fishing operation waivers or 
scientific research permits will be considered a basis for adjustments.
    (iv)(A) A vessel assigned a full-year DML that does not make a set 
on dolphins by April 1 or that leaves the fishery will lose its DML for 
the remainder of the year, unless the failure to set on dolphins is due 
to force majeure or other extraordinary circumstances as determined by 
the International Review Panel.
    (B) A vessel assigned a DML for the second half of the year will be 
considered to have lost its DML if the vessel has not made a set on 
dolphins before December 31, unless the failure to set on dolphins is 
due to force majeure or extraordinary circumstances as determined by the 
International Review Panel.
    (C) Any vessel that loses its DML for 2 consecutive years will not 
be eligible

[[Page 30]]

to receive a DML for the following year.
    (D) NMFS will determine, based on available information, whether a 
vessel has left the fishery.
    (1) A vessel lost at sea, undergoing extensive repairs, operating in 
an ocean area other than the ETP, or for which other information 
indicates that vessel will no longer be conducting purse seine 
operations in the ETP for the remainder of the period covered by the DML 
will be determined to have left the fishery.
    (2) NMFS will make all reasonable efforts to determine the 
intentions of the vessel owner. The owner of any vessel that has been 
preliminarily determined to have left the fishery will be provided 
notice of such preliminary determination and given the opportunity to 
provide information on whether the vessel has left the fishery prior to 
NMFS making a final determination under 15 CFR part 904 and notifying 
the IATTC.
    (v) Any vessel that exceeds its assigned DML after any applicable 
adjustment under paragraph (c)(9)(iii) of this section will have its DML 
for the subsequent year reduced by 150 percent of the overage, unless 
another adjustment is determined by the International Review Panel, as 
mandated by the Agreement on the IDCP.
    (vi) A vessel that is covered by a valid vessel permit and that does 
not normally fish for tuna in the ETP but desires to participate in the 
fishery on a limited basis may apply for a per-trip DML from the 
Administrator, Southwest Region, at any time, allowing at least 60 days 
for processing. The request must state the expected number of trips 
involving sets on dolphins and the anticipated dates of the trip or 
trips. The request will be forwarded to the Secretariat of the IATTC for 
processing in accordance with Annex IV of the Agreement on the IDCP. A 
per-trip DML will be assigned if one is made available in accordance 
with the terms of Annex IV of the Agreement on the IDCP. If a vessel 
assigned a per-trip DML does not set on dolphins during that trip, the 
vessel will be considered to have lost its DML unless this was a result 
of force majeure or other extraordinary circumstances as determined by 
the International Review Panel. After two consecutive losses of a DML, a 
vessel will not be eligible to receive a DML for the next fishing year.
    (vii) Observers will make their records available to the vessel 
operator at any reasonable time, including after each set, in order for 
the operator to monitor the balance of the DML(s) remaining for use.
    (viii) Vessel and operator permit holders must not deploy a purse 
seine net on or encircle any school of dolphins containing individuals 
of a particular stock of dolphins for the remainder of the calendar 
year:
    (A) after the applicable per-stock per-year dolphin mortality limit 
for that stock of dolphins (or for that vessel, if so assigned) has been 
reached or exceeded; or
    (B) after the time and date provided in actual notification or 
notification in the Federal Register by the Administrator, Southwest 
Region, based upon the best available evidence, stating when any 
applicable per-stock per-year dolphin mortality limit has been reached 
or exceeded, or is expected to be reached in the near future.
    (ix) If individual dolphins belonging to a stock that is prohibited 
from being taken are not reasonably observable at the time the net skiff 
attached to the net is released from the vessel at the start of a set, 
the fact that individuals of that stock are subsequently taken will not 
be cause for enforcement action provided that all procedures required by 
the applicable regulations have been followed.
    (x) Vessel and operator permit holders must not intentionally deploy 
a purse seine net on or encircle dolphins intentionally:
    (A) after a set in which the vessel's DML, as adjusted, has been 
reached or exceeded; or
    (B) after the date and time provided in actual notification by 
letter, facsimile, radio, or electronic mail, or notice in the Federal 
Register by the Administrator, Southwest Region, based upon the best 
available evidence, that intentional sets on dolphins must cease because 
the total of the DMLs assigned to the U.S. fleet has been reached or 
exceeded, or is expected to be exceeded in the near future.

[[Page 31]]

    (d) Purse seining by vessels without assigned DMLs. In addition to 
the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, a vessel permit used 
for a trip not involving an assigned DML and the operator's permit when 
used on such a vessel are subject to the following terms and conditions: 
a permit holder may take marine mammals provided that such taking is an 
accidental occurrence in the course of normal commercial fishing 
operations and the vessel does not intentionally deploy its net on, or 
to encircle, dolphins; marine mammals taken incidental to such 
commercial fishing operations must be immediately returned to the 
environment where captured without further injury, using release 
procedures such as hand rescue, or aborting the set at the earliest 
effective opportunity; and the use of one or more rafts and facemasks or 
viewboxes to aid in the rescue of dolphins is recommended.
    (e) Observers--(1) The holder of a vessel permit must allow an 
observer duly authorized by the Administrator, Southwest Region, to 
accompany the vessel on all fishing trips in the ETP for the purpose of 
conducting research and observing operations, including collecting 
information that may be used in civil or criminal penalty proceedings, 
forfeiture actions, or permit sanctions. A vessel that fails to carry an 
observer in accordance with these requirements may not engage in fishing 
operations.
    (2) Research and observation duties will be carried out in such a 
manner as to minimize interference with commercial fishing operations. 
Observers must be provided access to vessel personnel and to dolphin 
safety gear and equipment, electronic navigation equipment, radar 
displays, high powered binoculars, and electronic communication 
equipment. The navigator must provide true vessel locations by latitude 
and longitude, accurate to the nearest minute, upon request by the 
observer. Observers must be provided with adequate space on the bridge 
or pilothouse for clerical work, as well as space on deck adequate for 
carrying out observer duties. No vessel owner, master, operator, or crew 
member of a permitted vessel may impair, or in any way interfere with, 
the research or observations being carried out. Masters must allow 
observers to use vessel communication equipment necessary to report 
information concerning the take of marine mammals and other observer 
collected data upon request of the observer.
    (3) Any marine mammals killed during fishing operations that are 
accessible to crewmen and requested from the permit holder or master by 
the observer must be brought aboard the vessel and retained for 
biological processing, until released by the observer for return to the 
ocean. Whole marine mammals or marine mammal parts designated as 
biological specimens by the observer must be retained in cold storage 
aboard the vessel until retrieved by authorized personnel of NMFS or the 
IATTC when the vessel returns to port for unloading.
    (4) It is unlawful for any person to forcibly assault, impede, 
intimidate, interfere with, or to influence or attempt to influence an 
observer, or to harass (including sexual harassment) an observer by 
conduct that has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with 
the observer's work performance, or that creates an intimidating, 
hostile, or offensive environment. In determining whether conduct 
constitutes harassment, the totality of the circumstances, including the 
nature of the conduct and the context in which it occurred, will be 
considered. The determination of the legality of a particular action 
will be made from the facts on a case-by-case basis.
    (5)(i) All observers must be provided sleeping, toilet and eating 
accommodations at least equal to that provided to a full crew member. A 
mattress or futon on the floor or a cot is not acceptable in place of a 
regular bunk. Meal and other galley privileges must be the same for the 
observer as for other crew members.
    (ii) Female observers on a vessel with an all-male crew must be 
accommodated either in a single-person cabin or, if reasonable privacy 
can be ensured by installing a curtain or other temporary divider, in a 
two-person cabin shared with a licensed officer of the vessel. If the 
cabin assigned to a female observer does not have its own toilet

[[Page 32]]

and shower facilities that can be provided for the exclusive use of the 
observer, then a schedule for time-sharing common facilities must be 
established before the placement meeting and approved by NMFS or other 
approved observer program and must be followed during the entire trip.
    (iii) In the event there are one or more female crew members, the 
female observer must be provided a bunk in a cabin shared solely with 
female crew members, and provided toilet and shower facilities shared 
solely with these female crew members.
    (f) Importation, purchase, shipment, sale and transport. (1)(i) It 
is illegal to import into the United States any fish, whether fresh, 
frozen, or otherwise prepared, if the fish have been caught with 
commercial fishing technology that results in the incidental kill or 
incidental serious injury of marine mammals in excess of that allowed 
under this part for U.S. fishermen, or as specified at paragraph (f)(6) 
of this section.
    (ii) For purposes of this paragraph (f), and in applying the 
definition of an ``intermediary nation,'' an import occurs when the fish 
or fish product is released from a nation's Customs' custody and enters 
into the commerce of the nation. For other purposes, ``import'' is 
defined in Sec. 216.3.
    (2) Imports requiring a Fisheries Certificate of Origin. Shipments 
of tuna, tuna products, and certain other fish products identified in 
paragraphs (f)(2)(i), (f)(2)(ii), and (f)(2)(iii) of this section may 
not be imported into the United States unless a properly completed 
Fisheries Certificate of Origin (FCO), NOAA Form 370, is filed with U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the time of importation.
    (i) Imports requiring a Fisheries Certificate of Origin, subject to 
yellowfin tuna embargo. All shipments containing yellowfin tuna or 
yellowfin tuna products (other than fresh tuna) imported into the United 
States must be accompanied by an FCO, including, but not limited to, 
those imported under the following Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
United States (HTS) numbers. Updated HTS numbers can be identified by 
referencing the most current HTS in effect at the time of importation,

    (3) Disposition of Fisheries Certificates of Origin. The FCO 
described in paragraph (f)(4) of this section may be obtained from the 
Administrator, Southwest Region, or downloaded from the Internet at 
http://swr.nmfs.noaa.gov/noaa370.htm.
    (i) A properly completed FCO and its attached certificates as 
described in Sec. 216.91(a), if applicable, must accompany the required 
CBP entry documents that are filed at the time of import.
    (ii) FCOs and associated certifications as described in Sec. 
216.91(a), if any, that accompany imported shipments of tuna must be 
submitted by the importer of record to the Tuna Tracking and 
Verification Program, Southwest Region, within 10 calendar days of the 
shipment's entry into the commerce of the United States. FCOs submitted 
via mail should be sent to the Tuna Tracking and Verification Program, 
Southwest Region, P.O. Box 32469, Long Beach, CA 90832-2469. Copies of 
the documents may be submitted electronically using a secure file 
transfer protocol (FTP) site. Importers of record interested in 
submitting FCOs and associated certifications via FTP may contact a 
representative of the Tuna Tracking and Verification Program at the 
following email address: SWRTuna.Track@noaa.gov. The Tuna Tracking and 
Verification Program will facilitate secure transfer and protection of 
certifications by assigning a separate electronic folder for each 
importer. Access to the electronic folder will require a user 
identification and password. The Tuna Tracking and Verification Program 
will assign each importer a unique user identification and password. 
Safeguarding the confidentiality of the user identification and password 
is the responsibility of the importer to whom they are assigned. Copies 
of the documents may also be submitted via mail either on compact disc 
or as hard copies. All electronic submissions, whether via FTP or on 
compact disc, must be in Portable Document Format (PDF).
    (iii) FCOs that accompany imported shipments of tuna destined for 
further processing in the United States must be endorsed at each change 
in ownership and submitted to the Administrator, Southwest Region, by 
the last endorser when all required endorsements are completed.
    (iv) Importers and exporters are required to retain their records, 
including FCOs, import or export documents, invoices, and bills of 
lading for 2 years,

[[Page 35]]

and such records must be made available within 30 days of a request by 
the Secretary or the Administrator, Southwest Region.
    (4) Contents of Fisheries Certificate of Origin. An FCO, certified 
to be accurate by the exporter(s) of the accompanying shipment, must 
include the following information:
    (i) CBP entry identification;
    (ii) Date of entry;
    (iii) Exporter's full name and complete address;
    (iv) Importer's or consignee's full name and complete address;
    (v) Species description, product form, and HTS number;
    (vi) Total net weight of the shipment in kilograms;
    (vii) Ocean area where the fish were harvested (ETP, western Pacific 
Ocean, south Pacific Ocean, north Pacific Ocean, eastern Atlantic Ocean, 
western Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, Indian Ocean, or other);
    (viii) Type of fishing gear used to harvest the fish (purse seine, 
longline, baitboat, large-scale driftnet, gillnet, pole and line/hook 
and line, or other);
    (ix) Country under whose laws the harvesting vessel operated based 
upon the flag of the vessel or, if a certified charter vessel, the 
country that accepted responsibility for the vessel's fishing 
operations;
    (x) Dates on which the fishing trip began and ended;
    (xi) The name of the harvesting vessel;
    (xii) Dolphin-safe condition of the shipment, described by checking 
the appropriate statement on the form and attaching additional 
certifications as described in Sec. 216.91(a) if required;
    (xiii) For shipments containing fish or fish products exported from, 
or harvested on the high seas by vessels of a nation known to use large-
scale driftnets, as determined by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph 
(f)(7) of this section, the High Seas Driftnet Certification contained 
on the FCO must be dated and signed by a responsible government official 
of the large-scale driftnet nation, certifying that the fish or fish 
products were harvested by a method other than large-scale driftnet; and
    (xiv) Each importer, exporter, or processor who takes custody of the 
shipment must sign and date the form to certify that the form and 
attached documentation accurately describes the shipment of fish that 
they accompany.
    (5) Dolphin-safe label. Tuna or tuna products sold in or exported 
from the United States that include on the label the term ``dolphin-
safe'' or any other term or symbol that claims or suggests the tuna were 
harvested in a manner not injurious to dolphins are subject to the 
requirements of subpart H of this part (Sec. 216.90 et seq.).
    (6) Scope of embargoes--(i) ETP yellowfin tuna embargo. Yellowfin 
tuna or products of yellowfin tuna harvested using a purse seine in the 
ETP identified by an HTS number listed in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this 
section may not be imported into the United States if such tuna or tuna 
products were:
    (A) Harvested on or after March 3, 1999, the effective date of 
section 4 of the IDCPA, and harvested by, or exported from, a nation 
that the Assistant Administrator has determined has jurisdiction over 
purse seine vessels of greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) carrying capacity 
harvesting tuna in the ETP, unless the Assistant Administrator has made 
an affirmative finding required for importation for that nation under 
paragraph (f)(8) of this section;
    (B) Exported from an intermediary nation, as defined in Section 3 of 
the MMPA, and a ban is currently in force prohibiting the importation 
from that nation under paragraph (f)(9) of this section; or
    (C) Harvested before March 3, 1999, the effective date of Section 4 
of the IDCPA, and would have been banned from importation under Section 
101(a)(2) of the MMPA at the time of harvest.
    (ii) Driftnet embargo. A shipment containing fish or fish products 
identified by an HTS number listed in paragraph (f)(2) of this section 
may not be imported into the United States if it is harvested by a 
large-scale driftnet, or if it is exported from or harvested on the high 
seas by any nation determined by the Assistant Administrator to be 
engaged in large-scale driftnet fishing, unless a government official of 
the

[[Page 36]]

large-scale driftnet nation completes, signs and dates the High Seas 
Driftnet section of the FCO certifying that the fish or fish products 
were harvested by a method other than large-scale driftnet.
    (iii) Pelly certification. After 6 months of an embargo being in 
place against a nation under this section, the Secretary will certify 
that nation under section 8(a) of the Fishermen's Protective Act (22 
U.S.C. 1978(a)). When such an embargo is lifted, the Secretary will 
terminate the certification under Section 8(d) of that Act (22 U.S.C. 
1978(d)).
    (iv) Coordination. The Assistant Administrator will promptly advise 
the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security of 
embargo decisions, actions, and finding determinations.
    (7) Large-scale driftnet nation: determination. Based upon the best 
information available, the Assistant Administrator will determine which 
nations have registered vessels that engage in fishing using large-scale 
driftnets. Such determinations will be published in the Federal 
Register. A responsible government official of any such nation may 
certify to the Assistant Administrator that none of the nation's vessels 
use large-scale driftnets. Upon receipt of the certification, the 
Assistant Administrator may find, and publish such finding in the 
Federal Register, that none of that nation's vessels engage in fishing 
with large-scale driftnets.
    (8) Affirmative finding procedure for nations harvesting yellowfin 
tuna using a purse seine in the ETP. (i) The Assistant Administrator 
will determine, on an annual basis, whether to make an affirmative 
finding based upon documentary evidence provided by the government of 
the harvesting nation or by the IDCP and the IATTC, and will publish the 
finding in the Federal Register. A finding will remain valid for 1 year 
or for such other period as the Assistant Administrator may determine. 
An affirmative finding will be terminated if the Assistant Administrator 
determines that the requirements of this paragraph are no longer being 
met. Every 5 years, the government of the harvesting nation must submit 
such documentary evidence directly to the Assistant Administrator and 
request an affirmative finding. Documentary evidence must be submitted 
by the harvesting nation for the first affirmative finding application. 
The Assistant Administrator may require the submission of supporting 
documentation or other verification of statements made in connection 
with requests to allow importations. An affirmative finding applies to 
yellowfin tuna and yellowfin tuna products that were harvested by 
vessels of the nation after March 3, 1999. To make an affirmative 
finding, the Assistant Administrator must find that:
    (A) The harvesting nation participates in the IDCP and is either a 
member of the IATTC or has initiated (and within 6 months thereafter 
completed) all steps required of applicant nations, in accordance with 
article V, paragraph 3, of the Convention establishing the IATTC, to 
become a member of that organization;
    (B) The nation is meeting its obligations under the IDCP and its 
obligations of membership in the IATTC, including all financial 
obligations;
    (C)(1) The annual total dolphin mortality of the nation's purse 
seine fleet (including certified charter vessels operating under its 
jurisdiction) did not exceed the aggregated total of the mortality 
limits assigned by the IDCP for that nation's purse seine vessels for 
the year preceding the year in which the finding would start; or
    (2)(i) Because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of 
the nation and the vessel captains, the total dolphin mortality of the 
nation's purse seine fleet (including certified charter vessels 
operating under its jurisdiction) exceeded the aggregated total of the 
mortality limits assigned by the IDCP for that nation's purse seine 
vessels; and
    (ii) Immediately after the national authorities discovered the 
aggregate mortality of its fleet had been exceeded, the nation required 
all its vessels to cease fishing for tuna in association with dolphins 
for the remainder of the calendar year; and
    (D)(1) In any years in which the parties agree to a global 
allocation system for per-stock per-year individual stock

[[Page 37]]

quotas, the nation responded to the notification from the IATTC that an 
individual stock quota had been reached by prohibiting any additional 
sets on the stock for which the quota had been reached;
    (2) If a per-stock per-year quota is allocated to each nation, the 
annual per-stock per-year dolphin mortality of the nation's purse seine 
fleet (including certified charter vessels operating under its 
jurisdiction) did not exceed the aggregated total of the per-stock per-
year limits assigned by the IDCP for that nation's purse seine vessels 
(if any) for the year preceding the year in which the finding would 
start; or
    (3)(i) Because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of 
the nation and the vessel captains, the per-stock per-year dolphin 
mortality of the nation's purse seine fleet (including certified charter 
vessels operating under its jurisdiction) exceeded the aggregated total 
of the per-stock per-year limits assigned by the IDCP for that nation's 
purse seine vessels; and
    (ii) Immediately after the national authorities discovered the 
aggregate per-stock mortality limits of its fleet had been exceeded, the 
nation required all its vessels to cease fishing for tuna in association 
with the stocks whose limits had been exceeded, for the remainder of the 
calendar year.
    (ii) Documentary Evidence and Compliance with the IDCP--(A) 
Documentary Evidence. The Assistant Administrator will make an 
affirmative finding under paragraph (f)(8)(i) of this section only if 
the government of the harvesting nation provides directly to the 
Assistant Administrator, or authorizes the IATTC to release to the 
Assistant Administrator, complete, accurate, and timely information that 
enables the Assistant Administrator to determine whether the harvesting 
nation is meeting the obligations of the IDCP, and whether ETP-harvested 
tuna imported from such nation comports with the tracking and 
verification regulations of subpart H of this part.
    (B) Revocation. After considering the information provided under 
paragraph (f)(8)(ii)(A) of this section, each party's financial 
obligations to the IATTC, and any other relevant information, including 
information that a nation is consistently failing to take enforcement 
actions on violations that diminish the effectiveness of the IDCP, the 
Assistant Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of State, 
will revoke an affirmative finding issued to a nation that is not 
meeting the obligations of the IDCP.
    (iii) A harvesting nation may apply for an affirmative finding at 
any time by providing to the Assistant Administrator the information and 
authorizations required in paragraphs (f)(8)(i) and (f)(8)(ii) of this 
section, allowing at least 60 days from the submission of complete 
information to NMFS for processing.
    (iv) The Assistant Administrator will make or renew an affirmative 
finding for the period from April 1 through March 31 of the following 
year, or portion thereof, if the harvesting nation has provided all the 
information and authorizations required by paragraphs (f)(8)(i) and 
(f)(8)(ii) of this section, and has met the requirements of paragraphs 
(f)(8)(i) and (f)(8)(ii) of this section.
    (v) Reconsideration of finding. The Assistant Administrator may 
reconsider a finding upon a request from, and the submission of 
additional information by, the harvesting nation, if the information 
indicates that the nation has met the requirements under paragraphs 
(f)(8)(i) and (f)(8)(ii) of this section.
    (9) Intermediary nation. Except as authorized under this paragraph, 
no yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products harvested by purse seine in 
the ETP classified under one of the HTS numbers listed in paragraph 
(f)(2)(i) of this section may be imported into the United States from 
any intermediary nation.
    (i) An ``intermediary nation'' is a nation that exports yellowfin 
tuna or yellowfin tuna products to the United States and that imports 
yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products that are subject to a direct 
ban on importation into the United States pursuant to Section 
101(a)(2)(B) of the MMPA.
    (ii) Shipments of yellowfin tuna that pass through any nation (e.g. 
on a 'through Bill of Lading') and are not entered for consumption in 
that nation are not considered to be imports to

[[Page 38]]

that nation and thus, would not cause that nation to be considered an 
intermediary nation under the MMPA.
    (iii) The Assistant Administrator will publish in the Federal 
Register a notice announcing when NMFS has determined, based on the best 
information available, that a nation is an ``intermediary nation.'' 
After the effective date of that notice, the import restrictions of this 
paragraph shall apply.
    (iv) Changing the status of intermediary nation determinations. 
Imports from an intermediary nation of yellowfin tuna and yellowfin tuna 
products classified under any of the HTS numbers in paragraph (f)(2)(i) 
of this section may be imported into the United States only if the 
Assistant Administrator determines, and publishes a notice of such 
determination in the Federal Register, that the intermediary nation has 
provided certification and reasonable proof that it has not imported in 
the preceding 6 months yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products that 
are subject to a ban on direct importation into the United States under 
Section 101(a)(2)(B) of the MMPA. At that time, the nation shall no 
longer be considered an ``intermediary nation'' and these import 
restrictions shall no longer apply.
    (v) The Assistant Administrator will review decisions under this 
paragraph upon the request of an intermediary nation. Such requests must 
be accompanied by specific and detailed supporting information or 
documentation indicating that a review or reconsideration is warranted. 
For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``certification and reasonable 
proof'' means the submission to the Assistant Administrator by a 
responsible government official from the nation of a document reflecting 
the nation's customs records for the preceding 6 months, together with a 
certification attesting that the document is accurate.
    (10) Fish refused entry. If fish is denied entry under paragraph 
(f)(2) of this section, the Port Director of CBP shall refuse to release 
the fish for entry into the United States.
    (11) Disposition of fish refused entry into the United States. Fish 
that is denied entry under paragraph (f)(2) of this section and that is 
not exported under CBP supervision within 90 days shall be disposed of 
under CBP laws and regulations at the importer's expense. Provided, 
however, that any disposition shall not result in an introduction into 
the United States of fish caught in violation of the MMPA.
    (12) Market Prohibitions. (i) It is unlawful for any person to sell, 
purchase, offer for sale, transport, or ship in the United States, any 
tuna or tuna products unless the tuna products are either:
    (A) Dolphin-safe under subpart H of this part; or
    (B) Harvested in compliance with the IDCP by vessels under the 
jurisdiction of a nation that is a member of the IATTC or has initiated, 
and within 6 months thereafter completes, all steps required by an 
applicant nation to become a member of the IATTC.
    (ii) It is unlawful for any exporter, transshipper, importer, 
processor, or wholesaler/distributor to possess, sell, purchase, offer 
for sale, transport, or ship in the United States, any tuna or tuna 
products bearing a label or mark that refers to dolphins, porpoises, or 
marine mammals unless the label or mark complies with the requirements 
of 16 U.S.C. 1385(d).
    (g) Penalties. Any person or vessel subject to the jurisdiction of 
the United States will be subject to the penalties provided for under 
the MMPA for the conduct of fishing operations in violation of these 
regulations. Penalties for violating these regulations may include, but 
are not limited to, civil monetary fines, permit suspension or 
revocation, and reductions in current and future DMLs. Recommended 
sanctions are identified in the IDCPA/DPCIA Tuna/Dolphin Civil 
Administrative Penalty Schedule. Procedures for the imposition of 
penalties under the MMPA are found at 15 CFR part 904.

<R05>
Sec. 216.26  Collection of certain marine mammal parts without prior 
authorization.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart:
    (a) Any bones, teeth or ivory of any dead marine mammal may be 
collected from a beach or from land within\1/4\ of a mile of the ocean. 
The term ocean includes bays and estuaries.
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subpart D, soft parts that are 
sloughed, excreted, or discharged naturally by a living marine mammal in

<R05>
Sec. 216.27  Release, non-releasability, and disposition under special
exception permits for rehabilitated marine mammals.

    (a) Release requirements. (1) Any marine mammal held for 
rehabilitation must be released within six months of capture or import 
unless the attending veterinarian determines that:
    (i) The marine mammal might adversely affect marine mammals in the 
wild;
    (ii) Release of the marine mammal to the wild will not likely be 
successful given the physical condition and behavior of the marine 
mammal; or
    (iii) More time is needed to determine whether the release of the 
marine mammal to the wild will likely be successful. Releasability must 
be reevaluated at intervals of no less than six months until 24 months 
from capture or import, at which time there will be a rebuttable 
presumption that release into the wild is not feasible.
    (2) The custodian of the rehabilitated marine mammal shall provide 
written notification prior to any release into the wild.
    (i) Notification shall be provided to:
    (A) The NMFS Regional Director at least 15 days in advance of 
releasing any beached or stranded marine mammal, unless advance notice 
is waived in writing by the Regional Director; or
    (B) The Office Director at least 30 days in advance of releasing any 
imported marine mammal.
    (ii) Notification shall include the following:

[[Page 40]]

    (A) A description of the marine mammal, including its physical 
condition and estimated age;
    (B) The date and location of release; and
    (C) The method and duration of transport prior to release.
    (3) The Regional Director, or the Office Director as appropriate, 
may:
    (i) Require additional information prior to any release;
    (ii) Change the date or location of release, or the method or 
duration of transport prior to release;
    (iii) Impose additional conditions to improve the likelihood of 
success or to monitor the success of the release; or
    (iv) Require other disposition of the marine mammal.
    (4) All marine mammals must be released near wild populations of the 
same species, and stock if known, unless a waiver is granted by the 
Regional Director or the Office Director.
    (5) All marine mammals released must be tagged or marked in a manner 
acceptable to the Regional Director or the Office Director. The tag 
number or description of the marking must be reported to the Regional 
Director or Office Director following release.
    (b) Non-releasability and postponed determinations. (1) The 
attending veterinarian shall provide the Regional Director or Office 
Director with a written report setting forth the basis of any 
determination under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (2) Upon receipt of a report under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
the Regional Director or Office Director, in their sole discretion, may:
    (i) Order the release of the marine mammal;
    (ii) Order continued rehabilitation for an additional 6 months; or
    (iii) Order other disposition as authorized.
    (3) No later than 30 days after a marine mammal is determined 
unreleasable in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of 
this section, the person with authorized custody must:
    (i) Request authorization to retain or transfer custody of the 
marine mammal in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, or;
    (ii) Humanely euthanize the marine mammal or arrange any other 
disposition of the marine mammal authorized by the Regional Director or 
Office Director.
    (4) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this section, the 
Office Director may require use of a rehabilitated marine mammal for any 
activity authorized under subpart D in lieu of animals taken from the 
wild.
    (5) Any rehabilitated beached or stranded marine mammal placed on 
public display following a non-releasability determination under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section and pending disposition under paragraph 
(c) of this section, or any marine mammal imported for medical treatment 
otherwise unavailable and placed on public display pending disposition 
after such medical treatment is concluded, must be held in captive 
maintenance consistent with all requirements for public display.
    (c) Disposition for a special exception purpose. (1) Upon receipt of 
an authorization request made under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, 
or release notification under (a)(2), the Office Director may authorize 
the retention or transfer of custody of the marine mammal for a special 
exception purpose authorized under subpart D.
    (2) The Office Director will first consider requests from a person 
authorized to hold the marine mammal for rehabilitation. The Office 
Director may authorize such person to retain or transfer custody of the 
marine mammal for scientific research, enhancement, or public display 
purposes.
    (3) The Office Director may authorize retention or transfer of 
custody of the marine mammal only if:
    (i) Documentation has been submitted to the Office Director that the 
person retaining the subject animal or the person receiving custody of 
the subject animal by transfer, hereinafter referred to as the 
recipient, complies with public display requirements of 16 U.S.C. 
1374(c)(2)(A) or, for purposes of scientific research and enhancement, 
holds an applicable permit, or an application for such a special 
exception permit under Sec. 216.33 or a request for a major amendment 
under Sec. 216.39 has

[[Page 41]]

been submitted to the Office Director and has been found complete;
    (ii) The recipient agrees to hold the marine mammal in conformance 
with all applicable requirements and standards; and
    (iii) The recipient acknowledges that the marine mammal is subject 
to seizure by the Office Director:
    (A) If, at any time pending issuance of the major amendment or 
permit, the Office Director determines that seizure is necessary in the 
interest of the health or welfare of the marine mammal;
    (B) If the major amendment or permit is denied; or
    (C) If the recipient is issued a notice of violation and assessment, 
or is subject to permit sanctions, in accordance with 15 CFR part 904.
    (4) There shall be no remuneration associated with any transfer, 
provided that, the transferee may reimburse the transferor for any and 
all costs associated with the rehabilitation and transport of the marine 
mammal.
    (5) Marine mammals undergoing rehabilitation or pending disposition 
under this section shall not be subject to public display, unless such 
activities are specifically authorized by the Regional Director or the 
Office Director, and conducted consistent with the requirements 
applicable to public display. Such marine mammals shall not be trained 
for performance or be included in any aspect of a program involving 
interaction with the public; and
    (6) Marine mammals undergoing rehabilitation shall not be subject to 
intrusive research, unless such activities are specifically authorized 
by the Office Director in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission 
and its Committee of Scientific Advisors on Marine Mammals, and are 
conducted pursuant to a scientific research permit.
    (d) Reporting. In addition to the report required under Sec. 
216.22(b), the person authorized to hold marine mammals for 
rehabilitation must submit reports to the Regional Director or Office 
Director regarding release or other disposition. These reports must be 
provided in the form and frequency specified by the Regional Director or 
Office Director.

    (v) Whether sufficient information is included regarding the 
environmental impact of the proposed activity to enable the Office 
Director:
    (A) To make an initial determination under the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) as to whether the proposed activity is 
categorically excluded from preparation of further environmental 
documentation, or whether the preparation of an environmental assessment 
(EA) or environmental impact statement (EIS) is appropriate or 
necessary; and
    (B) To prepare an EA or EIS if an initial determination is made by 
the Office Director that the activity proposed is not categorically 
excluded from such requirements.
    (3) The Office Director may consult with the Marine Mammal 
Commission (Commission) and its Committee of Scientific Advisors on 
Marine Mammals (Committee) in making these initial, and any subsequent, 
determinations.
    (4) Incomplete applications will be returned with explanation. If 
the applicant fails to resubmit a complete application or correct the

material, data, views, or comments. A summary record of the hearing will 
be kept.
    (6) The Office Director may extend the period during which any 
interested party may submit written comments. Notice of the extension 
must be published in the Federal Register within 60 days of publication 
of the notice of receipt in the Federal Register.
    (7) If, after publishing a notice of receipt, the Office Director 
determines on the basis of new information that an EA or EIS must be 
prepared, the Office Director must deny the permit unless an EA is 
prepared with a finding of no significant impact. If a permit is denied 
under these circumstances the application may be resubmitted with 
information sufficient to prepare an EA or EIS, and will be processed as 
a new application.
    (e) Issuance or denial procedures. (1) Within 30 days of the close 
of the public hearing or, if no public hearing is held, within 30 days 
of the close of the public comment period, the Office Director will 
issue or deny a special exception permit.
    (2) The decision to issue or deny a permit will be based upon:
    (i) All relevant issuance criteria set forth at Sec. 216.34;

    (i) Agrees to abide by all terms and conditions set forth in the 
permit, and all restrictions and relevant regulations under this 
subpart; and
    (ii) Acknowledges that the authority to conduct certain activities 
specified in the permit is conditional and subject to authorization by 
the Office Director.
    (4) Notice of the decision of the Office Director shall be published 
in the Federal Register within 10 days after the date of permit issuance 
or denial and shall indicate where copies of the permit, if issued, may 
be reviewed or obtained. If the permit issued involves marine mammals 
listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA, the notice shall 
include a finding by the Office Director that the permit:
    (i) Was applied for in good faith;
    (ii) If exercised, will not operate to the disadvantage of such 
endangered or threatened species; and
    (iii) Is consistent with the purposes and policy set forth in 
section 2 of the ESA.
    (5) If the permit is denied, the Office Director shall provide the 
applicant with an explanation for the denial.
    (6) Under the MMPA, the Office Director may issue a permit for 
scientific research before the end of the public comment period if 
delaying issuance could result in injury to a species, stock, or 
individual, or in loss of unique research opportunities. The Office 
Director also may waive the 30-day comment period required under the ESA 
in an emergency situation where the health or life of an endangered or 
threatened marine mammal is threatened and no reasonable alternative is 
available. If a permit is issued under these circumstances, notice of 
such issuance before the end of the comment period shall be published in 
the Federal Register within 10 days of issuance.

[[Page 44]]

    (7) The applicant or any party opposed to a permit may seek judicial 
review of the terms and conditions of such permit or of a decision to 
deny such permit. Review may be obtained by filing a petition for review 
with the appropriate U.S. District Court as provided for by law.

    (1) The proposed activity furthers a bona fide scientific or 
enhancement purpose;
    (2) If the lethal taking of marine mammals is proposed:
    (i) Non-lethal methods for conducting the research are not feasible; 
and
    (ii) For depleted, endangered, or threatened species, the results 
will directly benefit that species or stock, or will fulfill a 
critically important research need.
    (3) Any permanent removal of a marine mammal from the wild is 
consistent with any applicable quota established by the Office Director.
    (4) The proposed research will not likely have significant adverse 
effects on any other component of the marine ecosystem of which the 
affected species or stock is a part.

[[Page 48]]

    (5) For species or stocks designated or proposed to be designated as 
depleted, or listed or proposed to be listed as endangered or 
threatened:
    (i) The proposed research cannot be accomplished using a species or 
stock that is not designated or proposed to be designated as depleted, 
or listed or proposed to be listed as threatened or endangered;
    (ii) The proposed research, by itself or in combination with other 
activities will not likely have a long-term direct or indirect adverse 
impact on the species or stock;
    (iii) The proposed research will either:
    (A) Contribute to fulfilling a research need or objective identified 
in a species recovery or conservation plan, or if there is no 
conservation or recovery plan in place, a research need or objective 
identified by the Office Director in stock assessments established under 
section 117 of the MMPA;
    (B) Contribute significantly to understanding the basic biology or 
ecology of the species or stock, or to identifying, evaluating, or 
resolving conservation problems for the species or stock; or
    (C) Contribute significantly to fulfilling a critically important 
research need.
    (6) For proposed enhancement activities:
    (i) Only living marine mammals and marine mammal parts necessary for 
enhancement of the survival, recovery, or propagation of the affected 
species or stock may be taken, imported, exported, or otherwise affected 
under the authority of an enhancement permit. Marine mammal parts would 
include in this regard clinical specimens or other biological samples 
required for the conduct of breeding programs or the diagnosis or 
treatment of disease.
    (ii) The activity will likely contribute significantly to 
maintaining or increasing distribution or abundance, enhancing the 
health or welfare of the species or stock, or ensuring the survival or 
recovery of the affected species or stock in the wild.
    (iii) The activity is consistent with:
    (A) An approved conservation plan developed under section 115(b) of 
the MMPA or recovery plan developed under section 4(f) of the ESA for 
the species or stock; or
    (B) If there is no conservation or recovery plan, with the Office 
Director's evaluation of the actions required to enhance the survival or 
recovery of the species or stock in light of the factors that would be 
addressed in a conservation or recovery plan.
    (iv) An enhancement permit may authorize the captive maintenance of 
a marine mammal from a threatened, endangered, or depleted species or 
stock only if the Office Director determines that:
    (A) The proposed captive maintenance will likely contribute directly 
to the survival or recovery of the species or stock by maintaining a 
viable gene pool, increasing productivity, providing necessary 
biological information, or establishing animal reserves required to 
support directly these objectives; and
    (B) The expected benefit to the species or stock outweighs the 
expected benefits of alternatives that do not require removal of marine 
mammals from the wild.
    (v) The Office Director may authorize the public display of marine 
mammals held under the authority of an enhancement permit only if:
    (A) The public display is incidental to the authorized captive 
maintenance;

banked tissue is consistent with the goals of the NMMTB and the MMHSRP.
    (A) The goals of the MMHSRP are to facilitate the collection and 
dissemination of reference data on marine mammals and health trends of 
marine mammal populations in the wild; to correlate the health of marine 
mammals and marine mammal populations in the wild with available data on 
physical, chemical, and biological environmental parameters; and to 
coordinate effective responses to unusual mortality events.
    (B) The goal of the NMMTB is to maintain quality controlled marine 
mammal tissues that will permit retrospective analyses to determine 
environmental trends of contaminants and other analytes of interest and 
that will provide the highest quality samples for analyses using new and 
innovative techniques.
    (ii) A copy of the applicant's scientific research permit. The 
applicant must demonstrate that the proposed use of the banked tissue is 
authorized by the permit;
    (iii) Name of principal investigator, official title, and affiliated 
research or academic organization;

Sec. 216.71  Allowable take of fur seals.

    Pribilovians may take fur seals on the Pribilof Islands if such 
taking is
    (a) For subsistence uses, and
    (b) Not accomplished in a wasteful manner.

<R05>
Sec. 216.72  Restrictions on taking.

    (a) The harvests of seals on St. Paul and St. George Islands shall 
be treated independently for the purposes of this section. Any 
suspension, termination, or extension of the harvest is applicable only 
to the island for which it is issued.

[[Page 55]]

    (b) By April 1 of every third year, beginning April 1994, the 
Assistant Administrator will publish in the Federal Register a summary 
of the preceding 3 years of harvesting and a discussion of the number of 
seals expected to be taken annually over the next 3 years to satisfy the 
subsistence requirements of each island. This discussion will include an 
assessment of factors and conditions on St. Paul and St. George Islands 
that influence the need by Pribilof Aleuts to take seals for subsistence 
uses and an assessment of any changes to those conditions indicating 
that the number of seals that may be taken for subsistence each year 
should be made higher or lower. Following a 30-day public comment 
period, a final notification of the expected annual harvest levels for 
the next 3 years will be published.
    (c)(1) No fur seal may be taken on the Pribilof Islands before June 
23 of each year.
    (2) No fur seal may be taken except by experienced sealers using the 
traditional harvesting methods, including stunning followed immediately 
by exsanguination. The harvesting method shall include organized drives 
of subadult males to killing fields unless it is determined by the NMFS 
representatives, in consultation with the Pribilovians conducting the 
harvest, that alternative methods will not result in increased 
disturbance to the rookery or the increased accidental take of female 
seals.
    (3) Any taking of adult fur seals or pups, or the intentional taking 
of subadult female fur seals is prohibited.
    (4) Only subadult male fur seals 124.5 centimeters or less in length 
may be taken.
    (5) Seals with tags and/or entangling debris may only be taken if so 
directed by NMFS scientists.
    (d) The scheduling of the harvest is at the discretion of the 
Pribilovians, but must be such as to minimize stress to the harvested 
seals. The Pribilovians must give adequate advance notice of their 
harvest schedules to the NMFS representatives to allow for necessary 
monitoring activities. Scheduling must be consistent with the following 
restrictions:
    (1) St. Paul Island--Seals may only be harvested from the following 
haulout areas: Zapadni, English Bay, Northeast Point, Polovina, Lukanin, 
Kitovi, and Reef. No haulout area may be harvested more than once per 
week.
    (2) St. George Island--Seals may only be harvested from the 
following haulout areas: Northeast and Zapadni. Neither haulout area may 
be harvested more than twice per week.
    (e)(1) The Assistant Administrator is required to suspend the take 
provided for in Sec. 215.31 when:
    (i) He determines, after reasonable notice by NMFS representatives 
to the Pribilovians on the island, that the subsistence needs of the 
Pribilovians on the island have been satisfied;

or
    (ii) He determines that the harvest is otherwise being conducted in 
a wasteful manner; or
    (iii) The lower end of the range of the estimated subsistence level 
provided in the notice issued under paragraph (b) of this section is 
reached.
    (2) A suspension based on a determination under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) 
of this section may be lifted by the Assistant Administrator if he finds 
that the conditions which led to the determination that the harvest was 
being conducted in a wasteful manner have been remedied.
    (3) A suspension issued in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of 
this section may not exceed 48 hours in duration and shall be followed 
immediately by a review of the harvest data to determine if a finding 
under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section is warranted. If a the harvest 
is not suspended under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the 
Assistant Administrator must provide a revised estimate of the number of 
seals required to satisfy the Pribilovians' subsistence needs.
    (f) The Assistant Administrator shall terminate the take provided 
for in Sec. 215.31 on August 8 of each year or when it is determined 
under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section that the subsistence needs of 
the Pribilovians on the

Act (15 U.S.C. 45) for any producer, importer, exporter, distributor, or 
seller of any tuna products that are exported from or offered for sale 
in the United States to include on the label of those products the term 
``dolphin-safe'' or any other term or symbol that claims or suggests 
that the tuna contained in the products were harvested using a method of 
fishing that is not harmful to dolphins if the products contain tuna 
harvested:
    (1) ETP large purse seine vessel. In the ETP by a purse seine vessel 
of greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) carrying capacity unless:
    (i) the documentation requirements for dolphin-safe tuna under Sec. 
216.92 and 216.93 are met;
    (ii) No dolphins were killed or seriously injured during the sets in 
which the tuna were caught; and
    (iii) None of the tuna were caught on a trip using a purse seine net 
intentionally deployed on or to encircle dolphins, provided that this 
paragraph (a)(1)(iii) will not apply if the Assistant Administrator 
publishes a notification in the Federal Register announcing a finding 
under 16 U.S.C. 1385(g)(2) that the intentional deployment of purse 
seine nets on or encirclement of dolphins is not having a significant 
adverse impact on any depleted stock.
    (2) Non-ETP purse seine vessel. Outside the ETP by a vessel using a 
purse seine net:
    (i) In a fishery in which the Assistant Administrator has determined 
that a

[[Page 58]]

regular and significant association occurs between dolphins and tuna 
(similar to the association between dolphins and tuna in the ETP), 
unless such products are accompanied as described in Sec. 216.24(f)(3) 
by a written statement, executed by the Captain of the vessel and an 
observer participating in a national or international program acceptable 
to the Assistant Administrator, certifying that no purse seine net was 
intentionally deployed on or used to encircle dolphins during the 
particular trip on which the tuna were caught and no dolphins were 
killed or seriously injured in the sets in which the tuna were caught; 
or
    (ii) In any other fishery unless the products are accompanied as 
described in Sec. 216.24(f)(3) by a written statement executed by the 
Captain of the vessel certifying that no purse seine net was 
intentionally deployed on or used to encircle dolphins during the 
particular trip on which the tuna was harvested;
    (3) Driftnet. By a vessel engaged in large-scale driftnet fishing; 
or
    (4) Other fisheries. By a vessel in a fishery other than one 
described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section that is 
identified by the Assistant Administrator as having a regular and 
significant mortality or serious injury of dolphins, unless such product 
is accompanied as described in Sec. 216.24(f)(3) by a written 
statement, executed by the Captain of the vessel and an observer 
participating in a national or international program acceptable to the 
Assistant Administrator, that no dolphins were killed or seriously 
injured in the sets or other gear deployments in which the tuna were 
caught, provided that the Assistant Administrator determines that such 
an observer statement is necessary.
    (b) It is a violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission 
Act (15 U.S.C. 45) to willingly and knowingly use a label referred to in 
this section in a campaign or effort to mislead or deceive consumers 
about the level of protection afforded dolphins under the IDCP.
    (c) A tuna product that is labeled with the official mark, described 
in Sec. 216.95, may not be labeled with any other label or mark that 
refers to dolphins, porpoises, or marine mammals.

<R05>
Sec. 216.93  Tracking and verification program.

    The Administrator, Southwest Region, has established a national 
tracking and verification program to accurately document the dolphin-
safe condition of tuna, under the standards set forth in Sec. Sec. 
216.91 and 216.92. The tracking program includes procedures and reports 
for use when importing tuna into the United States and during U.S. purse 
seine fishing, processing, and marketing in the United States and 
abroad. Verification of tracking system operations is attained through 
the establishment of audit and document review requirements. The 
tracking program is consistent with the international tuna tracking and 
verification program adopted by the Parties to the Agreement on the 
IDCP.
    (a) Tuna tracking forms. Whenever a U.S. flag tuna purse seine 
vessel of greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) carrying capacity fishes in the 
ETP, IDCP approved Tuna Tracking Forms (TTFs), bearing a unique number 
assigned to that trip, are used by the observer to record every set made 
during that trip. One TTF is used to record dolphin-safe sets and a 
second TTF is used to record non-dolphin-safe sets. The information 
entered on the TTFs following each set includes the date, well number, 
weights by species composition, estimated tons loaded, and additional 
notes, if any. The observer and the vessel engineer initial the entry as 
soon as possible following each set, and the vessel captain and observer 
review and sign both TTFs at the end of the fishing trip certifying that 
the information on the forms is accurate. TTFs are confidential official 
documents of the IDCP, consistent with Article XVIII of the Agreement on 
the IDCP, and the Agreement on the IDCP Rules of Confidentiality.
    (b) Dolphin-Safe Certification. Upon request, the Office of the 
Administrator, Southwest Region, will provide written certification that 
tuna harvested by U.S. purse seine vessels greater than 400 st (362.8 
mt) carrying capacity is dolphin-safe, but only if NMFS' review of the 
TTFs for the subject trip shows that the tuna for which the 
certification is requested is dolphin-safe under the requirements of the 
Agreement on the IDCP and U.S. law.
    (c) Tracking fishing operations. (1) During ETP fishing trips by 
purse seine vessels greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) carrying capacity, 
tuna caught in sets designated as dolphin-safe by the vessel observer 
must be stored separately from tuna caught in non-dolphin-safe sets from 
the time of capture through unloading. Vessel personnel will decide into 
which wells tuna will be loaded. The observer will initially designate 
whether each set is dolphin-safe or not, based on his/her observation of 
the set. The observer will initially identify a vessel fish well as 
dolphin-safe if the first tuna loaded into the well during a trip was 
captured in a set in which no dolphin died or was seriously injured. The 
observer will initially identify a vessel fish well as non-dolphin-safe 
if the first tuna loaded into the well during a trip was captured in a 
set in which a dolphin died or was seriously injured. Any tuna loaded 
into a well previously designated non-dolphin-safe is considered non-
dolphin-safe tuna. The observer will change the designation of a 
dolphin-safe well to non-dolphin-safe if any tuna are loaded into the 
well that were captured in a set in which a dolphin died or was 
seriously injured.
    (2) The captain, managing owner, or vessel agent of a U.S. purse 
seine vessel greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) returning

[[Page 60]]

to port from a trip, any part of which included fishing in the ETP, must 
provide at least 48 hours notice of the vessel's intended place of 
landing, arrival time, and schedule of unloading to the Administrator, 
Southwest Region.
    (3) If the trip terminates when the vessel enters port to unload 
part or all of its catch, new TTFs will be assigned to the new trip, and 
any information concerning tuna retained on the vessel will be recorded 
as the first entry on the TTFs for the new trip. If the trip is not 
terminated following a partial unloading, the vessel will retain the 
original TTFs and submit a copy of those TTFs to the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, within 5 working days. In either case, the species and 
amount unloaded will be noted on the respective originals.
    (4) Tuna offloaded to trucks, storage facilities, or carrier vessels 
must be loaded or stored in such a way as to maintain and safeguard the 
identification of the dolphin-safe or non-dolphin-safe designation of 
the tuna as it left the fishing vessel.
    (5) The handling of TTFs and the tracking and verification of tuna 
caught in the Convention Area by a U.S. purse seine vessel greater than 
400 st (362.8 mt) carrying capacity shall be conducted consistent with 
the international tuna tracking and verification program adopted by the 
Parties to the Agreement on the IDCP.
    (d) Tracking cannery operations. (1) Whenever a U.S. tuna canning 
company in the 50 states, Puerto Rico, or American Samoa receives a 
domestic or imported shipment of ETP caught tuna for processing, a NMFS 
representative may be present to monitor delivery and verify that 
dolphin-safe and non-dolphin-safe tuna are clearly identified and remain 
segregated. Such inspections may be scheduled or unscheduled, and 
canners must allow the NMFS representative access to all areas and 
records.
    (2) Tuna processors must submit a report to the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, of all tuna received at their processing facilities in 
each calendar month whether or not the tuna is actually canned or stored 
during that month. Monthly cannery receipt reports must be submitted 
electronically or by mail before the last day of the month following the 
month being reported. Monthly reports must contain the following 
information:
    (i) Domestic receipts: dolphin-safe status, species, condition 
(round, loin, dressed, gilled and gutted, other), weight in short tons 
to the fourth decimal, ocean area of capture (ETP, western Pacific, 
Indian, eastern and western Atlantic, other), catcher vessel, trip 
dates, carrier name, unloading dates, and location of unloading.
    (ii) Import receipts: In addition to the information required in 
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, a copy of the FCO for each imported 
receipt must be provided.
    (3) Tuna processors must report on a monthly basis the amounts of 
ETP-caught tuna that were immediately utilized upon receipt or removed 
from cold storage. This report may be submitted in conjunction with the 
monthly report required in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. This report 
must contain:
    (i) The date of removal from cold storage or disposition;
    (ii) Storage container or lot identifier number(s) and dolphin-safe 
or non-dolphin-safe designation of each container or lot; and
    (iii) Details of the disposition of fish (for example, canning, 
sale, rejection, etc.).
    (4) During canning activities, non-dolphin-safe tuna may not be 
mixed in any manner or at any time during processing with any dolphin-
safe tuna or tuna products and may not share the same storage 
containers, cookers, conveyers, tables, or other canning and labeling 
machinery.
    (e) Tracking imports. All tuna products, except fresh tuna, that are 
imported into the United States must be accompanied as described in 
Sec. 216.24(f)(3) by a properly certified FCO as required by Sec. 
216.24(f)(2). For tuna tracking purposes, copies of FCOs and associated 
certifications must be submitted by the importer of record to the 
Administrator, Southwest Region, within 10 calendar days of the 
shipment's entry into the commerce of the United States as required by 
Sec. 216.24 (f)(3)(ii).
    (f) Verification requirements--(1) Record maintenance. Any exporter,

[[Page 61]]

transshipper, importer, processor, or wholesaler/distributor of any tuna 
or tuna products must maintain records related to that tuna for at least 
2 years. These records include, but are not limited to: FCOs and 
required certifications, any reports required in paragraphs (a), (b) and 
(d) of this section, invoices, other import documents, and trip reports.
    (2) Record submission. Within 10 calendar days of receiving a 
shipment of tuna or tuna products, any exporter, transshipper, importer, 
processor, or wholesaler/distributor of tuna or tuna products must 
submit to the Administrator, Southwest Region, all corresponding FCOs 
and required certifications for those tuna or tuna products.
    (3) Audits and spot checks. Upon request of the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, any exporter, transshipper, importer, processor, or 
wholesaler/distributor of tuna or tuna products must provide the 
Administrator, Southwest Region, timely access to all pertinent records 
and facilities to allow for audits and spot-checks on caught, landed, 
stored, and processed tuna.
    (g) Confidentiality of proprietary information. Information 
submitted to the Assistant Administrator under this section will be 
treated as confidential in accordance with NOAA Administrative Order 
216-100 ``Protection of Confidential Fisheries Statistics.''

 Subpart I_General Regulations Governing Small Takes of Marine Mammals 
                   Incidental to Specified Activities

    Source: 61 FR 15887, Apr. 10, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 216.101  Purpose.

    The regulations in this subpart implement section 101(a)(5) (A) 
through (D) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended, 16 
U.S.C. 1371(a)(5), which provides a mechanism for allowing, upon 
request, the incidental, but not intentional, taking of small numbers of 
marine mammals by U.S. citizens who engage in a specified activity 
(other than commercial fishing) within a specified geographic region.


<R05>
Sec. 216.102  Scope.

    The taking of small numbers of marine mammals under section 
101(a)(5) (A) through (D) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act may be 
allowed only if the National Marine Fisheries Service:
    (a) Finds, based on the best scientific evidence available, that the 
total taking by the specified activity during the specified time period 
will have a negligible impact on species or stock of

[[Page 63]]

marine mammal(s) and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the 
availability of those species or stocks of marine mammals intended for 
subsistence uses;
    (b) Prescribes either regulations under Sec. 216.106, or 
requirements and conditions contained within an incidental harassment 
authorization issued under Sec. 216.107, setting forth permissible 
methods of taking and other means of effecting the least practicable 
adverse impact on the species or stock of marine mammal and its habitat 
and on the availability of the species or stock of marine mammal for 
subsistence uses, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating 
grounds, and areas of similar significance; and
    (c) Prescribes either regulations or requirements and conditions 
contained within an incidental harassment authorization, as appropriate, 
pertaining to the monitoring and reporting of such taking. The specific 
regulations governing certain specified activities are contained in 
subsequent subparts of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 216.103  Definitions.

    In addition to definitions contained in the MMPA, and in Sec. 
216.3, and unless the context otherwise requires, in subsequent subparts 
to this part:
    Arctic waters means the marine and estuarine waters north of 60[deg] 
N. lat.
    Citizens of the United States and U.S. citizens mean individual U.S. 
citizens or any corporation or similar entity if it is organized under 
the laws of the United States or any governmental unit defined in 16 
U.S.C. 1362(13). U.S. Federal, state and local government agencies shall 
also constitute citizens of the United States for purposes of this part.
    Incidental harassment, incidental taking and incidental, but not 
intentional, taking all mean an accidental taking. This does not mean 
that the taking is unexpected, but rather it includes those takings that 
are infrequent, unavoidable or accidental. (A complete definition of 
``take'' is contained in Sec. 216.3).
    Negligible impact is an impact resulting from the specified activity 
that cannot be reasonably expected to, and is not reasonably likely to, 
adversely affect the species or stock through effects on annual rates of 
recruitment or survival.
    Small numbers means a portion of a marine mammal species or stock 
whose taking would have a negligible impact on that species or stock.
    Specified activity means any activity, other than commercial 
fishing, that takes place in a specified geographical region and 
potentially involves the taking of small numbers of marine mammals.
    Specified geographical region means an area within which a specified 
activity is conducted and that has certain biogeographic 
characteristics.
    Unmitigable adverse impact means an impact resulting from the 
specified activity:
    (1) That is likely to reduce the availability of the species to a 
level insufficient for a harvest to meet subsistence needs by:
    (i) Causing the marine mammals to abandon or avoid hunting areas;
    (ii) Directly displacing subsistence users; or
    (iii) Placing physical barriers between the marine mammals and the 
subsistence hunters; and
    (2) That cannot be sufficiently mitigated by other measures to 
increase the availability of marine mammals to allow subsistence needs 
to be met.


<R05>
Sec. 216.104  Submission of requests.

    (a) In order for the National Marine Fisheries Service to consider 
authorizing the taking by U.S. citizens of small numbers of marine 
mammals incidental to a specified activity (other than commercial 
fishing), or to make a finding that an incidental take is unlikely to 
occur, a written request must be submitted to the Assistant 
Administrator. All requests must include the following information for 
their activity:
    (1) A detailed description of the specific activity or class of 
activities that can be expected to result in incidental taking of marine 
mammals;
    (2) The date(s) and duration of such activity and the specific 
geographical region where it will occur;
    (3) The species and numbers of marine mammals likely to be found 
within the activity area;

[[Page 64]]

    (4) A description of the status, distribution, and seasonal 
distribution (when applicable) of the affected species or stocks of 
marine mammals likely to be affected by such activities;
    (5) The type of incidental taking authorization that is being 
requested (i.e., takes by harassment only; takes by harassment, injury 
and/or death) and the method of incidental taking;
    (6) By age, sex, and reproductive condition (if possible), the 
number of marine mammals (by species) that may be taken by each type of 
taking identified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, and the number of 
times such takings by each type of taking are likely to occur;
    (7) The anticipated impact of the activity upon the species or stock 
of marine mammal;
    (8) The anticipated impact of the activity on the availability of 
the species or stocks of marine mammals for subsistence uses;
    (9) The anticipated impact of the activity upon the habitat of the 
marine mammal populations, and the likelihood of restoration of the 
affected habitat;
    (10) The anticipated impact of the loss or modification of the 
habitat on the marine mammal populations involved;
    (11) The availability and feasibility (economic and technological) 
of equipment, methods, and manner of conducting such activity or other 
means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact upon the 
affected species or stocks, their habitat, and on their availability for 
subsistence uses, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating 
grounds, and areas of similar significance;
    (12) Where the proposed activity would take place in or near a 
traditional Arctic subsistence hunting area and/or may affect the 
availability of a species or stock of marine mammal for Arctic 
subsistence uses, the applicant must submit either a plan of cooperation 
or information that identifies what measures have been taken and/or will 
be taken to minimize any adverse effects on the availability of marine 
mammals for subsistence uses. A plan must include the following:
    (i) A statement that the applicant has notified and provided the 
affected subsistence community with a draft plan of cooperation;
    (ii) A schedule for meeting with the affected subsistence 
communities to discuss proposed activities and to resolve potential 
conflicts regarding any aspects of either the operation or the plan of 
cooperation;
    (iii) A description of what measures the applicant has taken and/or 
will take to ensure that proposed activities will not interfere with 
subsistence whaling or sealing; and
    (iv) What plans the applicant has to continue to meet with the 
affected communities, both prior to and while conducting the activity, 
to resolve conflicts and to notify the communities of any changes in the 
operation;
    (13) The suggested means of accomplishing the necessary monitoring 
and reporting that will result in increased knowledge of the species, 
the level of taking or impacts on populations of marine mammals that are 
expected to be present while conducting activities and suggested means 
of minimizing burdens by coordinating such reporting requirements with 
other schemes already applicable to persons conducting such activity. 
Monitoring plans should include a description of the survey techniques 
that would be used to determine the movement and activity of marine 
mammals near the activity site(s) including migration and other habitat 
uses, such as feeding. Guidelines for developing a site-specific 
monitoring plan may be obtained by writing to the Director, Office of 
Protected Resources; and
    (14) Suggested means of learning of, encouraging, and coordinating 
research opportunities, plans, and activities relating to reducing such 
incidental taking and evaluating its effects.
    (b)(1) The Assistant Administrator shall determine the adequacy and 
completeness of a request and, if determined to be adequate and 
complete, will begin the public review process by publishing in the 
Federal Register either:
    (i) A proposed incidental harassment authorization; or
    (ii) A notice of receipt of a request for the implementation or 
reimplementation of regulations governing the incidental taking.

[[Page 65]]

    (2) Through notice in the Federal Register, newspapers of general 
circulation, and appropriate electronic media in the coastal areas that 
may be affected by such activity, NMFS will invite information, 
suggestions, and comments for a period not to exceed 30 days from the 
date of publication in the Federal Register. All information and 
suggestions will be considered by the National Marine Fisheries Service 
in developing, if appropriate, the most effective regulations governing 
the issuance of letters of authorization or conditions governing the 
issuance of an incidental harassment authorization.
    (3) Applications that are determined to be incomplete or 
inappropriate for the type of taking requested, will be returned to the 
applicant with an explanation of why the application is being returned.
    (c) The Assistant Administrator shall evaluate each request to 
determine, based upon the best available scientific evidence, whether 
the taking by the specified activity within the specified geographic 
region will have a negligible impact on the species or stock and, where 
appropriate, will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the 
availability of such species or stock for subsistence uses. If the 
Assistant Administrator finds that the mitigating measures would render 
the impact of the specified activity negligible when it would not 
otherwise satisfy that requirement, the Assistant Administrator may make 
a finding of negligible impact subject to such mitigating measures being 
successfully implemented. Any preliminary findings of ``negligible 
impact'' and ``no unmitigable adverse impact'' shall be proposed for 
public comment along with either the proposed incidental harassment 
authorization or the proposed regulations for the specific activity.
    (d) If, subsequent to the public review period, the Assistant 
Administrator finds that the taking by the specified activity would have 
more than a negligible impact on the species or stock of marine mammal 
or would have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of such 
species or stock for subsistence uses, the Assistant Administrator shall 
publish in the Federal Register the negative finding along with the 
basis for denying the request.


<R05>
Sec. 216.105  Specific regulations.

    (a) For all petitions for regulations under this paragraph, 
applicants must provide the information requested in Sec. 216.104(a) on 
their activity as a whole, which includes, but is not necessarily 
limited to, an assessment of total impacts by all persons conducting the 
activity.
    (b) For allowed activities that may result in incidental takings of 
small numbers of marine mammals by harassment, serious injury, death or 
a combination thereof, specific regulations shall be established for 
each allowed activity that set forth:
    (1) Permissible methods of taking;
    (2) Means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on the 
species and its habitat and on the availability of the species for 
subsistence uses; and
    (3) Requirements for monitoring and reporting, including 
requirements for the independent peer-review of proposed monitoring 
plans where the proposed activity may affect the availability of a 
species or stock for taking for subsistence uses.
    (c) Regulations will be established based on the best available 
information. As new information is developed, through monitoring, 
reporting, or research, the regulations may be modified, in whole or in 
part, after notice and opportunity for public review.


<R05>

opportunity for public comment, the Assistant Administrator determines 
that:
    (1) The regulations prescribed are not being substantially complied 
with; or
    (2) The taking allowed is having, or may have, more than a 
negligible impact on the species or stock or, where relevant, an 
unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock 
for subsistence uses.
    (f) The requirement for notice and opportunity for public review in 
Sec. 216.106(e) shall not apply if the Assistant Administrator 
determines that an emergency exists that poses a significant risk to the 
wellbeing of the species or stocks of marine mammals concerned.
    (g) A violation of any of the terms and conditions of a Letter of 
Authorization or of the specific regulations shall subject the Holder 
and/or any individual who is operating under the authority of the

<R05>
Sec. 216.107  Incidental harassment authorization for Arctic waters.

    (a) Except for activities that have the potential to result in 
serious injury or mortality, which must be authorized under Sec. 
216.105, incidental harassment authorizations may be issued, following a 
30-day public review period, to allowed activities that may result in 
only the incidental harassment of a small number of marine mammals. Each 
such incidental harassment authorization shall set forth:
    (1) Permissible methods of taking by harassment;
    (2) Means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on the 
species, its habitat, and on the availability of the species for 
subsistence uses; and
    (3) Requirements for monitoring and reporting, including 
requirements for the independent peer-review of proposed monitoring 
plans where the proposed activity may affect the availability of a 
species or stock for taking for subsistence uses.
    (b) Issuance of an incidental harassment authorization will be based 
on a determination that the number of marine mammals taken by harassment 
will be small, will have a negligible impact on the species or stock of 
marine mammal(s), and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the 
availability of species or stocks for taking for subsistence uses.
    (c) An incidental harassment authorization will be either issued or 
denied within 45 days after the close of the public review period.
    (d) Notice of issuance or denial of an incidental harassment 
authorization will be published in the Federal Register within 30 days 
of issuance of a determination.
    (e) Incidental harassment authorizations will be valid for a period 
of time not to exceed 1 year but may be renewed for additional periods 
of time not to exceed 1 year for each reauthorization.
    (f) An incidental harassment authorization shall be modified, 
withdrawn, or suspended if, after notice and opportunity for public 
comment, the Assistant Administrator determines that:
    (1) The conditions and requirements prescribed in the authorization 
are not being substantially complied with; or
    (2) The authorized taking, either individually or in combination 
with other authorizations, is having, or may have, more than a 
negligible impact on the species or stock or, where relevant, an 
unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock 
for subsistence uses.
    (g) The requirement for notice and opportunity for public review in 
paragraph (f) of this section shall not apply if the Assistant 
Administrator determines that an emergency exists that poses a 
significant risk to the well-being of the species or stocks of marine 
mammals concerned.
    (h) A violation of any of the terms and conditions of an incidental 
harassment authorization shall subject the

[[Page 67]]

holder and/or any individual who is operating under the authority of the 
holder's incidental harassment authorization to penalties provided in 
the MMPA.


<R05>
Sec. 216.108  Requirements for monitoring and reporting under 
incidental harassment authorizations for Arctic waters.

    (a) Holders of an incidental harassment authorization in Arctic 
waters and their employees, agents, and designees must cooperate with 
the National Marine Fisheries Service and other designated Federal, 
state, or local agencies to monitor the impacts of their activity on 
marine mammals. Unless stated otherwise within an incidental harassment 
authorization, the holder of an incidental harassment authorization 
effective in Arctic waters must notify the Alaska Regional Director, 
National Marine Fisheries Service, of any activities that may involve a 
take by incidental harassment in Arctic waters at least 14 calendar days 
prior to commencement of the activity.
    (b) Holders of incidental harassment authorizations effective in 
Arctic waters may be required by their authorization to designate at 
least one qualified biological observer or another appropriately 
experienced individual to observe and record the effects of activities 
on marine mammals. The number of observers required for monitoring the 
impact of the activity on marine mammals will be specified in the 
incidental harassment authorization. If observers are required as a 
condition of the authorization, the observer(s) must be approved in 
advance by the National Marine Fisheries Service.
    (c) The monitoring program must, if appropriate, document the 
effects (including acoustical) on marine mammals and document or 
estimate the actual level of take. The requirements for monitoring 
plans, as specified in the incidental harassment authorization, may vary 
depending on the activity, the location, and the time.
    (d) Where the proposed activity may affect the availability of a 
species or stock of marine mammal for taking for subsistence purposes, 
proposed monitoring plans or other research proposals must be 
independently peer-reviewed prior to issuance of an incidental 
harassment authorization under this subpart. In order to complete the 
peer-review process within the time frames mandated by the MMPA for an 
incidental harassment authorization, a proposed monitoring plan 
submitted under this paragraph must be submitted to the Assistant 
Administrator no later than the date of submission of the application 
for an incidental harassment authorization. Upon receipt of a complete 
monitoring plan, and at its discretion, the National Marine Fisheries 
Service will either submit the plan to members of a peer review panel 
for review or within 60 days of receipt of the proposed monitoring plan, 
schedule a workshop to review the plan. The applicant must submit a 
final monitoring plan to the Assistant Administrator prior to the 
issuance of an incidental harassment authorization.
    (e) At its discretion, the National Marine Fisheries Service may 
place an observer aboard vessels, platforms, aircraft, etc., to monitor 
the impact of activities on marine mammals.
    (f)(1) As specified in the incidental harassment authorization, the 
holder of an incidental harassment authorization for Arctic waters must 
submit reports to the Assistant Administrator within 90 days of 
completion of any individual components of the activity (if any), within 
90 days of completion of the activity, but no later than 120 days prior 
to expiration of the incidental harassment authorization, whichever is 
earlier. This report must include the following information:
    (i) Dates and type(s) of activity;
    (ii) Dates and location(s) of any activities related to monitoring 
the effects on marine mammals; and
    (iii) Results of the monitoring activities, including an estimate of 
the actual level and type of take, species name and numbers of each 
species observed, direction of movement of species, and any observed 
changes or modifications in behavior.
    (2) Monitoring reports will be reviewed by the Assistant 
Administrator and, if determined to be incomplete or inaccurate, will be 
returned to the

[[Page 68]]

holder of the authorization with an explanation of why the report is 
being returned. If the authorization holder disagrees with the findings 
of the Assistant Administrator, the holder may request an independent 
peer review of the report. Failure to submit a complete and accurate 
report may result in a delay in processing future authorization 
requests.
    (g) Results of any behavioral, feeding, or population studies, that 
are conducted supplemental to the monitoring program, should be made 
available to the National Marine Fisheries Service before applying for 
an incidental harassment authorization for the following year.

Sec. 216.124  Mitigation.

    (a) The activity identified in Sec. 216.120(a) must be conducted in 
a manner that minimizes, to the greatest extent practicable, adverse 
impacts on marine mammals and their habitats. When conducting operations 
identified in Sec. 216.120(a), the mitigation measures contained in the 
Letter of Authorization issued under Sec. Sec. 216.106 and 216.127 must 
be implemented. These mitigation measures include (but are not limited 
to):
    (1) All aircraft and helicopter flight paths must maintain a minimum 
distance of 1,000 ft (305 m) from recognized seal haul-outs and 
rookeries (e.g., Point Sal, Purisima Point, Rocky Point), except in 
emergencies or for real-time security incidents (e.g., search-and-
rescue, fire-fighting), which may require approaching pinniped haul-outs 
and rookeries closer than 1,000 ft (305 m).
    (2) For missile and rocket launches, holders of Letters of 
Authorization must avoid, whenever possible, launches during the harbor 
seal pupping season of March through June, unless constrained by factors 
including, but not limited to, human safety, national security, or for 
space vehicle launch trajectory necessary to meet mission objectives.
    (3) Vandenberg Air Force Base must avoid, whenever possible, 
launches which are predicted to produce a sonic boom on the Northern 
Channel Islands during harbor seal, elephant seal, California sea lion, 
and northern fur seal pupping seasons of March through June.
    (4) If post-launch surveys determine that an injurious or lethal 
take of a marine mammal has occurred or there is an indication that the 
distribution, size, or productivity of the potentially affected pinniped 
populations has been affected, the launch procedure and the monitoring 
methods must be reviewed, in cooperation with NMFS, and, if necessary, 
appropriate changes must be made through modification to a Letter of 
Authorization, prior to conducting the next launch of the same vehicle 
under that Letter of Authorization.

    (1) Conduct observations on harbor seal, elephant seal, and sea lion 
activity in the vicinity of the rookery nearest the launch platform or, 
in the absence of pinnipeds at that location, at another nearby haul-
out, for at least 72 hours prior to any planned launch occurring during 
the harbor seal pupping season (1 March through 30 June) and continue 
for a period of time not less than 48 hours subsequent to launching.
    (2) For launches during the harbor seal pupping season (March 
through June), conduct follow-up surveys within 2 weeks of the launch to 
ensure that there were no adverse effects on any marine mammals,
    (3) Monitor haul-out sites on the Northern Channel Islands, if it is 
determined by modeling that a sonic boom of greater than 1 psf could 
occur in

[[Page 70]]

those areas (this determination will be made in consultation with NMFS),
    (4) Investigate the potential for spontaneous abortion, disruption 
of effective female-neonate bonding, and other reproductive dysfunction,
    (5) Supplement observations on Vandenberg and on the Northern 
Channel Islands with video-recording of mother-pup seal responses for 
daylight launches during the pupping season,
    (6) Conduct acoustic measurements of those launch vehicles that have 
not had sound pressure level measurements made previously, and
    (7) Include multiple surveys each day that surveys are required that 
record the species, number of animals, general behavior, presence of 
pups, age class, gender and reaction to launch noise, sonic booms or 
other natural or human caused disturbances, in addition to recording 
environmental conditions such as tide, wind speed, air temperature, and 
swell.
    (c) Holders of Letters of Authorization must conduct additional 
monitoring as required under an annual Letter of Authorization.
    (d) Holders of Letters of Authorization must submit a report to the 
Southwest Administrator, NMFS, within 90 days after each launch. This

    (1) Date(s) and time(s) of the launch,
    (2) Design of the monitoring program, and
    (3) Results of the monitoring program, including, but not 
necessarily limited to:
    (i) Numbers of pinnipeds present on the haul-out prior to 
commencement of the launch,
    (ii) Numbers of pinnipeds that may have been harassed as noted by 
the number of pinnipeds estimated to have entered the water as a result 
of launch noise,
    (iii) The length of time pinnipeds remained off the haul-out or 
rookery,
    (iv) Numbers of pinniped adults, juveniles or pups that may have 
been injured or killed as a result of the launch, and
    (v) Behavioral modifications by pinnipeds that were likely the 
result of launch noise or the sonic boom.
    (e) An annual report must be submitted at the time of renewal of the 
Letter of Authorization.
    (f) A final report must be submitted at least 180 days prior to 
expiration of these regulations. This report will:
    (1) Summarize the activities undertaken and the results reported in 
all previous reports,
    (2) Assess the impacts at each of the major rookeries,
    (3) Assess the cumulative impacts on pinnipeds and other marine 
mammals from Vandenberg activities, and
    (4) State the date(s), location(s), and findings of any research 
activities related to monitoring the effects on launch noise and sonic 
booms on marine mammal populations.

local agency with authority to monitor the impacts of the activity on 
marine mammals. Unless specified otherwise in the Letter of 
Authorization, the Holder of the Letter of Authorization must notify the 
Administrator, Southwest Region, NMFS, by letter, e-mail, or telephone, 
at least 1 week prior to activities possibly involving the taking of 
marine mammals. If the authorized activity identified in Sec. 216.150 
is thought to have resulted in the mortality or injury of any marine 
mammals or in any take of marine mammals not identified in Sec. 
216.150(b), then the Holder of the Letter of Authorization must notify 
the Director, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, or designee, by 
telephone (301-713-2289), and the Administrator, Southwest Region, NMFS, 
or designee, by telephone (562-980-3232), within 48 hours of the 
discovery of the injured or dead animal.
    (b) The National Marine Fisheries Service must be informed 
immediately of any changes or deletions to any portions of the proposed 
monitoring plan submitted, in accordance with the Letter of 
Authorization.
    (c) The holder of the Letter of Authorization must designate 
biologically trained, on-site individual(s), approved in advance by the 
National Marine Fisheries Service, to record the effects of the launch 
activities and the resulting noise on pinnipeds.
    (d) The holder of the Letter of Authorization must implement the 
following monitoring measures:
    (1) Visual Land-Based Monitoring. (i) Prior to each missile launch, 
an observer(s) will place 3 autonomous digital video cameras overlooking 
chosen haul-out sites located varying distances from the missile launch 
site. Each video camera will be set to record a focal subgroup within 
the larger haul-out aggregation for a maximum of 4 hours or as permitted 
by the videotape capacity.
    (ii) Systematic visual observations, by those individuals, described 
in paragraph (c) of this section, on pinniped presence and activity will 
be conducted and recorded in a field logbook or recorded on digital 
video for subsequent analysis for no less than 1 hour prior to the 
estimated launch time and for up to 1 hour immediately following each 
missile launch.
    (iii) Documentation, both via autonomous video camera and human 
observer, will consist of:
    (A) Numbers and sexes of each age class in focal subgroups;
    (B) Description and timing of launch activities or other disruptive 
event(s);
    (C) Movements of pinnipeds, including number and proportion moving, 
direction and distance moved, and pace of movement;
    (D) Description of reactions;
    (E) Minimum distances between interacting and reacting pinnipeds;
    (F) Study location;
    (G) Local time;

    (2) Acoustic Monitoring. (i) During all missile launches, calibrated 
recordings of the levels and characteristics of the received launch 
sounds will be obtained from 3 different locations of varying distances 
from the missile's flight path. To the extent practicable, these 
acoustic recording locations will correspond with the haul-out sites 
where video monitoring is done.
    (ii) Acoustic recordings will be supplemented by the use of radar 
and telemetry systems to obtain the trajectory of missiles in three 
dimensions, whenever data coverage allows.
    (iii) Acoustic equipment used to record launch sounds will be 
suitable for collecting a wide range of parameters, including the 
magnitude, characteristics, and duration of each missile.
    (e) The holder of the Letter of Authorization must implement the 
following reporting requirements:
    (1) For each missile launch, the lead contractor or lead observer 
for the holder of the Letter of Authorization must provide a status 
report to the National Marine Fisheries Service, Southwest Regional 
Office, providing reporting items found under the Letter of 
Authorization, unless other arrangements for monitoring are agreed in

<R05>
Sec. 216.163  Mitigation.

    (a) Under a Letter of Authorization issued pursuant to Sec. 
216.106, the U.S. Navy may incidentally, but not intentionally, take 
marine mammals in the course of the activity described in Sec. 
216.161(a) provided all requirements of these regulations and such 
Letter of Authorization are met.
    (b) The activity identified in paragraph Sec. 216.161(a) of this 
section must be conducted in a manner that minimizes, to the greatest 
extent practicable, adverse impacts on marine mammals and their habitat. 
When detonating explosives, the following mitigation measures must be 
implemented:
    (1) Except as provided under the following paragraph (2), if any 
marine mammals are visually detected within the designated 3.5 nm (6.5 
km) Safety Range surrounding the USS MESA VERDE, detonation must be 
delayed until the marine mammals are positively resighted outside the 
Safety Range either due to the animal(s) swimming out of the Safety 
Range or due to the Safety Range moving beyond the mammal's last 
verified location.
    (2) If a North Atlantic right whale or other marine mammal listed 
under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is seen within the Safety Range, 
detonation must not occur until the animal is positively resighted 
outside the Safety Range and at least one additional aerial monitoring 
of the Safety Range shows that no other right whales or other ESA-listed 
marine mammals are present;
    (3) If the sea state exceeds 3 on the Beaufort scale (i.e., 
whitecaps on 33 to 50 percent of surface; 2 ft (0.6 m) to 3 ft (0.9 m) 
waves), the visibility is equal to

[[Page 77]]

or less than 3 nm (5.6 km), or the aircraft ceiling (i.e., vertical 
visibility) is equal to or less than 1,000 ft (305 m), detonation must 
not occur until conditions improve sufficiently for aerial surveillance 
to be undertaken.
    (4) A detonation must not be conducted earlier than 3 hours after 
sunrise or later than 3 hours prior to sunset to ensure adequate 
daylight for conducting the pre-detonation and post-detonation 
monitoring requirements in Sec. 216.165;
    (5) If post-detonation surveys determine that an injury or lethal 
take of a marine mammal has occurred,
    (i) the Director, Office of Protected Resources, National Marine 
Fisheries Service must be notified within 24 hours of the taking 
determination,
    (ii) the FSST procedures and monitoring methods must be reviewed in 
coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service, and
    (iii) appropriate changes to avoid future injury or mortality must 
be made prior to conducting the next detonation.


<R05>
Sec. 216.164  Prohibitions.

    No person in connection with the activities described in Sec. 
216.161(a) shall:
    (a) Take any marine mammal not specified in Sec. 216.161(b);
    (b) Take any marine mammal specified in Sec. 216.161(b) other than 
by incidental, unintentional Level A or Level B harassment or mortality;
    (c) Take a marine mammal specified in Sec. 216.161(b) if such 
taking results in more than a negligible impact on the species or stocks 
or marine mammals;
    (d) Violate, or failure to comply with, the requirements of a Letter 
of Authorization issued under Sec. 216.106.


<R05>
Sec. 216.165  Requirements for monitoring and reporting.

    (a) The holder of the Letter of Authorization is required to 
cooperate with the National Marine Fisheries Service and any other 
Federal, or state or local agency with regulatory authority for 
monitoring the impacts of the activity on marine mammals. The holder 
must notify the Director, Office of Protected Resources, National Marine 
Fisheries Service at least 2 weeks prior to activities involving the 
detonation of explosives in order to satisfy paragraph (f) of this 
section.
    (b) The holder of the Letter of Authorization must designate at 
least 6 experienced on-site marine mammal observers (MMOs) onboard the 
USS MESA VERDE, 2 experienced MMOs onboard the survey aircraft and 2 
experienced MMOs onboard the Navy support vessel each of whom has been 
approved in advance by NMFS, to monitor the Safety Range for presence of 
marine mammals and to record the effects of explosives detonation on 
marine mammals that inhabit the Navy's Jacksonville/Charleston Operating 
Area offshore of Mayport, Florida.
    (c)(1) Prior to each detonation for the FSST, an area will be 
located which has been determined by an aerial survey to contain the 
lowest marine mammal abundance relative to other areas within the area 
off Mayport, FL.
    (2) The test area must be monitored by aerial and shipboard 
monitoring for the following periods of time:
    (i) 48-72 hours prior to a scheduled detonation (aircraft only),
    (ii) on the day of detonation,
    (iii) immediately after each detonation and continuing for at least 
3 hours subsequent to each detonation (or until sighting conditions 
become unsuitable for visual observations),
    (iv) for at least 2 days after each detonation, unless weather and/
or sea conditions preclude surveillance, in which case post-test survey 
dates must be extended, and
    (v) for a period of 7 days after the last detonation for a minimum 
of 3 hours per day at the detonation site and down-current from the 
site.
    (3) Monitoring shall include, but is not limited to, aerial and 
vessel surveillance sufficient to ensure that no marine mammals are 
within the designated Safety Range prior to or at the time of 
detonation.
    (d) Under the direction of an attending U.S.-licensed veterinarian 
(an attending U.S. licensed veterinarian is one who has graduated from a 
veterinary school accredited by the American Veterinary Medical 
Association Council on Education, has a certificate by the American 
Veterinary Graduates Association's Education Commission for Foreign 
Veterinary Graduates, or

[[Page 78]]

has received equivalent formal education, as determined by the NMFS 
Assistant Administrator), an examination and recovery of any dead or 
injured marine mammals will be conducted in accordance with protocols 
and best practices of the NOAA Health and Stranding Response Program. 
Necropsies will be performed and tissue samples taken from any dead 
animals. After completion of the necropsy, animals not retained for 
shoreside examination will be tagged and returned to the sea.
    (e) Activities related to the monitoring described in paragraphs (c) 
and (d) of this section, including the retention of marine mammals, may 
be conducted without a separate scientific research permit. The use of 
retained marine mammals for scientific research other than shoreside 
examination must be authorized pursuant to Subpart D of this part.
    (f) Subject to relevant Navy regulations, the National Marine 
Fisheries Service at its discretion may place an observer on any ship or 
aircraft involved in marine mammal monitoring either prior to, during, 
or after explosives detonation.
    (g) A final report must be submitted to the Director, Office of 
Protected Resources, no later than 120 days after completion of the USS 
MESA VERDE (LPD 19) shock trial. This report must contain the following 
information:
    (1) Date and time of all detonations conducted under the Letter of 
Authorization.
    (2) A detailed description of all pre-detonation and post-detonation 
activities related to mitigating and monitoring the effects of 
explosives detonation on marine mammals.
    (3) Results of the monitoring program, including numbers by species/
stock of any marine mammals noted injured or killed as a result of the 
detonation and an estimate of the number, by species, of marine mammals 
in the Safety Range at the time of detonation based on post-test aerial 
monitoring and current density estimates.
    (4) Results of coordination with coastal marine mammal/sea turtle 
stranding networks.

<R05>
Sec. 216.174  Mitigation.

    (a) When conducting training activities identified in Sec. 
216.170(c), the mitigation measures contained in the Letter of 
Authorization issued under Sec. Sec. 216.106 of this chapter and 
216.177 must be implemented. These mitigation measures include, but are 
not limited to:
    (1) Mitigation Measures for ASW training: (i) All lookouts onboard 
platforms involved in ASW training events shall review the NMFS-approved 
Marine Species Awareness Training (MSAT) material prior to use of mid-
frequency active sonar.
    (ii) All Commanding Officers, Executive Officers, and officers 
standing watch on the Bridge shall have reviewed the MSAT material prior 
to a training event employing the use of mid-frequency active sonar.
    (iii) Navy lookouts shall undertake extensive training in order to 
qualify as a watchstander in accordance with the Lookout Training 
Handbook (NAVEDTRA, 12968-D).
    (iv) Lookout training shall include on-the-job instruction under the 
supervision of a qualified, experienced watchstander. Following 
successful completion of this supervised training period, Lookouts shall 
complete the Personal Qualification Standard program, certifying that 
they have demonstrated the necessary skills (such as detection and 
reporting of partially submerged objects).
    (v) Lookouts shall be trained in the most effective means to ensure 
quick and effective communication within the command structure in order 
to facilitate implementation of mitigation measures if marine species 
are spotted.
    (vi) On the bridge of surface ships, there shall be at least three 
people on watch whose duties include observing the water surface around 
the vessel.
    (vii) All surface ships participating in ASW exercises shall, in 
addition to the three personnel on watch noted previously, have at all 
times during the exercise at least two additional personnel on watch as 
lookouts.
    (viii) Personnel on lookout and officers on watch on the bridge 
shall have at least one set of binoculars available for each person to 
aid in the detection of marine mammals.
    (ix) On surface vessels equipped with mid-frequency active sonar, 
pedestal mounted ``Big Eye'' (20x110) binoculars shall be present and in 
good working order.
    (x) Personnel on lookout shall employ visual search procedures 
employing a scanning methodology in accordance with the Lookout Training 
Handbook (NAVEDTRA 12968-D).
    (xi) After sunset and prior to sunrise, lookouts shall employ Night 
Lookouts Techniques in accordance with the Lookout Training Handbook.
    (xii) Personnel on lookout shall be responsible for reporting all 
objects or anomalies sighted in the water (regardless of the distance 
from the vessel) to the Officer of the Deck.
    (xiii) CPF shall distribute the final mitigation measures contained 
in the LOA and BO to the Fleet.
    (xiv) Commanding Officers shall make use of marine species detection

[[Page 82]]

cues and information to limit interaction with marine species to the 
maximum extent possible consistent with safety of the ship.
    (xv) All personnel engaged in passive acoustic sonar operation 
(including aircraft, surface ships, or submarines) shall monitor for 
marine mammal vocalizations and report the detection of any marine 
mammal to the appropriate watch station for dissemination and 
appropriate action.
    (xvi) During mid-frequency active sonar training activities, 
personnel shall utilize all available sensor and optical systems (such 
as Night Vision Goggles) to aid in the detection of marine mammals.
    (xvii) Navy aircraft participating in exercises at sea shall conduct 
and maintain, when operationally feasible and safe, surveillance for 
marine mammals as long as it does not violate safety constraints or 
interfere with the accomplishment of primary operational duties.
    (xviii) Aircraft with deployed sonobuoys shall use only the passive 
capability of sonobuoys when marine mammals are detected within 200 
yards (182 m) of the sonobuoy.
    (xix) Marine mammal detections shall be reported immediately to 
assigned Aircraft Control Unit for further dissemination to ships in the 
vicinity of the marine species as appropriate where it is reasonable to 
conclude that the course of the ship will likely result in a closing of 
the distance to the detected marine mammal.
    (xx) Safety Zones--When marine mammals are detected by any means 
(aircraft, shipboard lookout, or acoustically) the Navy shall ensure 
that MFAS transmission levels are limited to at least 6 dB below normal 
operating levels if any detected marine mammals are within 1000 yards 
(914 m) of the sonar dome (the bow).
    (A) Ships and submarines shall continue to limit maximum MFAS 
transmission levels by this 6-dB factor until the marine mammal has been 
seen to leave the area, has not been detected for 30 minutes, or the 
vessel has transited more than 2,000 yards (1828 m) beyond the location 
of the last detection.
    (B) The Navy shall ensure that MFAS transmissions will be limited to 
at least 10 dB below the equipment's normal operating level if any 
detected animals are within 500 yards (457 m) of the sonar dome. Ships 
and submarines shall continue to limit maximum ping levels by this 10-dB 
factor until the marine mammal has been seen to leave the area, has not 
been detected for 30 minutes, or the vessel has transited more than 2000 
yards (1828 m) beyond the location of the last detection.
    (C) The Navy shall ensure that MFAS transmissions are ceased if any 
detected marine mammals are within 200 yards of the sonar dome. MFAS 
transmissions will not resume until the marine mammal has been seen to 
leave the area, has not been detected for 30 minutes, or the vessel has 
transited more than 2,000 yards beyond the location of the last 
detection.
    (D) Special conditions applicable for dolphins and porpoises only: 
If, after conducting an initial maneuver to avoid close quarters with 
dolphins or porpoises, the Officer of the Deck concludes that dolphins 
or porpoises are deliberately closing to ride the vessel's bow wave, no 
further mitigation actions are necessary while the dolphins or porpoises 
continue to exhibit bow wave riding behavior.
    (E) If the need for power-down should arise as detailed in ``Safety 
Zones'' in paragraph (a)(1)(xx) of this section, Navy shall follow the 
requirements as though they were operating at 235 dB--the normal 
operating level (i.e., the first power-down will be to 229 dB, 
regardless of at what level above 235 dB sonar was being operated).
    (xxi) Prior to start up or restart of active sonar, operators shall 
check that the Safety Zone radius around the sound source is clear of 
marine mammals.
    (xxii) Sonar levels (generally)--Navy shall operate sonar at the 
lowest practicable level, not to exceed 235 dB, except as required to 
meet tactical training objectives.
    (xxiii) Helicopters shall observe/survey the vicinity of an ASW 
Exercise for 10 minutes before the first deployment of active (dipping) 
sonar in the water.

[[Page 83]]

    (xxiv) Helicopters shall not dip their sonar within 200 yards (183 
m) of a marine mammal and shall cease pinging if a marine mammal closes 
within 200 yards (183 m) after pinging has begun.
    (xxv) Submarine sonar operators shall review detection indicators of 
close-aboard marine mammals prior to the commencement of ASW training 
activities involving active mid-frequency sonar.
    (xxvi) Night vision goggles shall be available to all ships and air 
crews, for use as appropriate.
    (xxvii) Humpback Whale Cautionary Area: An area extending 5km (2.7 
nm) from a line drawn from Kaunakakai on the island of Molokai to Kaena 
Point on the Island of Lanai; and an area extending 5 km (2.7 nm) from a 
line drawn from Kaunolu on the Island of Lanai to the most Northeastern 
point on the Island of Kahoolawe; and within a line drawn from Kanapou 
Bay on the Island of Kahoolawe to Kanahena Point on the Island of Maui 
and a line drawn from Cape Halawa on the Island of Molokai to Lipo Point 
on the Island of Maui, excluding the existing submarine operating area.
    (A) Should national security needs require MFAS training and testing 
in the cautionary area between 15 December and 15 April, it must be 
personally authorized by the Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet based on his 
determination that training and testing in that specific area is 
required for national security purposes. This authorization shall be 
documented by the CPF in advance of transiting and training in the 
cautionary area, and the determination shall be based on the unique 
characteristics of the area from a military readiness perspective, 
taking into account the importance of the area for humpback whales and 
the need to minimize adverse impacts on humpback whales from MFAS 
whenever practicable. Further, Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet will 
provide specific direction on required mitigation measures prior to 
operational units transiting to and training in the cautionary area.
    (B) The Navy shall provide advance notification to NMFS of any such 
activities (listed in paragraph (a)(1)(xxvii)(A)of this section).
    (C) The Navy shall include in its periodic reports for compliance 
with the MMPA whether or not activities occurred in the Humpback Whale 
Cautionary Area and any observed effects on humpback whales due to the 
conduct of these activities.
    (xxviii) The Navy shall abide by the letter of the ``Stranding 
Response Plan for Major Navy Training Exercises in the HRC'' to include 
the following measures:
    (A) Shutdown Procedures--When an Uncommon Stranding Event (USE--
defined in Sec. 216.171(b)) occurs during a Major Training Exercise 
(MTE, including RIMPAC, USWEX, or Multi-Strike Group Exercise) in the 
HRC, the Navy shall implement the procedures described below.
    (1) The Navy shall implement a Shutdown (as defined Sec. 
216.171(b)) when advised by a NMFS Office of Protected Resources 
Headquarters Senior Official designated in the HRC Stranding 
Communication Protocol that a USE involving live animals has been 
identified and that at least one live animal is located in the water. 
NMFS and Navy will maintain a dialogue, as needed, regarding the 
identification of the USE and the potential need to implement shutdown 
procedures.
    (2) Any shutdown in a given area shall remain in effect in that area 
until NMFS advises the Navy that the subject(s) of the USE at that area 
die or are euthanized, or that all live animals involved in the USE at 
that area have left the area (either of their own volition or herded).
    (3) If the Navy finds an injured or dead animal floating at sea 
during an MTE, the Navy shall notify NMFS immediately or as soon as 
operational security considerations allow. The Navy shall provide NMFS 
with species or description of the animal(s), the condition of the 
animal(s) including carcass condition if the animal(s) is/are dead), 
location, time of first discovery, observed behavior (if alive), and 
photo or video (if available). Based on the information provided, NMFS 
will determine if, and advise the Navy whether a modified shutdown is 
appropriate on a case-by-case basis.

[[Page 84]]

    (4) In the event, following a USE, that qualified individuals are 
attempting to herd animals back out to the open ocean and animals are 
not willing to leave, or animals are seen repeatedly heading for the 
open ocean but turning back to shore, NMFS and the Navy shall coordinate 
(including an investigation of other potential anthropogenic stressors 
in the area) to determine if the proximity of MFAS training activities 
or explosive detonations, though farther than 14 nm from the distressed 
animal(s), is likely contributing to the animals' refusal to return to 
the open water. If so, NMFS and the Navy will further coordinate to 
determine what measures are necessary to improve the probability that 
the animals will return to open water and implement those measures as 
appropriate.
    (B) Within 72 hours of NMFS notifying the Navy of the presence of a 
USE, the Navy shall provide available information to NMFS (per the HRC 
Communication Protocol) regarding the location, number and types of 
acoustic/explosive sources, direction and speed of units using MFAS, and 
marine mammal sightings information associated with training activities 
occurring within 80 nm (148 km) and 72 hours prior to the USE event. 
Information not initially available regarding the 80 nm (148 km), 72 
hour period prior to the event will be provided as soon as it becomes 
available. The Navy will provide NMFS investigative teams with 
additional relevant unclassified information as requested, if available.
    (C) Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)--The Navy and NMFS shall develop a 
MOA, or other mechanism consistent with federal fiscal law requirements 
(and all other applicable laws), that will establish a framework whereby 
the Navy can (and provide the Navy examples of how they can best) assist 
NMFS with stranding investigations in certain circumstances.
    (xxix) While in transit, naval vessels shall be alert at all times, 
use extreme caution, and proceed at a ``safe speed'' so that the vessel 
can take proper and effective action to avoid a collision with any 
marine animal and can be stopped within a distance appropriate to the 
prevailing circumstances and conditions.
    (xxx) When marine mammals have been sighted in the area, Navy 
vessels shall increase vigilance and take reasonable and practicable 
actions to avoid collisions and activities that might result in close 
interaction of naval assets and marine mammals. Actions may include 
changing speed and/or direction and are dictated by environmental and 
other conditions (e.g., safety, weather).
    (2) Mitigation for IEER--The following are protective measures for 
use with Extended Echo Ranging/Improved Extended Echo Ranging (EER/IEER) 
given an explosive source generates the acoustic wave used in this 
sonobuoy.
    (i) Crews shall conduct aerial visual reconnaissance of the drop 
area prior to laying their intended sonobuoy pattern. This search should 
be conducted below 500 yards (457 m) at a slow speed, if operationally 
feasible and weather conditions permit. In dual aircraft training 
activities, crews are allowed to conduct coordinated area clearances.
    (ii) Crews shall conduct a minimum of 30 minutes of visual and 
acoustic monitoring of the search area prior to commanding the first 
post detonation. This 30-minute observation period may include pattern 
deployment time.
    (iii) For any part of the briefed pattern where a post (source/
receiver sonobuoy pair) will be deployed within 1,000 yards (914 m) of 
observed marine mammal activity, the Navy shall deploy the receiver ONLY 
and monitor while conducting a visual search. When marine mammals are no 
longer detected within 1,000 yards (914 m) of the intended post 
position, co-locate the explosive source sonobuoy (AN/SSQ-110A) (source) 
with the receiver.
    (iv) When able, crews will conduct continuous visual and aural 
monitoring of marine mammal activity. This is to include monitoring of 
own-aircraft sensors from first sensor placement to checking off station 
and out of communication range of these sensors.
    (v) Aural Detection: If the presence of marine mammals is detected 
aurally, then that shall cue the aircrew to increase the diligence of 
their visual surveillance. Subsequently, if no marine mammals are 
visually detected, then

[[Page 85]]

the crew may continue multi-static active search.
    (vi) Visual Detection:
    (A) If marine mammals are visually detected within 1,000 yards (914 
m) of the explosive source sonobuoy (AN/SSQ-110A) intended for use, then 
that payload shall not be detonated. Aircrews may utilize this post once 
the marine mammals have not been re-sighted for 30 minutes, or are 
observed to have moved outside the 1,000 yards (914 m) safety buffer.
    (B) Aircrews may shift their multi-static active search to another 
post, where marine mammals are outside the 1,000 yards (914 m) safety 
buffer.
    (vii) Aircrews shall make every attempt to manually detonate the 
unexploded charges at each post in the pattern prior to departing the 
operations area by using the ``Payload 1 Release'' command followed by 
the ``Payload 2 Release'' command. Aircrews shall refrain from using the 
``Scuttle'' command when two payloads remain at a given post. Aircrews 
will ensure that a 1,000 yard (914 m) safety buffer, visually clear of 
marine mammals, is maintained around each post as is done during active 
search operations.
    (viii) Aircrews shall only leave posts with unexploded charges in 
the event of a sonobuoy malfunction, an aircraft system malfunction, or 
when an aircraft must immediately depart the area due to issues such as 
fuel constraints, inclement weather, and in-flight emergencies. In these 
cases, the sonobuoy will self-scuttle using the secondary or tertiary 
method.
    (ix) The navy shall ensure all payloads are accounted for. Explosive 
source sonobuoys (AN/SSQ-110A) that cannot be scuttled shall be reported 
as unexploded ordnance via voice communications while airborne, then 
upon landing via naval message.
    (x) Marine mammal monitoring shall continue until out of own-
aircraft sensor range.
    (3) Mitigation for Demolitions (DEMOs) and Mine Countermeasure (MCM) 
Training (Up to 20 lb).
    (i) Exclusion Zones--Explosive charges shall not be detonated if a 
marine mammal is detected within 700 yards (640 m) of the detonation 
site.
    (ii) Pre-Exercise Surveys--For MCM training activities, the Navy 
shall conduct a pre-exercise survey within 30 minutes prior to the 
commencement of the scheduled explosive event. The survey may be 
conducted from the surface, by divers, and/or from the air. If a marine 
mammal is detected within the survey area, the exercise shall be 
suspended until the animal voluntarily leaves the area.
    (iii) Post-Exercise Surveys--Surveys within the same radius shall 
also be conducted within 30 minutes after the completion of the 
explosive event.
    (iv) Reporting--Any evidence of a marine mammal that may have been 
injured or killed by the action shall be reported immediately to NMFS.
    (v) Mine Laying Training--Though mine laying training operations 
involve aerial drops of inert training shapes on floating targets, 
measures 1, 2, and 3 for Demolitions and Mine countermeasures will apply 
to mine laying training. To the maximum extent feasible, the Navy shall 
retrieve inert mine shapes dropped during Mine Laying Training.
    (4) Mitigation for SINKEX, GUNEX, MISSILEX, and BOMBEX. (i) All 
weapons firing shall be conducted during the period 1 hour after 
official sunrise to 30 minutes before official sunset.
    (ii) Extensive range clearance operations shall be conducted in the 
hours prior to commencement of the exercise.
    (iii) An exclusion zone with a radius of 1.0 nm (1.85 km) shall be 
established around each target. An additional buffer of 0.5 nm (0.93 km) 
shall be added to account for errors, target drift, and animal 
movements. Additionally, a safety zone, which extends out an additional 
0.5 nm (0.93 km), shall be surveyed. Together, the zones extend out 2 nm 
(3.7 km) from the target.
    (iv) A series of surveillance over-flights shall be conducted within 
the exclusion and the safety zones, prior to and during the exercise, 
when feasible. Survey protocol would be as follows:
    (A) Overflights within the exclusion zone shall be conducted in a 
manner that optimizes the surface area of the water observed. This may 
be accomplished through the use of the Navy's

[[Page 86]]

Search and Rescue (SAR) Tactical Aid (TACAID).
    (B) All visual surveillance activities shall be conducted by Navy 
personnel trained in visual surveillance. At least one member of the 
mitigation team shall have completed the Navy's marine mammal training 
program for lookouts.
    (C) In addition to the overflights, the exclusion zone shall be 
monitored by passive acoustic means, when assets are available. This 
passive acoustic monitoring shall be maintained throughout the exercise. 
Potential assets include sonobuoys, which can be utilized to detect any 
vocalizing marine mammals in the vicinity of the exercise. The sonobuoys 
shall be re-seeded as necessary throughout the exercise. Additionally, 
passive sonar onboard submarines may be utilized to detect any 
vocalizing marine mammals in the area. The Officer Conducting the 
Exercise (OCE) shall be informed of any aural detection of marine 
mammals and would include this information in the determination of when 
it is safe to commence the exercise.
    (D) On each day of the exercise, aerial surveillance of the 
exclusion and safety zones shall commence two hours prior to the first 
firing.
    (E) The results of all visual, aerial, and acoustic searches shall 
be reported immediately to the OCE. No weapons launches or firing would 
commence until the OCE declares the safety and exclusion zones free of 
marine mammals.
    (F) If a marine mammal observed within the exclusion zone is diving, 
firing shall be delayed until the animal is re-sighted outside the 
exclusion zone, or 30 minutes has elapsed.
    (G) During breaks in the exercise of 30 minutes or more, the 
exclusion zone shall again be surveyed for any marine mammals. If marine 
mammals are sighted within the exclusion zone, the OCE would be 
notified, and the procedure described in paragraph (a)(4)(iv)(F) of this 
section would be followed.
    (H) Upon sinking of the vessel, a final surveillance of the 
exclusion zone shall be monitored for two hours, or until sunset, to 
verify that no marine mammals were harmed.
    (v) Aerial surveillance would be conducted using helicopters or 
other aircraft based on necessity and availability. These aircraft shall 
be capable of (and shall, to the extent practicable) flying at the slow 
safe speeds necessary to enable viewing of marine mammals with 
unobstructed, or minimally obstructed, downward and outward visibility. 
The Navy may cancel the exclusion and safety zone surveys in the event 
that a mechanical problem, emergency search and rescue, or other similar 
and unexpected event preempts the use of one of the aircraft onsite for 
the exercise.
    (vi) Where practicable, the Navy shall conduct the exercise in sea 
states that are ideal for marine mammal sighting, i.e., Beaufort Sea 
State 3 or less. In the event of a Beaufort Sea State of 4 or above, the 
Navy shall utilize additional aircraft (conducting tight search 
patterns), if available, to increase survey efforts within the zones.
    (vii) The exercise shall not be conducted unless the exclusion zone 
can be adequately monitored visually.
    (viii) In the unlikely event that any marine mammals are observed to 
be harmed in the area, a detailed description of the animal shall be 
documented, the location noted, and if possible, photos taken. This 
information would be provided to NMFS.
    (b) [Reserved]

are detonated below the water-mud interface, either inside or outside a 
pipe, other structure or cable.
    (2) Above-mud-line or AML means that the explosives are detonated in 
the water column above the water-mud interface, either inside or outside 
a pipe, other structure or cable.
    (3) Multiple charge detonation means any explosive configuration 
where more than one charge is required in a single detonation event.
    (4) Scenario means an alpha-numeric designation provided to describe 
charge size, activity location, and target design employed in order to 
determine the appropriate marine mammal mitigation/monitoring measures.
    (b) Terms (1) Impact zone (required for all scenarios) means the 
area around a decommissioning target measured by the horizontal radius, 
in which a marine mammal could be affected by the pressure or acoustic 
energy released during the detonation of an explosive-severance charge.
    (2) Predetonation survey (required for all scenarios) means any 
marine mammal monitoring survey (e.g., surface, aerial, or acoustic) 
conducted prior to the detonation of any explosive severance tool.
    (3) Postdetonation survey (required for all scenarios) means any 
marine mammal monitoring survey (e.g., surface, aerial, or post-post-
detonation aerial) conducted after the detonation event occurs.
    (4) Waiting period (required for all scenarios) means the amount of 
time detonation operations must hold before the requisite monitoring 
survey(s) can be repeated.

severance scenarios. To determine the appropriate

[[Page 93]]

marine mammal mitigation and monitoring requirements in Sec. Sec. 
216.218 and 216.219, holders of Letters of Authorization for activities 
described in Sec. 216.211(a) of this subpart must determine, from Table 
1 in Sec. 216.217(b)(1), the appropriate explosive severance 
mitigation/monitoring scenario to follow for the blasting category, 
species-delineation zone, and charge configuration for their activity.
    (2) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 216.216  Mitigation.

    (a) The activity identified in Sec. 216.211(a) must be conducted in 
a manner that minimizes, to the greatest extent practicable, adverse 
impacts on marine mammals and their habitats. When conducting operations 
identified in Sec. 216.211(a), all mitigation measures contained in 
this subpart and in the Letter of Authorization issued pursuant to 
Sec. Sec. 216.106 and 216.218 must be implemented. When using 
explosives, the following mitigation measures must be carried out:
    (1)(i) If marine mammals are observed within (or about to enter) the 
marine mammal impact zone identified in Table 1 in Sec. 216.217(b)(1) 
column 5 for the relevant charge range and configuration (i.e., BML or 
AML) for the activity, detonation must be delayed until the marine 
mammal(s) are outside that zone;
    (ii) Pre-detonation surveys shall not begin prior to sunrise and 
detonations shall not occur if the post-detonation survey cannot be 
concluded prior to sunset;
    (iii) Whenever weather or sea conditions preclude adequate aerial, 
shipboard or subsurface marine mammal monitoring as determined by the 
trained observer, detonations must be delayed until conditions improve 
sufficiently for marine mammal monitoring to be undertaken or resumed;
    (iv) Whenever the weather or sea conditions prevent implementation 
of the aerial survey monitoring required under Sec. 216.217(c)(2), the 
aerial survey must be repeated prior to detonation of charges; and
    (v) Multiple charge detonations must be staggered at an interval of 
0.9 sec (900 msec) between blasts.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) If a marine mammal is found seriously injured, or dead, the 
explosive severance activity will immediately cease and the holder of 
the Letter of Authorization, designee or the designated lead observer 
will contact the Minerals Management Service and the Regional 
Administrator, National Marine Fisheries Service' Southeast Regional 
Office, or designee at the earliest opportunity. Procedures and 
monitoring methods will be reviewed and, if necessary, appropriate 
changes made to the mitigation and monitoring measures prior to 
conducting the next detonation to avoid future injury or mortality 
takings.
    (c) Any mitigation measures proposed to be contained in a Letter of 
Authorization that are not specified in this subpart, or not considered 
an emergency requirement under Sec. 216.219(d), will first be subject 
to notice and comment through publication in the Federal Register, as 
provided in Sec. 216.219(c).


<R05>
Sec. 216.217  Requirements for monitoring and reporting.

    (a) Holders of Letters of Authorization issued for activities 
described in Sec. 216.211(a) are required to cooperate with the 
National Marine Fisheries Service, and any other Federal, state or local 
agency with regulatory authority over the offshore oil-and-gas 
activities for the purpose of monitoring the impacts of the activity on 
marine mammals.
    (b)(1) Table 1 summarizes the required mitigation and monitoring 
survey modes, duration and zones for all blasting scenarios of marine 
mammal impact zones for implementation of surface and aerial monitoring 
requirements depending upon charge weight and severance scenario.
    (2) Holders of Letters of Authorization must fully comply with the 
relevant mitigation and monitoring program for the explosive-severance 
activity described in subparagraph (c) of this paragraph that 
corresponds to the holder of the Letter of Authorization's blast 
scenario shown in Table 1.

\1\ Severance of subsea structures that do not penetrate the sea surface will follow the mitigation scenario for above mudline (AML) detonations even if
  charges are placed below mudline.


[[Page 95]]

    (c) Holders of Letters of Authorization must ensure that the 
following monitoring programs are conducted as appropriate for the 
required monitoring scenario.
    (1) Surface monitoring survey. A surface monitoring survey must be 
conducted for the length of time that corresponds to the relevant 
explosive severance scenario. Surface monitoring surveys are to be 
conducted from the highest vantage point and/or other location(s) that 
provide the best, clear view of the entire impact zone. These vantage 
points may be on the structure being removed or proximal surface vessels 
(i.e., crewboats, derrick barges, etc.). Surface surveys are restricted 
to daylight hours only, and the monitoring will cease if the designated 
lead observer determines that weather or marine conditions are not 
adequate for visual observations.
    (2) Aerial monitoring survey. Aerial surveys are required for all 
explosive severance scenarios except monitoring scenarios A1-A4. Aerial 
monitoring surveys are to be conducted from helicopters running standard 
low-altitude search patterns over the extent of the impact zone that 
corresponds to the appropriate explosive severance scenario. Aerial 
surveys will be restricted to daylight hours only (defined as ``legal 
sunrise'' to ``legal sunset''), and cannot begin until the requisite 
surface monitoring survey has been completed. Aerial surveys will cease 
if the designated lead observer determines that weather or marine 
conditions are not adequate for visual observations, or when the pilot/
removal supervisor determines that helicopter operations must be 
suspended.
    (3) Acoustic monitoring survey.
    (i) Acoustic monitoring surveys are required to be conducted on all 
Standard, Large, and Specialty blasting scenarios conducted at slope 
(<ls-thn-eq>200 m (656 ft)) locations (i.e., scenarios C2, C4, D2, D4, 
E2, and E4).
    (ii) Persons conducting acoustic surveys will be required to comply 
with NMFS-approved passive acoustic monitoring protocols and use 
approved devices and technicians.
    (iii) Acoustic surveys will be run concurrent with requisite pre-
detonation surveys, beginning with the surface observations and 
concluding at the finish of the aerial surveys when the detonation(s) is 
allowed to proceed.
    (4) Post-detonation surface monitoring survey. A 30-minute post-
detonation surface survey must be conducted by the trained company 
observer for scenarios A1 - A4 immediately upon conclusion of the 
detonation.
    (5) Post-detonation aerial monitoring survey. For scenarios B1-D4, a 
30-minute aerial survey must be conducted immediately upon conclusion of 
the detonation. For scenarios E1-E4, a 45-minute aerial survey must be 
conducted immediately upon conclusion of the detonation.
    (6) Post-post-detonation aerial monitoring survey. Post-post-
detonation aerial monitoring surveys must be conducted for scenarios C4, 
D2, D4, E2 and E4 within 2-7 days after detonation activities conclude, 
by either helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft. Observations are to start 
at the removal site and proceed leeward and outward of wind and current 
movement. Any distressed, shocked, injured or dead marine mammals will 
be noted in the survey report, and if possible, tracked and collected 
after notifying the National Marine Fisheries Service within the time 
requirements stated in Sec. 216.217(f).
    (7) If unforeseen conditions or events occur during an explosive 
severance operation that may necessitate additional monitoring not 
specified in this paragraph, the designated NMFS lead observer will 
contact the appropriate National Marine Fisheries Service and Minerals 
Management Service personnel as detailed in the Letter of Authorization 
for additional guidance.
    (d) Holders of Letters of Authorization must conduct all monitoring 
and research required under the Letter of Authorization. Any monitoring 
or research measures proposed to be contained in a Letter of 
Authorization that are not specified in this subpart or not considered 
an emergency requirement under Sec. 216.218(d), will first be subject 
to public notice and comment through publication in the Federal 
Register, as provided by Sec. 216.219(c).
    (e) Reporting (1) A report summarizing the results of structure 
removal

[[Page 96]]

activities, mitigation measures, monitoring efforts, and other 
information as required by a Letter of Authorization, must be submitted 
to the Director, Office of Protected Resources, within 30 days of 
completion of the removal activity.
    (2) The National Marine Fisheries Service will accept the NMFS 
observer report as the activity report required by subparagraph (1) of 
this paragraph if all requirements for reporting contained in the Letter 
of Authorization are provided to the NMFS observer before the NMFS 
observer's report is submitted to the PROP Manager.
    (3) If a marine mammal is found shocked, injured, or dead, the 
Holder of the Letter of Authorization, or designee, must report the 
incident to the National Marine Fisheries Service Southeast Regional 
Office, at the earliest opportunity.


<R05>
Sec. 216.218  Letters of Authorization.

    (a) To incidentally take marine mammal species listed in Sec. 
216.211(b) pursuant to these regulations, each company or contractor 
responsible for the removal of the structure or an industry-related 
seafloor obstruction in the area specified in Sec. 216.211(a) must 
apply for and obtain either a Letter of Authorization in accordance with 
Sec. 216.106 or a renewal under Sec. 216.219(a).
    (b) An application for a Letter of Authorization must be submitted 
to the National Marine Fisheries Service at least 30 days before the 
explosive removal activity is scheduled to begin.
    (c) Issuance of a Letter of Authorization and renewal of a Letter of 
Authorization under Sec. 216.219(a) will be based on a determination by 
the National Marine Fisheries Service that the number of each species or 
stock of cetaceans taken annually by the activity will be small and that 
the total taking over the 5-year period will have a negligible impact on 
the species or stock of affected marine mammal(s).
    (d) A Letter of Authorization may be renewed annually, subject to 
conditions in Sec. 216.219(a).
    (e) A Letter of Authorization for activities in this subpart will 
not be valid after the effective period of this subpart.
    (f) A copy of the Letter of Authorization must be in the possession 
of the persons conducting the activity specified in Sec. 216.211(a) 
that may involve incidental takings of marine mammals.
    (g) Notice of issuance or denial of a Letter of Authorization will 
be published in the Federal Register within 30 days of a determination.


<R05>
Sec. 216.219  Renewal and modifications of Letters of Authorization.

    (a) A Letter of Authorization issued for the activity identified in 
Sec. 216.211(a) will be renewed annually upon:
    (1) Receipt of an application for renewal of a Letter of 
Authorization under Sec. 216.218.
    (2) Timely receipt of the report(s) required under Sec. 216.217(f), 
which have been reviewed by the Assistant Administrator and determined 
to be acceptable; and
    (3) A determination that the required mitigation, monitoring and 
reporting measures have been undertaken.
    (b) Notice of issuance of a renewal of the Letter of Authorization 
will be published in the Federal Register within 30 days of issuance.
    (c) In addition to complying with the provisions of Sec. 216.106, 
except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, no substantive 
modification, including a request for a variance in the mitigation or 
monitoring requirements in this subpart or a withdrawal or suspension of 
the Letter of Authorization issued pursuant to Sec. 216.106 and subject 
to the provisions of this subpart, shall be made until after notice and 
an opportunity for public comment. For purposes of this paragraph, 
renewal of a Letter of Authorization under Sec. 216.219, without 
modification other than an effective date change, is not considered a 
substantive modification.
    (d) If the Assistant Administrator determines that an emergency 
exists that poses a significant risk to the well-being of the species or 
stocks of marine mammals specified in Sec. 216.211(b), a Letter of 
Authorization issued pursuant to Sec. Sec. 216.106 and 216.118, or 
renewed pursuant to this paragraph may be modified without prior notice 
and opportunity for public comment. A notice will be published in the 
Federal Register subsequent to the action.

    (iii) A group of 2 or more cetaceans of any species exhibiting 
indicators of distress as defined in Sec. 216.241(b)(3).
    (2) Shutdown--The cessation of MFAS/HFAS operation or detonation of 
explosives within 14 nm nm (Atlantic Ocean) or 17 nm (Gulf of Mexico) of 
any live, in the water, animal involved in a USE.

<R05>
Sec. 216.243  Prohibitions.

    Notwithstanding takings contemplated in Sec. 218.92 and authorized 
by a Letter of Authorization issued under Sec. Sec. 216.106 and 
216.247, no person in connection with the activities described in Sec. 
216.240 may:
    (a) Take any marine mammal not specified in Sec. 216.242(c);
    (b) Take any marine mammal specified in Sec. 216.242(c) other than 
by incidental take as specified in Sec. 216.242(c)(1) and (2);
    (c) Take a marine mammal specified in Sec. 216.242(c) if such 
taking results in more than a negligible impact on the species or stocks 
of such marine mammal; or
    (d) Violate, or fail to comply with, the terms, conditions, and 
requirements of these regulations or a Letter of Authorization issued 
under Sec. Sec. 216.106 and 216.247.


<R05>
Sec. 216.244  Mitigation.

    (a) When conducting training activities identified in Sec. 
216.240(c), the mitigation measures contained in the Letter of 
Authorization issued under Sec. Sec. 216.106 and 216.247 must be 
implemented. These mitigation measures include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Mitigation Measures for ASW and MIW training:
    (i) All lookouts onboard platforms involved in ASW training events 
shall review the NMFS-approved Marine Species Awareness Training (MSAT) 
material prior to use of mid-frequency active sonar.
    (ii) All Commanding Officers, Executive Officers, and officers 
standing watch on the Bridge shall review the MSAT material prior to a 
training event employing the use of mid- or high-frequency active sonar.
    (iii) Navy lookouts shall undertake extensive training in order to 
qualify as a watchstander in accordance with the Lookout Training 
Handbook (NAVEDTRA, 12968-D).
    (iv) Lookout training shall include on-the-job instruction under the 
supervision of a qualified, experienced watchstander. Following 
successful completion of this supervised training period, Lookouts shall 
complete the Personal Qualification Standard program, certifying that 
they have demonstrated the necessary skills (such as detection and 
reporting of partially submerged objects).
    (v) Lookouts shall be trained in the most effective means to ensure 
quick and effective communication within the command structure in order 
to facilitate implementation of mitigation measures if marine mammals 
are spotted.
    (vi) On the bridge of surface ships, there shall always be at least 
three people on watch whose duties include

[[Page 100]]

observing the water surface around the vessel.
    (vii) All surface ships participating in ASW exercises shall, in 
addition to the three personnel on watch noted previously, have at all 
times during the exercise at least two additional personnel on watch as 
lookouts.
    (viii) Personnel on lookout and officers on watch on the bridge 
shall have at least one set of binoculars available for each person to 
aid in the detection of marine mammals.
    (ix) On surface vessels equipped with MFAS, pedestal mounted ``Big 
Eye'' (20 x 110) binoculars shall be present and in good working order.
    (x) Personnel on lookout shall employ visual search procedures 
employing a scanning methodology in accordance with the Lookout Training 
Handbook (NAVEDTRA 12968-D). Surface lookouts should scan the water from 
the ship to the horizon and be responsible for all contacts in their 
sector. In searching the assigned sector, the lookout should always 
start at the forward part of the sector and search aft (toward the 
back). To search and scan, the lookout should hold the binoculars steady 
so the horizon is in the top third of the field of vision and direct the 
eyes just below the horizon. The lookout should scan for approximately 
five seconds in as many small steps as possible across the field seen 
through the binoculars. They should search the entire sector in 
approximately five-degree steps, pausing between steps for approximately 
five seconds to scan the field of view. At the end of the sector search, 
the glasses should be lowered to allow the eyes to rest for a few 
seconds, and then the lookout should search back across the sector with 
the naked eye.
    (xi) After sunset and prior to sunrise, lookouts shall employ Night 
Lookouts Techniques in accordance with the Lookout Training Handbook. At 
night, lookouts should not sweep the horizon with their eyes because 
this method is not effective when the vessel is moving. Lookouts should 
scan the horizon in a series of movements that should allow their eyes 
to come to periodic rests as they scan the sector. When visually 
searching at night, they should look a little to one side and out of the 
corners of their eyes, paying attention to the things on the outer edges 
of their field of vision.
    (xii) Personnel on lookout shall be responsible for informing the 
Officer of the Deck all objects or anomalies sighted in the water 
(regardless of the distance from the vessel) to the Officer of the Deck, 
since any object or disturbance (e.g., trash, periscope, surface 
disturbance, discoloration) in the water may be indicative of a threat 
to the vessel and its crew or indicative of a marine species that may 
need to be avoided as warranted.
    (xiii) Commanding Officers shall make use of marine mammal detection 
cues and information to limit interaction with marine mammals to the 
maximum extent possible consistent with safety of the ship.
    (xiv) All personnel engaged in passive acoustic sonar operation 
(including aircraft, surface ships, or submarines) shall monitor for 
marine mammal vocalizations and report the detection of any marine 
mammal to the appropriate watch station for dissemination and 
appropriate action.
    (xv) Units shall use training lookouts to survey for marine mammals 
prior to commencement and during the use of active sonar.
    (xvi) During operations involving sonar, personnel shall utilize all 
available sensor and optical systems (such as Night Vision Goggles) to 
aid in the detection of marine mammals.
    (xvii) Navy aircraft participating in exercises at sea shall conduct 
and maintain, when operationally feasible and safe, surveillance for 
marine mammals as long as it does not violate safety constraints or 
interfere with the accomplishment of primary operational duties.
    (xviii) Aircraft with deployed sonobuoys shall use only the passive 
capability of sonobuoys when marine mammals are detected within 200 
yards (182 m) of the sonobuoy.
    (xix) Marine mammal detections shall be reported immediately to 
assigned Aircraft Control Unit (if participating) for further 
dissemination to ships in the vicinity of the marine mammals. This 
action shall occur when it is reasonable to conclude that the course of 
the ship will likely close

[[Page 101]]

the distance between the ship and the detected marine mammal.
    (xx) Safety Zones--When marine mammals are detected by any means 
(aircraft, shipboard lookout, or acoustically) the Navy shall ensure 
that sonar transmission levels are limited to at least 6 dB below normal 
operating levels if any detected marine mammals are within 1000 yards 
(914 m) of the sonar dome (the bow).
    (A) Ships and submarines shall continue to limit maximum 
transmission levels by this 6-dB factor until the marine mammal has been 
seen to leave the area, has not been detected for 30 minutes, or the 
vessel has transited more than 2,000 yards (1828 m) beyond the location 
of the last detection.
    (B) Should a marine mammal be detected within or closing to inside 
457 m (500 yd) of the sonar dome, active sonar transmissions shall be 
limited to at least 10 dB below the equipment's normal operating level. 
Ships and submarines shall continue to limit maximum ping levels by this 
10-dB factor until the marine mammal has been seen to leave the area, 
has not been detected for 30 minutes, or the vessel has transited more 
than 2000 yards (1828 m) beyond the location of the last detection.
    (C) Should the marine mammal be detected within or closing to inside 
183 m (200 yd) of the sonar dome, active sonar transmissions shall 
cease. Sonar shall not resume until the marine mammal has been seen to 
leave the area, has not been detected for 30 minutes, or the vessel has 
transited more than 2,000 yards (1828 m) beyond the location of the last 
detection.
    (D) If the need for power-down should arise as detailed in ``Safety 
Zones'' in paragraph (a)(1)(xx) of this section, Navy shall follow the 
requirements as though they were operating at 235 dB--the normal 
operating level (i.e., the first power-down shall be to 229 dB, 
regardless of at what level above 235 sonar was being operated).
    (xxi) Prior to startup or restart of active sonar, operators shall 
check that the Safety Zone radius around the sound source is clear of 
marine mammals.
    (xxii) Sonar levels (generally)--The Navy shall operate sonar at the 
lowest practicable level, not to exceed 235 dB, except as required to 
meet tactical training objectives.
    (xxiii) Helicopters shall observe/survey the vicinity of an ASW 
Operation for 10 minutes before the first deployment of active (dipping) 
sonar in the water.
    (xxiv) Helicopters shall not dip their sonar within 200 yards (183 
m) of a marine mammal and shall cease pinging if a marine mammal closes 
within 200 yards of the helicopter dipping sonar (183 m) after pinging 
has begun.
    (xxv) Submarine sonar operators shall review detection indicators of 
close-aboard marine mammals prior to the commencement of ASW training 
activities involving active sonar.
    (xxvi) Night vision devices shall be available to all ships and air 
crews, for use as appropriate.
    (xxvii) Dolphin bowriding--If, after conducting an initial maneuver 
to avoid close quarters with dolphins, the ship concludes that dolphins 
are deliberately closing in on the ship to ride the vessel's bow wave, 
no further mitigation actions would be necessary because dolphins are 
out of the main transmission axis of the active sonar while in the 
shallow-wave area of the vessel bow.
    (xxviii) TORPEXs conducted in the northeast North Atlantic right 
whale critical habitat (as designated in 50 CFR Part 226) shall 
implement the following measures.
    (A) All torpedo-firing operations shall take place during daylight 
hours.
    (B) During the conduct of each test, visual surveys of the test area 
shall be conducted by all vessels and aircraft involved in the exercise 
to detect the presence of marine mammals. Additionally, trained 
observers shall be placed on the submarine, spotter aircraft, and the 
surface support vessel. All participants shall report sightings of any 
marine mammals, including negative reports, prior to torpedo firings. 
Reporting requirements shall be outlined in the test plans and 
procedures written for each individual exercise, and shall be emphasized 
as part of pre-exercise briefings conducted with all participants.
    (C) Observers shall receive NMFS-approved training in field 
identification,

[[Page 102]]

distribution, and relevant behaviors of marine mammals of the western 
north Atlantic. Observers shall fill out Standard Sighting Forms and the 
data shall be housed at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division 
Newport (NUWCDIVNPT). Any sightings of North Atlantic right whales shall 
be immediately communicated to the Sighting Advisory System (SAS). All 
platforms shall have onboard a copy of:
    (1) The Guide to Marine Mammals and Turtles of the U.S. Atlantic and 
Gulf of Mexico (Wynne and Schwartz 1999);
    (2) The NMFS Critical Sightings Program placard;
    (3) Right Whales, Guidelines to Mariners placard.
    (D) In addition to the visual surveillance discussed above, 
dedicated aerial surveys shall be conducted utilizing a fixed-wing 
aircraft. An aircraft with an overhead wing (i.e., Cessna Skymaster or 
similar) shall be used to facilitate a clear view of the test area. Two 
trained observers, in addition to the pilot, shall be embarked on the 
aircraft. Surveys shall be conducted at an approximate altitude of 1000 
ft (305 m) flying parallel track lines at a separation of 1 nmi (1.85 
km), or as necessary to facilitate good visual coverage of the sea 
surface. While conducting surveillance, the aircraft shall maintain an 
approximate speed of 100 knots (185 km/hr). Since factors that affect 
visibility are highly dependent on the specific time of day of the 
survey, the flight operator will have the flexibility to adjust the 
flight pattern to reduce glare and improve visibility. The entire test 
site shall be surveyed initially, but once preparations are being made 
for an actual test launch, survey effort shall be concentrated over the 
vicinity of the individual test location. Further, for approximately ten 
minutes immediately prior to launch, the aircraft shall racetrack back 
and forth between the launch vessel and the target vessel.
    (E) Commencement of an individual torpedo test scenario shall not 
occur until observers from all vessels and aircraft involved in the 
exercise have reported to the Officer in Tactical Command (OTC) and the 
OTC has declared that the range is clear of marine mammals. Should 
marine mammals be present within or seen moving toward the test area, 
the test shall be either delayed or moved as required to avoid 
interference with the animals.
    (F) The TORPEX shall be suspended if the Beaufort Sea State exceeds 
3 or if visibility precludes safe operations.
    (G) Vessel speeds:
    (1) During transit through the northeastern North Atlantic right 
whale critical habitat, surface vessels and submarines shall maintain a 
speed of no more than 10 knots (19 km/hr) while not actively engaged in 
the exercise procedures.
    (2) During TORPEX operations, a firing vessel should, where 
feasible, not exceed 10 knots. When a submarine is used as a target, 
vessel speeds should, where feasible, not exceed 18 knots. However, on 
occasion, when surface vessels are used as targets, the vessel may 
exceed 18 kts in order to fully test the functionality of the torpedoes. 
This increased speed would occur for a short period of time (e.g., 10-15 
minutes) to evade the torpedo when fired upon.
    (H) In the event of an animal strike, or if an animal is discovered 
that appears to be in distress, the Navy shall immediately report the 
discovery through the appropriate Navy chain of Command.
    (xxix) The Navy shall abide by the following additional measures:
    (A) The Navy shall avoid planning major exercises in the specified 
planning awareness areas (PAAs--as depicted in NMFS' ``Environmental 
Assessment of Mitigation Alternatives for Issuance of Incidental Take 
Regulations to U.S. Navy for Atlantic Fleet Active Sonar Training 
(AFAST)'') where feasible. Should national security require the conduct 
of more than four major exercises (C2X, JTFEX, SEASWITI, or similar 
scale event) in these areas (meaning all or a portion of the exercise) 
per year the Navy shall provide NMFS with prior notification and include 
the information in any associated after-action or monitoring reports.
    (B) The Navy shall conduct no more than one of the four above-
mentioned major exercises (COMPTUEX, JTFEX, SEASWITI or similar scale 
event) per year in the Gulf of Mexico to the extent operationally 
feasible. If national

[[Page 103]]

security needs require more than one major exercise to be conducted in 
the Gulf of Mexico PAAs, the Navy shall provide NMFS with prior 
notification and include the information in any associated after-action 
or monitoring reports.
    (C) The Navy shall include the PAAs in the Navy's Protective 
Measures Assessment Protocol (PMAP) (implemented by the Navy for use in 
the protection of the marine environment) for unit level situational 
awareness (i.e., exercises other than COMPTUEX, JTFEX, SEASWITI) and 
planning purposes.
    (D) Helicopter Dipping Sonar--Unless otherwise dictated by national 
security needs, the Navy shall minimize helicopter dipping sonar 
activities within the southeastern areas of North Atlantic right whale 
critical habitat (as designated in 50 CFR part 226) from November 15-
April 15.
    (E) Object Detection Exercises--The Navy shall implement the 
following measures regarding object detection activities in the 
southeastern areas of the North Atlantic right whale critical habitat:
    (1) The Navy shall reduce the time spent conducting object detection 
exercises in the NARW critical habitat;
    (2) Prior to conducting surface ship object detection exercises in 
the southeastern areas of the North Atlantic right whale critical 
habitat during the time of November 15-April 15, ships shall contact 
FACSFACJAX to obtain the latest North Atlantic right whale sighting 
information. FACSFACJAX shall advise ships of all reported whale 
sightings in the vicinity of the critical habitat and associated areas 
of concern (which extend 9 km (5 NM) seaward of the designated critical 
habitat boundaries). To the extent operationally feasible, ships shall 
avoid conducting training in the vicinity of recently sighted North 
Atlantic right whales. Ships shall maneuver to maintain at least 500 
yards separation from any observed whale, consistent with the safety of 
the ship.
    (xxx) The Navy shall abide by the letter of the ``Stranding Response 
Plan for Major Navy Training Exercises in the AFAST Study Area'' 
(available at: http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/permits/incidental.htm), to 
include the following measures:
    (A) Shutdown Procedures--When an Uncommon Stranding Event (USE--
defined in Sec. 216.241) occurs during a Major Training Exercise (MTE, 
including SEASWITI, IAC, Group Sails, JTFEX, or COMPTUEX) in the AFAST 
Study Area, the Navy shall implement the procedures described below.
    (1) The Navy shall implement a Shutdown (as defined Sec. 216.241) 
when advised by a NMFS Office of Protected Resources Headquarters Senior 
Official designated in the AFAST Stranding Communication Protocol that a 
USE involving live animals has been identified and that at least one 
live animal is located in the water. NMFS and Navy shall communicate, as 
needed, regarding the identification of the USE and the potential need 
to implement shutdown procedures.
    (2) Any shutdown in a given area shall remain in effect in that area 
until NMFS advises the Navy that the subject(s) of the USE at that area 
die or are euthanized, or that all live animals involved in the USE at 
that area have left the area (either of their own volition or herded).
    (3) If the Navy finds an injured or dead animal of any species other 
than North Atlantic right whale floating at sea during an MTE, the Navy 
shall notify NMFS immediately or as soon as operational security 
considerations allow. The Navy shall provide NMFS with species or 
description of the animal(s), the condition of the animal(s) including 
carcass condition (if the animal(s) is/are dead), location, time of 
first discovery, observed behaviors (if alive), and photo or video (if 
available). Based on the information provided, NMFS shall determine if, 
and advise the Navy whether a modified shutdown is appropriate on a 
case-by-case basis.
    (4) If the Navy finds an injured (or entangled) North Atlantic right 
whale floating at sea during an MTE, the Navy shall implement shutdown 
procedures (14 or 17 nm, as defined below) around the animal immediately 
(without waiting for notification from NMFS). The Navy shall then notify 
NMFS (pursuant to the AFAST Communication Protocol) immediately or

[[Page 104]]

as soon as operational security considerations allow. The Navy shall 
provide NMFS with species or description of the animal(s), the condition 
of the animal(s) including carcass condition (if the animal(s) is/are 
dead), location, time of first discovery, observed behaviors (if alive), 
and photo or video (if available). Subsequent to the discovery of the 
injured whale, any Navy platforms in the area shall report any North 
Atlantic right whale sightings to NMFS (or to a contact that can alert 
NMFS as soon as possible). Based on the information provided, NMFS may 
initiate/organize an aerial survey (by requesting the Navy's assistance 
pursuant to the memorandum of agreement (MOA) (see (a)(1)(xxx)(C) of 
this section) or by other available means) to see if other North 
Atlantic right whales are in the vicinity. Based on the information 
provided by the Navy and, if necessary, the outcome of the aerial 
surveys, NMFS shall determine whether a continued shutdown is 
appropriate on a case-by-case basis. Though it will be determined on a 
case-by-case basis after Navy/NMFS discussion of the situation, NMFS 
anticipates that the shutdown will continue within 14 or 17 nm of a 
live, injured/entangled North Atlantic right whale until the animal dies 
or has not been seen for at least 3 hours (either by NMFS staff 
attending the injured animal or Navy personnel monitoring the area 
around where the animal was last sighted).
    (5) If the Navy finds a dead North Atlantic right whale floating at 
sea during an MTE, the Navy shall notify NMFS (pursuant to AFAST 
Stranding Communication Protocol) immediately or as soon as operational 
security considerations allow. The Navy shall provide NMFS with species 
or description of the animal(s), the condition of the animal(s) 
(including carcass condition if the animal(s) is/are dead), location, 
time of first discovery, observed behaviors (if alive), and photo or 
video (if available). Subsequent to the discovery of the dead whale, if 
the Navy is operating sonar in the area they shall use increased 
vigilance (in looking for North Atlantic right whales) and all platforms 
in the area shall report sightings of North Atlantic right whales to 
NMFS as soon as possible. Based on the information provided, NMFS may 
initiate/organize an aerial survey (by requesting the Navy's assistance 
pursuant to the MOA (see (a)(1)(xxx)(C) of this section) or by other 
available means) to see if other North Atlantic right whales are in the 
vicinity. Based on the information provided by the Navy and, if 
necessary, the outcome of the aerial surveys, NMFS will determine 
whether any additional mitigation measures are necessary on a case-by-
case basis.
    (6) In the event, following a USE, that: (a) Qualified individuals 
are attempting to herd animals back out to the open ocean and animals 
are not willing to leave, or (b) animals are seen repeatedly heading for 
the open ocean but turning back to shore, NMFS and the Navy should 
coordinate (including an investigation of other potential anthropogenic 
stressors in the area) to determine if the proximity of MFAS/HFAS 
training activities or explosive detonations, though farther than 14 or 
17 nm from the distressed animal(s), is likely decreasing the likelihood 
that the animals return to the open water. If so, NMFS and the Navy 
shall further coordinate to determine what measures are necessary to 
further minimize that likelihood and implement those measures as 
appropriate.
    (B) Within 72 hours of NMFS notifying the Navy of the presence of a 
USE, the Navy shall provide available information to NMFS (per the AFAST 
Communication Protocol) regarding the location, number and types of 
acoustic/explosive sources, direction and speed of units using MFAS/
HFAS, and marine mammal sightings information associated with training 
activities occurring within 80 nm (148 km) and 72 hours prior to the USE 
event. Information not initially available regarding the 80 nm (148 km), 
72 hours, period prior to the event shall be provided as soon as it 
becomes available. The Navy shall provide NMFS investigative teams with 
additional relevant unclassified information as requested, if available.
    (C) Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)--The Navy and NMFS shall develop a 
MOA, or other mechanism consistent with Federal fiscal law requirements 
(and all other applicable laws),

[[Page 105]]

that will establish a framework whereby the Navy can (and provide the 
Navy examples of how they can best) assist NMFS with stranding 
investigations in certain circumstances. This document shall be 
finalized in 2009 (unless NMFS notifies the Navy that a delay is 
needed).
    (2) Mitigation for IEER/AEER--The following are mitigation measures 
for use with Extended Echo Ranging/Improved Extended Echo Ranging (EER/
IEER) and Advanced Extended Echo Ranging given an explosive source 
generates the acoustic wave used in this sonobuoy.
    (i) Navy crews shall conduct visual reconnaissance of the drop area 
prior to laying their intended sonobuoy pattern. This search should be 
conducted below 500 yards (457 m) at a slow speed, if operationally 
feasible and weather conditions permit. In dual aircraft training 
activities, crews are allowed to conduct coordinated area clearances.
    (ii) For IEER (AN/SSQ-110A), Navy crews shall conduct a minimum of 
30 minutes of visual and acoustic monitoring of the search area prior to 
commanding the first post (source/receiver sonobuoy pair) detonation. 
This 30-minute observation period may include pattern deployment time.
    (iii) For any part of the briefed pattern where a post (source/
receiver sonobuoy pair) will be deployed within 1,000 yards (914 m) of 
observed marine mammal activity, deploy the receiver ONLY and monitor 
while conducting a visual search. When marine mammals are no longer 
detected within 1,000 yards (914 m) of the intended post position, co-
locate the explosive source sonobuoy (AN/SSQ-110A) (source) with the 
receiver.
    (iv) When operationally feasible, Navy crews shall conduct 
continuous visual and aural monitoring of marine mammal activity. This 
is to include monitoring of own-aircraft sensors from first sensor 
placement to checking off station and out of communication range of 
these sensors.
    (v) Aural Detection: If the presence of marine mammals is detected 
aurally, then that should cue the aircrew to increase the diligence of 
their visual surveillance. Subsequently, if no marine mammals are 
visually detected, then the Navy crew may continue multi-static active 
search.
    (vi) Visual Detection:
    (A) If marine mammals are visually detected within 1,000 yards (914 
m) of the explosive source sonobuoy (AN/SSQ-110A) intended for use, then 
that payload shall not be detonated.
    (B) Navy Aircrews may utilize this post once the marine mammals have 
not been re-sighted for 30 minutes, or are observed to have moved 
outside the 1,000 yards (914 m) safety buffer.
    (C) Navy Aircrews may shift their multi-static active search to 
another post, where marine mammals are outside the 1,000 yards (914 m) 
safety buffer.
    (vii) For IEER (AN/SSQ-110A), Navy Aircrews shall make every attempt 
to manually detonate the unexploded charges at each post in the pattern 
prior to departing the operations area by using the ``Payload 1 
Release'' command followed by the ``Payload 2 Release'' command. 
Aircrews shall refrain from using the ``Scuttle'' command when two 
payloads remain at a given post. Aircrews shall ensure that a 1,000 yard 
(914 m) safety buffer, visually clear of marine mammals, is maintained 
around each post as is done during active search operations.
    (viii) Navy Aircrews shall only leave posts with unexploded charges 
in the event of a sonobuoy malfunction, an aircraft system malfunction, 
or when an aircraft must immediately depart the area due to issues such 
as fuel constraints, inclement weather, and in-flight emergencies. In 
these cases, the sonobuoy will self-scuttle using the secondary or 
tertiary method.
    (ix) The Navy shall ensure all payloads are accounted for. Explosive 
source sonobuoys (AN/SSQ-110A) that cannot be scuttled shall be reported 
as unexploded ordnance via voice communications while airborne, then 
upon landing via naval message.
    (x) Marine mammal monitoring shall continue until out of own-
aircraft sensor range.
    (3) Mitigation Measures Related to Vessel Transit and North Atlantic 
Right Whales:
    (i) Mid-Atlantic, Offshore of the Eastern United States:

[[Page 106]]

    (A) All Navy vessels are required to use extreme caution and operate 
at a slow, safe speed consistent with mission and safety during the 
months indicated below and within a 37 km (20 nm) arc (except as noted) 
of the specified associated reference points:
    (1) South and East of Block Island (37 km (20 NM) seaward of line 
between 41-4.49[deg] N. lat. 071-51.15[deg] W. long. and 41-18.58[deg] 
N. lat. 070-50.23[deg] W. long): Sept-Oct and Mar-Apr.
    (2) New York/New Jersey (40-30.64[deg] N. lat. 073-57.76[deg] W. 
long.): Sep-Oct and Feb-Apr.
    (3) Delaware Bay (Philadelphia) (38-52.13[deg] N. lat. 075-1.93[deg] 
W. long.): Oct-Dec and Feb-Mar.
    (4) Chesapeake Bay (Hampton Roads and Baltimore) (37-1.11[deg] N. 
lat. 075-57.56[deg] W. long.): Nov-Dec and Feb-Apr.
    (5) North Carolina (34-41.54[deg] N. lat. 076-40.20[deg] W. long.): 
Dec-Apr.
    (6) South Carolina (33-11.84[deg] N. lat. 079-8.99[deg] W. long. and 
32-43.39[deg] N. lat. 079-48.72[deg] W. long.): Oct-Apr.
    (B) During the months indicated in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this 
section, Navy vessels shall practice increased vigilance with respect to 
avoidance of vessel-whale interactions along the mid-Atlantic coast, 
including transits to and from any mid-Atlantic ports not specifically 
identified in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section.
    (C) All surface units transiting within 56 km (30 NM) of the coast 
in the mid-Atlantic shall ensure at least two watchstanders are posted, 
including at least one lookout who has completed required MSAT training.
    (D) Navy vessels shall not knowingly approach any whale head on and 
shall maneuver to keep at least 457 m (1,500 ft) away from any observed 
whale, consistent with vessel safety.
    (ii) Southeast Atlantic, Offshore of the Eastern United States--for 
the purposes of the measures below (within this paragraph), the 
``southeast'' encompasses sea space from Charleston, South Carolina, 
southward to Sebastian Inlet, Florida, and from the coast seaward to 148 
km (80 NM) from shore. North Atlantic right whale critical habitat is 
the area from 31-15[deg] N. lat. to 30-15[deg] N. lat. extending from 
the coast out to 28 km (15 NM), and the area from 28-00[deg] N. lat. to 
30-15[deg] N. lat. from the coast out to 9 km (5 NM). All mitigation 
measures described here that apply to the critical habitat apply from 
November 15-April 15 and also apply to an associated area of concern 
which extends 9 km (5 NM) seaward of the designated critical habitat 
boundaries.
    (A) Prior to transiting or training in the critical habitat or 
associated area of concern, ships shall contact Fleet Area Control and 
Surveillance Facility, Jacksonville, to obtain latest whale sighting and 
other information needed to make informed decisions regarding safe speed 
and path of intended movement. Subs shall contact Commander, Submarine 
Group Ten for similar information.
    (B) The following specific mitigation measures apply to activities 
occurring within the critical habitat and an associated area of concern 
which extends 9 km (5 NM) seaward of the designated critical habitat 
boundaries:
    (1) When transiting within the critical habitat or associated area 
of concern, vessels shall exercise extreme caution and proceed at a slow 
safe speed. The speed shall be the slowest safe speed that is consistent 
with mission, training and operations.
    (2) Speed reductions (adjustments) are required when a whale is 
sighted by a vessel or when the vessel is within 9 km (5 NM) of a 
reported new sighting less then 12 hours old. Circumstances could arise 
where, in order to avoid North Atlantic right whale(s), speed reductions 
could mean vessel must reduce speed to a minimum at which it can safely 
keep on course or vessels could come to an all stop.
    (3) Vessels shall avoid head-on approaches to North Atlantic right 
whale(s) and shall maneuver to maintain at least 457 m (500 yd) of 
separation from any observed whale if deemed safe to do so. These 
requirements do not apply if a vessel's safety is threatened, such as 
when a change of course would create an imminent and serious threat to a 
person, vessel, or aircraft, and to the extent vessels are restricted in 
the ability to maneuver.
    (4) Ships shall not transit through the critical habitat or 
associated area of concern in a North-South direction.

[[Page 107]]

    (5) Ships, surfaced subs, and aircraft shall report any whale 
sightings to Fleet Area Control and Surveillance Facility, Jacksonville, 
by the quickest and most practicable means. The sighting report shall 
include the time, latitude/longitude, direction of movement and number 
and description of whale (i.e., adult/calf).
    (iii) Northeast Atlantic, Offshore of the Eastern United States:
    (A) Prior to transiting the Great South Channel or Cape Cod Bay 
critical habitat areas, ships shall obtain the latest North Atlantic 
right whale sightings and other information needed to make informed 
decisions regarding safe speed. The Great South Channel critical habitat 
is defined by the following coordinates: 41-00[deg] N. lat., 69-05[deg] 
W. long.; 41-45[deg] N. lat, 69-45[deg] W. long; 42-10[deg] N. lat., 68-
31[deg] W. long.; 41-38[deg] N. lat., 68-13[deg] W. long. The Cape Cod 
Bay critical habitat is defined by the following coordinates: 42-
04.8[deg] N. lat., 70-10[deg] W. long.; 42-12[deg] N. lat., 70-15[deg] 
W. long.; 42-12[deg] N. lat., 70-30[deg] W. long.; 41-46.8[deg] N. lat., 
70-30[deg] W. long.
    (B) Ships, surfaced subs, and aircraft shall report any North 
Atlantic right whale sightings (if the whale is identifiable as a right 
whale) off the northeastern U.S. to Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing 
(COMPATRECONWING). The report shall include the time of sighting, lat/
long, direction of movement (if apparent) and number and description of 
the whale(s).
    (C) Vessels or aircraft that observe whale carcasses shall record 
the location and time of the sighting and report this information as 
soon as possible to the cognizant regional environmental coordinator. 
All whale strikes must be reported. This report shall include the date, 
time, and location of the strike; vessel course and speed; operations 
being conducted by the vessel; weather conditions, visibility, and sea 
state; description of the whale; narrative of incident; and indication 
of whether photos/videos were taken. Navy personnel are encouraged to 
take photos whenever possible.
    (D) Specific mitigation measures related to activities occurring 
within the critical habitat include the following:
    (1) Vessels shall avoid head-on approaches to North Atlantic right 
whale(s) and shall maneuver to maintain at least 457 m (500 yd) of 
separation from any observed whale if deemed safe to do so. These 
requirements do not apply if a vessel's safety is threatened, such as 
when change of course would create an imminent and serious threat to 
person, vessel, or aircraft, and to the extent vessels are restricted in 
the ability to maneuver.
    (2) When transiting within the critical habitat or associated area 
of concern, vessels shall use extreme caution and operate at a safe 
speed so as to be able to avoid collisions with North Atlantic right 
whales and other marine mammals, and stop within a distance appropriate 
to the circumstances and conditions.
    (3) Speed reductions (adjustments) are required when a whale is 
sighted by a vessel or when the vessel is within 9 km (5 NM) of a 
reported new sighting less than one week old.
    (4) Ships transiting in the Cape Cod Bay and Great South Channel 
critical habitats shall obtain information on recent whale sightings in 
the vicinity of the critical habitat. Any vessel operating in the 
vicinity of a North Atlantic right whale shall consider additional speed 
reductions as per Rule 6 of International Navigational Rules.

requirements of these regulations or a Letter of Authorization issued 
under Sec. Sec. 216.106 and 216.277.


<R05>
Sec. 216.274  Mitigation.

    (a) When conducting activities identified in Sec. 216.270(c), the 
mitigation measures contained in the Letter of Authorization issued 
under Sec. Sec. 216.106 and 216.277 must be implemented. These 
mitigation measures include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Navy's General SOCAL Maritime Measures for All Training at Sea:
    (i) Personnel Training (for all Training Types):
    (A) All commanding officers (COs), executive officers (XOs), 
lookouts, Officers of the Deck (OODs), junior OODs (JOODs), maritime 
patrol aircraft aircrews, and Anti-submarine Warfare (ASW)/Mine Warfare 
(MIW) helicopter crews shall complete the NMFS-approved Marine Species 
Awareness Training (MSAT) by viewing the U.S. Navy MSAT digital 
versatile disk (DVD). All bridge lookouts shall complete both parts one 
and two of the MSAT; part two is optional for other personnel.
    (B) Navy lookouts shall undertake extensive training in order to 
qualify as a watchstander in accordance with the Lookout Training 
Handbook (Naval Education and Training Command [NAVEDTRA] 12968-D).
    (C) Lookout training shall include on-the-job instruction under the 
supervision of a qualified, experienced lookout. Following successful 
completion of this supervised training period, lookouts shall complete 
the Personal Qualification Standard Program, certifying that they have 
demonstrated the necessary skills (such as detection and reporting of 
partially submerged objects). Personnel being trained as lookouts can be 
counted among required

[[Page 115]]

lookouts as long as supervisors monitor their progress and performance.
    (D) Lookouts shall be trained in the most effective means to ensure 
quick and effective communication within the command structure in order 
to facilitate implementation of mitigation measures if marine species 
are spotted.
    (ii) Operating Procedures and Collision Avoidance:
    (A) Prior to major exercises, a Letter of Instruction, Mitigation 
Measures Message or Environmental Annex to the Operational Order shall 
be issued to further disseminate the personnel training requirement and 
general marine species mitigation measures.
    (B) COs shall make use of marine species detection cues and 
information to limit interaction with marine species to the maximum 
extent possible consistent with safety of the ship.
    (C) While underway, surface vessels shall have at least two lookouts 
with binoculars; surfaced submarines shall have at least one lookout 
with binoculars. Lookouts already posted for safety of navigation and 
man-overboard precautions may be used to fill this requirement. As part 
of their regular duties, lookouts will watch for and report to the OOD 
the presence of marine mammals.
    (D) On surface vessels equipped with a mid-frequency active sensor, 
pedestal mounted ``Big Eye'' (20x110) binoculars shall be properly 
installed and in good working order to assist in the detection of marine 
mammals in the vicinity of the vessel.
    (E) Personnel on lookout shall employ visual search procedures 
employing a scanning methodology in accordance with the Lookout Training 
Handbook (NAVEDTRA 12968-D).
    (F) After sunset and prior to sunrise, lookouts shall employ Night 
Lookout Techniques in accordance with the Lookout Training Handbook. 
(NAVEDTRA 12968-D).
    (G) While in transit, naval vessels shall be alert at all times, use 
extreme caution, and proceed at a ``safe speed'' so that the vessel can 
take proper and effective action to avoid a collision with any marine 
animal and can be stopped within a distance appropriate to the 
prevailing circumstances and conditions.
    (H) When marine mammals have been sighted in the area, Navy vessels 
shall increase vigilance and take reasonable and practicable actions to 
avoid collisions and activities that might result in close interaction 
of naval assets and marine mammals. Actions may include changing speed 
and/or direction and are dictated by environmental and other conditions 
(e.g., safety, weather).
    (I) Floating weeds and kelp, algal mats, clusters of seabirds, and 
jellyfish are good indicators of marine mammals. Therefore, where these 
circumstances are present, the Navy shall exercise increased vigilance 
in watching for marine mammals.
    (J) Navy aircraft participating in exercises at sea shall conduct 
and maintain, when operationally feasible and safe, surveillance for 
marine mammals as long as it does not violate safety constraints or 
interfere with the accomplishment of primary operational duties. Marine 
mammal detections shall be immediately reported to assigned Aircraft 
Control Unit for further dissemination to ships in the vicinity of the 
marine species as appropriate when it is reasonable to conclude that the 
course of the ship will likely result in a closing of the distance to 
the detected marine mammal.
    (K) All vessels shall maintain logs and records documenting training 
operations should they be required for event reconstruction purposes. 
Logs and records will be kept for a period of 30 days following 
completion of a major training exercise.
    (2) Navy's Measures for MFAS Operations:
    (i) Personnel Training (for MFAS Operations):
    (A) All lookouts onboard platforms involved in ASW training events 
shall review the NMFS-approved Marine Species Awareness Training 
material prior to use of mid-frequency active sonar.
    (B) All COs, XOs, and officers standing watch on the bridge shall 
have reviewed the Marine Species Awareness Training material prior to a 
training event employing the use of mid-frequency active sonar.
    (C) Navy lookouts shall undertake extensive training in order to 
qualify as a watchstander in accordance with

[[Page 116]]

the Lookout Training Handbook (Naval Educational Training [NAVEDTRA], 
12968-D).
    (D) Lookout training shall include on-the-job instruction under the 
supervision of a qualified, experienced watchstander. Following 
successful completion of this supervised training period, lookouts shall 
complete the Personal Qualification Standard program, certifying that 
they have demonstrated the necessary skills (such as detection and 
reporting of partially submerged objects). This does not forbid 
personnel being trained as lookouts from being counted as those listed 
in previous measures so long as supervisors monitor their progress and 
performance.
    (E) Lookouts shall be trained in the most effective means to ensure 
quick and effective communication within the command structure in order 
to facilitate implementation of mitigation measures if marine species 
are spotted.
    (ii) Lookout and Watchstander Responsibilities:
    (A) On the bridge of surface ships, there shall always be at least 
three people on watch whose duties include observing the water surface 
around the vessel.
    (B) All surface ships participating in ASW training events shall, in 
addition to the three personnel on watch noted previously, have at all 
times during the exercise at least two additional personnel on watch as 
marine mammal lookouts.
    (C) Personnel on lookout and officers on watch on the bridge shall 
have at least one set of binoculars available for each person to aid in 
the detection of marine mammals.
    (D) On surface vessels equipped with mid-frequency active sonar, 
pedestal mounted ``Big Eye'' (20x110) binoculars shall be present and in 
good working order to assist in the detection of marine mammals in the 
vicinity of the vessel.
    (E) Personnel on lookout shall employ visual search procedures 
employing a scanning methodology in accordance with the Lookout Training 
Handbook (NAVEDTRA 12968-D).
    (F) After sunset and prior to sunrise, lookouts shall employ Night 
Lookouts Techniques in accordance with the Lookout Training Handbook.
    (G) Personnel on lookout shall be responsible for reporting all 
objects or anomalies sighted in the water (regardless of the distance 
from the vessel) to the Officer of the Deck, since any object or 
disturbance (e.g., trash, periscope, surface disturbance, discoloration) 
in the water may be indicative of a threat to the vessel and its crew or 
indicative of a marine species that may need to be avoided as warranted.
    (iii) Operating Procedures:
    (A) Navy will distribute final mitigation measures contained in the 
LOA and the Incidental take statement of NMFS' biological opinion to the 
Fleet.
    (B) COs shall make use of marine species detection cues and 
information to limit interaction with marine species to the maximum 
extent possible consistent with safety of the ship.
    (C) All personnel engaged in passive acoustic sonar operation 
(including aircraft, surface ships, or submarines) shall monitor for 
marine mammal vocalizations and report the detection of any marine 
mammal to the appropriate watch station for dissemination and 
appropriate action.
    (D) During mid-frequency active sonar operations, personnel shall 
utilize all available sensor and optical systems (such as night vision 
goggles) to aid in the detection of marine mammals.
    (E) Navy aircraft participating in exercises at sea shall conduct 
and maintain, when operationally feasible and safe, surveillance for 
marine species of concern as long as it does not violate safety 
constraints or interfere with the accomplishment of primary operational 
duties.
    (F) Aircraft with deployed sonobuoys shall use only the passive 
capability of sonobuoys when marine mammals are detected within 200 yds 
(183 m) of the sonobuoy.
    (G) Marine mammal detections shall be immediately reported to 
assigned Aircraft Control Unit for further dissemination to ships in the 
vicinity of the marine species as appropriate where it is reasonable to 
conclude that the course of the ship will likely result in a closing of 
the distance to the detected marine mammal.

[[Page 117]]

    (H) Safety Zones--When marine mammals are detected by any means 
(aircraft, shipboard lookout, or acoustically) within or closing to 
inside 1,000 yds (914 m) of the sonar dome (the bow), the ship or 
submarine shall limit active transmission levels to at least 6 decibels 
(dB) below normal operating levels.
    (1) Ships and submarines shall continue to limit maximum 
transmission levels by this 6-dB factor until the animal has been seen 
to leave the area, has not been detected for 30 minutes, or the vessel 
has transited more than 2,000 yds (1829 m) beyond the location of the 
last detection.
    (2) Should a marine mammal be detected within or closing to inside 
500 yds (457 m) of the sonar dome, active sonar transmissions shall be 
limited to at least 10-dB below the equipment's normal operating level. 
Ships and submarines shall continue to limit maximum ping levels by this 
10-dB factor until the animal has been seen to leave the area, has not 
been detected for 30 minutes, or the vessel has transited more than 
2,000 yds (1829 m) beyond the location of the last detection.
    (3) Should the marine mammal be detected within or closing to inside 
200 yds (183 m) of the sonar dome, active sonar transmissions shall 
cease. Sonar shall not resume until the animal has been seen to leave 
the area, has not been detected for 30 minutes, or the vessel has 
transited more than 2,000 yds (1829 m) beyond the location of the last 
detection.
    (4) Special conditions applicable for dolphins and porpoises only: 
If, after conducting an initial maneuver to avoid close quarters with 
dolphins or porpoises, the OOD concludes that dolphins or porpoises are 
deliberately closing to ride the vessel's bow wave, no further 
mitigation actions are necessary while the dolphins or porpoises 
continue to exhibit bow wave riding behavior.
    (5) If the need for power-down should arise as detailed in paragraph 
(a)(2)(iii)(H) of this section, the Navy shall follow the requirements 
as though they were operating at 235 dB--the normal operating level 
(i.e., the first power-down will be to 229 dB, regardless of at what 
level above 235 dB active sonar was being operated).
    (I) Prior to start up or restart of active sonar, operators will 
check that the Safety Zone radius around the sound source is clear of 
marine mammals.
    (J) Active sonar levels (generally)--Navy shall operate active sonar 
at the lowest practicable level, not to exceed 235 dB, except as 
required to meet tactical training objectives.
    (K) Helicopters shall observe/survey the vicinity of an ASW training 
event for 10 minutes before the first deployment of active (dipping) 
sonar in the water.
    (L) Helicopters shall not dip their active sonar within 200 yds (183 
m) of a marine mammal and shall cease pinging if a marine mammal closes 
within 200 yds (183 m) after pinging has begun.
    (M) Submarine sonar operators shall review detection indicators of 
close-aboard marine mammals prior to the commencement of ASW training 
events involving active mid-frequency sonar.
    (N) Night vision goggles shall be available to all ships and air 
crews, for use as appropriate.
    (3) Navy's Measures for Underwater Detonations:
    (i) Surface-to-Surface Gunnery (explosive rounds):
    (A) Lookouts shall visually survey for floating weeds and kelp. 
Intended impact (i.e., where the Navy is aiming) shall not be within 600 
yds (585 m) of known or observed floating weeds and kelp, and algal 
mats.
    (B) For exercises using targets towed by a vessel or aircraft, 
target-towing vessels/aircraft shall maintain a trained lookout for 
marine mammals, if applicable. If a marine mammal is sighted in the 
vicinity, the tow aircraft/vessel shall immediately notify the firing 
vessel, which shall suspend the exercise until the area is clear.
    (C) A 600-yard radius buffer zone shall be established around the 
intended target.
    (D) From the intended firing position, trained lookouts shall survey 
the buffer zone for marine mammals prior to commencement and during the 
exercise as long as practicable.

[[Page 118]]

    (E) The exercise shall be conducted only when the buffer zone is 
visible and marine mammals are not detected within it.
    (ii) Surface-to-Surface Gunnery (non-explosive rounds):
    (A) Lookouts shall visually survey for floating weeds and kelp, and 
algal mats. Intended impact will not be within 200 yds (183 m) of known 
or observed floating weeds and kelp, and algal mats.
    (B) A 200-yd (183 m) radius buffer zone shall be established around 
the intended target.
    (C) From the intended firing position, trained lookouts shall survey 
the buffer zone for marine mammals prior to commencement and during the 
exercise as long as practicable.
    (D) If applicable, target towing vessels shall maintain a lookout. 
If a marine mammal is sighted in the vicinity of the exercise, the tow 
vessel shall immediately notify the firing vessel in order to secure 
gunnery firing until the area is clear.
    (E) The exercise shall be conducted only when the buffer zone is 
visible and marine mammals are not detected within the target area and 
the buffer zone.
    (iii) Surface-to-Air Gunnery (explosive and non-explosive rounds):
    (A) Vessels shall orient the geometry of gunnery exercises in order 
to prevent debris from falling in the area of sighted marine mammals.
    (B) Vessels will expedite the recovery of any parachute deploying 
aerial targets to reduce the potential for entanglement of marine 
mammals.
    (C) Target towing aircraft shall maintain a lookout, if applicable. 
If a marine mammal is sighted in the vicinity of the exercise, the tow 
aircraft shall immediately notify the firing vessel in order to secure 
gunnery firing until the area is clear.
    (iv) Air-to-Surface Gunnery (explosive and non-explosive rounds)
    (A) If surface vessels are involved, lookouts will visually survey 
for floating kelp in the target area. Impact shall not occur within 200 
yds (183 m) of known or observed floating weeds and kelp or algal mats.
    (B) A 200 yd (183 m) radius buffer zone shall be established around 
the intended target.
    (C) If surface vessels are involved, lookout(s) shall visually 
survey the buffer zone for marine mammals prior to and during the 
exercise.
    (D) Aerial surveillance of the buffer zone for marine mammals shall 
be conducted prior to commencement of the exercise. Aircraft crew/pilot 
shall maintain visual watch during exercises. Release of ordnance 
through cloud cover is prohibited: aircraft must be able to actually see 
ordnance impact areas.
    (E) The exercise shall be conducted only if marine mammals are not 
visible within the buffer zone.
    (v) Small Arms Training--(grenades, explosive and non-explosive 
rounds)--Lookouts will visually survey for floating weeds or kelp, algal 
mats, and marine mammals. Weapons shall not be fired in the direction of 
known or observed floating weeds or kelp, algal mats, or marine mammals.
    (vi) Air-to-Surface At-sea Bombing Exercises (explosive and non-
explosive):
    (A) If surface vessels are involved, trained lookouts shall survey 
for floating kelp and marine mammals. Ordnance shall not be targeted to 
impact within 1,000 yds (914 m) of known or observed floating kelp or 
marine mammals.
    (B) A 1,000 yd (914 m) radius buffer zone shall be established 
around the intended target.
    (C) Aircraft shall visually survey the target and buffer zone for 
marine mammals prior to and during the exercise. The survey of the 
impact area shall be made by flying at 1,500 ft (152 m) or lower, if 
safe to do so, and at the slowest safe speed. Release of ordnance 
through cloud cover is prohibited: aircraft must be able to actually see 
ordnance impact areas. Survey aircraft should employ most effective 
search tactics and capabilities.
    (D) The exercise will be conducted only if marine mammals are not 
visible within the buffer zone.
    (vii) Air-to-Surface Missile Exercises (explosive and non-
explosive):

[[Page 119]]

    (A) Ordnance shall not be targeted to impact within 1,800 yds (1646 
m) of known or observed floating kelp.
    (B) Aircraft shall visually survey the target area for marine 
mammals. Visual inspection of the target area shall be made by flying at 
1,500 (457 m) feet or lower, if safe to do so, and at slowest safe 
speed. Firing or range clearance aircraft must be able to actually see 
ordnance impact areas. Explosive ordnance shall not be targeted to 
impact within 1,800 yds (1646 m) of sighted marine mammals.
    (viii) Demolitions, Mine Warfare, and Mine Countermeasures (up to a 
20-lb NEW charge):
    (A) Exclusion Zones--All Demolitions, Mine Warfare and Mine 
Countermeasures Operations involving the use of explosive charges must 
include exclusion zones for marine mammals to prevent physical and/or 
acoustic effects to those species. These exclusion zones shall extend in 
a 700-yard arc radius around the detonation site.
    (B) Pre-Exercise Surveys--For Demolition and Ship Mine 
Countermeasures Operations, pre-exercise survey shall be conducted 
within 30 minutes prior to the commencement of the scheduled explosive 
event. The survey may be conducted from the surface, by divers, and/or 
from the air, and personnel shall be alert to the presence of any marine 
mammal. Should a marine mammal be present within the survey area, the 
exercise shall be paused until the animal voluntarily leaves the area. 
The Navy shall suspend detonation exercises and ensure the area is clear 
for a full 30 minutes prior to detonation. Personnel shall record any 
marine mammal observations during the exercise.
    (C) Post-Exercise Surveys--Surveys within the same radius shall also 
be conducted within 30 minutes after the completion of the explosive 
event.
    (D) Reporting--If there is evidence that a marine mammal may have 
been stranded, injured or killed by the action, Navy activities shall be 
immediately suspended and the situation immediately reported by the 
participating unit to the Officer in Charge of the Exercise (OCE), who 
will follow Navy procedures for reporting the incident to Commander, 
Pacific Fleet, Commander, Third Fleet, Commander, Navy Region Southwest, 
Environmental Director, and the chain-of-command. The situation shall 
also be reported to NMFS (see Stranding Plan for details).
    (ix) Mining Operations--Initial target points shall be briefly 
surveyed prior to inert ordnance (no live ordnance used) release from an 
aircraft to ensure the intended drop area is clear of marine mammals. To 
the extent feasible, the Navy shall retrieve inert mine shapes dropped 
during Mining Operations.
    (x) Sink Exercise:
    (A) All weapons firing shall be conducted during the period 1 hour 
after official sunrise to 30 minutes before official sunset.
    (B) An exclusion zone with a radius of 1.5 nm shall be established 
around each target. This 1.5 nm zone includes a buffer of 0.5 nm to 
account for errors, target drift, and animal movement. In addition to 
the 1.5 nm exclusion zone, a further safety zone, which extends from the 
exclusion zone at 1.5 nm out an additional 0.5 nm, shall be surveyed. 
Together, the zones (exclusion and safety) extend out 2 nm from the 
target.
    (C) A series of surveillance over-flights shall be conducted within 
the exclusion and the safety zones, prior to and during the exercise, 
when feasible. Survey protocol shall be as follows:
    (1) Overflights within the exclusion zone shall be conducted in a 
manner that optimizes the surface area of the water observed. This may 
be accomplished through the use of the Navy's Search and Rescue Tactical 
Aid, which provides the best search altitude, ground speed, and track 
spacing for the discovery of small, possibly dark objects in the water 
based on the environmental conditions of the day. These environmental 
conditions include the angle of sun inclination, amount of daylight, 
cloud cover, visibility, and sea state.
    (2) All visual surveillance activities shall be conducted by Navy 
personnel trained in visual surveillance. At least one member of the 
mitigation team shall have completed the Navy's marine mammal training 
program for lookouts.

[[Page 120]]

    (3) In addition to the overflights, the exclusion zone shall be 
monitored by passive acoustic means, when assets are available. This 
passive acoustic monitoring would be maintained throughout the exercise. 
Potential assets include sonobuoys, which can be utilized to detect any 
vocalizing marine mammals (particularly sperm whales) in the vicinity of 
the exercise. The sonobuoys shall be re-seeded as necessary throughout 
the exercise. Additionally, passive sonar onboard submarines may be 
utilized to detect any vocalizing marine mammals in the area. The OCE 
would be informed of any aural detection of marine mammals and would 
include this information in the determination of when it is safe to 
commence the exercise.
    (4) On each day of the exercise, aerial surveillance of the 
exclusion and safety zones shall commence 2 hours prior to the first 
firing.
    (5) The results of all visual, aerial, and acoustic searches shall 
be reported immediately to the OCE. No weapons launches or firing may 
commence until the OCE declares the safety and exclusion zones free of 
marine mammals.
    (6) If a protected species observed within the exclusion zone is 
diving, firing shall be delayed until the animal is re-sighted outside 
the exclusion zone, or 30 minutes have elapsed. After 30 minutes, if the 
animal has not been re-sighted it would be assumed to have left the 
exclusion zone.
    (7) During breaks in the exercise of 30 minutes or more, the 
exclusion zone shall again be surveyed for any protected species. If 
marine mammals are sighted within the exclusion zone, the OCE shall be 
notified, and the procedure described in paragraph (a)(3)(x)(C)(6 ) of 
this section would be followed.
    (8) Upon sinking of the vessel, a final surveillance of the 
exclusion zone shall be monitored for 2 hours, or until sunset, to 
verify that no marine mammals were harmed.
    (D) Aerial surveillance shall be conducted using helicopters or 
other aircraft based on necessity and availability. The Navy has several 
types of aircraft capable of performing this task; however, not all 
types are available for every exercise. For each exercise, the available 
asset best suited for identifying objects on and near the surface of the 
ocean would be used. These aircraft would be capable of flying at the 
slow safe speeds necessary to enable viewing of marine vertebrates with 
unobstructed, or minimally obstructed, downward and outward visibility. 
The exclusion and safety zone surveys may be cancelled in the event that 
a mechanical problem, emergency search and rescue, or other similar and 
unexpected event preempts the use of one of the aircraft onsite for the 
exercise.
    (E) Where practicable, the Navy shall conduct the exercise in sea 
states that are ideal for marine mammal sighting, i.e., Beaufort Sea 
State 3 or less. In the event of a 4 or above, survey efforts shall be 
increased within the zones. This shall be accomplished through the use 
of an additional aircraft, if available, and conducting tight search 
patterns.
    (F) The exercise shall not be conducted unless the exclusion zone 
can be adequately monitored visually.
    (G) In the event that any marine mammals are observed to be harmed 
in the area, a detailed description of the animal shall be taken, the 
location noted, and if possible, photos taken. This information shall be 
provided to NMFS via the Navy's regional environmental coordinator for 
purposes of identification (see the Stranding Plan for detail).
    (H) An after action report detailing the exercise's time line, the 
time the surveys commenced and terminated, amount, and types of all 
ordnance expended, and the results of survey efforts for each event 
shall be submitted to NMFS.
    (xi) Extended Echo Ranging/Improved Extended Echo Ranging (EER/IEER/
AEER):
    (A) Crews shall conduct visual reconnaissance of the drop area prior 
to laying their intended sonobuoy pattern. This search shall be 
conducted at an altitude below 457 m (500 yd) at a slow speed, if 
operationally feasible and weather conditions permit. In dual aircraft 
operations, crews are allowed to conduct coordinated area clearances.
    (B) For IEER (AN/SSQ-110A), crews shall conduct a minimum of 30 
minutes

[[Page 121]]

of visual and aural monitoring of the search area prior to commanding 
the first post detonation. This 30-minute observation period may include 
pattern deployment time.
    (C) For any part of the briefed pattern where a post (source/
receiver sonobuoy pair) will be deployed within 914 m (1,000 yd) of 
observed marine mammal activity, the Navy shall deploy the receiver ONLY 
and monitor while conducting a visual search. When marine mammals are no 
longer detected within 914 m (1,000 yd) of the intended post position, 
the Navy shall co-locate the explosive source sonobuoy (AN/SSQ-110A) 
(source) with the receiver.
    (D) When able, Navy crews shall conduct continuous visual and aural 
monitoring of marine mammal activity. This is to include monitoring of 
own-aircraft sensors from first sensor placement to checking off station 
and out of RF range of these sensors.
    (E) Aural Detection--If the presence of marine mammals is detected 
aurally, then that shall cue the Navy aircrew to increase the diligence 
of their visual surveillance. Subsequently, if no marine mammals are 
visually detected, then the crew may continue multi-static active 
search.
    (F) Visual Detection--If marine mammals are visually detected within 
914 m (1,000 yd) of the explosive source sonobuoy (AN/SSQ-110A) intended 
for use, then that payload shall not be detonated. Aircrews may utilize 
this post once the marine mammals have not been re-sighted for 30 
minutes, or are observed to have moved outside the 914 m (1,000 yd) 
safety buffer. Aircrews may shift their multi-static active search to 
another post, where marine mammals are outside the 914 m (1,000 yd) 
safety buffer.
    (G) For IEER (AN/SSQ-110A), aircrews shall make every attempt to 
manually detonate the unexploded charges at each post in the pattern 
prior to departing the operations area by using the ``Payload 1 
Release'' command followed by the ``Payload 2 Release'' command. 
Aircrews shall refrain from using the ``Scuttle'' command when two 
payloads remain at a given post. Aircrews will ensure that a 914 m 
(1,000 yd) safety buffer, visually clear of marine mammals, is 
maintained around each post as is done during active search operations.
    (H) Aircrews shall only leave posts with unexploded charges in the 
event of a sonobuoy malfunction, an aircraft system malfunction, or when 
an aircraft must immediately depart the area due to issues such as fuel 
constraints, inclement weather, and in-flight emergencies. In these 
cases, the sonobuoy will self-scuttle using the secondary or tertiary 
method.
    (I) The Navy shall ensure all payloads are accounted for. Explosive 
source sonobuoys (AN/SSQ-110A) that can not be scuttled shall be 
reported as unexploded ordnance via voice communications while airborne, 
then upon landing via naval message.
    (J) Marine mammal monitoring shall continue until out of own-
aircraft sensor range.
    (4) The Navy shall abide by the letter of the ``Stranding Response 
Plan for Major Navy Training Exercises in the SOCAL Range Complex'' 
(available at: http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/permits/incidental.htm), 
which is incorporated herein by reference, to include the following 
measures:
    (i) Shutdown Procedures--When an Uncommon Stranding Event (USE--
defined in Sec. 216.271) occurs during a Major Training Exercise (MTE) 
(as defined in the Stranding Plan, meaning including Sustainment, 
SHAREM, IAC2, JTFEX, or COMPTUEX) in the SOCAL Range Complex, the Navy 
shall implement the procedures described below.
    (A) The Navy shall implement a Shutdown (as defined Sec. 216.271) 
when advised by a NMFS Office of Protected Resources Headquarters Senior 
Official designated in the SOCAL Range Complex Stranding Communication 
Protocol that a USE involving live animals has been identified and that 
at least one live animal is located in the water. NMFS and Navy shall 
communicate, as needed, regarding the identification of the USE and the 
potential need to implement shutdown procedures.
    (B) Any shutdown in a given area shall remain in effect in that area 
until NMFS advises the Navy that the subject(s) of the USE at that area 
die or are euthanized, or that all live animals involved in the USE at 
that area have

[[Page 122]]

left the area (either of their own volition or herded).
    (C) If the Navy finds an injured or dead marine mammal floating at 
sea during an MTE, the Navy shall notify NMFS immediately or as soon as 
operational security considerations allow. The Navy shall provide NMFS 
with species or description of the animal(s), the condition of the 
animal(s) including carcass condition if the animal(s) is/are dead), 
location, time of first discovery, observed behaviors (if alive), and 
photo or video (if available). Based on the information provided, NMFS 
shall determine if, and advise the Navy whether a modified shutdown is 
appropriate on a case-by-case basis.
    (D) In the event, following a USE, that: (a) Qualified individuals 
are attempting to herd animals back out to the open ocean and animals 
are not willing to leave, or (b) animals are seen repeatedly heading for 
the open ocean but turning back to shore, NMFS and the Navy shall 
coordinate (including an investigation of other potential anthropogenic 
stressors in the area) to determine if the proximity of MFAS/HFAS 
activities or explosive detonations, though farther than 14 nm from the 
distressed animal(s), is likely decreasing the likelihood that the 
animals return to the open water. If so, NMFS and the Navy shall further 
coordinate to determine what measures are necessary to further minimize 
that likelihood and implement those measures as appropriate.
    (ii) Within 72 hours of NMFS notifying the Navy of the presence of a 
USE, the Navy shall provide available information to NMFS (per the SOCAL 
Range Complex Communication Protocol) regarding the location, number and 
types of acoustic/explosive sources, direction and speed of units using 
MFAS/HFAS, and marine mammal sightings information associated with 
training activities occurring within 80 nm (148 km) and 72 hours prior 
to the USE event. Information not initially available regarding the 80 
nm (148 km), 72 hours, period prior to the event shall be provided as 
soon as it becomes available. The Navy shall provide NMFS investigative 
teams with additional relevant unclassified information as requested, if 
available.
    (iii) Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)--The Navy and NMFS shall develop 
a MOA, or other mechanism consistent with federal fiscal law 
requirements (and all other applicable laws), that will establish a 
framework whereby the Navy can (and provide the Navy examples of how 
they can best) assist NMFS with stranding investigations in certain 
circumstances.

Plan Report, if that is how the Navy chooses to submit the information) 
if submitted within 3 months of receipt. These reports will be 
considered final after the Navy has addressed NMFS' comments or provided 
the requested information, or three months after the submittal of the 
draft if NMFS does not comment by then.
    (k) In 2011, the Navy shall convene a Monitoring Workshop in which 
the Monitoring Workshop participants will be asked to review the Navy's 
Monitoring Plans and monitoring results and make individual 
recommendations (to the Navy and NMFS) of ways of improving the 
Monitoring Plans. The recommendations shall be reviewed by the Navy, in 
consultation with NMFS, and

[[Page 126]]

modifications to the Monitoring Plan shall be made, as appropriate.

Sec. 216.276  Applications for Letters of Authorization.

    To incidentally take marine mammals pursuant to the regulations in 
this subpart, the U.S. citizen (as defined by Sec. 216.103) conducting 
the activity identified in Sec. 216.270(c) (the U.S. Navy) must apply 
for and obtain either an initial Letter of Authorization in accordance 
with Sec. 216.277 or a renewal under Sec. 216.278.


<R05>
Sec. 216.277  Letters of Authorization.

    (a) A Letter of Authorization, unless suspended or revoked, will be 
valid for a period of time not to exceed the periods of validity of this 
subpart, but may be renewed or modified sooner subject to the renewal 
conditions in Sec. 216.278 and the modification conditions in Sec. 
216.279.
    (b) Each Letter of Authorization will set forth:
    (1) Permissible methods of incidental taking;
    (2) Means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on the 
species, its habitat, and on the availability of the species for 
subsistence uses (i.e., mitigation); and
    (3) Requirements for mitigation, monitoring and reporting.
    (c) Issuance and renewal of the Letter of Authorization will be 
based on a determination that the total number of marine mammals taken 
by the activity as a whole will have no more than a negligible impact on 
the affected species or stock of marine mammal(s).

    (d) Violate, or fail to comply with, the terms, conditions, and 
requirements of this subpart or a LOA issued under Sec. Sec. 216.106 
and 217.17 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 217.15  Mitigation.

    (a) The activity identified in Sec. 217.11(a) of this chapter must 
be conducted in a manner that minimizes, to the greatest extent 
practicable, adverse impacts on marine mammals and their habitats. When 
conducting the activities identified in Sec. 217.11(a) of this chapter, 
the mitigation measures contained in the LOA issued under Sec. Sec. 
216.106 and 217.17 of this chapter must be implemented. These mitigation 
measures include but are not limited to:
    (1) Limiting the location of the authorized fireworks displays to 
the four specifically designated areas at Half Moon Bay, the Santa Cruz/
Soquel area, the northeastern Monterey Breakwater, and Cambria (Santa 
Rosa Creek);
    (2) Limiting the frequency of authorized fireworks displays to no 
more than twenty total displays per year and no more than one fireworks 
display every 2 months in each of the four prescribed areas;
    (3) Limiting the duration of authorized individual fireworks 
displays to no longer than 30 minutes each, with the exception of two 
longer shows not to exceed 1 hour;
    (4) Prohibiting fireworks displays at MBNMS between March 1 and June 
30 of any year; and
    (5) Continuing to implement authorization requirements and general 
and special restrictions for each event, as determined by MBNMS. 
Standard requirements include, but are not limited to, the use of a 
ramp-up period, wherein salutes are not allowed in the first 5 minutes 
of the display; the removal of plastic and aluminum labels and 
wrappings; and post-show reporting and cleanup. MBNMS shall continue to 
assess displays and restrict the number of aerial salute effects on a 
case-by-case basis, and shall implement general and special restrictions 
unique to each fireworks event as necessary.
    (b) The mitigation measures that the individuals conducting the 
fireworks are responsible for will be included as a requirement in 
fireworks display authorizations issued by MBNMS to the individual 
entities.


<R05>
Sec. 217.16  Requirements for monitoring and reporting.

    (a) MBNMS is responsible for ensuring that all monitoring required 
under a LOA is conducted appropriately, including, but not limited to:
    (1) A census of all pinnipeds in the impact area on the day prior to 
all displays, with observations to occur for no less than 30 minutes, 
and
    (2) Reporting to NMFS of all marine mammal injury, serious injury, 
or mortality observed in the vicinity of the display area. Monitoring 
for injury, serious injury, or mortality shall occur no later than the 
morning after each fireworks display, and shall occur for no less than 
30 minutes.
    (b) Unless specified otherwise in the LOA, MBNMS must submit a draft 
annual monitoring report to the Director, Office of Protected Resources, 
NMFS, no later than 60 days after the conclusion of each calendar year. 
This report must contain:
    (1) An estimate of the number of marine mammals disturbed by the 
authorized activities,
    (2) Results of the monitoring required in Sec. 217.16(a) of this 
chapter, and any additional information required by the LOA. A final 
annual monitoring report must be submitted to NMFS within 30 days after 
receiving comments from NMFS on the draft report. If no comments are 
received from NMFS, the draft report will be considered to be the final 
annual monitoring report.
    (c) A draft comprehensive monitoring report on all marine mammal 
monitoring conducted during the period of these regulations must be 
submitted to the Director, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS at least 
120 days prior to expiration of these regulations. A final comprehensive 
monitoring report must be submitted to the NMFS within

[[Page 130]]

30 days after receiving comments from NMFS on the draft report. If no 
comments are received from NMFS, the draft report will be considered to 
be the final comprehensive monitoring report.


<R05>
Sec. 217.17  Letters of Authorization.

    (a) To incidentally take marine mammals pursuant to these 
regulations, MBNMS must apply for and obtain a LOA.
    (b) A LOA, unless suspended or revoked, may be effective for a 
period of time not to exceed the expiration date of these regulations.
    (c) If an LOA expires prior to the expiration date of these 
regulations, MBNMS must apply for and obtain a renewal of the LOA.
    (d) In the event of projected changes to the activity or to 
mitigation and monitoring measures required by an LOA, MBNMS must apply 
for and obtain a modification of the LOA as described in Sec. 217.18 of 
this chapter.
    (e) The LOA shall set forth:
    (1) Permissible methods of incidental taking;
    (2) Means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact (i.e., 
mitigation) on the species, its habitat, and on the availability of the 
species for subsistence uses; and
    (3) Requirements for monitoring and reporting.
    (f) Issuance of the LOA shall be based on a determination that the 
level of taking will be consistent with the findings made for the total 
taking allowable under these regulations.
    (g) Notice of issuance or denial of a LOA shall be published in the

<R05>
Sec. 217.18  Renewals and modifications of Letters of Authorization.

    (a) A LOA issued under Sec. Sec. 216.106 and 217.17 of this chapter 
for the activity identified in Sec. 217.11(a) of this chapter shall be 
renewed or modified upon request by the applicant, provided that:
    (1) The proposed specified activity and mitigation, monitoring, and 
reporting measures, as well as the anticipated impacts, are the same as 
those described and analyzed for these regulations (excluding changes 
made pursuant to the adaptive management provision in Sec. 217.18(c)(1) 
of this chapter), and
    (2) NMFS determines that the mitigation, monitoring, and reporting 
measures required by the previous LOA under these regulations were 
implemented.

include changes to the activity or the mitigation, monitoring, or 
reporting (excluding changes made pursuant to the adaptive management 
provision in Sec. 217.18(c)(1) of this chapter) that do not change the 
findings made for the regulations or result in no more than a minor 
change in the total estimated number of takes (or distribution by 
species or years), NMFS may publish a notice of proposed LOA in the 
Federal Register, including the associated analysis illustrating the 
change, and solicit public comment before issuing the LOA .
    (c) A LOA issued under Sec. Sec. 217.106 and 217.17 of this chapter 
for the activity identified in Sec. 217.11(a) of this chapter may be 
modified by NMFS under the following circumstances:
    (1) Adaptive Management--NMFS may modify (including augment) the 
existing mitigation, monitoring, or reporting measures (after consulting 
with MBNMS regarding the practicability of the modifications) if doing 
so creates a reasonable likelihood of more effectively accomplishing the 
goals of the mitigation and monitoring set forth in the preamble for 
these regulations.
    (i) Possible sources of data that could contribute to the decision 
to modify the mitigation, monitoring, or reporting measures in an LOA:
    (A) Results from MBNMS's monitoring from the previous year(s).
    (B) Results from other marine mammal and/or sound research or 
studies.
    (C) Any information that reveals marine mammals may have been taken 
in a manner, extent or number not authorized by these regulations or 
subsequent LOAs.
    (ii) If, through adaptive management, the modifications to the 
mitigation, monitoring, or reporting measures are

[[Page 131]]

substantial, NMFS will publish a notice of proposed LOA in the Federal 
Register and solicit public comment.
    (2) Emergencies--If NMFS determines that an emergency exists that 
poses a significant risk to the well-being of the species or stocks of 
marine mammals specified in Sec. 217.13(b) of this chapter, an LOA may 
be modified without prior notice or opportunity for public comment. 
Notification would be published in the Federal Register within 30 days 
of the action.

and 217.76 must be implemented. These mitigation measures include (but 
are not limited to):
    (1) Security overflights by helicopter associated with a launch will 
not approach occupied pinniped haulouts on Ugak Island by closer than 
0.25 mile (0.4 km), and will maintain a vertical distance of 1000 ft 
(305 m) from the haulouts when within 0.5 miles (0.8 km), unless 
indications of human presence or activity warrant closer inspection of 
the area to assure that national security interests are protected in 
accordance with law;
    (2) For missile and rocket launches, holders of Letters of 
Authorization must avoid launches during the harbor seal pupping season 
of May 15 through

[[Page 132]]

mammal abundance quarterly surveys must maintain a minimum altitude of 
500 ft (152 m) and remain 0.25 miles from recognized seal haulouts.
    (4) If launch monitoring or quarterly aerial surveys indicate that 
the distribution, size, or productivity of the potentially affected 
pinniped populations has been affected due to the specified activity, 
the launch procedures and the monitoring methods will be reviewed, in 
cooperation with NMFS, and, if necessary, appropriate changes may be 
made through modifications to a given LOA, prior to conducting the next 
launch of the same vehicle under that LOA.
    (5) Additional mitigation measures as contained in a Letter of 
Authorization.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 217.75  Requirements for monitoring and reporting.

    (a) Holders of Letters of Authorization issued pursuant to 
Sec. Sec. 216.106 of this chapter and 217.76 for activities described 
in Sec. 217.70(a) are required to cooperate with NMFS, and any other 
Federal, State, or local agency with authority to monitor the impacts of 
the activity on marine mammals. Unless specified otherwise in the Letter 
of Authorization, the Holder of the Letter of Authorization must notify 
the Administrator, Alaska Region, NMFS, by letter, e-mail or telephone, 
prior to each launch. If the authorized activity identified in Sec. 
217.70(a) is thought to have resulted in the take of marine mammals not 
identified in Sec. 217.70(b), then the Holder of the Letter of 
Authorization must notify the Director, Office of Protected Resources, 
NMFS, or designee, by telephone (301-713-2289), within 48 hours of the 
discovery of the take.
    (b) Holders of Letters of Authorization must designate qualified 
protected species observers, approved in advance by NMFS, as specified 
in the Letter of Authorization, to:
    (1) Deploy for AAC a remote camera system designed to detect 
pinniped responses to rocket launches for at least the first five 
launches conducted under these regulations. AAC will conduct visual 
monitoring for at least 2 hours before, during, and 2 hours after 
launch;
    (2) Ensure a remote camera system will be in place and operating in 
a location which allows visual monitoring of a harbor seal rookery, if a 
launch during the harbor seal pupping season cannot be avoided;
    (3) Relocate the camera system to or re-aim the camera system on 
another haulout to be chosen in cooperation with NMFS after the first 
five launches with harbor seals present;
    (4) Review and log pinniped presence, behavior, and re-occupation 
time data from the visual footage obtained from the remote camera system 
and report results to NMFS within 90 days post launch;
    (5) Obtain, whenever a new class of rocket is flown from the Kodiak 
Launch Complex, a real-time sound pressure and sound exposure record for 
documentation purposes and to correlate with the behavioral response 
record. Two monitors shall be used: one shall be placed at the 
established recording location known as Narrow Cape, and the other as 
close as practical to the remote video system;
    (6) Conduct quarterly aerial surveys, ideally during midday 
coinciding with low tide, to obtain data on pinniped presence, 
abundance, and behavior within the action area to determine long-term

and 50 individuals during the 5-year rule, for Atlantic bottlenose 
dolphins.
    (d) The U.S. Air Force shall suspend NEODS training operations until 
it obtains additional authorization for the take of marine mammals if:
    (1) A marine mammal is injured, seriously injured, or killed during 
training operations;
    (2) The injury, serious injury, or death could be associated with 
the activities; and
    (3) After coordination and concurrence with NMFS, the U.S. Air Force 
determines that supplementary measures are unlikely to reduce the risk 
of injury, serious injury or death to a very low level, require the U.S. 
Air Force to suspend its activities until an authorization for such 
taking has been obtained.

<R05>
Sec. 217.84  Mitigation.

    (a) The activity identified in Sec. 217.80(a) must be conducted in 
a manner that minimizes, to the greatest extent practicable, adverse 
impacts on marine mammals and their habitats. When conducting operations 
identified in Sec. 217.80(a), the mitigation measures contained in the 
Letter of Authorization issued under Sec. Sec. 216.106 of this chapter 
and 217.87 must be implemented. These mitigation measures include (but 
are not limited to):
    (1) Underwater detonations using timed delay devices will only be 
conducted during daylight hours. The time of detonation shall be limited 
to an hour after sunrise and an hour before sunset.
    (2) NEODS missions shall be postponed if:
    (i) The Beaufort sea state is greater than scale number three. Such 
a delay would maximize detection of marine mammals.
    (ii) Large concentrations of fish, jellyfish, and/or large Sargassum 
rafts are observed within the mitigation-monitoring zone. The delay 
would continue until the fish, jellyfish, and/or Sargassum rafts that 
cause the postponement are confirmed to be outside the mitigation-
monitoring zone.
    (3) Time delays longer than 10 minutes will not be used. Initiation 
of the timer device will not start until the mitigation-monitoring zone 
is clear of marine mammals for 30 minutes.
    (4) A calculated mitigation-monitoring zone will be established 
around each underwater detonation location based on charge weight and 
length of time-delay used. When conducting surveys within the 
mitigation-monitoring zone radius (but always outside the detonation 
plume radius/human safety zone) and travel in a circular pattern around 
the detonation point, surveying the inner (toward the detonation site) 
and outer (away from the detonation site) areas. For a survey radius of 
914.4 meters, the boat will be positioned at 457.2 meters from the 
detonation point. Similarly, for a survey radius of 1,280.2 meters, 
boats will be positioned at 640.1 meter distance.
    (5) For a survey radius of 914.4 meters, two boats are required. For 
a radius of 1,280.2 meters, either three boats or two boats/one 
helicopter are required.
    (6) When using two boats, each boat will be positioned on opposite 
sides of the detonation location, separated by 180 degrees. When using 
three boats, each boat will be separated by 120 degrees (equidistant 
from each other).
    (7) Two observers in each boat will conduct continuous visual 
surveys of the mitigation-monitoring zone for the entire duration of the 
training event, including at least 30 minutes prior to detonation. 
Observers will search the mitigation-monitoring zone for the presence of 
marine mammals, and other marine species such as sea turtles, diving 
birds, large concentrations of fish or jellyfish, and large Sargassum 
mats. The presence of diving birds, fish, jellyfish, and Sargassum may 
indicate an increased likelihood of dolphin presence.
    (8) To the extent practicable, boats will maintain 18.5 kilometer 
per hour search speed. This search speed is expected to ensure adequate 
coverage of the buffer zone. While weather conditions and sea state may 
require slower speeds in some instances, 18.5 kilometers per hour is 
considered a prudent, safe, and executable speed that will allow 
adequate surveillance. For a 914.4 meter survey zone, a boat traveling 
at 18.5 kilometers per hour and 457.2 meters from the detonation point 
would circle the point approximately 3.2 times during a 30 minute survey 
period. By using two boats, approximately 6.4 circles would be completed 
in total. Similarly, for a 1,280.2 meter radius, each boat would circle 
the detonation point approximately 2.3 times within 30 minutes, and use 
of three boats would result in 6.9 total circles.
    (9) If available, a U.S. Navy helicopter can be used in lieu of one 
of the survey boats, so long as safety of flight is not jeopardized. 
U.S. Navy helicopter pilots are trained to conduct searches for 
relatively small objects in the water, such as a missing person. A 
helicopter search pattern is dictated by standard U.S. Navy protocols 
and accounts for multiple variables, such as size and shape of the 
search area, size of the object, and environmental conditions, among 
others.

[[Page 137]]

    (10) The mitigation-monitoring zone will be surveyed for 30 minutes 
prior to detonation and continue for 30 minutes after detonation 
(concentrated on the area down current of the test site), in order to 
monitor for marine mammals and other protected species. It is the U.S. 
Air Force's (on behalf of the U.S. Navy) intent to conduct five 
successive detonations with a maximum time of 20 minutes between 
detonations, although a variety of factors can cause a delay of longer 
than 20 minutes between detonations, although a variety of factors can 
cause a delay of longer than 20 minutes, including a delay until the 
following day. Monitoring would continue during the 20 minutes time 
between detonations, and would serve as both post-detonation monitoring 
as well as pre-mission monitoring for the next detonation. If the time 
between detonations is delayed beyond 20 minutes, post-mission 
monitoring will be conducted for 30 minutes. At the conclusion of the 
final detonation, post-monitoring will be conducted for 30 minutes.
    (11) Other personnel besides designated observers shall also 
maintain situational awareness of the presence of marine mammals within 
the mitigation-monitoring zone to the extent practicable given dive 
safety considerations.
    (12) Divers placing the charges on mines will observe the immediate 
underwater area around the detonation site for marine mammals and other 
marine species such as diving birds, sea turtles, and Gulf sturgeon, and 
report sightings to surface observers.
    (13) If a marine mammal is sighted within an established mitigation-
monitoring zone or moving towards it, underwater detonation events will 
be postponed or suspended until the marine mammal that caused the 
postponement/suspension of training operations has voluntarily left the 
area and the area is clear of marine mammals for at least 30 minutes.
    (14) If a marine mammal is detected within or about to enter an 
established mitigation-monitoring zone and subsequently cannot be 
reacquired, the mission will be postponed or suspended until the last 
verified location is outside the mitigation-monitoring zone, the animals 
is moving away from the area, and the area is clear of marine mammals 
for at least 30 minutes.
    (15) Any marine mammal observed after an underwater detonation 
either injured or exhibiting signs of distress will be reported to Eglin 
Air Force Base. Eglin Air Force Base will coordinate with other members 
of marine mammal stranding networks, as appropriate, and report these 
events to NMFS or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The report will 
contain date and time of sighting, location, species description, and 
indications of the animal's status.
    (16) Training operations shall be suspended if the conditions of 
Sec. 217.83(a)-(d) regarding the injury, serious injury, or death of a 
marine mammal during NEODS training operations are met.
    (17) Additional mitigation measures as contained in a Letter of 
Authorization.
    (b) [Reserved]

Sec. 217.85  Requirements for monitoring and reporting.

    (a) Holders of Letters of Authorization pursuant to Sec. 216.106 of 
this chapter and Sec. 217.87 for activities described in Sec. 
216.80(a) are required to cooperate with NMFS, and any other Federal, 
state, or local agency with authority to monitor the impacts of the 
activity on marine mammals. Unless specified otherwise in the Letter of 
Authorization, the Holder of the Letter of Authorization must notify the 
Administrator, Southeast Region, NMFS, by letter or telephone, prior to 
activities possibly involving the taking of marine mammals. If the 
authorized activity identified in Sec. 217.80(a) is thought to have 
resulted in the mortality or injury of any marine mammals or in any take 
of marine mammals not identified in Sec. 217.80(b), then the Holder of 
the Letter of Authorization must, in addition to complying with the 
requirements of Sec. 217.82(a)-(d), notify the Director, Office of 
Protected Resources, NMFS, or designee, by telephone (301-427-8400), 
within 24 hours of the discovery of the injured or dead animal.
    (b) Holders of Letters of Authorization must designate trained, 
qualified, on-site individuals approved in advance by NMFS, as specified 
in the Letter of

[[Page 138]]

Authorization, to perform the following monitoring requirements:
    (1) For NEODS testing, areas to be used in missions shall be 
visually monitored for marine mammal presence from a surface support 
vessel prior to detonation of mine neutralization charges. Monitoring 
shall be conducted 30 minutes before missions to clear the mitigation-
monitoring zone. Post-mission monitoring shall also be conducted for 30 
minutes after the final detonation (concentrated on the area down 
current of the test site). If marine mammals are inside the mitigation-
monitoring zone, detonations shall be postponed until they have left the 
area. The observer on the vessel must be equipped with the proper 
optical equipment and lines of communication in order to recommend the 
decision to move forward with the mission.
    (2) Monitoring shall occur pre-mission (for 30 minutes), throughout 
the mission, and post-mission (for 30 minutes). Post-mission monitoring 
shall concentrate on the area down current of the test site.
    (3) Survey clearance procedures shall be conducted using best 
operational methods possible. After the mitigation-monitoring zone is 
cleared, all dolphins and protected species indicators (e.g., Sargassum 
rafts) shall be avoided to the maximum extent possible.
    (4) Clearance procedures shall be re-conducted if dolphins or 
protected species indicators (e.g., Sargassum rafts) are encountered.
    (5) After conducting post-mission monitoring, NEODS training 
operations data as required by Eglin Air Force Base's Natural Resources 
Section, 96 CEG/CEVSN shall be reported. Post-mission monitoring shall 
commence immediately following each detonation and shall be concentrated 
on the area down current of the test site. If any injured or dead marine 
mammals are observed, that information will be reported and coordinated 
with marine animals stranding networks.
    (6) An annual summary (coordinated through 96 CEG/CEVSN) of mission 
observations shall be submitted to: NMFS, Southeast Regional Office, 
Protected Resources Division, 9721 Executive Center Drive North, St. 
Petersburg, Florida 33702; and NMFS, Office of Protected Resources, 1315 
East West Highway, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910.
    (c) Holders of Letters of Authorization must conduct additional 
monitoring as required under an annual Letter of Authorization.
    (d) Holders of Letters of Authorization must submit an annual report 
summarizing the specified activity as well as monitoring and mitigation 
data to the Southeast Regional Administrator and Director of the Office 
of Protected Resources, NMFS, within 90 days after the conclusion of the 
NEODS training operations. This report must contain the following 
information:
    (1) Date(s), time(s), and location(s) of explosive activities,
    (2) Design of the monitoring program,
    (3) Results of the monitoring program including, but not necessarily 
limited to:
    (i) Species counts,
    (ii) Numbers of observed disturbances,
    (iii) Descriptions of the disturbance behaviors before, during, and 
after explosive activities,
    (iv) Bearing and distances,
    (v) Observations of unusual behaviors, numbers, or distributions of 
marine mammals in the activity area shall be reported to NMFS and the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service so that any potential follow-up 
observations can be conducted by the appropriate personnel. In addition, 
observations of tag-bearing marine mammals, sea turtles, and fish 
carcasses as well as any rare or unusual species of marine mammals and 
fish shall be reported to NMFS and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
    (e) An annual report (referred to in Sec. 217.85(d)) must be 
submitted at the time of notification of the renewal of the Letter of 
Authorization.
    (f) A draft comprehensive final report must be submitted at least 
180 days prior to expiration of these regulations. This comprehensive 
technical report shall provide full documentation of methods, results, 
and interpretation of all monitoring during the first four

[[Page 139]]

and a half years of the Letter of Authorization. A revised final 
comprehensive technical report, including all monitoring results during 
the entire period of the Letters of Authorization, must be submitted 90 
days after the end of the period of effectiveness of the regulations. 
This report shall summarize the activities undertaken and the results 
reported in all previous reports.
    (g)(1) In the unanticipated event that the specified activity 
clearly causes the take of a marine mammal in a manner prohibited by a 
Letter of Authorization, such as an injury, serious injury, or 
mortality, Eglin Air Force Base will immediately cease the specified 
activities and immediately report the incident to the Chief of the 
Permits and Conservation Division, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS 
at 301-427-8401 and/or by email to Jolie.Harrison@noaa.gov and 
Howard.Goldstein@noaa.gov, and the NMFS Southeast Regional Marine Mammal 
Stranding Network at 877-433-8299 (Blair.Mase@noaa.gov and 
Erin.Fougeres@noaa.gov) (Florida Marine Mammal Stranding Hotline at 888-
404-3922). The report must include the following information:
    (i) Time, date, and location (latitude/longitude) of the incident;
    (ii) Description of the incident;
    (iii) Status of all noise-generating source use in the 24 hours 
preceding the incident;
    (iv) Water depth;
    (v) Environmental conditions (e.g., wind speed and direction, 
Beaufort sea state, cloud cover, and visibility);
    (vi) Description of all marine mammal observations in the 24 hours 
preceding the incident;
    (vii) Species identification or description of the animal(s) 
involved;
    (viii) Fate of the animal(s); and
    (ix) Photographs or video footage of the animal(s) (if equipment is 
available).
    Activities shall not resume until NMFS is able to review the 
circumstances of the prohibited take. NMFS shall work with Eglin Air 
Force Base to determine what is necessary to minimize the likelihood of 
further prohibited take and ensure MMPA compliance. Eglin Air Force Base 
may not resume their activities until notified by NMFS via letter or 
email, or telephone.
    (2) In the event that Eglin Air Force Base discovers an injured or 
dead marine mammal, and the lead observer determines that the cause of 
injury or death is unknown and the death is relatively recent (i.e., 
less than a moderate state of decomposition as described in the next 
paragraph), Eglin Air Force Base will immediately report the incident to 
the Chief of the Permits and Conservation Division, Office of Protected 
Resources, NMFS, at 301-427-8401, and/or by email to 
Jolie.Harrison@noaa.gov and Howard.Goldstein@noaa.gov and the NMFS 
Southeast Region Marine Mammal Stranding Network (877-433-8299) and/or 
by email to the Southeast Regional Stranding Coordinator 
(Blair.Mase@noaa.gov) and Southeast Regional Stranding Program 
Administrator (Erin.Fougeres@noaa.gov). The report must include the same 
information identified in the paragraph above. Activities may continue 
while NMFS reviews the circumstances of the incident, NMFS will work 
with Eglin Air Force Base to determine whether modifications in the 
activities are appropriate.
    (3) In the event that Eglin Air Force Base discovers an injured or 
dead marine mammal, and the lead observer determines that the injury or 
death is not associated with or related to the activities authorized in 
the Letter of Authorization (e.g., previously wounded animal, carcass 
with moderate to advanced decomposition, or scavenger damage), Eglin Air 
Force Base will report the incident to the Chief of the Permits and 
Conservation Division, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, at 301-427-
8401, and/or by email to Jolie.Harrison@noaa.gov and

<R05>
Sec. 217.174  Mitigation.

    (a) When conducting the activities identified in Sec. 217.170(a), 
the mitigation measures contained in the Letter of Authorization issued 
under Sec. Sec. 216.106 and 217.177 must be implemented. These 
mitigation measures include but are not limited to:
    (1) Major Repairs (May 1-November 30):
    (i) During repairs, if a marine mammal is detected within 0.6 mi (1 
km) of the repair vessel (or acoustically), the vessel superintendent or 
on-deck supervisor shall be notified immediately. The vessel's crew will 
be put on a heightened state of alert. The marine mammal will be 
monitored constantly to determine if it is moving toward the repair 
area.
    (ii) Repair vessels shall cease any movement in the area if a marine 
mammal other than a right whale is sighted within or approaching to a 
distance of 100 yd (91 m) from the operating repair vessel. Repair 
vessels shall cease any movement in the construction area if a right 
whale is sighted within or approaching to a distance of 500 yd (457 m) 
from the operating vessel. Vessels transiting the repair area, such as 
pipe haul barge tugs, shall also be required to maintain these 
separation distances.
    (iii) Repair vessels shall cease all sound emitting activities if a 
marine mammal other than a right whale is sighted within or approaching 
to a distance of 100 yd (91 m) or if a right whale is sighted within or 
approaching to a distance of 500 yd (457 m), from the

[[Page 143]]

operating repair vessel. The back-calculated source level, based on the 
most conservative cylindrical model of acoustic energy spreading, is 
estimated to be 139 dB re 1 [micro]Pa.
    (iv) Repair activities may resume after the marine mammal is 
positively reconfirmed outside the established zones (either 500 yd (457 
m) or 100 yd (91 m), depending upon species) or if the marine mammal has 
not been re-sighted in the established zones for 30 minutes.
    (v) While under way, all repair vessels shall remain 500 yd (457 m) 
away from right whales and 100 yd (91 m) away from all other marine 
mammals, unless constrained by human safety concerns or navigational 
constraints.
    (vi) All repair vessels 300 gross tons or greater must maintain a 
speed of 10 knots (18.5 km/hr) or less. Vessels less than 300 gross tons 
carrying supplies or crew between the shore and the repair site must 
contact the Mandatory Ship Reporting System, the U.S. Coast Guard 
(USCG), or the protected species observers (PSOs) at the repair site 
before leaving shore for reports of recent right whale sightings or 
active Dynamic Management Areas (DMAs) and, consistent with navigation 
safety, restrict speeds to 10 knots (18.5 km/hr) or less within 5 mi (8 
km) of any recent sighting location and within any existing DMA.
    (vii) Vessels transiting through the Cape Cod Canal and Cape Cod Bay 
(CCB) between January 1 and May 15 must reduce speeds to 10 knots (18.5 
km/hr) or less, follow the recommended routes charted by NOAA to reduce 
interactions between right whales and shipping traffic, and avoid 
aggregations of right whales in the eastern portion of CCB.
    (2) Major Repairs (December 1-April 30): If unplanned/emergency 
repair activities cannot be conducted between May 1 and November 30, 
then Neptune shall implement the following mitigation measures in 
addition to those listed in Sec. 217.174(a)(1)(i) through (vii):
    (i) If on-board PSOs do not have at least 0.6-mi (1-km) visibility, 
they shall call for a shutdown of repair activities. If dive operations 
are in progress, then they shall be halted and divers brought on board 
until visibility is adequate to see a 0.6-mi (1-km) range. At the time 
of shutdown, the use of thrusters must be minimized to the lowest level 
needed to maintain personnel safety. If there are potential safety 
problems due to the shutdown, the captain must decide what operations 
can safely be shut down and shall document such activities in the data 
log.
    (ii) Prior to leaving the dock to begin transit, the barge must 
contact one of the PSOs on watch to receive an update of sightings 
within the visual observation area. If the PSO has observed a North 
Atlantic right whale within 30 minutes of the transit start, the vessel 
shall hold for 30 minutes and again seek clearance to leave from the 
PSOs on board. PSOs will assess whale activity and visual observation 
ability at the time of the transit request to clear the barge for 
release and will grant clearance if no North Atlantic right whales have 
been sighted in the last 30 minutes in the visual observation area.
    (iii) Neptune or its contractor shall provide a half-day training 
course to designated crew members assigned to the transit barges and 
other support vessels who will have responsibilities for watching for 
marine mammals. This course shall cover topics including, but not 
limited to, descriptions of the marine mammals found in the area, 
mitigation and monitoring requirements contained in the Letter of 
Authorization, sighting log requirements, and procedures for reporting 
injured or dead marine mammals. These designated crew members shall be 
required to keep watch on the bridge and immediately notify the 
navigator of any whale sightings. All watch crew members shall sign into 
a bridge log book upon start and end of watch. Transit route, 
destination, sea conditions, and any protected species sightings/
mitigation actions during watch shall be recorded in the log book. Any 
whale sightings within 3,281 ft (1,000 m) of the vessel shall result in 
a high alert and slow speed of 4 knots (7.4 km/hr) or less. A sighting 
within 2,461 ft (750 m) shall result in idle speed and/or ceasing all 
movement.
    (iv) The material barges and tugs used for repair work shall transit 
from the operations dock to the work sites during daylight hours, when 
possible,

[[Page 144]]

provided the safety of the vessels is not compromised. Should transit at 
night be required, the maximum speed of the tug shall be 5 knots (9.3 
km/hr).
    (v) Consistent with navigation safety, all repair vessels must 
maintain a speed of 10 knots (18.5 km/hr) or less during daylight hours. 
All vessels shall operate at 5 knots (9.3 km/hr) or less at all times 
within 3.1 mi (5 km) of the repair area.
    (3) Speed Restrictions in Seasonal Management Areas (SMAs): Repair 
vessels and shuttle regasification vessels (SRVs) shall transit at 10 
knots (18.5 km/hr) or less in the following seasons and areas, which 
either correspond to or are more restrictive than the times and areas in 
NMFS' regulations at 50 CFR 224.105 that implement speed restrictions to 
reduce the likelihood and severity of ship strikes of right whales:
    (i) CCB SMA from January 1 through May 15, which includes all waters 
in CCB, extending to all shorelines of the Bay, with a northern boundary 
of 42[deg] 12[min] N. latitude;
    (ii) Off Race Point SMA year round, which is bounded by straight 
lines connecting the following coordinates in the order stated: 
42[deg]30[min] N. 69[deg]45[min] W.; thence to 42[deg]30[min] N. 
70[deg]30[min] W.; thence to 42[deg]12[min] N. 70[deg]30[min] W.; thence 
to 42[deg]12[min] N. 70[deg]12[min] W.; thence to 42[deg]04[min] 
56.5[sec] N. 70[deg]12[min] W.; thence along mean high water line and 
inshore limits of COLREGS limit to a latitude of 41[deg]40[min] N.; 
thence due east to 41[deg]41[min] N. 69[deg]45[min] W.; thence back to 
starting point; and
    (iii) Great South Channel (GSC) SMA from April 1 through July 31, 
which is bounded by straight lines connecting the following coordinates 
in the order stated:

(A) 42[deg]30[min] N. 69[deg]45[min] W.
(B) 41[deg]40[min] N. 69[deg]45[min] W.
(C) 41[deg]00[min] N. 69[deg]05[min] W.
(D) 42[deg]09[min] N. 67[deg]08[min] 24[sec] W.
(E) 42[deg]30[min] N. 67[deg]27[min] W.
(F) 42[deg]30[min] N. 69[deg]45[min] W.

    (4) Additional Mitigation Measures:
    (i) When approaching and departing from the Neptune Port, SRVs shall 
use the Boston Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) starting and ending at 
the entrance to the GSC. Upon entering the TSS, the SRV shall go into a 
``heightened awareness'' mode of operation.
    (ii) In the event that a whale is visually observed within 0.6 mi (1 
km) of the Port or a confirmed acoustic detection is reported on either 
of the two auto-detection buoys (ABs) closest to the Port, departing 
SRVs shall delay their departure from the Port, unless extraordinary 
circumstances, defined in the Marine Mammal Detection, Monitoring, and 
Response Plan (the Plan), require that the departure is not delayed. The 
departure delay shall continue until either the observed whale has been 
visually (during daylight hours) confirmed as more than 0.6 mi (1 km) 
from the Port or 30 minutes have passed without another confirmed 
detection either acoustically within the acoustic detection range of the 
two ABs closest to the Port or visually within 0.6 mi (1 km) from 
Neptune.
    (iii) SRVs that are approaching or departing from the Port and are 
within the Area to be Avoided (ATBA) surrounding Neptune shall remain at 
least 0.6 mi (1 km) away from any visually detected right whales and at 
least 100 yd (91 m) away from all other visually detected whales unless 
extraordinary circumstances, as defined in Section 1.2 of the Plan, 
require that the vessel stay its course. The ATBA is defined in 33 CFR 
150.940. It is the largest area of the Port marked on nautical charts, 
and it is enforceable by the USCG in accordance with the 33 CFR 150.900 
regulations. The Vessel Master shall designate at least one lookout to 
be exclusively and continuously monitoring for the presence of marine 
mammals at all times while the SRV is approaching or departing Neptune.
    (iv) Neptune shall ensure that other vessels providing support to 
Port operations during regasification activities that are approaching or 
departing from the Port and are within the ATBA shall be operated so as 
to remain at least 0.6 mi (1 km) away from any visually detected right 
whales and at least 100 yd (91 m) from all other visually detected 
whales.
    (v) PSOs shall direct a moving vessel to slow to idle if a baleen 
whale is seen less than 0.6 mi (1 km) from the vessel.
    (vi) Use of lights during repair or maintenance activities shall be 
limited

[[Page 145]]

to areas where work is actually occurring, and all other lights must be 
extinguished. Lights must be downshielded to illuminate the deck and 
shall not intentionally illuminate surrounding waters, so as not to 
attract whales or their prey to the area.
    (vii) Neptune must immediately suspend any repair and maintenance or 
operations activities if a dead or injured marine mammal is found in the 
vicinity of the project area, and the death or injury of the animal 
could be attributable to the Port facility activities. Upon finding a 
dead or injured marine mammal, Neptune must contact NMFS, the Northeast 
Stranding and Disentanglement Program, and the USCG. NMFS will review 
the documentation submitted by the PSO and attempt to attribute a cause 
of death. Activities shall not resume until review and approval has been 
given by NMFS.
    (5) Additional mitigation measures as contained in a Letter of 
Authorization issued under Sec. Sec. 216.106 and 217.177 of this 
chapter.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 217.175  Requirements for monitoring and reporting.

    (a) Visual Monitoring Program:
    (1) Neptune shall employ PSOs during maintenance- and repair-related 
activities on each vessel that has a dynamic positioning system. Two (2) 
PSOs shall be on-duty at all times. All PSOs must receive NMFS-approved 
PSO training and be approved in advance by NMFS after a review of their 
qualifications.
    (2) Qualifications for these PSOs shall include direct field 
experience on a marine mammal observation vessel and/or aerial surveys 
in the Atlantic Ocean/Gulf of Mexico.
    (3) The PSOs (one primary and one secondary) are responsible for 
visually locating marine mammals at the ocean's surface and, to the 
extent possible, identifying the species. The primary PSO shall act as 
the identification specialist, and the secondary PSO shall serve as data 
recorder and also assist with identification. Both PSOs shall have 
responsibility for monitoring for the presence of marine mammals.
    (4) The PSOs shall monitor the maintenance/repair area using the 
naked eye, hand-held binoculars, and/or power binoculars.
    (5) The PSOs shall scan the ocean surface during maintenance- and 
repair-related activities and record all sightings in marine mammal 
field sighting logs. Observations of marine mammals shall be identified 
to the species or the lowest taxonomic level possible, and their 
relative position in relation to the vessel shall be recorded.
    (6) While a SRV is navigating within the designated TSS, three 
people have lookout duties on or near the bridge of the ship including 
the SRV Master, the Officer-of-the-Watch, and the Helmsman on watch.
    (7) In addition to standard watch procedures, while the SRV is 
within the ATBA and/or while actively engaging in the use of thrusters, 
an additional lookout shall be designated to exclusively and 
continuously monitor for marine mammals. Once the SRV is moored and 
regasification activities have begun, the vessel is no longer considered 
in ``heightened awareness'' status.
    (8) At the conclusion of regasification activities, when the SRV is 
prepared to depart from the Port, the Master shall once again ensure 
that the responsibilities as defined in the Plan are carried out. All 
sightings of marine mammals by the designated lookout, individuals 
posted to navigational lookout duties, and/or any other crew member 
while the SRV is within the TSS, in transit to the ATBA, within the 
ATBA, and/or when actively engaging in the use of thrusters shall be 
immediately reported to the Officer-of-the-Watch who shall then alert 
the Master.
    (b) Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) Program:
    (1) Neptune shall work with NMFS, Stellwagen Bank National Marine 
Sanctuary (SBNMS), and other scientists to install and monitor an array 
of passive acoustic detection buoys in the Boston TSS that meets the 
criteria specified in the recommendations developed by NOAA through 
consultation

[[Page 146]]

with the USCG under the National Marine Sanctuary Act (NMSA). The system 
shall provide near real-time information on the presence of vocalizing 
whales in the shipping lanes.
    (2) Neptune shall work with NMFS, SBNMS, and other scientists to 
monitor the archival array of acoustic recording units (ARUs), or ``pop-
ups,'' around the Port that meets the criteria specified in the program 
developed by NOAA in consultation with the USCG under the NMSA. The ARUs 
shall remain in place for 5 years following initiation of operations to 
monitor the actual acoustic output of port operations and alert NOAA to 
any unanticipated adverse effects of port operations, such as large-
scale abandonment of the area or greater acoustic impacts than predicted 
through modeling.
    (3) Passive acoustic devices shall be actively monitored for 
detections by a NMFS-approved bioacoustic technician.
    (4) Repair Activity PAM Measures: PAM, in addition to that required 
in this section of these regulations, shall be required, on a case-by-
case basis, during both planned and emergency repair activities in order 
to better detect right whales in the area of repair work and to collect 
additional data on the noise levels produced during repair and 
maintenance activities.
    (i) Neptune shall work with NOAA (NMFS and SBNMS) to evaluate when 
to install and maintain an array of real-time passive acoustic detection 
buoys to provide early warnings for potential occurrence of right whales 
in the vicinity of the repair area. The number of passive acoustic 
detection buoys installed around the activity site, if deemed necessary, 
shall be commensurate with the type and spatial extent of maintenance/
repair work required, but must be sufficient to detect vocalizing right 
whales within the 120-dB impact zone.
    (ii) Neptune shall provide NMFS with empirically measured source 
level data for all sources of noise associated with Port maintenance and 
repair activities. Measurements shall be carefully planned and 
coordinated with noise-producing activities and shall be collected from 
the passive detection network.
    (5) SRV Regasification PAM Measures: Source levels associated with 
dynamic positioning of SRVs at the buoys shall be estimated using 
empirical measurements collected from a platform positioned as close as 
practicable to thrusters while in use.
    (c) Neptune must implement the following reporting requirements:
    (1) Because the Port is within the Mandatory Ship Reporting Area 
(MSRA), all SRVs transiting to and from the Port must report their 
activities to the mandatory reporting section of the USCG to remain 
apprised of North Atlantic right whale movements within the area. All 
vessels entering and exiting the MSRA must report their activities to 
WHALESNORTH. Any North Atlantic right whale sightings must be reported 
to the NMFS Sighting Advisory System.
    (2) Repair work reports. (i) For major repair work associated with 
the pipeline lateral or other port components, Neptune shall notify the 
appropriate NOAA personnel as soon as practicable after it is determined 
that repair work must be conducted.
    (ii) During maintenance and repair of the pipeline lateral or other 
port components, weekly status reports must be provided to NOAA. The 
weekly report must include data collected for each distinct marine 
mammal species observed in the project area during the period of the 
repair activity. The weekly reports shall include the following:
    (A) The location, time, and nature of the pipeline lateral 
activities;
    (B) Whether the dynamic position (DP) system was operated and, if 
so, the number of thrusters used and the time and duration of DP 
operation;
    (C) Marine mammals observed in the area (number, species, age group, 
and initial behavior);
    (D) The distance of observed marine mammals from the repair 
activities;
    (E) Observed marine mammal behaviors during the sighting;
    (F) Whether any mitigation measures were implemented;
    (G) Weather conditions (sea state, wind speed, wind direction, 
ambient temperature, precipitation, and percent cloud cover, etc.);
    (H) Condition of the marine mammal observation (visibility and 
glare); and

[[Page 147]]

    (I) Details of passive acoustic detections and any action taken in 
response to those detections.
    (iii) For all minor repair work, Neptune must notify NOAA regarding 
when and where the repair/maintenance work is to take place along with a 
tentative schedule and description of the work, as soon as practicable 
after it is determined that repair work must be conducted. Vessel crews 
shall record/document any marine mammal sightings during the work 
period.
    (iv) At the conclusion of all minor repair work, Neptune shall 
provide NOAA with a report describing any marine mammal sightings, the 
type of work taking place when the sighting occurred, and any avoidance 
actions taken during the repair/maintenance work.
    (3) Incident reports. During all phases of project repair/
maintenance activities and operation, sightings of any injured or dead 
marine mammals must be reported immediately to the Chief, Permits, 
Conservation and Education Division or staff member and the Northeast 
Stranding and Disentanglement Program, regardless of whether the injury 
or death is caused by project activities. If the injury or death was 
caused by a project vessel (e.g., SRV, support vessel, or construction 
vessel), the USCG must be notified immediately, and a full report must 
be provided to NMFS. Activities will not resume until review and 
approval has been given by NMFS. The report must include the following 
information:
    (i) Time, date, and location (latitude/longitude) of the incident;
    (ii) The name and type of vessel involved;
    (iii) The vessel's speed during the incident;
    (iv) Description of the incident;
    (v) Water depth;
    (vi) Environmental conditions (e.g., wind speed and direction, sea 
state, cloud cover, and visibility);
    (vii) Species identification or description of the animal;
    (viii) The fate of the animal; and
    (ix) Photographs or video footage of the animal (if equipment is 
available).
    (4) Annual reports. (i) An annual report on marine mammal monitoring 
and mitigation shall be submitted to NMFS, Office of Protected 
Resources, and NMFS, Northeast Regional Office (specific contact 
information to be provided in Letter of Authorization), on August 1 of 
each year. The annual report shall cover the time period of January 1 
through December 31 of each year of activity.
    (ii) The annual report shall include data collected for each 
distinct marine mammal species observed in the project area in the 
Massachusetts Bay during the period of Port operations and repair/
maintenance activities. The annual report shall also include a 
description of marine mammal behavior, overall numbers of individuals 
observed, frequency of observation, and any behavioral changes and the 
context of the changes relative to operation and repair/maintenance 
activities. Additional information that shall be recorded by Neptune or 
its contractor during operations and repair/maintenance activities and 
contained in the reports include: results of empirical source level 
estimation for thrusters while in use and activities associated with 
maintenance and repair events, date and time of marine mammal detections 
(visually or acoustically), weather conditions, species identification, 
approximate distance from the source, activity of the vessel when a 
marine mammal is sighted, and whether thrusters were in use and, if so, 
how many at the time of the sighting.
    (5) Five-year comprehensive report. (i) Neptune shall submit a draft 
comprehensive final report to NMFS, Office of Protected Resources, and 
NMFS, Northeast Regional Office (specific contact information to be 
provided in Letter of Authorization), 180 days prior to the expiration 
of the regulations. This comprehensive technical report shall provide 
full documentation of methods, results, and interpretation of all 
monitoring during the first four and a half years of the LOA.
    (ii) Neptune shall submit a revised final comprehensive technical

<R05>
Sec. 217.201  Effective dates.

    Regulations in this subpart are effective from July 15, 2009, 
through July 14, 2014.


<R05>
Sec. 217.202  Permissible methods of taking.

    (a) Under Letters of Authorization issued pursuant to Sec. 216.106 
of this chapter and Sec. 217.207, the Port of Anchorage and MARAD, and 
persons under their authority, may incidentally, but not intentionally, 
take marine mammals by harassment, within the area described in Sec.

    (a) Take any marine mammal not specified in Sec. 217.202(b);
    (b) Take any marine mammal specified in Sec. 217.202(b) other than 
by incidental, unintentional Level B harassment;
    (c) Take a marine mammal specified in Sec. 217.202(b) if such 
taking results in more than a negligible impact on the

[[Page 150]]

species or stocks of such marine mammal; or
    (d) Violate, or fail to comply with, the terms, conditions, and 
requirements of this subpart or a Letter of Authorization issued under 
Sec. 216.106 of this chapter and Sec. 217.207.


<R05>
Sec. 217.204  Mitigation.

    (a) When conducting operations identified in Sec. 217.200(a), the 
mitigation measures contained in the Letter of Authorization, issued 
under Sec. 216.106 of this chapter and Sec. 217.207, must be 
implemented. These mitigation measures are:
    (1) Through monitoring described under Sec. 217.205, the Holder of 
a Letter of Authorization will ensure that no marine mammal is subjected 
to a sound pressure levels of 190 or 180 dB re: 1 microPa or greater for 
pinnipeds and cetaceans, respectively. If a marine mammal is detected 
within or approaching a distance 200 m from in-water pile driving or in-
water chipping, operations shall be immediately delayed or suspended 
until the marine mammal moves outside these designated zones or the 
animal is not detected within 15 minutes of the last sighting.
    (2) If a marine mammal is detected within or approaching the Level B 
harassment zone designated for impact pile driving (350 m) prior to in-
water impact pile driving, operations shall not commence until the 
animal moves outside this zone or it is not detected within 15 minutes 
of the last sighting.
    (3) If a marine mammal is detected within or approaching the Level B 
harassment zone designated for vibratory pile driving (1,300 m) prior to 
in-water vibratory pile driving, operations shall not commence until the 
marine mammal moves outside this zone or it is not detected within 15 
minutes of the last sighting.
    (4) A start'' technique shall be used at the beginning of each day's 
in-water pile driving activities or if pile driving has ceased for more 
than one hour to allow any marine mammal that may be in the immediate 
area to leave before piling driving reaches full energy. For vibratory 
hammers, the soft start requires the holder of the Letter of 
Authorization to initiate noise from the hammers for 15 seconds at 
reduced energy followed by 1-minute waiting period and repeat the 
procedure two additional times. If an impact hammer is used, the soft 
start requires an initial set of three strikes from the impact hammer at 
40 percent energy, followed by a one minute waiting period, then two 
subsequent 3 strike sets.
    (5) In-water pile driving or chipping shall not occur when 
conditions restrict clear, visible detection of all waters within the 
appropriate harassment zones or the 200 m safety zone. Such conditions 
that can impair sightibility include, but are not limited to, fog and 
rough sea state.
    (6) In-water piles will be driven with a vibratory hammer to the 
maximum extent possible (i.e., until a desired depth is achieved or to 
refusal) prior to using an impact hammer.
    (7) In-water impact pile driving shall not occur during the period 
from two hours before low tide until two hours after low tide.
    (8) The following measures apply to all in-water pile driving, 
except during the ``stabbing'' phase, and all in-water chipping 
associated with demolition of the existing dock:
    (i) No in-water pile driving (impact or vibratory) or chipping shall 
occur if any marine mammal is located within 200m of the hammer in any 
direction. If any marine mammal is sighted within or approaching this 
200m safety zone, pile-driving or chipping must be suspended until the 
animal has moved outside the 200m safety zone or the animal is not 
resighted within 15 minutes.
    (ii) If a group of more than 5 beluga whales is sighted within the 
Level B harassment isopleths, in-water pile driving shall be suspended. 
If the group is not re-sighted within 15 minutes, pile driving may 
resume.
    (iii) If a beluga whale calf or group with a calf is sighted within 
or approaching a harassment zone, in-water pile driving shall cease and 
shall not be resumed until the calf or group is confirmed to be outside 
of the harassment zone and moving along a trajectory away from such 
zone. If the calf or group with a calf is not re-sighted within 15 
minutes, pile driving may resume.

[[Page 151]]

    (9) If maximum authorized take is reached or exceeded for a 
particular species, any marine mammal of that species entering into the 
harassment or safety isopleths will trigger mandatory in-water pile 
driving shut down.
    (10) For Port of Anchorage operated in-water heavy machinery work 
other than pile driving or chipping (i.e., dredging, dump scowles, tug 
boats used to move barges, barge mounted hydraulic excavators, or 
clamshell equipment used to place or remove material), if a marine 
mammal comes within 50 m, those operations will cease and vessels will 
reduce to the slowest speed practicable while still maintaining control 
of the vessel and safe working conditions.
    (11) In the event the Port of Anchorage conducts out-of-water 
blasting, detonation of charges will be delayed if a marine mammal is 
detected anywhere within a visible distance from the detonation site.
    (12) Additional mitigation measures as contained in a Letter of 
Authorization.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 217.205  Requirements for monitoring and reporting.

    (a) The Holder of a Letter of Authorization issued pursuant to Sec. 
216.106 of this chapter and Sec. 217.207, for activities described in 
Sec. 217.200(a) is required to cooperate with NMFS, and any other 
Federal, state or local agency with authority to monitor the impacts of 
the activity on marine mammals. Unless specified otherwise in the Letter 
of Authorization, the Holder of the Letter of Authorization must notify 
the Administrator, Alaska Region, NMFS, by letter, e-mail, or telephone, 
at least 2 weeks prior to commencement of seasonal activities and dock 
demolition possibly involving the taking of marine mammals. If the 
activity identified in Sec. 217.200(a) is thought to have resulted in 
the mortality or injury of any marine mammals or in any take of marine 
mammals not identified in Sec. 217.202(b), the Holder of the Letter of 
Authorization must notify the Director, Office of Protected Resources, 
NMFS, or designee, by e-mail or telephone (301-713-2289), within 24 
hours of the discovery of the injured or dead animal.
    (b) The Holder of a Letters of Authorization must designate 
qualified, on-site marine mammal observers (MMOs), approved in advance 
by NMFS, as specified in the Letter of Authorization, to:
    (1) Conduct visual marine mammal monitoring at the Port of Anchorage 
beginning 30 minutes prior to and during all in-water pile driving or 
chipping and out-of-water blasting.
    (2) Record the following information on NMFS-approved marine mammal 
sighting sheets whenever a marine mammal is detected:
    (i) Date and time of initial sighting to end of sighting, tidal 
stage, and weather conditions (including Beaufort Sea State);
    (ii) Species, number, group composition, initial and closest 
distance to pile driving hammer, and behavior (e.g., activity, group 
cohesiveness, direction and speed of travel, etc.) of animals throughout 
duration of sighting;
    (iii) Any discrete behavioral reactions to in-water work;
    (iv) The number (by species) of marine mammals that have been taken;
    (v) Pile driving, chipping, or out of water blasting activities 
occurring at the time of sighting and if and why shut down was or was 
not implemented.
    (3) Employ a scientific marine mammal monitoring team separate from 
the on-site MMOs to characterize beluga whale abundance, movements, 
behavior, and habitat use around the Port of Anchorage and observe, 
analyze, and document potential changes in behavior in response to in-
water construction work. This monitoring team is not required to be 
present during all in-water pile driving operations but will continue 
monitoring one-year post in-water construction. The on-site MMOs and 
this marine mammal monitoring team shall remain in contact to alert each 
other to marine mammal presence when both teams are working.
    (c) The Holder of a Letter of Authorization must conduct additional 
monitoring as required under an annual Letter of Authorization.
    (d) The Holder of a Letter of Authorization shall submit a monthly 
report to NMFS' Headquarters Permits, Education and Conservation 
Division and

[[Page 152]]

the Alaska Region, Anchorage for all months in-water pile driving or 
chipping takes place. This report must contain the information listed in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (e) An annual report must be submitted at the time of application 
for renewal of a Letter of Authorization. This report will summarize all 
in-water construction activities and marine mammal monitoring from 
January 1- December 31, annually, and any discernable short or long term 
impacts from the Marine Terminal Expansion Project.
    (f) A final report must be submitted to NMFS upon application for a 
subsequent incidental take authorization or, if no future authorization 
is requested, no later than 90 days post expiration of these 
regulations. This report will:
    (1) Summarize the activities undertaken and the results reported in 
all previous reports;
    (2) Assess the impacts to marine mammals from the port expansion 
project; and
    (3) Assess the cumulative impacts on marine mammals.

<R05>
Sec. 218.4  Mitigation.

    (a) When conducting training activities identified in Sec. 
218.1(c), the mitigation measures contained in the Letter of 
Authorization issued under Sec. 216.106 of this chapter and Sec. 218.7 
must be implemented. These mitigation measures include, but are not 
limited to:
    (1) General Maritime Measures:
    (i) Personnel Training--Lookouts
    (A) All bridge personnel, Commanding Officers, Executive Officers, 
officers standing watch on the bridge, maritime patrol aircraft 
aircrews, and Mine Warfare (MIW) helicopter crews shall complete Marine 
Species Awareness Training (MSAT).
    (B) Navy lookouts shall undertake extensive training to qualify as a 
watchstander in accordance with the Lookout Training Handbook (NAVEDTRA 
12968-D).
    (C) Lookout training shall include on-the-job instruction under the 
supervision of a qualified, experienced watchstander. Following 
successful completion of this supervised training period, lookouts shall 
complete the Personal Qualification Standard Program, certifying that 
they have demonstrated the necessary skills (such as detection and 
reporting of partially submerged objects).
    (D) Lookouts shall be trained in the most effective means to ensure 
quick and effective communication within the command structure to 
facilitate implementation of protective measures if marine species are 
spotted.
    (E) Surface lookouts shall scan the water from the ship to the 
horizon and be responsible for all contacts in their sector. In 
searching the assigned sector, the lookout shall always start at the 
forward part of the sector and search aft (toward the back). To search 
and scan, the lookout shall hold the binoculars steady so the horizon is 
in the top third of the field of vision and direct the eyes just below 
the horizon. The lookout shall scan for approximately five seconds in as 
many small steps as possible across the field seen through the 
binoculars. They shall search the entire sector in approximately five-
degree steps, pausing between steps for approximately five seconds to 
scan the field of view. At the end of the sector search, the glasses 
shall be lowered to allow the eyes to rest for a few seconds, and then 
the lookout shall search back across the sector with the naked eye.
    (F) At night, lookouts shall scan the horizon in a series of 
movements that would allow their eyes to come to periodic rests as they 
scan the sector. When visually searching at night, they shall look a 
little to one side and out of the corners of their eyes, paying 
attention to the things on the outer edges of their field of vision. 
Lookouts shall also have night vision devices available for use.
    (ii) Operating Procedures and Collision Avoidance:
    (A) Prior to major exercises, a Letter of Instruction, Mitigation 
Measures Message or Environmental Annex to the Operational Order shall 
be issued to further disseminate the personnel training requirement and 
general marine species mitigation measures.
    (B) Commanding Officers shall make use of marine species detection 
cues and information to limit interaction with marine species to the 
maximum extent possible consistent with safety of the ship.
    (C) While underway, surface vessels shall have at least two lookouts 
with binoculars; surfaced submarines shall have at least one lookout 
with binoculars. Lookouts already posted for safety of navigation and 
man-overboard precautions may be used to fill this requirement. As part 
of their regular duties, lookouts shall watch for and report to the OOD 
the presence of marine mammals.
    (D) Personnel on lookout shall employ visual search procedures 
employing a scanning method in accordance with the Lookout Training 
Handbook (NAVEDTRA 12968-D).
    (E) After sunset and prior to sunrise, lookouts shall employ Night 
Lookouts Techniques in accordance with the Lookout Training Handbook 
(NAVEDTRA 12968-D).
    (F) While in transit, naval vessels shall be alert at all times, use 
extreme

[[Page 158]]

caution, and proceed at a ``safe speed'' so that the vessel can take 
proper and effective action to avoid a collision with any marine animal 
and can be stopped within a distance appropriate to the prevailing 
circumstances and conditions.
    (G) When whales have been sighted in the area, Navy vessels shall 
increase vigilance and implement measures to avoid collisions with 
marine mammals and avoid activities that might result in close 
interaction of naval assets and marine mammals. Such measures shall 
include changing speed and/or direction and would be dictated by 
environmental and other conditions (e.g., safety or weather).
    (H) Naval vessels shall maneuver to keep at least 500 yds (460 m) 
away from any observed whale and avoid approaching whales head-on. This 
requirement does not apply if a vessel's safety is threatened, such as 
when change of course will create an imminent and serious threat to a 
person, vessel, or aircraft, and to the extent vessels are restricted in 
their ability to maneuver. Vessels shall take reasonable steps to alert 
other vessels in the vicinity of the whale.
    (I) Where feasible and consistent with mission and safety, vessels 
shall avoid closing to within 200-yd (183 m) of marine mammals other 
than whales (whales addressed above).
    (J) Navy aircraft participating in exercises at sea shall conduct 
and maintain, when operationally feasible and safe, surveillance for 
marine species of concern as long as it does not violate safety 
constraints or interfere with the accomplishment of primary operational 
duties. Marine mammal detections shall be immediately reported to 
assigned Aircraft Control Unit for further dissemination to ships in the 
vicinity of the marine species as appropriate where it is reasonable to 
conclude that the course of the ship will likely result in a closing of 
the distance to the detected marine mammal.
    (K) All vessels shall maintain logs and records documenting training 
operations should they be required for event reconstruction purposes. 
Logs and records shall be kept for a period of 30 days following 
completion of a major training exercise.
    (2) Coordination and Reporting Requirements. (i) The Navy shall 
coordinate with the local NMFS Stranding Coordinator for any unusual 
marine mammal behavior and any stranding, beached live/dead, or floating 
marine mammals that may occur at any time during or within 24 hours 
after completion of training activities.
    (ii) The Navy shall follow internal chain of command reporting 
procedures as promulgated through Navy instructions and orders.
    (3) Mitigation Measures Applicable to Vessel Transit in the Mid-
Atlantic during North Atlantic Right Whale Migration: The mitigation 
measures apply to all Navy vessel transits, including those vessels that 
would transit to and from East Coast ports and the VACAPES Range 
Complex.
    (i) Mid-Atlantic, Offshore of the Eastern United States:
    (A) All Navy vessels are required to use extreme caution and operate 
at a slow, safe speed consistent with mission and safety (at a speed 
that does not compromise safety of navigation) during the months 
indicated below and within a 37 km (20 nm) arc (except as noted) of the 
specified associated reference points:
    (1) South and East of Block Island (37 km (20 NM) seaward of line 
between 41-4.49[deg] N. lat. 071-51.15[deg] W. long. and 41-18.58[deg] 
N. lat. 070-50.23[deg] W. long): Sept-Oct and Mar-Apr
    (2) New York/New Jersey (40-30.64[deg] N. lat. 073-57.76[deg] W. 
long.): Sep-Oct and Feb-Apr.
    (3) Delaware Bay (Philadelphia) (38-52.13[deg] N. lat. 075-1.93[deg] 
W. long.): Oct-Dec and Feb-Mar.
    (4) Chesapeake Bay (Hampton Roads and Baltimore) (37-1.11[deg] N. 
lat. 075-57.56[deg] W. long.): Nov-Dec and Feb-Apr.
    (5) North Carolina (34-41.54[deg] N. lat. 076-40.20[deg] W. long.): 
Dec-Apr.
    (6) South Carolina (33-11.84[deg] N. lat. 079-8.99[deg] W. long. and 
32-43.39[deg] N. lat. 079-48.72[deg] W. long.): Oct-Apr.
    (B) During the months indicated in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this 
section, Navy vessels shall practice increased vigilance with respect to 
avoidance of vessel-whale interactions along the mid-Atlantic coast, 
including transits to and from any mid-Atlantic ports not

[[Page 159]]

specifically identified in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section.
    (C) All surface units transiting within 56 km (30 NM) of the coast 
in the mid-Atlantic shall ensure at least two watchstanders are posted, 
including at least one lookout who has completed required MSAT training.
    (D) Navy vessels shall not knowingly approach any whale head on and 
shall maneuver to keep at least 457 m (1,500 ft) away from any observed 
whale, consistent with vessel safety.
    (ii) Southeast Atlantic, Offshore of the Eastern United States--for 
the purposes of the measures below (paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A) & (B) of 
this section), the ``southeast'' encompasses sea space from Charleston, 
South Carolina, southward to Sebastian Inlet, Florida, and from the 
coast seaward to 148 km (80 NM) from shore. North Atlantic right whale 
critical habitat is the area from 31-15[deg] N. lat. to 30-15[deg] N. 
lat. extending from the coast out to 28 km (15 NM), and the area from 
28-00[deg] N. lat. to 30-15[deg] N. lat. from the coast out to 9 km (5 
NM). All mitigation measures described here that apply to the critical 
habitat apply from November 15-April 15 and also apply to an associated 
area of concern which extends 9 km (5 NM) seaward of the designated 
critical habitat boundaries.
    (A) Prior to transiting or training in the critical habitat or 
associated area of concern, ships shall contact Fleet Area Control and 
Surveillance Facility, Jacksonville, to obtain latest whale sighting and 
other information needed to make informed decisions regarding safe speed 
(the minimum speed at which mission goals or safety will not be 
compromised) and path of intended movement. Subs shall contact 
Commander, Submarine Group Ten for similar information.
    (B) The following specific mitigation measures apply to activities 
occurring within the North Atlantic right whale critical habitat and an 
associated area of concern which extends 9 km (5 NM) seaward of the 
designated critical habitat boundaries:
    (1) When transiting within the critical habitat or associated area 
of concern, vessels shall exercise extreme caution and proceed at a slow 
safe speed. The speed shall be the slowest safe speed that is consistent 
with mission, training and operations.
    (2) Speed reductions (adjustments) are required when a whale is 
sighted by a vessel or when the vessel is within 9 km (5 NM) of a 
reported new sighting less than 12 hours old. Circumstances could arise 
where, in order to avoid North Atlantic right whale(s), speed reductions 
could mean vessels must reduce speed to a minimum at which it can safely 
keep on course or vessels could come to an all stop.
    (3) Vessels shall avoid head-on approaches to North Atlantic right 
whale(s) and shall maneuver to maintain at least 457 m (500 yd) of 
separation from any observed whale if deemed safe to do so. These 
requirements do not apply if a vessel's safety is threatened, such as 
when a change of course would create an imminent and serious threat to a 
person, vessel, or aircraft, and to the extent vessels are restricted in 
the ability to maneuver.
    (4) During the North Atlantic right whale calving season, north-
south transits through the critical habitat are prohibited.
    (5) Ships, surfaced subs, and aircraft shall report any whale 
sightings to Fleet Area Control and Surveillance Facility, Jacksonville, 
by the quickest and most practicable means. The sighting report shall 
include the time, latitude/longitude, direction of movement and number 
and description of whale (i.e., adult/calf).
    (iii) Northeast Atlantic, Offshore of the Eastern United States:
    (A) Prior to transiting the Great South Channel or Cape Cod Bay 
critical habitat areas, ships shall obtain the latest North Atlantic 
right whale sightings and other information needed to make informed 
decisions regarding safe speed (the minimum speed at which mission goals 
or safety will not be compromised). The Great South Channel critical 
habitat is defined by the following coordinates: 41-00[deg] N. lat., 69-
05[deg] W. long.; 41-45[deg] N. lat, 69-45[deg] W. long; 42-10[deg] N. 
lat., 68-31[deg] W. long.; 41-38[deg] N. lat., 68-13[deg] W. long. The 
Cape Cod Bay critical habitat is defined by the following coordinates: 
42-04.8[deg] N. lat., 70-10[deg] W. long.; 42-12[deg] N. lat., 70-
15[deg] W. long.; 42-12[deg] N. lat., 70-30[deg] W. long.; 41-46.8[deg] 
N. lat., 70-30[deg] W. long.

[[Page 160]]

    (B) Ships, surfaced subs, and aircraft shall report any North 
Atlantic right whale sightings (if the whale is identifiable as a right 
whale) off the northeastern U.S. to Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing 
(COMPATRECONWING). The report shall include the time of sighting, lat/
long, direction of movement (if apparent) and number and description of 
the whale(s).
    (C) Vessels or aircraft that observe whale carcasses shall record 
the location and time of the sighting and report this information as 
soon as possible to the cognizant regional environmental coordinator. 
All whale strikes must be reported. This report shall include the date, 
time, and location of the strike; vessel course and speed; operations 
being conducted by the vessel; weather conditions, visibility, and sea 
state; description of the whale; narrative of incident; and indication 
of whether photos/videos were taken. Navy personnel are encouraged to 
take photos whenever possible.
    (D) Specific mitigation measures related to activities occurring 
within the critical habitat include the following:
    (1) Vessels shall avoid head-on approaches to North Atlantic right 
whale(s) and shall maneuver to maintain at least 457 m (500 yd) of 
separation from any observed whale if deemed safe to do so. These 
requirements do not apply if a vessel's safety is threatened, such as 
when change of course would create an imminent and serious threat to 
person, vessel, or aircraft, and to the extent vessels are restricted in 
the ability to maneuver.
    (2) When transiting within the critical habitat or associated area 
of concern, vessels shall use extreme caution and operate at a safe 
speed (the minimum speed at which mission goals or safety will not be 
compromised) so as to be able to avoid collisions with North Atlantic 
right whales and other marine mammals, and stop within a distance 
appropriate to the circumstances and conditions.
    (3) Speed reductions (adjustments) are required when a whale is 
sighted by a vessel or when the vessel is within 9 km (5 NM) of a 
reported new sighting less than one week old.
    (4) Ships transiting in the Cape Cod Bay and Great South Channel 
critical habitats shall obtain information on recent whale sightings in 
the vicinity of the critical habitat. Any vessel operating in the 
vicinity of a North Atlantic right whale shall consider additional speed 
reductions per Rule 6 of International Navigational Rules.
    (4) Mitigation Measures for Specific At-sea Training Events--If a 
marine mammal is killed as a result of the proposed Navy training 
activities (e.g., instances in which it is clear that munitions 
explosions caused the death), the Navy shall suspend its activities 
immediately and report the incident to NMFS.
    (i) Firing Exercise (FIREX) Using the Integrated Maritime Portable 
Acoustic Scoring System (IMPASS) (5-in. Explosive Rounds):
    (A) FIREX using IMPASS would only be conducted in the four 
designated areas specified in the Navy's LOA application in the VACAPES 
Range Complex.
    (B) Pre-exercise monitoring of the target area shall be conducted 
with ``Big Eyes'' prior to the event, during deployment of the IMPASS 
sonobuoy array, and during return to the firing position. Ships shall be 
required to maintain a lookout dedicated to visually searching for 
marine mammals 180[deg] along the ship track line and 360[deg] at each 
buoy drop-off location.
    (C) ``Big Eyes'' on the ship shall be used to monitor a 600 yd (548 
m) buffer zone around the target area for marine mammals during naval-
gunfire events.
    (D) Ships shall not fire on the target if any marine mammals are 
detected within or approaching the 600 yd (548 m) buffer zone until the 
area is cleared. If marine mammals are present, operations shall be 
suspended. Visual observation shall occur for approximately 45 minutes, 
or until the animal has been observed to have cleared the area and is 
heading away from the buffer zone.
    (E) Post-exercise monitoring of the entire target area shall take 
place with ``Big Eyes'' and the naked eye during the retrieval of the 
IMPASS sonobuoy array following each firing exercise.
    (F) FIREX with IMPASS shall take place during daylight hours only.
    (G) FIREX with IMPASS shall only be used in Beaufort Sea State three 
(3) or less.

[[Page 161]]

    (H) The visibility must be such that the fall of shot is visible 
from the firing ship during the exercise.
    (I) No firing shall occur if marine mammals are detected within 70 
yd (64 m) of the vessel.
    (ii) Air-to-Surface At-Sea Bombing Exercises (250-lbs to 2,000-lbs 
explosive bombs):
    (A) Aircraft shall visually survey the target and buffer zone for 
marine mammals prior to and during the exercise. The survey of the 
impact area shall be made by flying at 1,500 ft (457 m) altitude or 
lower, if safe to do so, and at the slowest safe speed.
    (B) A buffer zone of 5,100-yd (4,663 m) radius shall be established 
around the intended target zone. The exercises shall be conducted only 
when marine mammals are observed to be outside the buffer zone.
    (C) At-sea BOMBEXs using live ordnance shall occur during daylight 
hours only.
    (iii) Air-to-Surface Missile Exercises (Explosive):
    (A) Aircraft shall initially survey the intended ordnance impact 
area for marine mammals.
    (B) During the actual firing of the weapon, the aircraft involved 
must be able to observe the intended ordnance impact area to ensure the 
area is free of marine mammal transiting the range.
    (C) Visual inspection of the target area shall be made by flying at 
1,500 ft (457 m) altitude or lower, if safe to do so, and at slowest 
safe speed.
    (D) Explosive ordnance shall not be targeted to impact within 1,800 
yd (1,646 m) of sighted marine mammals.
    (iv) Mine Neutralization Training Involving Underwater Detonations 
(up to 20-lb charges):
    (A) This activity shall only occur in W-50 of the VACAPES Range 
Complex.
    (B) Observers shall survey the Zone of Influence (ZOI), a 700 yd 
(640 m) radius from detonation location for marine mammals from all 
participating vessels during the entire operation. A survey of the ZOI 
(minimum of 3 parallel tracklines 219 yd [200 m] apart) using support 
craft shall be conducted at the detonation location 30 minutes prior 
through 30 minutes post detonation. Aerial survey support shall be 
utilized whenever assets are available.
    (C) Detonation operations shall be conducted during daylight hours 
only.
    (D) If a marine mammal is sighted within the ZOI, the animal shall 
be allowed to leave of its own volition. The Navy shall suspend 
detonation exercises and ensure the area is clear of marine mammals for 
a full 30 minutes prior to detonation.
    (E) Divers placing the charges on mines and dive support vessel 
personnel shall survey the area for marine mammals and shall report any 
sightings to the surface observers. These animals shall be allowed to 
leave of their own volition and the ZOI shall be clear of marine mammals 
for 30 minutes prior to detonation.
    (F) No detonations shall take place within 3.2 nm (6 km) of an 
estuarine inlet (Chesapeake Bay Inlets).
    (G) No detonations shall take place within 1.6 nm (3 km) of 
shoreline.
    (H) Personnel shall record any protected species observations during 
the exercise as well as measures taken if species are detected within 
the ZOI.

Sec. 218.5  Requirements for monitoring and reporting.

    (a) The Holder of the Letter of Authorization issued pursuant to 
Sec. 216.106 of this chapter and Sec. 218.7 for activities described 
in Sec. 218.1(c) is required to cooperate with the NMFS when monitoring 
the impacts of the activity on marine mammals.
    (b) The Holder of the Authorization must notify NMFS immediately (or 
as soon as clearance procedures allow) if the specified activity 
identified in Sec. 218.1(c) is thought to have resulted in the 
mortality or serious injury of any marine mammals, or in any take of 
marine mammals not identified in Sec. 218.2(c).
    (c) The Navy must conduct all monitoring and required reporting 
under the Letter of Authorization, including abiding by the VACAPES 
Range Complex Monitoring Plan, which is incorporated herein by 
reference, and which requires the Navy to implement, at a minimum, the 
monitoring activities summarized below.

[[Page 162]]

    (1) Vessel or aerial surveys. (i) The Holder of this Authorization 
shall visually survey a minimum of 2 explosive events per year, one of 
which shall be a multiple detonation event. One of the vessel or aerial 
surveys should involve professionally trained marine mammal observers 
(MMOs).
    (ii) Where operationally feasible, for specified training events, 
aerial or vessel surveys shall be used 1-2 days prior to, during (if 
reasonably safe), and 1-5 days post detonation.
    (iii) Surveys shall include any specified exclusion zone around a 
particular detonation point plus 2,000 yards beyond the border of the 
exclusion zone (i.e., the circumference of the area from the border of 
the exclusion zone extending 2,000 yards outwards). For vessel based 
surveys a passive acoustic system (hydrophone or towed array) could be 
used to determine if marine mammals are in the area before and/or after 
a detonation event.
    (iv) When conducting a particular survey, the survey team shall 
collect:
    (A) Location of sighting;
    (B) Species (if not possible, indicate whale, dolphin or pinniped);
    (C) Number of individuals;
    (D) Whether calves were observed;
    (E) Initial detection sensor;
    (F) Length of time observers maintained visual contact with marine 
mammal;
    (G) Wave height;
    (H) Visibility;
    (I) Whether sighting was before, during, or after detonations/
exercise, and how many minutes before or after;
    (J) Distance of marine mammal from actual detonations (or target 
spot if not yet detonated);
    (K) Observed behavior--Watchstanders shall report, in plain language 
and without trying to categorize in any way, the observed behavior of 
the animal(s) (such as animal closing to bow ride, paralleling course/
speed, floating on surface and not swimming etc.), including speed and 
direction;
    (L) Resulting mitigation implementation--Indicate whether explosive 
detonations were delayed, ceased, modified, or not modified due to 
marine mammal presence and for how long; and
    (M) If observation occurs while explosives are detonating in the 
water, indicate munition type in use at time of marine mammal detection.
    (2) Passive acoustic monitoring--the Navy shall conduct passive 
acoustic monitoring when operationally feasible.
    (i) Any time a towed hydrophone array is employed during shipboard 
surveys the towed array shall be deployed during daylight hours for each 
of the days the ship is at sea.
    (ii) The towed hydrophone array shall be used to supplement the 
ship-based systematic line-transect surveys (particularly for species 
such as beaked whales that are rarely seen).
    (iii) The array shall have the capability of detecting low frequency 
vocalizations (<1,000 Hz) for baleen whales and relatively high 
frequency (up to 30 kHz) for odontocetes. The use of two simultaneously 
deployed arrays can also allow more accurate localization and 
determination of diving patterns.
    (3) Marine mammal observers on Navy platforms. (i) As required in 
Sec. 218.5(c)(1), MMOs selected for aerial or vessel survey shall be 
placed on a Navy platform during one of the explosive exercises being 
monitored per year, the other designated exercise shall be monitored by 
the Navy lookouts/watchstanders.
    (ii) The MMO must possess expertise in species identification of 
regional marine mammal species and experience collecting behavioral 
data.
    (iii) MMOs shall not be placed aboard Navy platforms for every Navy 
training event or major exercise, but during specifically identified 
opportunities deemed appropriate for data collection efforts. The events 
selected for MMO participation shall take into account safety, 
logistics, and operational concerns.
    (iv) MMOs shall observe from the same height above water as the 
lookouts.
    (v) The MMOs shall not be part of the Navy's formal reporting chain 
of command during their data collection efforts; Navy lookouts shall 
continue to serve as the primary reporting means within the Navy chain 
of command for marine mammal sightings. The only

[[Page 163]]

exception is that if an animal is observed within the shutdown zone that 
has not been observed by the lookout, the MMO shall inform the lookout 
of the sighting and the lookout shall take the appropriate action 
through the chain of command.
    (vi) The MMOs shall collect species identification, behavior, 
direction of travel relative to the Navy platform, and distance first 
observed. Information collected by MMOs be the same as those collected 
by Navy lookout/watchstanders described in Sec. 218.5(c)(1)(iv).
    (d) The Navy shall complete an Integrated Comprehensive Monitoring 
Program (ICMP) Plan in 2009. This planning and adaptive management tool 
shall include:
    (1) A method for prioritizing monitoring projects that clearly 
describes the characteristics of a proposal that factor into its 
priority.
    (2) A method for annually reviewing, with NMFS, monitoring results, 
Navy R&D, and current science to use for potential modification of 
mitigation or monitoring methods.
    (3) A detailed description of the Monitoring Workshop to be convened 
in 2011 and how and when Navy/NMFS will subsequently utilize the 
findings of the Monitoring Workshop to potentially modify subsequent 
monitoring and mitigation.
    (4) An adaptive management plan.
    (5) A method for standardizing data collection for VACAPES Range 
Complex and across range complexes.
    (e) General Notification of Injured or Dead Marine Mammals--Navy 
personnel shall ensure that NMFS (regional stranding coordinator) is 
notified immediately (or as soon as clearance procedures allow) if an 
injured or dead marine mammal is found during or shortly after, and in 
the vicinity of, any Navy training exercise utilizing underwater 
explosive detonations. The Navy shall provide NMFS with species or 
description of the animal(s), the condition of the animal(s) (including 
carcass condition if the animal is dead), location, time of first 
discovery, observed behaviors (if alive), and photo or video (if 
available).
    (f) Annual VACAPES Range Complex Monitoring Plan Report--The Navy 
shall submit a report annually on March 1 describing the implementation 
and results (through January 1 of the same year) of the VACAPES Range 
Complex Monitoring Plan. Data collection methods shall be standardized 
across range complexes to allow for comparison in different geographic 
locations. Although additional information will also be gathered, the 
MMOs collecting marine mammal data pursuant to the VACAPES Range Complex 
Monitoring Plan shall, at a minimum, provide the same marine mammal 
observation data required in the data required in Sec. 218.5(g). The 
VACAPES Range Complex Monitoring Plan Report may be provided to NMFS 
within a larger report that includes the required Monitoring Plan 
Reports from VACAPES Range Complex and multiple range complexes.
    (g) Annual VACAPES Range Complex Exercise Report--The Navy shall 
provide the information described below for all of their explosive 
exercises. Until the Navy is able to report in full the information 
below, they shall provide an annual update on the Navy's explosive 
tracking methods, including improvements from the previous year.
    (1) Total annual number of each type of explosive exercise (of those 
identified as part of the ``specified activity'' in this final rule) 
conducted in the VACAPES Range Complex.
    (2) Total annual expended/detonated rounds (missiles, bombs, etc.) 
for each explosive type.
    (h) VACAPES Range Complex 5-yr Comprehensive Report--The Navy shall 
submit to NMFS a draft report that analyzes and summarizes all of the 
multi-year marine mammal information gathered during the VACAPES Range 
Complex exercises for which annual reports are required (Annual VACAPES 
Range Complex Exercise Reports and VACAPES Range Complex Monitoring Plan 
Reports). This report shall be submitted at the end of the fourth year 
of the rule (May 2013), covering activities that have occurred through 
December 1, 2012.
    (i) The Navy shall respond to NMFS' comments and requests for 
additional information or clarification on the VACAPES Range Complex 
Comprehensive Report, the Annual VACAPES

[[Page 164]]

Range Complex Exercise Report, or the Annual VACAPES Range Complex 
Monitoring Plan Report (or the multi-Range Complex Annual Monitoring 
Plan Report, if that is how the Navy chooses to submit the information) 
if submitted within 3 months of receipt. These reports shall be 
considered final after the Navy has addressed NMFS' comments or provided 
the requested information, or three months after the submittal of the 
draft if NMFS does not comment by then.
    (j) In 2011, the Navy shall convene a Monitoring Workshop in which 
the Monitoring Workshop participants will be asked to review the Navy's 
Monitoring Plans and monitoring results and make individual 
recommendations (to the Navy and NMFS) of ways of improving the 
Monitoring Plans. The recommendations shall be reviewed by the Navy, in 
consultation with NMFS, and modifications to the Monitoring Plan shall 
be made, as appropriate.

    (d) Violate, or fail to comply with, the terms, conditions, and 
requirements of this Subpart or a Letter of Authorization issued under 
Sec. 216.106 of this chapter and Sec. 218.16.


<R05>
Sec. 218.13  Mitigation.

    (a) When conducting training activities identified in Sec. 
218.10(c), the mitigation measures contained in the Letter of 
Authorization issued under Sec. 216.106 of this chapter and Sec. 
218.16 must be implemented. These mitigation measures include, but are 
not limited to:
    (1) General Maritime Measures:
    (i) Personnel Training--Lookouts:
    (A) All bridge personnel, Commanding Officers, Executive Officers, 
officers standing watch on the bridge, maritime patrol aircraft 
aircrews, and Mine Warfare (MIW) helicopter crews shall complete Marine 
Species Awareness Training (MSAT).
    (B) Navy lookouts shall undertake extensive training to qualify as a 
watchstander in accordance with the Lookout Training Handbook (NAVEDTRA 
12968-D).
    (C) Lookout training shall include on-the-job instruction under the 
supervision of a qualified, experienced watchstander. Following 
successful completion of this supervised training period, lookouts shall 
complete the Personal Qualification Standard Program, certifying that 
they have demonstrated the necessary skills (such as detection and 
reporting of partially submerged objects).
    (D) Lookouts shall be trained in the most effective means to ensure 
quick and effective communication within the command structure to 
facilitate implementation of protective measures if marine species are 
spotted.
    (E) Surface lookouts shall scan the water from the ship to the 
horizon and be responsible for all contacts in their sector. In 
searching the assigned sector, the lookout shall always start at the 
forward part of the sector and search aft (toward the back). To search 
and scan, the lookout shall hold the binoculars steady so the horizon is 
in the top third of the field of vision and direct the eyes just below 
the horizon. The lookout shall scan for approximately five seconds in as 
many small steps as possible across the field seen through the 
binoculars. They shall search the entire sector in approximately five-
degree steps, pausing between steps for approximately five seconds to 
scan the field of view. At the end of the sector search, the glasses 
shall be lowered to allow the eyes to rest for a few seconds, and then 
the lookout shall search back across the sector with the naked eye.
    (F) At night, lookouts shall scan the horizon in a series of 
movements that would allow their eyes to come to periodic rests as they 
scan the sector. When visually searching at night, they shall look a 
little to one side and out of the corners of their eyes, paying 
attention to the things on the outer edges of their field of vision. 
Lookouts shall also have night vision devices available for use.
    (ii) Operating Procedures & Collision Avoidance:
    (A) Prior to major exercises, a Letter of Instruction, Mitigation 
Measures Message or Environmental Annex to the Operational Order shall 
be issued to further disseminate the personnel training requirement and 
general marine species mitigation measures.
    (B) Commanding Officers shall make use of marine species detection 
cues and information to limit interaction with marine species to the 
maximum extent possible consistent with safety of the ship.
    (C) While underway, surface vessels shall have at least two lookouts 
with binoculars; surfaced submarines shall have at least one lookout 
with binoculars. Lookouts already posted for safety of navigation and 
man-overboard precautions may be used to fill this requirement. As part 
of their regular duties, lookouts shall watch for and report to the OOD 
the presence of marine mammals.
    (D) Personnel on lookout shall employ visual search procedures 
employing a scanning method in accordance with the Lookout Training 
Handbook (NAVEDTRA 12968-D).
    (E) After sunset and prior to sunrise, lookouts shall employ Night 
Lookouts

[[Page 168]]

Techniques in accordance with the Lookout Training Handbook (NAVEDTRA 
12968-D).
    (F) While in transit, naval vessels shall be alert at all times, use 
extreme caution, and proceed at a ``safe speed'' (the minimum speed at 
which mission goals or safety will not be compromised) so that the 
vessel can take proper and effective action to avoid a collision with 
any marine animal and can be stopped within a distance appropriate to 
the prevailing circumstances and conditions.
    (G) When marine mammals have been sighted in the area, Navy vessels 
shall increase vigilance and implement measures to avoid collisions with 
marine mammals and avoid activities that might result in close 
interaction of naval assets and marine mammals. Such measures shall 
include changing speed and/or course direction and would be dictated by 
environmental and other conditions (e.g., safety or weather).
    (H) Naval vessels shall maneuver to keep at least 500 yds (460 m) 
away from any observed whale and avoid approaching whales head-on. This 
requirement does not apply if a vessel's safety is threatened, such as 
when change of course will create an imminent and serious threat to a 
person, vessel, or aircraft, and to the extent vessels are restricted in 
their ability to maneuver. Vessels shall take reasonable steps to alert 
other vessels in the vicinity of the whale.
    (I) Where feasible and consistent with mission and safety, vessels 
shall avoid closing to within 200 yds (183 m) of marine mammals other 
than whales (whales addressed above).
    (J) Navy aircraft participating in exercises at sea shall conduct 
and maintain, when operationally feasible and safe, surveillance for 
marine species of concern as long as it does not violate safety 
constraints or interfere with the accomplishment of primary operational 
duties. Marine mammal detections shall be immediately reported to 
assigned Aircraft Control Unit for further dissemination to ships in the 
vicinity of the marine species as appropriate where it is reasonable to 
conclude that the course of the ship will likely result in a closing of 
the distance to the detected marine mammal.
    (K) All vessels shall maintain logs and records documenting training 
operations should they be required for event reconstruction purposes. 
Logs and records shall be kept for a period of 30 days following 
completion of a major training exercise.
    (2) Coordination and Reporting Requirements:
    (i) The Navy shall coordinate with the local NMFS Stranding 
Coordinator for any unusual marine mammal behavior and any stranding, 
beached live/dead, or floating marine mammals that may occur at any time 
during or within 24 hours after completion of training activities.
    (ii) The Navy shall follow internal chain of command reporting 
procedures as promulgated through Navy instructions and orders.
    (3) Mitigation Measures Applicable to Vessel Transit in the Mid-
Atlantic during North Atlantic Right Whale Migration: The mitigation 
measures apply to all Navy vessel transits, including those vessels that 
would transit to and from East Coast ports and the JAX Range Complex 
OPAREA.
    (i) Mid-Atlantic, Offshore of the Eastern United States:
    (A) All Navy vessels are required to use extreme caution and operate 
at a slow, safe speed consistent with mission and safety during the 
months indicated below and within a 37 km (20 nm) arc (except as noted) 
of the specified associated reference points:
    (1) South and East of Block Island (37 km (20 NM) seaward of line 
between 41-4.49[deg] N. lat. 071-51.15[deg] W. long. and 41-18.58[deg] 
N. lat. 070-50.23[deg] W. long): Sept-Oct and Mar-Apr
    (2) New York/New Jersey (40-30.64[deg] N. lat. 073-57.76[deg] W.

    (3) Delaware Bay (Philadelphia) (38-52.13[deg] N. lat. 075-1.93[deg] 
W. long.): Oct-Dec and Feb-Mar.
    (4) Chesapeake Bay (Hampton Roads and Baltimore) (37-1.11[deg] N. 
lat. 075-57.56[deg] W. long.): Nov-Dec and Feb-Apr.
    (5) North Carolina (34-41.54[deg] N. lat. 076-40.20[deg] W. long.): 
Dec-Apr
    (6) South Carolina (33-11.84[deg] N. lat. 079-8.99[deg] W. long. and 
32-43.39[deg] N. lat. 079-48.72[deg] W. long.): Oct-Apr

[[Page 169]]

    (B) During the months indicated in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this 
section, Navy vessels shall practice increased vigilance with respect to 
avoidance of vessel-whale interactions along the mid-Atlantic coast, 
including transits to and from any mid-Atlantic ports not specifically 
identified in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section.
    (C) All surface units transiting within 56 km (30 NM) of the coast 
in the mid-Atlantic shall ensure at least two watchstanders are posted, 
including at least one lookout who has completed required MSAT training.
    (D) Navy vessels shall not knowingly approach any whale head on and 
shall maneuver to keep at least 457 m (1,500 ft) away from any observed 
whale, consistent with vessel safety.
    (ii) Southeast Atlantic, Offshore of the Eastern United States--for 
the purposes of the measures below (paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A) & (B) of 
this section), the ``southeast'' encompasses sea space from Charleston, 
South Carolina, southward to Sebastian Inlet, Florida, and from the 
coast seaward to 148 km (80 NM) from shore. North Atlantic right whale 
critical habitat is the area from 31-15[deg] N. lat. to 30-15[deg] N. 
lat. extending from the coast out to 28 km (15 NM), and the area from 
28-00[deg] N. lat. to 30-15[deg] N. lat. from the coast out to 9 km (5 
NM). All mitigation measures described here that apply to the critical 
habitat apply from November 15--April 15 and also apply to an associated 
area of concern which extends 9 km (5 NM) seaward of the designated 
critical habitat boundaries.
    (A) Prior to transiting or training in the critical habitat or 
associated area of concern, ships shall contact Fleet Area Control and 
Surveillance Facility, Jacksonville, to obtain latest whale sighting and 
other information needed to make informed decisions regarding safe speed 
(the minimum speed at which mission goals or safety will not be 
compromised) and path of intended movement. Subs shall contact 
Commander, Submarine Group Ten for similar information.
    (B) The following specific mitigation measures apply to activities 
occurring within the North Atlantic right whale critical habitat and an 
associated area of concern which extends 9 km (5 NM) seaward of the 
designated critical habitat boundaries:
    (1) When transiting within the critical habitat or associated area 
of concern, vessels shall exercise extreme caution and proceed at a slow 
safe speed. The speed shall be the slowest safe speed that is consistent 
with mission, training and operations.
    (2) Speed reductions (adjustments) are required when a whale is 
sighted by a vessel or when the vessel is within 9 km (5 NM) of a 
reported new sighting less than 12 hours old. Circumstances could arise 
where, in order to avoid North Atlantic right whale(s), speed reductions 
could mean vessels must reduce speed to a minimum at which it can safely 
keep on course or vessels could come to an all stop.
    (3) Vessels shall avoid head-on approaches to North Atlantic right 
whale(s) and shall maneuver to maintain at least 457 m (500 yd) of 
separation from any observed whale if deemed safe to do so. These 
requirements do not apply if a vessel's safety is threatened, such as 
when a change of course would create an imminent and serious threat to a 
person, vessel, or aircraft, and to the extent vessels are restricted in 
the ability to maneuver.
    (4) During the North Atlantic right whale calving season, north-
south transits through the critical habitat are prohibited, except for 
Precision Anchoring drills and the Shipboard Electronic System 
Evaluation Facility range that necessarily operate at slow, safe speed.
    (5) Ships, surfaced subs, and aircraft shall report any whale 
sightings to Fleet Area Control and Surveillance Facility, Jacksonville, 
by the quickest and most practicable means. The sighting report shall 
include the time, latitude/longitude, direction of movement and number 
and description of whale (i.e., adult/calf).
    (6) Naval vessel operations in the North Atlantic right whale 
critical habitat and AAOC during the calving season shall be undertaken 
during daylight and periods of good visibility, to the extent 
practicable and consistent with mission, training, and operation. When 
operating in the critical habitat and AAOC at night or during periods of 
poor visibility, vessels shall operate as

[[Page 170]]

if in the vicinity of a recently reported NARW sighting.
    (iii) Northeast Atlantic, Offshore of the Eastern United States:
    (A) Prior to transiting the Great South Channel or Cape Cod Bay 
critical habitat areas, ships shall obtain the latest North Atlantic 
right whale sightings and other information needed to make informed 
decisions regarding safe speed (the minimum speed at which mission goals 
or safety will not be compromised). The Great South Channel critical 
habitat is defined by the following coordinates: 41-00[deg] N. lat., 69-
05[deg] W. long.; 41-45[deg] N. lat, 69-45[deg] W. long; 42-10[deg] N. 
lat., 68-31[deg] W. long.; 41-38[deg] N. lat., 68-13[deg] W. long. The 
Cape Cod Bay critical habitat is defined by the following coordinates: 
42-04.8[deg] N. lat., 70-10[deg] W. long.; 42-12[deg] N. lat., 70-
15[deg] W. long.; 42-12[deg] N. lat., 70-30[deg] W. long.; 41-46.8[deg] 
N. lat., 70-30[deg] W. long.
    (B) Ships, surfaced subs, and aircraft shall report any North 
Atlantic right whale sightings (if the whale is identifiable as a right 
whale) off the northeastern U.S. to Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing 
(COMPATRECONWING). The report shall include the time of sighting, lat/
long, direction of movement (if apparent) and number and description of 
the whale(s).
    (C) Vessels or aircraft that observe whale carcasses shall record 
the location and time of the sighting and report this information as 
soon as possible to the cognizant regional environmental coordinator. 
All whale strikes must be reported immediately. This report shall 
include the date, time, and location of the strike; vessel course and 
speed; operations being conducted by the vessel; weather conditions, 
visibility, and sea state; description of the whale; narrative of 
incident; and indication of whether photos/videos were taken. Navy 
personnel are encouraged to take photos whenever possible.
    (D) Specific mitigation measures related to activities occurring 
within the critical habitat include the following:
    (1) Vessels shall avoid head-on approaches to North Atlantic right 
whale(s) and shall maneuver to maintain at least 457 m (500 yd) of 
separation from any observed whale if deemed safe to do so. These 
requirements do not apply if a vessel's safety is threatened, such as 
when change of course would create an imminent and serious threat to 
person, vessel, or aircraft, and to the extent vessels are restricted in 
the ability to maneuver.
    (2) When transiting within the critical habitat or associated area 
of concern, vessels shall use extreme caution and operate at a safe 
speed (the minimum speed at which mission goals or safety will not be 
compromised) so as to be able to avoid collisions with North Atlantic 
right whales and other marine mammals, and stop within a distance 
appropriate to the circumstances and conditions.
    (3) Speed reductions (adjustments) are required when a whale is 
sighted by a vessel or when the vessel is within 9 km (5 NM) of a 
reported new sighting less than one week old.
    (4) Ships transiting in the Cape Cod Bay and Great South Channel 
critical habitats shall obtain information on recent whale sightings in 
the vicinity of the critical habitat. Any vessel operating in the 
vicinity of a North Atlantic right whale shall consider additional speed 
reductions as per Rule 6 of International Navigational Rules.
    (4) Mitigation Measures for Specific At-sea Training Events--If a 
marine mammal is injured or killed as a result of the proposed Navy 
training activities (e.g., instances in which it is clear that munitions 
explosions caused death), the Navy shall suspend its activities 
immediately and report such incident to NMFS.
    (i) Firing Exercise (FIREX) Using the Integrated Maritime Portable 
Acoustic Scoring System (IMPASS) (5-in Explosive Rounds):
    (A) This activity shall only occur in Areas BB and CC, or in similar 
areas that will not result in marine mammal takes exceeding the amount 
indicated in Sec. 216.11(c).
    (B) During North Atlantic right whale calving season no explosive 
ordnance shall be used.
    (C) Pre-exercise monitoring of the target area shall be conducted 
with ``Big Eyes'' prior to the event, during deployment of the IMPASS 
sonobuoy array, and during return to the firing position. Ships shall 
maintain a lookout dedicated to visually searching for marine mammals 
180[deg] along the ship

[[Page 171]]

track line and 360[deg] at each buoy drop-off location.
    (D) ``Big Eyes'' on the ship shall be used to monitor a 600 yard 
(548 m) buffer zone for marine mammals during naval-gunfire events.
    (E) Ships shall not fire on the target if any marine mammals are 
detected within or approaching the 600 yd (548 m) buffer zone until the 
area is cleared. If marine mammals are present, operations shall be 
suspended. Visual observation shall occur for approximately 45 minutes, 
or until the animal has been observed to have cleared the area and is 
heading away from the buffer zone.
    (F) Post-exercise monitoring of the entire target area shall take 
place with ``Big Eyes'' and the naked eye during the retrieval of the 
IMPASS sonobuoy array following each firing exercise.
    (G) FIREX with IMPASS shall take place during daylight hours only.
    (H) FIREX with IMPASS shall only be used in Beaufort Sea State three 
(3) or less.
    (I) The visibility must be such that the fall of shot is visible 
from the firing ship during the exercise.
    (J) No firing shall occur if marine mammals are detected within 70 
yards (64 m) of the vessel.
    (ii) Air-to-Surface Missile Exercises (Explosive):
    (A) Aircraft shall initially survey the intended ordnance impact 
area for marine mammals.
    (B) During the actual firing of the weapon, the aircraft involved 
must be able to observe the intended ordnance impact area to ensure the 
area is free of marine mammals transiting the range.
    (C) Visual inspection of the target area shall be made by flying at 
1,500 ft (457 m) altitude or lower, if safe to do so, and at slowest 
safe speed.
    (D) Explosive ordnance shall not be targeted to impact within 1,800 
yd (1,646 m) of sighted marine mammals.
    (iii) Mine Neutralization Training Involving Underwater Detonations 
(up to and including 20-lb charges):
    (A) This activity shall only occur in Undet North and Undet South of 
the JAX Range Complex.
    (B) Observers shall survey the Zone of Influence (ZOI), a 700 yd 
(640 m) radius from detonation location for marine mammals from all 
participating vessels during the entire operation. A survey of the ZOI 
(minimum of 3 parallel tracklines 219 yd [200 m] apart) using support 
craft shall be conducted at the detonation location 30 minutes prior 
through 30 minutes post detonation. Aerial survey support shall be 
utilized whenever assets are available.
    (C) Detonation operations shall be conducted during daylight hours 
only.
    (D) If a marine mammal is sighted within the ZOI, the animal shall 
be allowed to leave of its own volition. The Navy shall suspend 
detonation exercises and ensure the area is clear of marine mammals for 
a full 30 minutes prior to detonation.
    (E) Divers placing the charges on mines and dive support vessel 
personnel shall survey the area for marine mammals and shall report any 
sightings to the surface observers. These animals shall be allowed to 
leave of their own volition and the ZOI shall be clear of marine mammals 
for 30 minutes prior to detonation.
    (F) No detonations shall take place within 3.2 nm (6 km) of an 
estuarine inlet.
    (G) No detonations shall take place within 1.6 nm (3 km) of 
shoreline.
    (H) Personnel shall record any protected species observations during 
the exercise as well as measures taken if species are detected within 
the ZOI.
    (iv) Small Arms Training--Explosive hand grenades (such as the MK3A2 
grenades):
    (A) Lookouts shall visually survey for marine mammals prior to and 
during exercise.
    (B) A 200 yd (182 m) radius buffer zone shall be established around 
the intended target. The exercises shall be conducted only if the buffer

Sec. 218.14  Requirements for monitoring and reporting.

    (a) The Holder of the Letter of Authorization issued pursuant to 
Sec. 216.106 of this chapter and Sec. 218.16 for activities

[[Page 172]]

described in Sec. 218.10(b) is required to cooperate with the NMFS when 
monitoring the impacts of the activity on marine mammals.
    (b) The Holder of the Authorization must notify NMFS immediately (or 
as soon as clearance procedures allow) if the specified activity 
identified in Sec. 218.10(b) is thought to have resulted in the 
mortality or serious injury of any marine mammals, or in any take of 
marine mammals not identified in Sec. 218.10(c).
    (c) The Navy must conduct all monitoring and required reporting 
under the Letter of Authorization, including abiding by the JAX Range 
Complex Monitoring Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference, and 
which requires the Navy to implement, at a minimum, the monitoring 
activities summarized below:
    (1) Vessel or aerial surveys:
    (i) The Holder of this Authorization shall visually survey a minimum 
of 2 explosive events per year, one of which shall be a multiple 
detonation event. One of the vessel or aerial surveys should involve 
professionally trained marine mammal observers (MMOs).
    (ii) When operationally feasible, for specified training events, 
aerial or vessel surveys shall be used 1-2 days prior to, during (if 
reasonably safe), and 1-5 days post detonation.
    (iii) Surveys shall include any specified exclusion zone around a 
particular detonation point plus 2,000 yards beyond the border of the 
exclusion zone (i.e., the circumference of the area from the border of 
the exclusion zone extending 2,000 yards outwards). For vessel-based 
surveys a passive acoustic system (hydrophone or towed array) could be 
used to determine if marine mammals are in the area before and/or after 
a detonation event.
    (iv) When conducting a particular survey, the survey team shall 
collect:
    (A) Location of sighting;
    (B) Species (if not possible, indicate whale, dolphin or pinniped);
    (C) Number of individuals;
    (D) Whether calves were observed;
    (E) Initial detection sensor;
    (F) Length of time observers maintained visual contact with marine 
mammal;
    (G) Wave height;
    (H) Visibility;
    (I) Whether sighting was before, during, or after detonations/
exercise, and how many minutes before or after;
    (J) Distance of marine mammal from actual detonations (or target 
spot if not yet detonated);
    (K) Observed behavior--Watchstanders shall report, in plain language 
and without trying to categorize in any way, the observed behavior of 
the animal(s) (such as animal closing to bow ride, paralleling course/
speed, floating on surface and not swimming etc.), including speed and 
direction;
    (L) Resulting mitigation implementation--Indicate whether explosive 
detonations were delayed, ceased, modified, or not modified due to 
marine mammal presence and for how long; and
    (M) If observation occurs while explosives are detonating in the 
water, indicate munition type in use at time of marine mammal detection.
    (2) Passive acoustic monitoring--the Navy shall conduct passive 
acoustic monitoring when operationally feasible.
    (i) Any time a towed hydrophone array is employed during shipboard 
surveys, the towed array shall be deployed during daylight hours for 
each of the days the ship is at sea.
    (ii) The towed hydrophone array shall be used to supplement the 
ship-based systematic line-transect surveys (particularly for species 
such as beaked whales that are rarely seen).
    (iii) The array shall have the capability of detecting low frequency 
vocalizations (<1,000 Hz) for baleen whales and relatively high 
frequency (up to 30 kHz) for odontocetes. The use of two simultaneously 
deployed arrays can also allow more accurate localization and 
determination of diving patterns.
    (3) Marine mammal observers on Navy platforms:
    (i) As required in Sec. 218.14(c)(1), MMOs selected for aerial or 
vessel survey shall be placed on a Navy platform during one of the 
explosive exercises being monitored per year, the other designated 
exercise shall be monitored by the Navy lookouts/watchstanders.
    (ii) The MMO must possess expertise in species identification of 
regional

[[Page 173]]

marine mammal species and experience collecting behavioral data.
    (iii) MMOs shall not be placed aboard Navy platforms for every Navy 
training event or major exercise, but during specifically identified 
opportunities deemed appropriate for data collection efforts. The events 
selected for MMO participation shall take into account safety, 
logistics, and operational concerns.
    (iv) MMOs shall observe from the same height above water as the 
lookouts.
    (v) The MMOs shall not be part of the Navy's formal reporting chain 
of command during their data collection efforts; Navy lookouts shall 
continue to serve as the primary reporting means within the Navy chain 
of command for marine mammal sightings. The only exception is that if an 
animal is observed within the shutdown zone that has not been observed 
by the lookout, the MMO shall inform the lookout of the sighting and the 
lookout shall take the appropriate action through the chain of command.
    (vi) The MMOs shall collect species identification, behavior, 
direction of travel relative to the Navy platform, and distance first 
observed. Information collected by MMOs shall be the same as those 
collected by Navy lookout/watchstanders described in Sec. 
218.14(c)(1)(iv).
    (d) The Navy shall complete an Integrated Comprehensive Monitoring 
Program (ICMP) Plan in 2009. This planning and adaptive management tool 
shall include:
    (1) A method for prioritizing monitoring projects that clearly 
describes the characteristics of a proposal that factor into its 
priority.
    (2) A method for annually reviewing, with NMFS, monitoring results, 
Navy R&D, and current science to use for potential modification of 
mitigation or monitoring methods.
    (3) A detailed description of the Monitoring Workshop to be convened 
in 2011 and how and when Navy/NMFS will subsequently utilize the 
findings of the Monitoring Workshop to potentially modify subsequent 
monitoring and mitigation.
    (4) An adaptive management plan.
    (5) A method for standardizing data collection for JAX Range Complex 
and across range complexes.
    (e) General Notification of Injured or Dead Marine Mammals--Navy 
personnel shall ensure that NMFS (regional stranding coordinator) is 
notified immediately (or as soon as clearance procedures allow) if an 
injured or dead marine mammal is found during or shortly after, and in 
the vicinity of, any Navy training exercise utilizing underwater 
explosive detonations. The Navy shall provide NMFS with species or 
description of the animal(s), the condition of the animal(s) (including 
carcass condition if the animal is dead), location, time of first 
discovery, observed behaviors (if alive), and photo or video (if 
available).
    (f) Annual JAX Range Complex Monitoring Plan Report--The Navy shall 
submit a report annually on March 1 describing the implementation and 
results (through January 1 of the same year) of the JAX Range Complex 
Monitoring Plan. Data collection methods will be standardized across 
range complexes to allow for comparison in different geographic 
locations. Although additional information will also be gathered, the 
MMOs collecting marine mammal data pursuant to the JAX Range Complex 
Monitoring Plan shall, at a minimum, provide the same marine mammal 
observation data required in Sec. 218.14(g). The JAX Range Complex 
Monitoring Plan Report may be provided to NMFS within a larger report 
that includes the required Monitoring Plan Reports from JAX Range 
Complex and multiple range complexes.
    (g) Annual JAX Range Complex Exercise Report--The Navy shall provide 
the information described below for all of their explosive exercises. 
Until the Navy is able to report in full the information below, they 
shall provide an annual update on the Navy's explosive tracking methods, 
including improvements from the previous year.
    (i) Total annual number of each type of explosive exercise (of those 
identified as part of the ``specified activity'' in this final rule) 
conducted in the JAX Range Complex.

[[Page 174]]

    (ii) Total annual expended/detonated rounds (missiles, bombs, etc.) 
for each explosive type.
    (h) JAX Range Complex 5-yr Comprehensive Report--The Navy shall 
submit to NMFS a draft report that analyzes and summarizes all of the 
multi-year marine mammal information gathered during the JAX Range 
Complex exercises for which annual reports are required (Annual JAX 
Range Complex Exercise Reports and JAX Range Complex Monitoring Plan 
Reports). This report shall be submitted at the end of the fourth year 
of the rule (May 2013), covering activities that have occurred through 
December 1, 2012.
    (i) The Navy shall respond to NMFS' comments and requests for 
additional information or clarification on the JAX Range Complex 
Comprehensive Report, the Annual JAX Range Complex Exercise Report, or 
the Annual JAX Range Complex Monitoring Plan Report (or the multi-Range 
Complex Annual Monitoring Plan Report, if that is how the Navy chooses 
to submit the information) if submitted within 3 months of receipt. 
These reports will be considered final after the Navy has addressed 
NMFS' comments or provided the requested information, or three months 
after the submittal of the draft if NMFS does not comment by then.
    (j) In 2011, the Navy shall convene a Monitoring Workshop in which 
the Monitoring Workshop participants will be asked to review the Navy's 
Monitoring Plans and monitoring results and make individual 
recommendations (to the Navy and NMFS) of ways of improving the 
Monitoring Plans. The recommendations shall be reviewed by the Navy, in 
consultation with NMFS, and modifications to the Monitoring Plan shall 
be made, as appropriate.

Sec. 218.22  Prohibitions.

    Notwithstanding takings contemplated in Sec. 218.21 and authorized 
by a Letter of Authorization issued under Sec. Sec. 216.106 of this 
chapter and 218.26, no person in connection with the activities 
described in Sec. 218.20 may:
    (a) Take any marine mammal not specified in Sec. 218.21(c);
    (b) Take any marine mammal specified in Sec. 218.21(c) other than 
by incidental take as specified in Sec. 218.21(b)(1) and (2);
    (c) Take a marine mammal specified in Sec. 218.21(c) if such taking

    (d) Violate, or fail to comply with, the terms, conditions, and 
requirements of this Subpart or a Letter of Authorization issued under 
Sec. Sec. 216.106 of this chapter and 218.26.


<R05>
Sec. 218.23  Mitigation.

    (a) When conducting training activities identified in Sec. 
218.20(c), the mitigation measures contained in the Letters of 
Authorization issued under Sec. Sec. 216.106 of this chapter and 218.26 
must be implemented. These mitigation measures include, but are not 
limited to:
    (1) General Maritime Measures:
    (i) Personnel Training--Lookouts:
    (A) All bridge personnel, Commanding Officers, Executive Officers, 
officers standing watch on the bridge, maritime patrol aircraft 
aircrews, and Mine Warfare (MIW) helicopter crews shall complete Marine 
Species Awareness Training (MSAT).
    (B) Navy lookouts shall undertake extensive training to qualify as a 
watchstander in accordance with the Lookout Training Handbook (NAVEDTRA 
12968-D).
    (C) Lookout training shall include on-the-job instruction under the 
supervision of a qualified, experienced watchstander. Following 
successful completion of this supervised training period, lookouts shall 
complete the Personal Qualification Standard Program, certifying that 
they have demonstrated the necessary skills (such as detection and 
reporting of partially submerged objects).
    (D) Lookouts shall be trained in the most effective means to ensure 
quick and effective communication within the command structure to 
facilitate implementation of protective measures if marine species are 
spotted.
    (E) Surface lookouts shall scan the water from the ship to the 
horizon and be responsible for all contacts in their sector. In 
searching the assigned sector, the lookout shall always start at the 
forward part of the sector and search aft (toward the back). To search 
and scan, the lookout shall hold the binoculars steady so the horizon is 
in the top third of the field of vision and direct the eyes just below 
the horizon. The lookout shall scan for approximately five seconds in as 
many small steps as possible across the field seen through the 
binoculars. They shall search the entire sector in approximately five-
degree steps, pausing between steps for approximately five seconds to 
scan the field of view. At the end of the sector search, the glasses 
shall be lowered to allow the eyes to rest for a few seconds, and then 
the lookout shall search back across the sector with the naked eye.
    (F) At night, lookouts shall scan the horizon in a series of 
movements that would allow their eyes to come to periodic rests as they 
scan the sector. When visually searching at night, they shall look a 
little to one side and out of the corners of their eyes, paying 
attention to the things on the outer edges of their field of vision. 
Lookouts shall also have night vision devices available for use.
    (ii) Operating Procedures and Collision Avoidance:
    (A) Prior to major exercises, a Letter of Instruction, Mitigation 
Measures Message or Environmental Annex to the Operational Order shall 
be issued to further disseminate the personnel training requirement and 
general marine species mitigation measures.
    (B) Commanding Officers shall make use of marine species detection 
cues

[[Page 178]]

and information to limit interaction with marine species to the maximum 
extent possible consistent with safety of the ship.
    (C) While underway, surface vessels shall have at least two lookouts 
with binoculars; surfaced submarines shall have at least one lookout 
with binoculars. Lookouts already posted for safety of navigation and 
man-overboard precautions may be used to fill this requirement. As part 
of their regular duties, lookouts shall watch for and report to the OOD 
the presence of marine mammals.
    (D) Personnel on lookout shall employ visual search procedures 
employing a scanning method in accordance with the Lookout Training 
Handbook (NAVEDTRA 12968-D).
    (E) After sunset and prior to sunrise, lookouts shall employ Night 
Lookouts Techniques in accordance with the Lookout Training Handbook 
(NAVEDTRA 12968-D).
    (F) While in transit, naval vessels shall be alert at all times, use 
extreme caution, and proceed at a ``safe speed'' (the minimum speed at 
which mission goals or safety will not be compromised) so that the 
vessel can take proper and effective action to avoid a collision with 
any marine animal and can be stopped within a distance appropriate to 
the prevailing circumstances and conditions.
    (G) When marine mammals have been sighted in the area, Navy vessels 
shall increase vigilance and implement measures to avoid collisions with 
marine mammals and avoid activities that might result in close 
interaction of naval assets and marine mammals. Such measures shall 
include changing speed and/or course direction and would be dictated by 
environmental and other conditions (e.g., safety or weather).
    (H) Naval vessels shall maneuver to keep at least 500 yds (460 m) 
away from any observed whale and avoid approaching whales head-on. This 
requirement does not apply if a vessel's safety is threatened, such as 
when change of course will create an imminent and serious threat to a 
person, vessel, or aircraft, and to the extent vessels are restricted in 
their ability to maneuver. Vessels shall take reasonable steps to alert 
other vessels in the vicinity of the whale.
    (I) Where feasible and consistent with mission and safety, vessels 
shall avoid closing to within 200-yd (183 m) of marine mammals other 
than whales (whales addressed above).
    (J) Navy aircraft participating in exercises at sea shall conduct 
and maintain, when operationally feasible and safe, surveillance for 
marine species of concern as long as it does not violate safety 
constraints or interfere with the accomplishment of primary operational 
duties. Marine mammal detections shall be immediately reported to 
assigned Aircraft Control Unit for further dissemination to ships in the 
vicinity of the marine species as appropriate where it is reasonable to 
conclude that the course of the ship will likely result in a closing of 
the distance to the detected marine mammal.
    (K) All vessels shall maintain logs and records documenting training 
operations should they be required for event reconstruction purposes. 
Logs and records shall be kept for a period of 30 days following 
completion of a major training exercise.
    (2) Coordination and Reporting Requirements. (i) The Navy shall 
coordinate with the local NMFS Stranding Coordinator for any unusual 
marine mammal behavior and any stranding, beached live/dead, or floating 
marine mammals that may occur at any time during training activities or 
within 24 hours after completion of training activities.
    (ii) The Navy shall follow internal chain of command reporting 
procedures as promulgated through Navy instructions and orders.
    (3) Mitigation Measures Applicable to Vessel Transit in the Mid-
Atlantic during North Atlantic Right Whale Migration: The mitigation 
measures apply to all Navy vessel transits, including those vessels that 
would transit to and from East Coast ports and the Cherry Point OPAREA.
    (i) Mid-Atlantic, Offshore of the Eastern United States:
    (A) All Navy vessels are required to use extreme caution and operate 
at a slow, safe speed (at a speed that does not compromise safety of 
navigation)

[[Page 179]]

consistent with mission and safety during the months indicated below and 
within a 37 km (20 NM) arc (except as noted) of the specified associated 
reference points:
    (1) South and East of Block Island (37 km (20 NM) seaward of line 
between 41-4.49[deg] N. lat. 071-51.15[deg] W. long. and 41-18.58[deg] 
N. lat. 070-50.23[deg] W. long): Sept-Oct and Mar-Apr.
    (2) New York/New Jersey (40-30.64[deg] N. lat. 073-57.76[deg] W. 
long.): Sep-Oct and Feb-Apr.
    (3) Delaware Bay (Philadelphia) (38-52.13[deg] N. lat. 075-1.93[deg] 
W. long.): Oct-Dec and Feb-Mar.
    (4) Chesapeake Bay (Hampton Roads and Baltimore) (37-1.11[deg] N. 
lat. 075-57.56[deg] W. long.): Nov-Dec and Feb-Apr.
    (5) North Carolina (34-41.54[deg] N. lat. 076-40.20[deg] W. long.): 
Dec-Apr.
    (6) South Carolina (33-11.84[deg] N. lat. 079-8.99[deg] W. long. and 
32-43.39[deg] N. lat. 079-48.72[deg] W. long.): Oct-Apr.
    (B) During the months indicated in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this 
section, Navy vessels shall practice increased vigilance with respect to 
avoidance of vessel-whale interactions along the mid-Atlantic coast, 
including transits to and from any mid-Atlantic ports not specifically 
identified in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section.
    (C) All surface units transiting within 56 km (30 NM) of the coast 
in the mid-Atlantic shall ensure at least two watchstanders are posted, 
including at least one lookout who has completed required MSAT training.
    (D) Navy vessels shall not knowingly approach any whale head on and 
shall maneuver to keep at least 457 m (1,500 ft) away from any observed 
whale, consistent with vessel safety.
    (ii) Southeast Atlantic, Offshore of the Eastern United States--for 
the purposes of the measures below (paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A) & (B) of 
this section), the ``southeast'' encompasses sea space from Charleston, 
South Carolina, southward to Sebastian Inlet, Florida, and from the 
coast seaward to 148 km (80 NM) from shore. North Atlantic right whale 
critical habitat is the area from 31-15[deg] N. lat. to 30-15[deg] N. 
lat. extending from the coast out to 28 km (15 NM), and the area from 
28-00[deg] N. lat. to 30-15[deg] N. lat. from the coast out to 9 km (5 
NM). All mitigation measures described here that apply to the critical 
habitat apply from November 15--April 15 and also apply to an associated 
area of concern which extends 9 km (5 NM) seaward of the designated 
critical habitat boundaries.
    (A) Prior to transiting or training in the critical habitat or 
associated area of concern (AAOC), ships shall contact Fleet Area 
Control and Surveillance Facility, Jacksonville, to obtain latest whale 
sighting and other information needed to make informed decisions 
regarding safe speed (the minimum speed at which mission goals or safety 
will not be compromised) and path of intended movement. Subs shall 
contact Commander, Submarine Group Ten for similar information.
    (B) The following specific mitigation measures apply to activities 
occurring within the North Atlantic right whale critical habitat and an 
associated area of concern which extends 9 km (5 NM) seaward of the 
designated critical habitat boundaries:
    (1) When transiting within the critical habitat or associated area 
of concern, vessels shall exercise extreme caution and proceed at a slow 
safe speed. The speed shall be the slowest safe speed that is consistent 
with mission, training and operations.
    (2) Speed reductions (adjustments) are required when a whale is 
sighted by a vessel or when the vessel is within 9 km (5 NM) of a 
reported new sighting less than 12 hours old. Circumstances could arise 
where, in order to avoid North Atlantic right whale(s), speed reductions 
could mean vessels must reduce speed to a minimum at which it can safely 
keep on course or vessels could come to an all stop.
    (3) Vessels shall avoid head-on approaches to North Atlantic right 
whale(s) and shall maneuver to maintain at least 457 m (500 yd) of 
separation from any observed whale if deemed safe to do so. These 
requirements do not apply if a vessel's safety is threatened, such as 
when a change of course would create an imminent and serious threat to a 
person, vessel, or aircraft, and to the extent vessels are restricted in 
the ability to maneuver.
    (4) During the North Atlantic right whale calving season, north-
south

[[Page 180]]

transits through the critical habitat are prohibited.
    (5) Ships, surfaced subs, and aircraft shall report any whale 
sightings to Fleet Area Control and Surveillance Facility, Jacksonville, 
by the quickest and most practicable means. The sighting report shall 
include the time, latitude/longitude, direction of movement and number 
and description of whale (i.e., adult/calf).
    (6) Naval vessel operations in the North Atlantic right whale 
critical habitat and AAOC during the calving season shall be undertaken 
during daylight and periods of good visibility, to the extent 
practicable and consistent with mission, training, and operation. When 
operating in the critical habitat and AAOC at night or during periods of 
poor visibility, vessels shall operate as if in the vicinity of a 
recently reported NARW sighting.
    (iii) Northeast Atlantic, Offshore of the Eastern United States:
    (A) Prior to transiting the Great South Channel or Cape Cod Bay 
critical habitat areas, ships shall obtain the latest North Atlantic 
right whale sightings and other information needed to make informed 
decisions regarding safe speed (the minimum speed at which mission goals 
or safety will not be compromised). The Great South Channel critical 
habitat is defined by the following coordinates: 41-00[deg] N. lat., 69-
05[deg] W. long.; 41-45[deg] N. lat, 69-45[deg] W. long; 42-10[deg] N. 
lat., 68-31[deg] W. long.; 41-38[deg] N. lat., 68-13[deg] W. long. The 
Cape Cod Bay critical habitat is defined by the following coordinates: 
42-04.8[deg] N. lat., 70-10[deg] W. long.; 42-12[deg] N. lat., 70-
15[deg] W. long.; 42-12[deg] N. lat., 70-30[deg] W. long.; 41-46.8[deg] 
N. lat., 70-30[deg] W. long.
    (B) Ships, surfaced subs, and aircraft shall report any North 
Atlantic right whale sightings (if the whale is identifiable as a right 
whale) off the northeastern U.S. to Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing 
(COMPATRECONWING). The report shall include the time of sighting, lat/
long, direction of movement (if apparent) and number and description of 
the whale(s).
    (C) Vessels or aircraft that observe whale carcasses shall record 
the location and time of the sighting and report this information as 
soon as possible to the cognizant regional environmental coordinator. 
All whale strikes must be reported. This report shall include the date, 
time, and location of the strike; vessel course and speed; operations 
being conducted by the vessel; weather conditions, visibility, and sea 
state; description of the whale; narrative of incident; and indication 
of whether photos/videos of the whale were taken. Navy personnel are 
encouraged to take photos of the whale whenever possible.
    (D) Specific mitigation measures related to activities occurring 
within the critical habitat include the following:
    (1) Vessels shall avoid head-on approaches to North Atlantic right 
whale(s) and shall maneuver to maintain at least 457 m (500 yd) of 
separation from any observed whale if deemed safe to do so. These 
requirements do not apply if a vessel's safety is threatened, such as 
when change of course would create an imminent and serious threat to 
person, vessel, or aircraft, and to the extent vessels are restricted in 
the ability to maneuver.
    (2) When transiting within the critical habitat or associated area 
of concern, vessels shall use extreme caution and operate at a safe 
speed (the minimum speed at which mission goals or safety will not be 
compromised) so as to be able to avoid collisions with North Atlantic 
right whales and other marine mammals, and stop within a distance 
appropriate to the circumstances and conditions.
    (3) Speed reductions (adjustments) are required when a whale is 
sighted by a vessel or when the vessel is within 9 km (5 NM) of a 
reported new sighting less than one week old.
    (4) Ships transiting in the Cape Cod Bay and Great South Channel 
critical habitats shall obtain information on recent whale sightings in 
the vicinity of the critical habitat. Any vessel operating in the 
vicinity of a North Atlantic right whale shall consider additional speed 
reductions as per Rule 6 of International Navigational Rules.
    (4) Mitigation Measures for Specific At-sea Training Events--If a 
marine mammal is killed as a result of the proposed Navy training 
activities (e.g., instances in which it is clear that munitions 
explosions caused the death), the Navy shall suspend its activities

[[Page 181]]

immediately and report the incident to NMFS.
    (i) Firing Exercise (FIREX) Using the Integrated Maritime Portable 
Acoustic Scoring System (IMPASS) (5-in Explosive Rounds)
    (A) This activity shall only occur in Areas 4/5 and 13/14, or in 
similar areas that will not result in marine mammal takes exceeding the 
amount indicated in Sec. 218.21(c).
    (B) Pre-exercise monitoring of the target area shall be conducted 
with ``Big Eyes'' prior to the event, during deployment of the IMPASS 
sonobuoy array, and during return to the firing position. Ships shall 
maintain lookouts dedicated to visually searching for marine mammals 
180[deg] along the ship track line and 360[deg] at each buoy drop-off 
location.
    (C) ``Big Eyes'' on the ship shall be used to monitor a 600-yd (548-
m) buffer zone for marine mammals during naval-gunfire events.
    (D) Ships shall not fire on the target if any marine mammals are 
detected within or approaching the 600-yd (548-m) buffer zone. If marine 
mammals are present, operations must be suspended. Visual observation 
shall occur for approximately 45 min, or until the animal has been 
observed to have cleared the area and is heading away from the buffer 
zone. At such time as animals have cleared the area and are heading away 
from the buffer zone, the Navy may begin or resume operations.
    (E) Post-exercise monitoring of the entire target area shall take 
place with ``Big Eyes'' and the naked eye during the retrieval of the 
IMPASS sonobuoy array following each firing exercise.
    (F) The naval gunfire shall take place during daylight hours only.
    (G) FIREX with IMPASS shall only be used in Beaufort Sea State three 
(3) or less.
    (H) The visibility must be such that the fall of shot is visible 
from the firing ship during the exercise.
    (I) No firing shall occur if marine mammals are detected within 70 
yd (64 m) of the vessel.
    (ii) Air-to-Surface Missile Exercises (Explosive):
    (A) Aircraft shall initially survey the intended ordnance impact 
area for marine mammals.
    (B) During the actual firing of the weapon, the aircraft involved 
must be able to observe the intended ordnance impact area to ensure the 
area is free of marine mammals transiting the range.
    (C) Visual inspection of the target area shall be made by flying at 
1,500 ft (457 m) altitude or lower, if safe to do so, and at slowest 
safe speed.
    (D) Explosive ordnance shall not be targeted to impact within 1,800 
yd (1,646 m) of sighted marine mammals.
    (iii) Mine Neutralization Training Involving Underwater Detonations 
(up to and including 20-lb charges):
    (A) This activity shall only occur in W-15 of the Cherry Point Range 
Complex.
    (B) Observers shall survey the Zone of Influence (ZOI), a 700 yd 
(640 m) radius from detonation location for marine mammals from all 
participating vessels during the entire operation. A survey of the ZOI 
(minimum of 3 parallel tracklines 219 yd [200 m] apart) using support 
craft shall be conducted at the detonation location 30 minutes prior 
through 30 minutes post detonation. Aerial survey support shall be 
utilized whenever operationally feasible.
    (C) Detonation operations shall be conducted during daylight hours 
only.
    (D) If a marine mammal is sighted within the ZOI, the animal shall 
be allowed to leave of its own volition. The Navy shall suspend 
detonation exercises and ensure the area is clear of marine mammals for 
a full 30 minutes prior to detonation.
    (E) Divers placing the charges on mines and dive support vessel 
personnel shall survey the area for marine mammals and shall report any 
sightings to the surface observers. These animals shall be allowed to 
leave of their own volition and the ZOI shall be clear of marine mammals 
for 30 minutes prior to detonation.
    (F) No detonations shall take place within 3.2 nm (6 km) of an 
estuarine inlet.
    (G) No detonations shall take place within 1.6 nm (3 km) of 
shoreline.
    (H) Personnel shall record any protected species observations during 
the

[[Page 182]]

exercise as well as measures taken if species are detected within the 
ZOI.

Sec. 218.24  Requirements for monitoring and reporting.

    (a) The Holder of the Letter of Authorization issued pursuant to 
Sec. 216.106 of this chapter and Sec. 218.26 for activities described 
in Sec. 218.20(c) is required to cooperate with the NMFS when 
monitoring the impacts of the activity on marine mammals.
    (b) The Holder of the Authorization must notify NMFS immediately (or 
as soon as clearance procedures allow) if the specified activity 
identified in Sec. 218.20(c) is thought to have resulted in the 
mortality or serious injury of any marine mammals, or in any take of 
marine mammals not identified in Sec. 218.21(c).
    (c) The Navy must conduct all monitoring and required reporting 
under the Letter of Authorization, including abiding by the Cherry Point 
Range Complex Monitoring Plan, which is incorporated herein by 
reference, and which requires the Navy to implement, at a minimum, the 
monitoring activities summarized below.
    (1) Vessel or aerial surveys.
    (i) The Holder of this Authorization shall visually survey a minimum 
of 1 explosive event per year. If possible, the event surveyed shall be 
one involving multiple detonations. One of the vessel or aerial surveys 
should involve professionally trained marine mammal observers (MMOs). If 
it is impossible to conduct the required surveys due to lack of training 
exercises, the missed annual survey requirement shall roll into the 
subsequent year to ensure that the appropriate number of surveys (i.e., 
total of five) occurs over the 5-year period of effectiveness of this 
subject.
    (ii) When operationally feasible, for specified training events, 
aerial or vessel surveys shall be used 1-2 days prior to, during (if 
reasonably safe), and 1-5 days post detonation.
    (iii) Surveys shall include any specified exclusion zone around a 
particular detonation point plus 2,000 yards beyond the border of the 
exclusion zone (i.e., the circumference of the area from the border of 
the exclusion zone extending 2,000 yards outwards). For vessel based 
surveys, a passive acoustic system (hydrophone or towed array) could be 
used to determine if marine mammals are in the area before and/or after 
a detonation event.
    (iv) When conducting a particular survey, the survey team shall 
collect:
    (A) Location of sighting;
    (B) Species (if not possible, indicate whale, dolphin or pinniped);
    (C) Number of individuals;
    (D) Whether calves were observed;
    (E) Initial detection sensor;
    (F) Length of time observers maintained visual contact with marine 
mammal;
    (G) Wave height;
    (H) Visibility;
    (I) Whether sighting was before, during, or after detonations/
exercise, and how many minutes before or after;
    (J) Distance of marine mammal from actual detonations (or target 
spot if not yet detonated);
    (K) Observed behavior--Watchstanders shall report, in plain language 
and without trying to categorize in any way, the observed behavior of 
the animal(s) (such as animal closing to bow ride, paralleling course/
speed, floating on surface and not swimming etc.), including speed and 
direction;
    (L) Resulting mitigation implementation--Indicate whether explosive 
detonations were delayed, ceased, modified, or not modified due to 
marine mammal presence and for how long; and
    (M) If observation occurs while explosives are detonating in the 
water, indicate munitions type in use at time of marine mammal 
detection.
    (2) Passive acoustic monitoring--the Navy shall conduct passive 
acoustic monitoring when operationally feasible.
    (i) Any time a towed hydrophone array is employed during shipboard 
surveys, the towed array shall be deployed during daylight hours for 
each of the days the ship is at sea.
    (ii) The towed hydrophone array shall be used to supplement the 
ship-based systematic line-transect surveys (particularly for species 
such as beaked whales that are rarely seen).

[[Page 183]]

    (iii) The array should have the capability of detecting low 
frequency vocalizations (<1,000 Hz) for baleen whales and relatively 
high frequency (up to 30 kHz) for odontocetes. The use of two 
simultaneously deployed arrays can also allow more accurate localization 
and determination of diving patterns.
    (3) Marine mammal observers on Navy platforms:
    (i) As required in Sec. 218.24(c)(1), MMOs who are selected for 
aerial or vessel surveys shall be placed on a Navy platform during one 
of the explosive exercises being monitored per year, the other 
designated exercise shall be monitored by the Navy lookouts/
watchstanders.
    (ii) The MMO must possess expertise in species identification of 
regional marine mammal species and experience collecting behavioral 
data.
    (iii) MMOs shall not be placed aboard Navy platforms for every Navy 
training event or major exercise, but during specifically identified 
opportunities deemed appropriate for data collection efforts. The events 
selected for MMO participation shall take into account safety, 
logistics, and operational concerns.
    (iv) MMOs shall observe from the same height above water as the 
lookouts.
    (v) The MMOs shall not be part of the Navy's formal reporting chain 
of command during their data collection efforts; Navy lookouts shall 
continue to serve as the primary reporting means within the Navy chain 
of command for marine mammal sightings. The only exception is that if an 
animal is observed within the shutdown zone that has not been observed 
by the lookout, the MMO shall inform the lookout of the sighting and the 
lookout shall take the appropriate action through the chain of command.
    (vi) The MMOs shall collect species identification, behavior, 
direction of travel relative to the Navy platform, and distance first 
observed. Information collected by MMOs should be the same as those 
collected by Navy lookout/watchstanders described in Sec. 
218.24(c)(1)(iv).
    (d) The Navy shall complete an Integrated Comprehensive Monitoring 
Program (ICMP) Plan in 2009. This planning and adaptive management tool 
shall include:
    (1) A method for prioritizing monitoring projects that clearly 
describes the characteristics of a proposal that factor into its 
priority.
    (2) A method for annually reviewing, with NMFS, monitoring results, 
Navy R&D, and current science to use for potential modification of 
mitigation or monitoring methods.
    (3) A detailed description of the Monitoring Workshop to be convened 
in 2011 and how and when Navy/NMFS will subsequently utilize the 
findings of the Monitoring Workshop to potentially modify subsequent 
monitoring and mitigation.
    (4) An adaptive management plan,
    (5) A method for standardizing data collection for Cherry Point 
Range Complex and across range complexes,
    (e) General Notification of Injured or Dead Marine Mammals--Navy 
personnel shall ensure that NMFS (regional stranding coordinator) is 
notified immediately (or as soon as clearance procedures allow) if an 
injured or dead marine mammal is found during or shortly after, and in 
the vicinity of, any Navy training exercise utilizing underwater 
explosive detonations. The Navy shall provide NMFS with species or 
description of the animal(s), the condition of the animal(s) (including 
carcass condition if the animal is dead), location, time of first 
discovery, observed behaviors (if alive), and photo or video (if 
available).
    (f) Annual Cherry Point Range Complex Monitoring Plan Report--The 
Navy shall submit a report annually on March 1 describing the 
implementation and results (through January 1 of the same year) of the 
Cherry Point Range Complex Monitoring Plan. Data collection methods 
shall be standardized across range complexes to allow for comparison in 
different geographic locations. Although additional information will 
also be gathered, the MMOs collecting marine mammal data pursuant to the 
Cherry Point Range Complex Monitoring Plan shall, at a minimum, provide 
the same marine mammal observation data required in the data required in 
Sec. 218.24(g). The Cherry Point Range Complex Monitoring Plan

[[Page 184]]

Report may be provided to NMFS within a larger report that includes the 
required Monitoring Plan Reports from Cherry Point Range Complex and 
multiple range complexes.
    (g) Annual Cherry Point Range Complex Exercise Report--The Navy 
shall provide the information described below for all of their explosive 
exercises. Until the Navy is able to report in full the information 
below, they shall provide an annual update on the Navy's explosive 
tracking methods, including improvements from the previous year.
    (1) Total annual number of each type of explosive exercise (of those 
identified as part of the ``specified activity'' in this final rule) 
conducted in the Cherry Point Range Complex.
    (2) Total annual expended/detonated rounds (missiles, bombs, etc.) 
for each explosive type.
    (h) Cherry Point Range Complex 5-yr Comprehensive Report--The Navy 
shall submit to NMFS a draft report that analyzes and summarizes all of 
the multi-year marine mammal information gathered during the Cherry 
Point Range Complex exercises for which annual reports are required 
(Annual Cherry Point Range Complex Exercise Reports and Cherry Point 
Range Complex Monitoring Plan Reports). This report shall be submitted 
at the end of the fourth year of the rule (May 2013), covering 
activities that have occurred through December 1, 2012.
    (i) The Navy shall respond to NMFS comments and requests for 
additional information or clarification on the Cherry Point Range 
Complex Comprehensive Report, the Annual Cherry Point Range Complex 
Exercise Report, or the Annual Cherry Point Range Complex Monitoring 
Plan Report (or the multi-Range Complex Annual Monitoring Plan Report, 
if that is how the Navy chooses to submit the information) if submitted 
within 3 months of receipt. These reports will be considered final after 
the Navy has addressed NMFS' comments or provided the requested 
information, or three months after the submittal of the draft if NMFS 
does not comment by then.
    (j) In 2011, the Navy shall convene a Monitoring Workshop in which 
the Monitoring Workshop participants will be asked to review the Navy's 
Monitoring Plans and monitoring results and make individual 
recommendations (to the Navy and NMFS) of ways of improving the 
Monitoring Plans. The recommendations shall be reviewed by the Navy, in 
consultation with NMFS, and modifications to the Monitoring Plan shall 
be made, as appropriate.

requirements of this Subpart or a Letter of Authorization issued under 
Sec. 216.106 of this chapter and Sec. 218.36.


<R05>
Sec. 218.33  Mitigation.

    (a) When conducting training activities identified in Sec. 
218.30(c), the mitigation measures contained in the Letter of 
Authorization issued under Sec. 216.106 of this chapter and Sec. 
218.36 must be implemented. These mitigation measures include, but are 
not limited to:
    (1) General Maritime Measures:
    (i) Personnel Training--Lookouts:
    (A) All bridge personnel, Commanding Officers, Executive Officers, 
officers standing watch on the bridge, maritime patrol aircraft 
aircrews, and Mine Warfare (MIW) helicopter crews shall complete Marine 
Species Awareness Training (MSAT).
    (B) Navy lookouts shall undertake extensive training to qualify as a 
watchstander in accordance with the Lookout Training Handbook (NAVEDTRA 
12968-D).
    (C) Lookout training shall include on-the-job instruction under the 
supervision of a qualified, experienced watchstander. Following 
successful completion of this supervised training period, lookouts shall 
complete the Personal Qualification Standard Program, certifying that 
they have demonstrated the necessary skills (such as

[[Page 188]]

detection and reporting of partially submerged objects).
    (D) Lookouts shall be trained in the most effective means to ensure 
quick and effective communication within the command structure to 
facilitate implementation of protective measures if marine species are 
spotted.
    (E) Surface lookouts shall scan the water from the ship to the 
horizon and be responsible for all contacts in their sector. In 
searching the assigned sector, the lookout shall always start at the 
forward part of the sector and search aft (toward the back). To search 
and scan, the lookout shall hold the binoculars steady so the horizon is 
in the top third of the field of vision and direct the eyes just below 
the horizon. The lookout shall scan for approximately five seconds in as 
many small steps as possible across the field seen through the 
binoculars. They shall search the entire sector in approximately five-
degree steps, pausing between steps for approximately five seconds to 
scan the field of view. At the end of the sector search, the glasses 
shall be lowered to allow the eyes to rest for a few seconds, and then 
the lookout shall search back across the sector with the naked eye.
    (F) At night, lookouts shall scan the horizon in a series of 
movements that would allow their eyes to come to periodic rests as they 
scan the sector. When visually searching at night, they shall look a 
little to one side and out of the corners of their eyes, paying 
attention to the things on the outer edges of their field of vision. 
Lookouts shall also have night vision devices available for use.
    (ii) Operating Procedures & Collision Avoidance:
    (A) Prior to major exercises, a Letter of Instruction, Mitigation 
Measures Message or Environmental Annex to the Operational Order shall 
be issued to further disseminate the personnel training requirement and 
general marine species mitigation measures.
    (B) Commanding Officers shall make use of marine species detection 
cues and information to limit interaction with marine species to the 
maximum extent possible consistent with safety of the ship.
    (C) While underway, surface vessels shall have at least two lookouts 
with binoculars; surfaced submarines shall have at least one lookout 
with binoculars. Lookouts already posted for safety of navigation and 
man-overboard precautions may be used to fill this requirement. As part 
of their regular duties, lookouts shall watch for and report to the OOD 
the presence of marine mammals.
    (D) Personnel on lookout shall employ visual search procedures 
employing a scanning method in accordance with the Lookout Training 
Handbook (NAVEDTRA 12968-D).
    (E) After sunset and prior to sunrise, lookouts shall employ Night 
Lookouts Techniques in accordance with the Lookout Training Handbook 
(NAVEDTRA 12968-D).
    (F) While in transit, naval vessels shall be alert at all times, use 
extreme caution, and proceed at a ``safe speed'' (the minimum speed at 
which mission goals or safety will not be compromised) so that the 
vessel can take proper and effective action to avoid a collision with 
any marine animal and can be stopped within a distance appropriate to 
the prevailing circumstances and conditions.
    (G) When marine mammals have been sighted in the area, Navy vessels 
shall increase vigilance and implement measures to avoid collisions with 
marine mammals and avoid activities that might result in close 
interaction of naval assets and marine mammals. Such measures shall 
include changing speed and/or course direction and would be dictated by 
environmental and other conditions (e.g., safety or weather).
    (H) Naval vessels shall maneuver to keep at least 500 yds (460 m) 
away from any observed whale and avoid approaching whales head-on. This 
requirement does not apply if a vessel's safety is threatened, such as 
when change of course will create an imminent and serious threat to a 
person, vessel, or aircraft, and to the extent vessels are restricted in 
their ability to maneuver. Vessels shall take reasonable steps to alert 
other vessels in the vicinity of the whale.
    (I) Where feasible and consistent with mission and safety, vessels 
shall avoid

[[Page 189]]

closing to within 200-yd (183 m) of marine mammals other than whales 
(whales addressed above).
    (J) Navy aircraft participating in exercises at sea shall conduct 
and maintain, when operationally feasible and safe, surveillance for 
marine species of concern as long as it does not violate safety 
constraints or interfere with the accomplishment of primary operational 
duties. Marine mammal detections shall be immediately reported to 
assigned Aircraft Control Unit for further dissemination to ships in the 
vicinity of the marine species as appropriate where it is reasonable to 
conclude that the course of the ship will likely result in a closing of 
the distance to the detected marine mammal.
    (K) All vessels shall maintain logs and records documenting training 
operations should they be required for event reconstruction purposes. 
Logs and records shall be kept for a period of 30 days following 
completion of a major training exercise.
    (2) Coordination and Reporting Requirements:
    (i) The Navy shall coordinate with the local NMFS Stranding 
Coordinator for any unusual marine mammal behavior and any stranding, 
beached live/dead, or floating marine mammals that may occur at any time 
during or within 24 hours after completion of training activities.
    (ii) The Navy shall follow internal chain of command reporting 
procedures as promulgated through Navy instructions and orders.
    (3) Mitigation Measures for Specific At-sea Training Events--If a 
marine mammal is injured or killed as a result of the proposed Navy 
training activities (e.g., instances in which it is clear that munitions 
explosions caused the death), the Navy shall suspend its activities 
immediately and report such incident to NMFS.
    (i) Air-to-Surface At-Sea Bombing Exercises (1,000-lbs explosive 
bombs):
    (A) This activity shall only occur in the W-155A/B (hot box) area, 
or in similar areas that will not result in marine mammal takes 
exceeding the amount indicated in Sec. 218.31(c).
    (B) Aircraft shall visually survey the target and buffer zone for 
marine mammals prior to and during the exercise. The survey of the 
impact area shall be made by flying at 1,500 ft (457 m) altitude or 
lower, if safe to do so, and at the slowest safe speed. Release of 
ordnance through cloud cover is prohibited; aircraft must be able to 
actually see ordnance impact areas.
    (C) A buffer zone of a 5,100-yard (4,663-m) radius shall be 
established around the intended target zone. The exercises shall be 
conducted only if the buffer zone is clear of marine mammals.
    (D) At-sea BOMBEXs using live ordnance shall occur during daylight 
hours only.
    (ii) Small Arms Training--Explosive hand grenades (such as the MK3A2 
grenades):
    (A) Lookouts shall visually survey for marine mammals prior to and 
during exercise.
    (B) A 200-yd (182-m) radius buffer zone shall be established around 
the intended target. The exercises shall be conducted only if the buffer 
zone is clear of marine mammals.
    (b) [Reserved]

Sec. 218.34  Requirements for monitoring and reporting.

    (a) The Holder of the Letter of Authorization issued pursuant to 
Sec. 216.106 of this chapter and Sec. 218.36 for activities described 
in Sec. 218.30(c) is required to cooperate with the NMFS when 
monitoring the impacts of the activity on marine mammals.
    (b) The Holder of the Authorization must notify NMFS immediately (or 
as soon as clearance procedures allow) if the specified activity 
identified in Sec. 218.30(c) is thought to have resulted in the 
mortality or serious injury of any marine mammals, or in any take of 
marine mammals not identified in Sec. 218.31(c).
    (c) The Navy must conduct all monitoring and required reporting 
under the Letter of Authorization, including abiding by the GOMEX Range 
Complex Monitoring Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference, and 
which requires the Navy to implement, at a minimum, the monitoring 
activities summarized below.
    (1) Vessel or aerial surveys.

[[Page 190]]

    (i) The Holder of this Authorization shall visually survey a minimum 
of 1 explosive event per year. One of the vessel or aerial surveys 
should involve professional trained marine mammal observers (MMOs). If 
it is impossible to conduct the required surveys due to lack of training 
exercises, the missed annual survey requirement shall roll into the 
subsequent year to ensure that the appropriate number of surveys (i.e., 
total of five) occurs over the 5-year period of effectiveness of this 
subject.
    (ii) When operationally feasible, for specified training events, 
aerial or vessel surveys shall be used 1-2 days prior to, during (if 
reasonably safe), and 1-5 days post detonation.
    (iii) Surveys shall include any specified exclusion zone around a 
particular detonation point plus 2,000 yards beyond the border of the 
exclusion zone (i.e., the circumference of the area from the border of 
the exclusion zone extending 2,000 yards outwards). For vessel-based 
surveys a passive acoustic system (hydrophone or towed array) could be 
used to determine if marine mammals are in the area before and/or after 
a detonation event.
    (iv) When conducting a particular survey, the survey team shall 
collect:
    (A) Location of sighting;
    (B) Species (if not possible, indicate whale, dolphin or pinniped);
    (C) Number of individuals;
    (D) Whether calves were observed;
    (E) Initial detection sensor;
    (F) Length of time observers maintained visual contact with marine 
mammal;
    (G) Wave height;
    (H) Visibility;
    (I) Whether sighting was before, during, or after detonations/
exercise, and how many minutes before or after;
    (J) Distance of marine mammal from actual detonations (or target 
spot if not yet detonated);
    (K) Observed behavior--Watchstanders shall report, in plain language 
and without trying to categorize in any way, the observed behavior of 
the animal(s) (such as animal closing to bow ride, paralleling course/
speed, floating on surface and not swimming etc.), including speed and 
direction;
    (L) Resulting mitigation implementation--Indicate whether explosive 
detonations were delayed, ceased, modified, or not modified due to 
marine mammal presence and for how long; and
    (M) If observation occurs while explosives are detonating in the 
water, indicate munitions type in use at time of marine mammal 
detection.
    (2) Passive acoustic monitoring--the Navy shall conduct passive 
acoustic monitoring when operationally feasible.
    (i) Any time a towed hydrophone array is employed during shipboard 
surveys the towed array shall be deployed during daylight hours for each 
of the days the ship is at sea.
    (ii) The towed hydrophone array shall be used to supplement the 
ship-based systematic line-transect surveys (particularly for species 
such as beaked whales that are rarely seen).
    (iii) The array should have the capability of detecting low 
frequency vocalizations (<1,000 Hz) for baleen whales and relatively 
high frequency (up to 30 kHz) for odontocetes. The use of two 
simultaneously deployed arrays can also allow more accurate localization 
and determination of diving patterns.
    (3) Marine mammal observers on Navy platforms:
    (i) As required in Sec. 218.34(c)(1), MMOs who are selected for 
aerial or vessel surveys shall, to the extent practicable, be placed on 
a Navy platform during the exercises being monitored.
    (ii) The MMO must possess expertise in species identification of 
regional marine mammal species and experience collecting behavioral 
data.
    (iii) MMOs shall not be placed aboard Navy platforms for every Navy 
training event or major exercise. Instead, MMOs should be employed 
during specifically identified opportunities deemed appropriate for data 
collection efforts. The events selected for MMO participation shall take 
into account safety, logistics, and operational concerns.
    (iv) MMOs shall observe from the same height above water as the 
lookouts.

[[Page 191]]

    (v) The MMOs shall not be part of the Navy's formal reporting chain 
of command during their data collection efforts; Navy lookouts shall 
continue to serve as the primary reporting means within the Navy chain 
of command for marine mammal sightings. The only exception is that if an 
animal is observed within the shutdown zone that has not been observed 
by the lookout, the MMO shall inform the lookout of the sighting and the 
lookout shall take the appropriate action through the chain of command.
    (vi) The MMOs shall collect species identification, behavior, 
direction of travel relative to the Navy platform, and distance first 
observed. Information collected by MMOs should be the same as those 
collected by the survey team described in Sec. 218.34(c)(1)(iv).
    (d) General Notification of Injured or Dead Marine Mammals--Navy 
personnel shall ensure that NMFS (regional stranding coordinator) is 
notified immediately (or as soon as clearance procedures allow) if an 
injured or dead marine mammal is found during or shortly after, and in 
the vicinity of, any Navy training exercise utilizing underwater 
explosive detonations. The Navy shall provide NMFS with species or 
description of the animal(s), the condition of the animal(s) (including 
carcass condition if the animal is dead), location, time of first 
discovery, observed behaviors (if alive), and photo or video (if 
available).
    (e) Annual GOMEX Range Complex Monitoring Plan Report--The Navy 
shall submit a report annually on March 1 describing the implementation 
and results (through January 1 of the same year) of the GOMEX Range 
Complex Monitoring Plan. Data collection methods shall be standardized 
across range complexes to allow for comparison in different geographic 
locations. Although additional information will also be gathered, the 
MMOs collecting marine mammal data pursuant to the GOMEX Range Complex 
Monitoring Plan shall, at a minimum, provide the same marine mammal 
observation data required in Sec. 218.34(c)(1)(iv). The GOMEX Range 
Complex Monitoring Plan Report may be provided to NMFS within a larger 
report that includes the required Monitoring Plan Reports from GOMEX 
Range Complex and multiple range complexes.
    (f) Annual GOMEX Range Complex Exercise Report--The Navy shall 
provide the information described below for all of their explosive 
exercises. Until the Navy is able to report in full the information 
below, they shall provide an annual update on the Navy's explosive 
tracking methods, including improvements from the previous year.
    (1) Total annual number of each type of explosive exercise (of those 
identified as part of the ``specified activity'' in this final rule) 
conducted in the GOMEX Range Complex.
    (2) Total annual expended/detonated rounds (missiles, bombs, etc.) 
for each explosive type.
    (g) GOMEX Range Complex 5-yr Comprehensive Report--The Navy shall 
submit to NMFS a draft report that analyzes and summarizes all of the 
multi-year marine mammal information gathered during the GOMEX Range 
Complex exercises for which annual reports are required (Annual GOMEX 
Range Complex Exercise Reports and GOMEX Range Complex Monitoring Plan 
Reports). This report shall be submitted at the end of the fourth year 
of the rule (February 2015), covering activities that have occurred 
through August 1, 2014.
    (h) The Navy shall respond to NMFS comments and requests for 
additional information or clarification on the GOMEX Range Complex 
Comprehensive Report, the Annual GOMEX Range Complex Exercise Report, or 
the Annual GOMEX Range Complex Monitoring Plan Report (or the multi-
Range Complex Annual Monitoring Plan Report, if that is how the Navy 
chooses to submit the information) if submitted within 3 months of 
receipt. These reports will be considered final after the Navy has 
addressed NMFS' comments or provided the requested information, or three 
months after the submittal of the draft if NMFS does not comment by 
then.
    (i) In 2011, the Navy shall convene a Monitoring Workshop in which 
the Monitoring Workshop participants will be asked to review the Navy's 
Monitoring Plans and monitoring results and make individual 
recommendations

[[Page 192]]

(to the Navy and NMFS) of ways of improving the Monitoring Plans. The 
recommendations shall be reviewed by the Navy, in consultation with 
NMFS, and modifications to the Monitoring Plan shall be made, as 
appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 218.104  Mitigation.

    (a) When conducting training and utilizing the sound sources or 
explosives identified in Sec. 218.100(c), the mitigation measures 
contained in a Letter of Authorization issued under Sec. Sec. 216.106 
and 218.107 of this chapter must be implemented. These mitigation 
measures include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Personnel Training:
    (i) All commanding officers (COs), executive officers (XOs), 
lookouts, Officers of the Deck (OODs), junior OODs (JOODs), maritime 
patrol aircraft aircrews, and Anti-submarine Warfare (ASW)/Mine Warfare 
(MIW) helicopter crews shall complete the NMFS-approved Marine Species 
Awareness Training (MSAT) by viewing the U.S. Navy MSAT digital 
versatile disk (DVD). All bridge lookouts shall complete both parts one 
and two of the MSAT; part two is optional for other personnel.
    (ii) Navy lookouts shall undertake extensive training in order to 
qualify as a watchstander in accordance with the Lookout Training 
Handbook (Naval Education and Training Command [NAVEDTRA] 12968-D).
    (iii) Lookout training shall include on-the-job instruction under 
the supervision of a qualified, experienced lookout. Following 
successful completion of this supervised training period, lookouts shall 
complete the Personal Qualification Standard Program, certifying that 
they have demonstrated the necessary skills (such as detection and 
reporting of partially submerged objects). Personnel being trained as 
lookouts can be counted among required lookouts as long as supervisors 
monitor their progress and performance.
    (iv) Lookouts shall be trained in the most effective means to ensure 
quick and effective communication within the command structure in order 
to facilitate implementation of protective measures if marine species 
are spotted.
    (v) All lookouts onboard platforms involved in ASW training events 
will review the NMFS-approved Marine Species Awareness Training material 
prior to use of MFAS.
    (vi) All COs, XOs, and officers standing watch on the bridge will 
review the Marine Species Awareness Training material prior to a 
training event employing the use of MFAS/HFAS.
    (2) General Operating Procedures (for all training types):
    (i) Prior to major exercises, a Letter of Instruction, Mitigation 
Measures Message or Environmental Annex to the Operational Order shall 
be issued to further disseminate the personnel training requirement and 
general marine species protective measures.
    (ii) COs shall make use of marine species detection cues and 
information to limit interaction with marine mammals to the maximum 
extent possible consistent with safety of the ship.
    (iii) While underway, surface vessels shall have at least two 
lookouts with binoculars; surfaced submarines shall have at least one 
lookout with binoculars. Lookouts already posted for safety of 
navigation and man-overboard precautions may be used to fill this 
requirement. As part of their regular duties, lookouts will watch for 
and report to the OOD the presence of marine mammals.
    (iv) On surface vessels equipped with a multi-function active 
sensor, pedestal mounted ``Big Eye'' (20x110) binoculars shall be 
properly installed and in good working order to assist in the detection 
of marine mammals in the vicinity of the vessel.
    (v) Personnel on lookout shall employ visual search procedures 
employing a scanning methodology in accordance with the Lookout Training 
Handbook (NAVEDTRA 12968-D).
    (vi) After sunset and prior to sunrise, lookouts shall employ Night 
Lookouts Techniques in accordance with the Lookout Training Handbook 
(NAVEDTRA 12968-D).
    (vii) While in transit, naval vessels shall be alert at all times, 
use extreme caution, and proceed at a ``safe speed'', which means the 
speed at which the CO

[[Page 197]]

can maintain crew safety and effectiveness of current operational 
directives, so that the vessel can take action to avoid a collision with 
any marine mammal.
    (viii) When marine mammals have been sighted in the area, Navy 
vessels shall increase vigilance and take all reasonable actions to 
avoid collisions and close interaction of naval assets and marine 
mammals. Such action may include changing speed and/or direction and are 
dictated by environmental and other conditions (e.g., safety, weather).
    (ix) Navy aircraft participating in exercises at-sea shall conduct 
and maintain surveillance for marine mammals as long as it does not 
violate safety constraints or interfere with the accomplishment of 
primary operational duties.
    (x) All marine mammal detections shall be immediately reported to 
assigned Aircraft Control Unit for further dissemination to ships in the 
vicinity of the marine species as appropriate when it is reasonable to 
conclude that the course of the ship will likely result in a closing of 
the distance to the detected marine mammal.
    (xi) Naval vessels will maneuver to keep at least 1,500 ft (500 yds) 
away from any observed whale in the vessel's path and avoid approaching 
whales head-on. These requirements do not apply if a vessel's safety is 
threatened, such as when change of course will create an imminent and 
serious threat to a person, vessel, or aircraft, and to the extent 
vessels are restricted in their ability to maneuver. Restricted 
maneuverability includes, but is not limited to, situations when vessels 
are engaged in dredging, submerged activities, launching and recovering 
aircraft or landing craft, minesweeping activities, replenishment while 
underway and towing activities that severely restrict a vessel's ability 
to deviate course. Vessels will take reasonable steps to alert other 
vessels in the vicinity of the whale. Given rapid swimming speeds and 
maneuverability of many dolphin species, naval vessels would maintain 
normal course and speed on sighting dolphins unless some condition 
indicated a need for the vessel to maneuver.
    (3) Operating Procedures (for Anti-submarine Warfare (ASW) 
Operations):
    (i) On the bridge of surface ships, there shall always be at least 
three people on watch whose duties include observing the water surface 
around the vessel.
    (ii) All surface ships participating in ASW training events shall 
have, in addition to the three personnel on watch noted in (i), at least 
two additional personnel on watch as lookouts at all times during the 
exercise.
    (iii) Personnel on lookout and officers on watch on the bridge will 
have at least one set of binoculars available for each person to aid in 
the detection of marine mammals.
    (iv) Personnel on lookout shall be responsible for reporting all 
objects or anomalies sighted in the water (regardless of the distance 
from the vessel) to the Officer of the Deck, since any object or 
disturbance (e.g., trash, periscope, surface disturbance, discoloration) 
in the water may be indicative of a threat to the vessel and its crew or 
indicative of a marine mammal that may need to be avoided.
    (v) All personnel engaged in passive acoustic sonar operation 
(including aircraft, surface ships, or submarines) shall monitor for 
marine mammal vocalizations and report the detection of any marine 
mammal to the appropriate watch station for dissemination and 
appropriate action.
    (vi) During MFAS operations, personnel shall utilize all available 
sensor and optical systems (such as night vision goggles) to aid in the 
detection of marine mammals.
    (vii) Aircraft with deployed sonobuoys shall use only the passive 
capability of sonobuoys when marine mammals are detected within 200 yds 
(183 m) of the sonobuoy.
    (viii) Helicopters shall observe/survey the vicinity of an ASW 
exercise for 10 minutes before the first deployment of active (dipping) 
sonar in the water.
    (ix) Helicopters shall not dip their sonar within 200 yards of a 
marine mammal and shall cease pinging if a marine mammal closes within 
200 yards after pinging has begun.
    (x)(A) Safety Zones--When marine mammals are detected by any means

[[Page 198]]

(aircraft, shipboard lookout, or acoustically) the Navy shall ensure 
that sonar transmission levels are limited to at least 6 dB below normal 
operating levels if any detected marine mammals are within 1000 yards 
(914 m) of the sonar dome (the bow) (i.e., limit to at most 229 dB for 
AN/SQS-53 and 219 dB for AN/SQS-56, etc.). Ships and submarines shall 
continue to limit maximum transmission levels by this 6-dB factor until 
the animal has been seen to leave the 1000-yd safety zone, has not been 
detected for 30 minutes, or the vessel has transited more than 2,000 yds 
(1829 m) beyond the location of the last detection.
    (B) When marine mammals are detected by any means (aircraft, 
shipboard lookout, or acoustically) the Navy shall ensure that sonar 
transmission levels are limited to at least 10 dB below normal operating 
levels if any detected marine mammals are within 500 yards (457 m) of 
the sonar dome (the bow). Ships and submarines shall continue to limit 
maximum ping levels by this 10-dB factor until the animal has been seen 
to leave the 500-yd safety zone, has not been detected for 30 minutes, 
or the vessel has transited more than 2,000 yds (1829 m) beyond the 
location of the last detection.
    (C) When marine mammals are detected by any means (aircraft, 
shipboard lookout, or acoustically) the Navy shall ensure that sonar 
transmission ceases if any detected marine mammals are within 200 yards 
(183 m) of the sonar dome (the bow). Sonar shall not resume until the 
animal has been seen to leave the 200-yd safety zone, has not been 
detected for 30 minutes, or the vessel has transited more than 2,000 yds 
(457 m) beyond the location of the last detection.
    (D) Special conditions applicable for dolphins and porpoises only: 
If, after conducting an initial maneuver to avoid close quarters with 
dolphins or porpoises, the OOD concludes that dolphins or porpoises are 
deliberately closing to ride the vessel's bow wave, no further 
mitigation actions are necessary while the dolphins or porpoises 
continue to exhibit bow wave riding behavior.
    (xi) Prior to start up or restart of active sonar, operators will 
check that the 1000-m Safety Zone radius around the sound source is 
clear of marine mammals.
    (xii) Active sonar levels (generally)--Navy shall operate active 
sonar at the lowest practicable level, not to exceed 235 dB, except as 
required to meet tactical training objectives.
    (xiii) Submarine sonar operators will review detection indicators of 
close-aboard marine mammals prior to the commencement of ASW training 
events involving MFAS.
    (E) If the need for power-down should arise (as detailed in 
218.114(a)(3)(x)) when the Navy is operating a hull-mounted or sub-
mounted source above 235 dB (infrequent), the Navy shall follow the 
requirements as though they were operating at 235 dB--the normal 
operating level (i.e., the first power-down will be to 229 dB, 
regardless of at what level above 235 dB active sonar was being 
operated).
    (4) Operating Procedures for Underwater Detonations (up to 10-lb 
charges):
    (i) Exclusion Zones--All demolitions and ship mine countermeasures 
training exercises involving the use of explosive charges must include 
exclusion zones for marine mammals to prevent physical and/or acoustic 
effects to those species. These exclusion zones shall extend in a 700-
yard arc radius around the detonation site. Should a marine mammal be 
present within the surveillance area, the explosive event shall not be 
started until the animal leaves the area.
    (ii) Pre-Exercise Surveys--For Demolition and Ship Mine 
Countermeasures Operations, pre-exercise surveys shall be conducted for 
30 minutes prior to the commencement of the scheduled explosive event. 
The survey may be conducted from the surface, by divers, and/or from the 
air, and personnel shall be alert to the presence of any marine mammal. 
Should such an animal be present within the survey area, the explosive 
event shall not be started until the animal voluntarily leaves the area. 
The Navy will ensure the area is clear of marine mammals for a full 30 
minutes prior to initiating the explosive

[[Page 199]]

event. Personnel will record any marine mammal observations during the 
exercise as well as measures taken if species are detected within the 
exclusion zone.
    (iii) Post-Exercise Surveys--Surveys within the same exclusion zone 
radius shall also be conducted within 30 minutes after the completion of 
the explosive event.
    (iv) Reporting--If there is evidence that a marine mammal may have 
been stranded, injured or killed by the action, Navy training activities 
shall be immediately suspended and the situation immediately reported by 
the participating unit to the Officer in Charge of the Exercise (OCE), 
who will follow Navy procedures for reporting the incident to Commander, 
Pacific Fleet, Commander, Navy Region Marianas, Environmental Director, 
and the chain-of-command. The situation shall also be reported to NMFS 
(see Stranding Plan for details).
    (5) Sinking Exercise:
    (i) All weapons firing shall be conducted during the period 1 hour 
after official sunrise to 30 minutes before official sunset.
    (ii) An exclusion zone with a radius of 1.0 nm (1.9 km) will be 
established around each target. An additional buffer of 0.5 nm (0.9 km) 
will be added to account for errors, target drift, and animal movements. 
Additionally, a safety zone, which will extend beyond the buffer zone by 
an additional 0.5 nm (0.9 km), shall be surveyed. Together, the zone 
extends out 2 nm (3.7 km) from the target.
    (iii) A series of surveillance over-flights shall be conducted 
within the 2-nm zone around the target, prior to and during the 
exercise, when feasible. Survey protocol shall be as follows:
    (A) Overflights within the 2-nm zone around the target shall be 
conducted in a manner that optimizes the surface area of the water 
observed. This may be accomplished through the use of the Navy's Search 
and Rescue Tactical Aid, which provides the best search altitude, ground 
speed, and track spacing for the discovery of small, possibly dark 
objects in the water based on the environmental conditions of the day. 
These environmental conditions include the angle of sun inclination, 
amount of daylight, cloud cover, visibility, and sea state.
    (B) All visual surveillance activities shall be conducted by Navy 
personnel trained in visual surveillance. At least one member of the 
mitigation team will have completed the Navy's marine mammal training 
program for lookouts.
    (C) In addition to the overflights, the 2-nm zone around the target 
shall be monitored by passive acoustic means, when assets are available. 
This passive acoustic monitoring would be maintained throughout the 
exercise. Additionally, passive sonar onboard submarines may be utilized 
to detect any vocalizing marine mammals in the area. The OCE will be 
informed of any aural detection of marine mammals and will include this 
information in the determination of when it is safe to commence the 
exercise.
    (D) On each day of the exercise, aerial surveillance of the 2-nm 
zone around the target shall commence 2 hours prior to the first firing.
    (E) The results of all visual, aerial, and acoustic searches shall 
be reported immediately to the OCE. No weapons launches or firing may 
commence until the OCE declares this 2-nm zone around the target is free 
of marine mammals.
    (F) If a marine mammal is observed within the 2-nm zone around the 
target, firing will be delayed until the animal is re-sighted outside 
the 2-nm zone around the target, or 30 minutes have elapsed. After 30 
minutes, if the animal has not been re-sighted it can be assumed to have 
left the 2-nm zone around the target. The OCE will determine if the 
marine mammal is in danger of being adversely affected by commencement 
of the exercise.
    (G) During breaks in the exercise of 30 minutes or more, the 2-nm 
zone around the target shall again be surveyed for any marine mammal. If 
marine mammals are sighted within the 2-nm zone around the target, the 
OCE shall be notified, and the procedures described in this section 
shall be followed.
    (H) Upon sinking of the vessel, a final surveillance of the 2-nm 
zone around the target shall be monitored for 2 hours, or until sunset, 
to verify that no marine mammals were harmed.

[[Page 200]]

    (iv) Aerial surveillance shall be conducted using helicopters or 
other aircraft based on necessity and availability. The Navy has several 
types of aircraft capable of performing this task; however, not all 
types are available for every exercise. For each exercise, the available 
asset best suited for identifying objects on and near the surface of the 
ocean shall be used. These aircraft shall be capable of flying at the 
slow safe speeds necessary to enable viewing of marine vertebrates with 
unobstructed, or minimally obstructed, downward and outward visibility. 
The exclusion and safety zone surveys may be cancelled in the event that 
a mechanical problem, emergency search and rescue, or other similar and 
unexpected event preempts the use of one of the aircraft onsite for the 
exercise.
    (v) Every attempt shall be made to conduct the exercise in sea 
states that are ideal for marine mammal sighting, Beaufort Sea State 3 
or less. In the event of a 4 or above, survey efforts shall be increased 
within the 2-nm zone around the target. This shall be accomplished 
through the use of an additional aircraft, if available, and conducting 
tight search patterns.
    (vi) The exercise shall not be conducted unless the 2-nm zone around 
the target could be adequately monitored visually. Should low cloud 
cover or surface visibility prevent adequate visual monitoring as 
described previously, the exercise would be delayed until conditions 
improved, and all of the above monitoring criteria could be met.
    (vii) In the event that any marine mammals are observed to be harmed 
in the area, a detailed description of the animal shall be taken, the 
location noted, and if possible, photos taken of the marine mammal. This 
information shall be provided to NMFS via the Navy's regional 
environmental coordinator for purposes of identification (see the 
Stranding Plan for detail).
    (viii) An after action report detailing the exercise's time line, 
the time the surveys commenced and terminated, amount, and types of all 
ordnance expended, and the results of survey efforts for each event 
shall be submitted to NMFS.
    (6) Surface-to-Surface Gunnery (up to 5-inch Explosive Rounds):
    (i) For exercises using targets towed by a vessel, target-towing 
vessels shall maintain a trained lookout for marine mammals when 
feasible. If a marine mammal is sighted in the vicinity, the tow vessel 
will immediately notify the firing vessel, which will suspend the 
exercise until the area is clear.
    (ii) A 600 yard (585 m) radius buffer zone will be established 
around the intended target.
    (iii) From the intended firing position, trained lookouts will 
survey the buffer zone for marine mammals prior to commencement and 
during the exercise as long as practicable. Due to the distance between 
the firing position and the buffer zone, lookouts are only expected to 
visually detect breaching whales, whale blows, and large pods of 
dolphins and porpoises.
    (iv) The exercise will be conducted only when the buffer zone is 
visible and marine mammals are not detected within it.
    (7) Surface-to-Surface Gunnery (non-explosive rounds):
    (i) A 200-yd (183 m) radius buffer zone shall be established around 
the intended target.
    (ii) From the intended firing position, trained lookouts shall 
survey the buffer zone for marine mammals prior to commencement and 
during the exercise as long as practicable.
    (iii) If available, target towing vessels shall maintain a lookout 
(unmanned towing vessels will not have a lookout available). If a marine 
mammal is sighted in the vicinity of the exercise, the tow vessel shall 
immediately notify the firing vessel in order to secure gunnery firing 
until the area is clear.
    (iv) The exercise shall be conducted only when the buffer zone is 
visible and marine mammals are not detected within the target area and 
the buffer zone.
    (8) Surface-to-Air Gunnery (Explosive and Non-explosive Rounds):
    (i) Vessels will orient the geometry of gunnery exercises in order 
to prevent debris from falling in the area of sighted marine mammals.
    (ii) Vessels will attempt to recover any parachute deploying aerial 
targets

[[Page 201]]

to the extent practicable (and their parachutes if feasible) to reduce 
the potential for entanglement of marine mammals.
    (iii) Target towing aircraft shall maintain a lookout if feasible. 
If a marine mammal is sighted in the vicinity of the exercise, the tow 
aircraft will immediately notify the firing vessel in order to secure 
gunnery firing until the area is clear.
    (9) Air-to-Surface Gunnery (Explosive and Non-explosive Rounds):
    (i) A 200 yard (183 m) radius buffer zone will be established around 
the intended target.
    (ii) If surface vessels are involved, lookout(s) will visually 
survey the buffer zone for marine mammals to and during the exercise.
    (iii) Aerial surveillance of the buffer zone for marine mammals will 
be conducted prior to commencement of the exercise. Aerial surveillance 
altitude of 500 feet to 1,500 feet (152-456 m) is optimum. Aircraft 
crew/pilot will maintain visual watch during exercises. Release of 
ordnance through cloud cover is prohibited; aircraft must be able to 
actually see ordnance impact areas.
    (iv) The exercise will be conducted only if marine mammals are not 
visible within the buffer zone.
    (10) Small Arms Training (Grenades, Explosive and Non-explosive 
Rounds)--Lookouts will visually survey for marine mammals. Weapons will 
not be fired in the direction of known or observed marine mammals.
    (11) Air-to-Surface At-sea Bombing Exercises (explosive bombs and 
rockets):
    (i) If surface vessels are involved, trained lookouts shall survey 
for marine mammals. Ordnance shall not be targeted to impact within 
1,000 yds (914 m) of known or observed marine mammals.
    (ii) A 1,000 yd (914 m) radius buffer zone shall be established 
around the intended target.
    (iii) Aircraft shall visually survey the target and buffer zone for 
marine mammals prior to and during the exercise. The survey of the 
impact area shall be made by flying at 1,500 ft (152 m) or lower, if 
safe to do so, and at the slowest safe speed. When safety or other 
considerations require the release of weapons without the releasing 
pilot having visual sight of the target area, a second aircraft, the 
``wingman,'' will clear the target area and perform the clearance and 
observation functions required before the dropping plane may release its 
weapons. Both planes must have direct communication to assure immediate 
notification to the dropping plane that the target area may have been 
fouled by encroaching animals or people. The clearing aircraft will 
assure it has visual site of the target area at a maximum height of 1500 
ft. The clearing plane will remain within visual sight of the target 
until required to clear the area for safety reasons. Survey aircraft 
shall employ most effective search tactics and capabilities.
    (iv) The exercise will be conducted only if marine mammals are not 
visible within the buffer zone.
    (12) Air-to-Surface At-Sea Bombing Exercises (Non-explosive Bombs 
and Rockets):
    (i) If surface vessels are involved, trained lookouts will survey 
for marine mammals. Ordnance shall not be targeted to impact within 
1,000 yards (914 m) of known or observed or marine mammals.
    (ii) A 1,000 yard (914 m) radius buffer zone will be established 
around the intended target.
    (iii) Aircraft will visually survey the target and buffer zone for 
marine mammals prior to and during the exercise. The survey of the 
impact area will be made by flying at 1,500 feet (456 m) or lower, if 
safe to do so, and at the slowest safe speed. When safety or other 
considerations require the release of weapons without the releasing 
pilot having visual sight of the target area, a second aircraft, the 
``wingman,'' will clear the target area and perform the clearance and 
observation functions required before the dropping plane may release its 
weapons. Both planes must have direct communication to assure immediate 
notification to the dropping plane that the target area may have been 
fouled by encroaching animals or people. The clearing aircraft will 
assure it has visual site of the target area at a maximum height of 1500 
ft. The clearing plane will remain within visual sight of the target 
until required to clear the area for safety reasons.

[[Page 202]]

Survey aircraft shall employ most effective search tactics and 
capabilities.
    (iv) The exercise will be conducted only if marine mammals and are 
not visible within the buffer zone.
    (13) Air-to-Surface Missile Exercises (explosive and non-explosive):
    (i) Aircraft will visually survey the target area for marine 
mammals. Visual inspection of the target area will be made by flying at 
1,500 (457 m) feet or lower, if safe to do so, and at slowest safe 
speed. Firing or range clearance aircraft must be able to actually see 
ordnance impact areas.
    (ii) Explosive ordnance shall not be targeted to impact within 1,800 
yds (1646 m) of sighted marine mammals.
    (14) Aircraft Training Activities Involving Non-Explosive Devices:
    An exclusion zone of 200 yds around the target location, therefore, 
shall be clear of marine mammals. Pre- and post-surveillance and 
reporting requirements outlined for underwater detonations shall be 
implemented during Mining Training Activities.
    (15) Extended Echo Ranging/Improved Extended Echo Ranging and 
Advanced Extended Echo-ranging (EER/IEER/AEER)--The following mitigation 
measures shall be used with the employment of IEER/AEER sonobuoys:
    (i) Crews shall conduct visual reconnaissance of the drop area prior 
to laying their intended sonobuoy pattern. This search shall be 
conducted at an altitude below 500 yd (457 m) at a slow speed, if 
operationally feasible and weather conditions permit. In dual aircraft 
operations, crews are allowed to conduct coordinated area clearances.
    (ii) For IEER (AN/SSQ-110A), crews shall conduct a minimum of 30 
minutes of visual and aural monitoring of the search area prior to 
commanding the first post detonation. This 30-minute observation period 
may include pattern deployment time.
    (iii) For any part of the intended sonobuoy pattern where a post 
(source/receiver sonobuoy pair) will be deployed within 1,000 yd (914 m) 
of observed marine mammal activity, the Navy shall deploy the receiver 
ONLY (i.e., not the source) and monitor while conducting a visual 
search. When marine mammals are no longer detected within 1,000 yd (914 
m) of the intended post position, the source sonobuoy (AN/SSQ-110A/SSQ-
125) will be co-located with the receiver.
    (iv) When operationally feasible, Navy crews shall conduct 
continuous visual and aural monitoring of marine mammal activity. This 
shall include monitoring of own-aircraft sensors from the time of the 
first sensor placement until the aircraft have left the area and are out 
of RF range of these sensors.
    (v) Aural Detection. If the presence of marine mammals is detected 
aurally, then that shall cue the Navy aircrew to increase the diligence 
of their visual surveillance. Subsequently, if no marine mammals are 
visually detected, then the crew may continue multi-static active 
search.
    (vi) Visual Detection. If marine mammals are visually detected 
within 1,000 yd (914 m) of the explosive source sonobuoy (AN/SSQ-110A/
SSQ-125) intended for use, then that payload shall not be activated. 
Aircrews may utilize this post once the marine mammals have not been re-
sighted for 30 minutes, or are observed to have moved outside the 1,000 
yd (914 m) safety buffer. Aircrews may shift their multi-static active 
search to another post, where marine mammals are outside the 1,000 yd 
(914 m) safety buffer.
    (vii) For IEER (AN/SSQ-110A), aircrews shall make every attempt to 
manually detonate the unexploded charges at each post in the pattern 
prior to departing the operations area by using the ``Payload 1 
Release'' command followed by the ``Payload 2 Release'' command. 
Aircrews shall refrain from using the ``Scuttle'' command when two 
payloads remain at a given post. Aircrews shall ensure that a 1,000 yd 
(914 m) safety buffer, visually clear of marine mammals, is maintained 
around each post as is done during active search operations.
    (viii) Aircrews shall only leave posts with unexploded charges in 
the event of a sonobuoy malfunction, an aircraft system malfunction, or 
when an aircraft must immediately depart the area due to issues such as 
fuel constraints, inclement weather, and in-flight emergencies. In these 
cases, the sonobuoy will self-scuttle using the secondary or tertiary 
method.

[[Page 203]]

    (ix) The Navy shall ensure all payloads are accounted for. Explosive 
source sonobuoys (AN/SSQ-110A) that cannot be scuttled shall be reported 
as unexploded ordnance via voice communications while airborne, then 
upon landing via naval message.
    (x) Marine mammal monitoring shall continue until out of own-
aircraft sensor range.
    (16) The Navy shall implement the ``Stranding Response Plan for 
Major Navy Training Exercises in the MIRC'' (available at: http://
www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/permits/incidental.htm), which is incorporated 
herein by reference, including the following measures:
    (i) Shutdown Procedures. When an Uncommon Stranding Event (USE--
defined in Sec. 216.271) occurs during a Major Training Exercise (MTE) 
(as defined in the Stranding Plan, meaning including Multi-strike group 
exercises, Joint Expeditionary exercises, and Marine Air Ground Task 
Force exercises in the MIRC), the Navy shall implement the procedures 
described in this section.
    (A) The Navy shall implement a Shutdown (as defined in the Stranding 
Response Plan for MIRC) when advised by a NMFS Office of Protected 
Resources Headquarters Senior Official designated in the MIRC Stranding 
Communication Protocol that a USE (as defined in the Stranding Response 
Plan for MIRC) involving live animals has been identified and that at 
least one live animal is located in the water. NMFS and Navy shall 
communicate, as needed, regarding the identification of the USE and the 
potential need to implement shutdown procedures.
    (B) Any shutdown in a given area shall remain in effect in that area 
until NMFS advises the Navy that the subject(s) of the USE at that area 
die or are euthanized, or that all live animals involved in the USE at 
that area have left the area (either of their own volition or herded).
    (C) If the Navy finds an injured or dead marine mammal floating at 
sea during an MTE, the Navy shall notify NMFS immediately or as soon as 
operational security considerations allow. The Navy shall provide NMFS 
with species or description of the animal(s), the condition of the 
animal(s) including carcass condition if the animal(s) is/are dead, 
location, time of first discovery, observed behaviors (if alive), and 
photo or video of the animals (if available). Based on the information 
provided, NMFS shall determine if, and advise the Navy whether, a 
modified shutdown is appropriate on a case-by-case basis.
    (D) In the event, following a USE, that: (a) Qualified individuals 
are attempting to herd animals back out to the open ocean and animals 
are not willing to leave, or (b) animals are seen repeatedly heading for 
the open ocean but turning back to shore, NMFS and the Navy shall 
coordinate (including an investigation of other potential anthropogenic 
stressors in the area) to determine if the proximity of MFAS/HFAS 
activities or explosive detonations, though farther than 14 nm from the 
distressed animal(s), is likely decreasing the likelihood that the 
animals return to the open water. If so, NMFS and the Navy shall further 
coordinate to determine what measures are necessary to further minimize 
that likelihood and implement those measures as appropriate.
    (ii) Within 72 hours of NMFS notifying the Navy of the presence of a 
USE, the Navy shall provide available information to NMFS (per the MIRC 
Communication Protocol) regarding the location, number and types of 
acoustic/explosive sources, direction and speed of units using MFAS/
HFAS, and marine mammal sightings information associated with training 
activities occurring within 80 nm (148 km) and 72 hours prior to the USE 
event. Information not initially available regarding the 80 nm (148 km), 
72 hours, period prior to the event shall be provided as soon as it 
becomes available. The Navy shall provide NMFS investigative teams with 
additional relevant unclassified information as requested, if available.
    (b) [Reserved]

any Navy training exercise utilizing MFAS, HFAS, or underwater explosive 
detonations. The Navy will provide NMFS with the name of species or 
description of the animal(s), the condition of the animal(s) (including 
carcass condition if the animal is dead), location, time of first 
discovery, observed behaviors (if alive), and photo or video of the 
animal(s) (if available). In the event that an injured, stranded, or 
dead marine mammal is found by the Navy that is not in the vicinity of, 
or during or shortly after, MFAS, HFAS, or underwater explosive 
detonations, the Navy will report the same information as listed above 
as soon as operationally feasible and clearance procedures allow.
    (b) General Notification of Ship Strike. In the event of a ship 
strike by any Navy vessel, at any time or place, the Navy shall do the 
following:
    (1) Immediately report to NMFS the species identification (if 
known), location (lat/long) of the animal (or the strike if the animal 
has disappeared), and whether the animal is alive or dead, or whether

Sec. 218.109  Modifications to Letters of Authorization.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no 
substantive modification (including withdrawal or suspension) to the 
Letter of Authorization by NMFS, issued pursuant to Sec. Sec. 216.106 
and 218.107 of this chapter and

[[Page 208]]

subject to the provisions of this subpart, shall be made until after 
notification and an opportunity for public comment has been provided. 
For purposes of this paragraph, a renewal of a Letter of Authorization

validity) is not considered a substantive modification.
    (b) If the Assistant Administrator determines that an emergency 
exists that poses a significant risk to the well-being of the species or 
stocks of marine mammals specified in Sec. 218.100(b), a Letter of 
Authorization issued pursuant to Sec. Sec. 216.106 and 218.107 of this 
chapter may be substantively modified without prior notification and an 
opportunity for public comment. Notification will be published in the 
Federal Register within 30 days subsequent to the action.

at that time, Sec. 218.112 was added with two paragraphs (a)(4)(ii).


<R05>
Sec. 218.113  Prohibitions.

    No person in connection with the activities described in Sec. 
218.110 may:
    (a) Take any marine mammal not specified in Sec. 218.112(c);
    (b) Take any marine mammal specified in Sec. 218.112(c) other than 
by incidental take as specified in Sec. Sec. 218.112(c)(1) and (c)(2);
    (c) Take a marine mammal specified in Sec. 218.112(c) if such 
taking results in more than a negligible impact on the species or stocks 
of such marine mammal; or
    (d) Violate, or fail to comply with, the terms, conditions, and 
requirements of these regulations or a Letter of Authorization issued 
under Sec. Sec. 216.106 and 218.117 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 218.114  Mitigation.

    (a) When conducting training and utilizing the sound sources or 
explosives identified in Sec. 218.110(c), the mitigation measures 
contained in the Letter of Authorization issued under Sec. Sec. 216.106 
and 218.117 of this chapter must be implemented. These mitigation 
measures include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Navy's General Maritime Measures for All Training at Sea:
    (i) Personnel Training (for all Training Types):
    (A) All commanding officers (COs), executive officers (XOs), 
lookouts, Officers of the Deck (OODs), junior OODs (JOODs), maritime 
patrol aircraft aircrews, and Anti-submarine Warfare (ASW)/Mine Warfare 
(MIW) helicopter crews shall complete the NMFS-approved Marine Species 
Awareness Training (MSAT) by viewing the U.S. Navy MSAT digital 
versatile disk (DVD). All bridge lookouts shall complete both parts one 
and two of the MSAT; part two is optional for other personnel.

[[Page 211]]

    (B) Navy lookouts shall undertake extensive training in order to 
qualify as a watchstander in accordance with the Lookout Training 
Handbook (Naval Education and Training Command [NAVEDTRA] 12968-D) 
available at https://portal.navfac.navy.mil/go/navytraining-env-docs.
    (C) Lookout training shall include on-the-job instruction under the 
supervision of a qualified, experienced lookout. Following successful 
completion of this supervised training period, lookouts shall complete 
the Personal Qualification Standard Program, certifying that they have 
demonstrated the necessary skills (such as detection and reporting of 
partially submerged objects). Personnel being trained as lookouts can be 
counted among required lookouts as long as supervisors monitor their 
progress and performance.
    (D) Lookouts shall be trained in the most effective means to ensure 
quick and effective communication within the command structure in order 
to facilitate implementation of protective measures if marine species 
are spotted.
    (ii) Operating Procedures and Collision Avoidance:
    (A) Prior to major exercises, a Letter of Instruction, Mitigation 
Measures Message or Environmental Annex to the Operational Order shall 
be issued to further disseminate the personnel training requirement and 
general marine species protective measures.
    (B) COs shall make use of marine species detection cues and 
information to limit interaction with marine species to the maximum 
extent possible consistent with safety of the ship.
    (C) While underway, surface vessels shall have at least two lookouts 
with binoculars; surfaced submarines shall have at least one lookout 
with binoculars. Lookouts already posted for safety of navigation and 
man-overboard precautions may be used to fill this requirement. As part 
of their regular duties, lookouts will watch for and report to the OOD 
the presence of marine mammals.
    (D) On surface vessels equipped with a multi-function active sensor, 
pedestal mounted ``Big Eye'' (20x110) binoculars shall be properly 
installed and in good working order to assist in the detection of marine 
mammals in the vicinity of the vessel.
    (E) Personnel on lookout shall employ visual search procedures 
employing a scanning methodology in accordance with the Lookout Training 
Handbook (NAVEDTRA 12968-D).
    (F) After sunset and prior to sunrise, lookouts shall employ Night 
Lookouts Techniques in accordance with the Lookout Training Handbook. 
(NAVEDTRA 12968-D).
    (G) While in transit, naval vessels shall be alert at all times, use 
extreme caution, and proceed at a ``safe speed'' so that the vessel can 
take proper and effective action to avoid a collision with any marine 
animal and can be stopped within a distance appropriate to the 
prevailing circumstances and conditions.
    (H) When marine mammals have been sighted in the area, Navy vessels 
shall increase vigilance and take reasonable and practicable actions to 
avoid collisions and activities that might result in close interaction 
of naval assets and marine mammals. Actions may include changing speed 
and/or direction and are dictated by environmental and other conditions 
(e.g., safety, weather).
    (I) Naval vessels shall maneuver to keep at least 1,500 ft (500 yds) 
away from any observed whale in the vessel's path and avoid approaching 
whales head-on. These requirements do not apply if a vessel's safety is 
threatened, such as when change of course will create an imminent and 
serious threat to a person, vessel, or aircraft, and to the extent 
vessels are restricted in their ability to maneuver. Restricted 
maneuverability includes, but is not limited to, situations when vessels 
are engaged in dredging, submerged activities, launching and recovering 
aircraft or landing craft, minesweeping activities, replenishment while 
underway and towing activities that severely restrict a vessel's ability 
to deviate course. Vessels will take reasonable steps to alert other 
vessels in the vicinity of the whale. Given rapid swimming speeds and 
maneuverability of many dolphin species, naval vessels would maintain 
normal course and speed on sighting dolphins unless some condition 
indicated a need for the vessel to maneuver.

[[Page 212]]

    (J) Navy aircraft participating in exercises at sea shall conduct 
and maintain, when operationally feasible and safe, surveillance for 
marine mammals as long as it does not violate safety constraints or 
interfere with the accomplishment of primary operational duties. Marine 
mammal detections shall be immediately reported to assigned Aircraft 
Control Unit for further dissemination to ships in the vicinity of the 
marine species as appropriate when it is reasonable to conclude that the 
course of the ship will likely result in a closing of the distance to 
the detected marine mammal.
    (K) All vessels shall maintain logs and records documenting training 
operations should they be required for event reconstruction purposes. 
Logs and records will be kept for a period of 30 days following 
completion of a major training exercise.
    (2) Navy's Measures for MFAS Operations:
    (i) Personnel Training (for MFAS Operations):
    (A) All lookouts onboard platforms involved in ASW training events 
shall review the NMFS-approved Marine Species Awareness Training 
material prior to use of mid-frequency active sonar.
    (B) All COs, XOs, and officers standing watch on the bridge shall 
have reviewed the Marine Species Awareness Training material prior to a 
training event employing the use of mid-frequency active sonar.
    (C) Navy lookouts shall undertake extensive training in order to 
qualify as a watchstander in accordance with the Lookout Training 
Handbook (Naval Educational Training [NAVEDTRA], 12968-D).
    (D) Lookout training shall include on-the-job instruction under the 
supervision of a qualified, experienced watchstander. Following 
successful completion of this supervised training period, lookouts shall 
complete the Personal Qualification Standard program, certifying that 
they have demonstrated the necessary skills (such as detection and 
reporting of partially submerged objects). This does not forbid 
personnel being trained as lookouts from being counted as those listed 
in previous measures so long as supervisors monitor their progress and 
performance.
    (E) Lookouts shall be trained in the most effective means to ensure 
quick and effective communication within the command structure in order 
to facilitate implementation of mitigation measures if marine species 
are spotted.
    (ii) Lookout and Watchstander Responsibilities:
    (A) On the bridge of surface ships, there shall always be at least 
three people on watch whose duties include observing the water surface 
around the vessel.
    (B) All surface ships participating in ASW training events shall, in 
addition to the three personnel on watch noted previously, have at all 
times during the exercise at least two additional personnel on watch as 
marine mammal lookouts.
    (C) Personnel on lookout and officers on watch on the bridge shall 
have at least one set of binoculars available for each person to aid in 
the detection of marine mammals.
    (D) On surface vessels equipped with mid-frequency active sonar, 
pedestal mounted ``Big Eye'' (20x110) binoculars shall be present and in 
good working order to assist in the detection of marine mammals in the 
vicinity of the vessel.
    (E) Personnel on lookout shall employ visual search procedures 
employing a scanning methodology in accordance with the Lookout Training 
Handbook (NAVEDTRA 12968-D).
    (F) After sunset and prior to sunrise, lookouts shall employ Night 
Lookouts Techniques in accordance with the Lookout Training Handbook.
    (G) Personnel on lookout shall be responsible for reporting all 
objects or anomalies sighted in the water (regardless of the distance 
from the vessel) to the Officer of the Deck, since any object or 
disturbance (e.g., trash, periscope, surface disturbance, discoloration) 
in the water may be indicative of a threat to the vessel and its crew or 
indicative of a marine species that may need to be avoided as warranted.
    (iii) Operating Procedures (for MFAS Operations):
    (A) Navy will distribute final mitigation measures contained in the 
LOA

[[Page 213]]

and the Incidental take statement of NMFS' biological opinion to the 
Fleet.
    (B) COs shall make use of marine species detection cues and 
information to limit interaction with marine species to the maximum 
extent possible consistent with safety of the ship.
    (C) All personnel engaged in passive acoustic sonar operation 
(including aircraft, surface ships, or submarines) shall monitor for 
marine mammal vocalizations and report the detection of any marine 
mammal to the appropriate watch station for dissemination and 
appropriate action.
    (D) During mid-frequency active sonar operations, personnel shall 
utilize all available sensor and optical systems (such as night vision 
goggles) to aid in the detection of marine mammals.
    (E) Navy aircraft participating in exercises at sea shall conduct 
and maintain, when operationally feasible and safe, surveillance for 
marine species of concern as long as it does not violate safety 
constraints or interfere with the accomplishment of primary operational 
duties.
    (F) Aircraft with deployed sonobuoys shall use only the passive 
capability of sonobuoys when marine mammals are detected within 200 yds 
(183 m) of the sonobuoy.
    (G) Marine mammal detections shall be immediately reported to 
assigned Aircraft Control Unit for further dissemination to ships in the 
vicinity of the marine species as appropriate where it is reasonable to 
conclude that the course of the ship will likely result in a closing of 
the distance to the detected marine mammal.
    (H) Safety Zones--When marine mammals are detected by any means 
(aircraft, shipboard lookout, or acoustically) the Navy shall ensure 
that sonar transmission levels are limited to at least 6 dB below normal 
operating levels if any detected marine mammals are within 1,000 yards 
(914 m) of the sonar dome (the bow).
    (1) Ships and submarines shall continue to limit maximum 
transmission levels by this 6-dB factor until the animal has been seen 
to leave the 1,000-yd safety zone, has not been detected for 30 minutes, 
or the vessel has transited more than 2,000 yds (1829 m) beyond the 
location of the last detection.
    (2) When marine mammals are detected by any means (aircraft, 
shipboard lookout, or acoustically) the Navy shall ensure that sonar 
transmission levels are limited to at least 10 dB below normal operating 
levels if any detected marine mammals are within 500 yards (497 m) of 
the sonar dome (the bow). Ships and submarines shall continue to limit 
maximum ping levels by this 10-dB factor until the animal has been seen 
to leave the 500-yd safety zone, has not been detected for 30 minutes, 
or the vessel has transited more than 2,000 yds (1829 m) beyond the 
location of the last detection.
    (3) When marine mammals are detected by any means (aircraft, 
shipboard lookout, or acoustically) the Navy shall ensure that sonar 
transmission ceases if any detected marine mammals are within 200 yards 
(183 m) of the sonar dome (the bow). Sonar shall not resume until the 
animal has been seen to leave the 200-yd safety zone, has not been 
detected for 30 minutes, or the vessel has transited more than 2,000 yds 
(1829 m) beyond the location of the last detection.
    (4) Special conditions applicable for dolphins and porpoises only: 
If, after conducting an initial maneuver to avoid close quarters with 
dolphins or porpoises, the OOD concludes that dolphins or porpoises are 
deliberately closing to ride the vessel's bow wave, no further 
mitigation actions are necessary while the dolphins or porpoises 
continue to exhibit bow wave riding behavior.
    (5) If the need for power-down should arise as detailed in ``Safety 
Zones'' above, the Navy shall follow the requirements as though they 
were operating at 235 dB--the normal operating level (i.e., the first 
power-down will be to 229 dB, regardless of at what level above 235 dB 
active sonar was being operated).
    (I) Prior to start up or restart of active sonar, operators will 
check that the Safety Zone radius around the sound source is clear of 
marine mammals.
    (J) Active sonar levels (generally)--Navy shall operate active sonar 
at the

[[Page 214]]

lowest practicable level, not to exceed 235 dB, except as required to 
meet tactical training objectives.
    (K) Helicopters shall observe/survey the vicinity of an ASW training 
event for 10 minutes before the first deployment of active (dipping) 
sonar in the water.
    (L) Helicopters shall not dip their active sonar within 200 yds (183 
m) of a marine mammal and shall cease pinging if a marine mammal closes 
within 200 yds of the sound source (183 m) after pinging has begun.
    (M) Submarine sonar operators shall review detection indicators of 
close-aboard marine mammals prior to the commencement of ASW training 
events involving active mid-frequency sonar.
    (N) Night vision goggles shall be available to all ships and air 
crews, for use as appropriate.
    (3) Navy's Measures for Underwater Detonations:
    (i) Surface-to-Surface Gunnery (non-explosive rounds)
    (A) A 200-yd (183 m) radius buffer zone shall be established around 
the intended target.
    (B) From the intended firing position, trained lookouts shall survey 
the buffer zone for marine mammals prior to commencement and during the 
exercise as long as practicable.
    (C) If applicable, target towing vessels shall maintain a lookout. 
If a marine mammal is sighted in the vicinity of the exercise, the tow 
vessel shall immediately notify the firing vessel in order to secure 
gunnery firing until the area is clear.
    (D) The exercise shall be conducted only when the buffer zone is 
visible and marine mammals are not detected within the target area and 
the buffer zone.
    (ii) Surface-to-Air Gunnery (explosive and non-explosive rounds)
    (A) Vessels shall orient the geometry of gunnery exercises in order 
to prevent debris from falling in the area of sighted marine mammals.
    (B) Vessels will attempt to recover any parachute deploying aerial 
targets to the extent practicable (and their parachutes if feasible) to 
reduce the potential for entanglement of marine mammals.
    (C) For exercises using targets towed by a vessel or aircraft, 
target towing vessel/aircraft shall maintain a lookout. If a marine 
mammal is sighted in the vicinity of the exercise, the tow aircraft 
shall immediately notify the firing vessel in order to secure gunnery 
firing until the area is clear.
    (iii) Air-to-Surface At-sea Bombing Exercises (explosive and non-
explosive):
    (A) If surface vessels are involved, trained lookouts shall survey 
for floating kelp and marine mammals. Ordnance shall not be targeted to 
impact within 1,000 yds (914 m) of known or observed floating kelp or 
marine mammals.
    (B) A 1,000 yd (914 m) radius buffer zone shall be established 
around the intended target.
    (C) Aircraft shall visually survey the target and buffer zone for 
marine mammals prior to and during the exercise. The survey of the 
impact area shall be made by flying at 1,500 ft (457 m) or lower, if 
safe to do so, and at the slowest safe speed. Release of ordnance 
through cloud cover is prohibited: aircraft must be able to actually see 
ordnance impact areas. Survey aircraft should employ most effective 
search tactics and capabilities.
    (D) The exercise will be conducted only if marine mammals are not 
visible within the buffer zone.
    (iv) Air-to-Surface Missile Exercises (explosive and non-explosive):
    (A) Ordnance shall not be targeted to impact within 1,800 yds (1646 
m) of known or observed floating kelp.
    (B) Aircraft shall visually survey the target area for marine 
mammals. Visual inspection of the target area shall be made by flying at 
1,500 ft (457 m) or lower, if safe to do so, and at slowest safe speed. 
Firing or range clearance aircraft must be able to actually see ordnance 
impact areas. Explosive ordnance shall not be targeted to impact within 
1,800 yds (1646 m) of sighted marine mammals.
    (v) Demolitions, Mine Warfare, and Mine Countermeasures (up to a 
2.5-lb charge):
    (A) Exclusion Zones--All Mine Warfare and Mine Countermeasures 
Operations involving the use of explosive charges must include exclusion 
zones

[[Page 215]]

for marine mammals to prevent physical and/or acoustic effects to those 
species. These exclusion zones shall extend in a 700-yard arc radius 
around the detonation site.
    (B) Pre-Exercise Surveys--For Demolition and Ship Mine 
Countermeasures Operations, pre-exercise surveys shall be conducted 
within 30 minutes prior to the commencement of the scheduled explosive 
event. The survey may be conducted from the surface, by divers, and/or 
from the air, and personnel shall be alert to the presence of any marine 
mammal. Should such an animal be present within the survey area, the 
explosive event shall not be started until the animal voluntarily leaves 
the area. The Navy will ensure the area is clear of marine mammals for a 
full 30 minutes prior to initiating the explosive event. Personnel will 
record any marine mammal observations during the exercise as well as 
measures taken if species are detected within the exclusion zone.
    (C) Post-Exercise Surveys--Surveys within the same radius shall also 
be conducted within 30 minutes after the completion of the explosive 
event.
    (D) Reporting--If there is evidence that a marine mammal may have 
been stranded, injured or killed by the action, Navy training activities 
shall be immediately suspended and the situation immediately reported by 
the participating unit to the Officer in Charge of the Exercise (OCE), 
who will follow Navy procedures for reporting the incident to Commander, 
Pacific Fleet, Commander, Navy Region Northwest, Environmental Director, 
and the chain-of-command. The situation shall also be reported to NMFS 
(see Stranding Plan for details).
    (vi) Sink Exercise:
    (A) All weapons firing shall be conducted during the period 1 hour 
after official sunrise to 30 minutes before official sunset.
    (B) An exclusion zone with a radius of 1.5 nm shall be established 
around each target. This 1.5 nm zone includes a buffer of 0.5 nm to 
account for errors, target drift, and animal movement. In addition to 
the 1.5 nm exclusion zone, a further safety zone, which extends from the 
exclusion zone at 1.5 nm out an additional 0.5 nm, shall be surveyed. 
Together, the zones extend out 2 nm (3.7 km) from the target.
    (C) A series of surveillance over-flights shall be conducted within 
the 2-nm zone around the target, prior to and during the exercise, when 
feasible. Survey protocol shall be as follows:
    (1) Overflights within the 2-nm zone around the target shall be 
conducted in a manner that optimizes the surface area of the water 
observed. This may be accomplished through the use of the Navy's Search 
and Rescue Tactical Aid, which provides the best search altitude, ground 
speed, and track spacing for the discovery of small, possibly dark 
objects in the water based on the environmental conditions of the day. 
These environmental conditions include the angle of sun inclination, 
amount of daylight, cloud cover, visibility, and sea state.
    (2) All visual surveillance activities shall be conducted by Navy 
personnel trained in visual surveillance. At least one member of the 
mitigation team is required to have completed the Navy's marine mammal 
training program for lookouts.
    (3) In addition to the overflights, the 2-nm zone around the target 
shall be monitored by passive acoustic means, when assets are available. 
This passive acoustic monitoring would be maintained throughout the 
exercise. Potential assets include sonobuoys, which can be utilized to 
detect any vocalizing marine mammals (particularly sperm whales) in the 
vicinity of the exercise. The sonobuoys shall be re-seeded as necessary 
throughout the exercise. Additionally, if submarines are present, 
passive sonar onboard shall be utilized to detect any vocalizing marine 
mammals in the area. The OCE would be informed of any aural detection of 
marine mammals and would include this information in the determination 
of when it is safe to commence the exercise.
    (4) On each day of the exercise, aerial surveillance of the 2-nm 
zone around the target shall commence 2 hours prior to the first firing.
    (5) The results of all visual, aerial, and acoustic searches shall 
be reported immediately to the OCE. No weapons launches or firing may 
commence until

[[Page 216]]

the OCE declares the 2-nm zone around the target free of marine mammals.
    (6) If a marine mammal observed within the 2-nm zone around the 
target is diving, firing would be delayed until the animal is re-sighted 
outside the 2-nm zone around the target, or 30 minutes have elapsed. 
After 30 minutes, if the animal has not been re-sighted it would be 
assumed to have left the exclusion zone. The OCE would determine if the 
identified marine mammal is in danger of being adversely affected by 
commencement of the exercise.
    (7) During breaks in the exercise of 30 minutes or more, the 2-nm 
zone around the target shall again be surveyed for any marine mammal. If 
marine mammals are sighted within 2-nm zone around the target, the OCE 
shall be notified, and the procedure described in (vi)(c)(1)-(6) would 
be followed.
    (8) Upon sinking of the vessel, a final surveillance of the 2-nm 
zone around the target shall be monitored for 2 hours, or until sunset, 
to verify that no marine mammals were injured.
    (D) Aerial surveillance shall be conducted using helicopters or 
other aircraft based on necessity and availability.
    (E) Where practicable, the Navy shall conduct the exercise in sea 
states that are ideal for marine mammal sighting, i.e., Beaufort Sea 
State 3 or less. In the event of a Beaufort Sea State 4 or above, survey 
efforts shall be increased within the 2-nm zone around the target. This 
shall be accomplished through the use of an additional aircraft, if 
available, and conducting tight search patterns.
    (F) The sink exercise shall not be conducted unless the 2-nm zone 
around the target could be adequately monitored visually.
    (G) In the event that any marine mammals are observed to be harmed 
in the area, NMFS shall be notified as soon as feasible following the 
stranding communication protocol. A detailed description of the animal 
shall be taken, the location noted, and if possible, photos taken. This 
information shall be provided to NMFS as soon as practicable via the 
Navy's regional environmental coordinator for purposes of 
identification.
    (H) An after action report detailing the exercise's time line, the 
time the surveys commenced and terminated, amount, and types of all 
ordnance expended, and the results of survey efforts for each event 
shall be submitted to NMFS.
    (vii) Extended Echo Ranging/Improved Extended Echo Ranging (EER/
IEER):
    (A) Crews shall conduct visual reconnaissance of the drop area prior 
to laying their intended sonobuoy pattern. This search shall be 
conducted at an altitude below 457 m (500 yd) at a slow speed, if 
operationally feasible and weather conditions permit. In dual aircraft 
operations, crews are allowed to conduct area clearances utilizing more 
than one aircraft.
    (B) For IEER (AN/SSQ-110A), crews shall conduct a minimum of 30 
minutes of visual and aural monitoring of the search area prior to 
commanding the first post detonation. This 30-minute observation period 
may include pattern deployment time.
    (C) For any part of the intended sonobuoy pattern where a post 
(source/receiver sonobuoy pair) will be deployed within 914 m (1,000 yd) 
of observed marine mammal activity, the Navy shall deploy the receiver 
ONLY (i.e., not the source) and monitor while conducting a visual 
search. When marine mammals are no longer detected within 914 m (1,000 
yd) of the intended post position, the source sonobuoy (AN/SSQ-110A/SSQ-
125) will be co-located with the receiver.
    (D) When operationally feasible, Navy crews shall conduct continuous 
visual and aural monitoring of marine mammal activity. This shall 
include monitoring of aircraft sensors from the time of the first sensor 
placement until the aircraft have left the area and are out of RF range 
of these sensors.
    (E) Aural Detection--If the presence of marine mammals is detected 
aurally, then that shall cue the Navy aircrew to increase the vigilance 
of their visual surveillance. Subsequently, if no marine mammals are 
visually detected, then the crew may continue multi-static active 
search.
    (F) Visual Detection--If marine mammals are visually detected within 
914 m (1,000 yd) of the explosive source

[[Page 217]]

sonobuoy (AN/SSQ-110A) intended for use, then that payload shall not be 
detonated. Aircrews may utilize this post once the marine mammals have 
not been re-sighted for 30 minutes, or are observed to have moved 
outside the 914 m (1,000 yd) safety buffer. Aircrews may shift their 
multi-static active search to another post, where marine mammals are 
outside the 914 m (1,000 yd) safety buffer.
    (G) For IEER (AN/SSQ-110A), aircrews shall make every attempt to 
manually detonate the unexploded charges at each post in the pattern 
prior to departing the operations area by using the ``Payload 1 
Release'' command followed by the ``Payload 2 Release'' command. 
Aircrews shall refrain from using the ``Scuttle'' command when two 
payloads remain at a given post. Aircrews will ensure that a 914 m 
(1,000 yd) safety buffer, visually clear of marine mammals, is 
maintained around each post as is done during active search operations.
    (H) Aircrews shall only leave posts with unexploded charges in the 
event of a sonobuoy malfunction, an aircraft system malfunction, or when 
an aircraft must immediately depart the area due to issues such as fuel 
constraints, inclement weather, or in-flight emergencies. In these 
cases, the sonobuoy will self-scuttle using the secondary or tertiary 
method.
    (I) The Navy shall ensure all payloads are accounted for. Explosive 
source sonobuoys (AN/SSQ-110A) that cannot be scuttled shall be reported 
as unexploded ordnance via voice communications while airborne, then 
upon landing via naval message.
    (J) Mammal monitoring shall continue until out of own-aircraft 
sensor range.
    (b) [Reserved]

<R05>
Sec. 218.124  Mitigation.

    (a) When conducting training and utilizing the sound sources or 
explosives identified in Sec. 218.120(c), the mitigation measures 
contained in a Letter of Authorization issued under Sec. Sec. 216.106 
and 218.127 of this chapter must be implemented. These mitigation 
measures include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Personnel Training (for all Training Types):
    (i) All commanding officers (COs), executive officers (XOs), 
Lookouts, Officers of the Deck (OODs), junior OODs (JOODs), maritime 
patrol aircraft aircrews, and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) helicopter 
crews shall complete the NMFS-approved Marine Species Awareness Training 
(MSAT) by viewing the U.S. Navy MSAT digital versatile disk (DVD). All 
bridge Lookouts shall complete both parts one and two of the MSAT; part 
two is optional for other personnel.
    (ii) Navy Lookouts shall undertake extensive training in order to 
qualify

[[Page 224]]

as a watchstander in accordance with the Lookout Training Handbook 
(Naval Education and Training Command [NAVEDTRA] 12968-D).
    (iii) Lookout training shall include on-the-job instruction under 
the supervision of a qualified, experienced Lookout. Following 
successful completion of this supervised training period, Lookouts shall 
complete the Personal Qualification Standard Program, certifying that 
they have demonstrated the necessary skills (such as detection and 
reporting of partially submerged objects). Personnel being trained as 
Lookouts can be counted among required Lookouts as long as supervisors 
monitor their progress and performance.
    (iv) Lookouts shall be trained in the most effective means to ensure 
quick and effective communication within the command structure in order 
to facilitate implementation of protective measures if marine species 
are spotted.
    (v) All Lookouts onboard platforms involved in ASW training events 
shall review the NMFS-approved Marine Species Awareness Training 
material prior to use of mid-frequency active sonar.
    (vi) All COs, XOs, and officers standing watch on the bridge shall 
have reviewed the Marine Species Awareness Training material prior to a 
training event employing the use of MFAS/HFAS.
    (2) General Operating Procedures (for all Training Types):
    (i) Prior to major exercises, a Letter of Instruction, Mitigation 
Measures Message or Environmental Annex to the Operational Order shall 
be issued to further disseminate the personnel training requirement and 
general marine species protective measures.
    (ii) COs shall make use of marine species detection cues and 
information to limit interaction with marine mammals to the maximum 
extent possible consistent with safety of the ship.
    (iii) While underway, surface vessels shall have at least two 
Lookouts with binoculars; surfaced submarines shall have at least one 
Lookout with binoculars. Lookouts already posted for safety of 
navigation and man-overboard precautions may be used to fill this 
requirement. As part of their regular duties, Lookouts shall watch for 
and report to the OOD the presence of marine mammals.
    (iv) On surface vessels equipped with mid-frequency active sonar, 
pedestal mounted ``Big Eye'' (20x110) binoculars shall be properly 
installed and in good working order to assist in the detection of marine 
mammals in the vicinity of the vessel.
    (v) Personnel on Lookout shall employ visual search procedures 
employing a scanning methodology in accordance with the Lookout Training 
Handbook (NAVEDTRA 12968-D).
    (vi) After sunset and prior to sunrise, Lookouts shall employ Night 
Lookouts Techniques in accordance with the Lookout Training Handbook 
(NAVEDTRA 12968-D).
    (vii) While in transit, naval vessels shall be alert at all times, 
use extreme caution, and proceed at a ``safe speed,'' which means the 
speed at which the CO can maintain crew safety and effectiveness of 
current operational directives, so that the vessel can take action to 
avoid a collision with any marine mammal.
    (viii) When marine mammals have been sighted in the area, Navy 
vessels shall increase vigilance and take all reasonable and practicable 
actions to avoid collisions and activities that might result in close 
interaction of naval assets and marine mammals. Such action may include 
changing speed and/or direction and are dictated by environmental and 
other conditions (e.g., safety, weather).
    (ix) Navy aircraft participating in exercises at sea shall conduct 
and maintain surveillance for marine mammals as long as it does not 
violate safety constraints or interfere with the accomplishment of 
primary operational duties.
    (x) All marine mammal detections shall be immediately reported to 
assigned Aircraft Control Unit for further dissemination to ships in the 
vicinity of the marine species as appropriate when it is reasonable to 
conclude that the course of the ship will likely result in a closing of 
the distance to the detected marine mammal.
    (xi) Naval vessels shall maneuver to keep at least 1,500 ft (500 yd 
or 457 m) away from any observed whale in the

[[Page 225]]

vessel's path and avoid approaching whales head-on. These requirements 
do not apply if a vessel's safety is threatened, such as when change of 
course will create an imminent and serious threat to a person, vessel, 
or aircraft, and to the extent vessels are restricted in their ability 
to maneuver. Restricted maneuverability includes, but is not limited to, 
situations when vessels are engaged in dredging, submerged activities, 
launching and recovering aircraft or landing craft, minesweeping 
activities, replenishment while underway and towing activities that 
severely restrict a vessel's ability to deviate course. Vessels shall 
take reasonable steps to alert other vessels in the vicinity of the 
whale. Given rapid swimming speeds and maneuverability of many dolphin 
species, naval vessels would maintain normal course and speed on 
sighting dolphins unless some condition indicated a need for the vessel 
to maneuver.
    (3) Operating Procedures (for Anti-submarine Warfare (ASW) 
Operations):
    (i) On the bridge of surface ships, there shall always be at least 
three people on watch whose duties include observing the water surface 
around the vessel.
    (ii) All surface ships participating in ASW training events shall 
have, in addition to the three personnel on watch noted in paragraph 
(i), at least two additional personnel on watch as Lookouts at all times 
during the exercise.
    (iii) Personnel on Lookout and officers on watch on the bridge shall 
have at least one set of binoculars available for each person to aid in 
the detection of marine mammals.
    (iv) Personnel on Lookout shall be responsible for reporting all 
objects or anomalies sighted in the water (regardless of the distance 
from the vessel) to the Officer of the Deck, since any object or 
disturbance (e.g., trash, periscope, surface disturbance, discoloration) 
in the water may be indicative of a threat to the vessel and its crew or 
indicative of a marine mammal that may need to be avoided as warranted.
    (v) All personnel engaged in passive acoustic sonar operation 
(including aircraft, surface ships, or submarines) shall monitor for 
marine mammal vocalizations and report the detection of any marine 
mammal to the appropriate watch station for dissemination and 
appropriate action.
    (vi) During mid-frequency active sonar operations, personnel shall 
utilize all available sensor and optical systems (such as night vision 
goggles) to aid in the detection of marine mammals.
    (vii) Aircraft with deployed sonobuoys shall use only the passive 
capability of sonobuoys when marine mammals are detected within 200 yd 
(183 m) of the sonobuoy.
    (viii) Helicopters shall observe/survey the vicinity of an ASW 
exercise for 10 minutes before the first deployment of active (dipping) 
sonar in the water.
    (ix) Helicopters shall not dip their sonar within 200 yd (183 m) of 
a marine mammal and shall cease pinging if a marine mammal closes within 
200 yd (183 m) of the sound source after pinging has begun.
    (x) Safety Zones--When marine mammals are detected by any means 
(aircraft, shipboard Lookout, or acoustically) within 1,000 yd (914 m) 
of the sonar dome (the bow), the ship or submarine shall limit active 
transmission levels to at least 6 decibels (dB) below normal operating 
levels for that source (i.e., limit to at most 229 dB for AN/SQS-53 and 
219 for AN/SQS-56, etc.).
    (A) Ships and submarines shall continue to limit maximum 
transmission levels by this 6-dB factor until the animal has been seen 
to leave the 1,000-yd (914 m) exclusion zone, has not been detected for 
30 minutes, or the vessel has transited more than 2,000 yds (1,829 m) 
beyond the location of the last detection.
    (B) Should a marine mammal be detected within 500 yd (457 m) of the 
sonar dome, active sonar transmissions shall be limited to at least 10 
dB below the equipment's normal operating level (i.e., limit to at most 
225 dB for AN/SQS-53 and 215 for AN/SQS-56, etc.). Ships and submarines 
shall continue to limit maximum ping levels by this 10-dB factor until 
the animal has been seen to leave the 500-yd (457 m) safety zone (at 
which point the 6-dB powerdown applies until the animal leaves the 
1,000-yd (914 m) safety zone), has not been detected for 30 minutes, or 
the vessel has transited more than

[[Page 226]]

2,000 yd (1,829 m) beyond the location of the last detection.
    (C) Should the marine mammal be detected within 200 yd (183 m) of 
the sonar dome, active sonar transmissions shall cease. Sonar shall not 
resume until the animal has been seen to leave the 200-yd (183 m) safety 
zone (at which point the 10-dB or 6-dB powerdowns apply until the animal 
leaves the 500-yd (457 m) or 1,000-yd (914 m) safety zone, 
respectively), has not been detected for 30 minutes, or the vessel has 
transited more than 2,000 yd (1,829 m) beyond the location of the last 
detection.
    (D) Special conditions applicable for dolphins and porpoises only: 
If, after conducting an initial maneuver to avoid close quarters with 
dolphins or porpoises, the OOD concludes that dolphins or porpoises are 
deliberately closing to ride the vessel's bow wave, no further 
mitigation actions are necessary while the dolphins or porpoises 
continue to exhibit bow wave riding behavior.
    (xi) Prior to start up or restart of active sonar, operators shall 
check that the Safety Zone radius around the sound source is clear of 
marine mammals.
    (xii) Active sonar levels (generally)--Navy shall operate active 
sonar at the lowest practicable level, not to exceed 235 dB, except as 
required to meet tactical training objectives.
    (xiii) Submarine sonar operators shall review detection indicators 
of close-aboard marine mammals prior to the commencement of ASW training 
events involving MFAS.

    Note to paragraph (a)(3): If the need for power-down should arise 
(as detailed in 218.114(a)(3)(x)) when the Navy is operating a hull-
mounted or sub-mounted source above 235 db (infrequent), the Navy shall 
follow the requirements as though they were operating at 235 dB--the 
normal operating level (i.e., the first power-down will be to 229 dB, 
regardless of at what level above 235 dB active sonar was being 
operated).

    (4) Sinking Exercise:
    (i) All weapons firing shall be conducted during the period 1 hour 
after official sunrise to 30 minutes before official sunset.
    (ii) An exclusion zone with a radius of 1.0 nm (1.9 km) shall be 
established around each target. An additional buffer of 0.5 nm (0.9 km) 
will be added to account for errors, target drift, and animal movements. 
Additionally, a safety zone, which will extend beyond the buffer zone by 
an additional 0.5 nm (0.9 km), shall be surveyed. Together, the zones 
extend out 2 nm (3.7 km) from the target.
    (iii) A series of surveillance over-flights shall be conducted 
within the exclusion and the safety zones, prior to and during the 
exercise, when feasible. Survey protocol shall be as follows:
    (A) Overflights within the exclusion zone shall be conducted in a 
manner that optimizes the surface area of the water observed. This may 
be accomplished through the use of the Navy's Search and Rescue Tactical 
Aid, which provides the best search altitude, ground speed, and track 
spacing for the discovery of small, possibly dark objects in the water 
based on the environmental conditions of the day. These environmental 
conditions include the angle of sun inclination, amount of daylight, 
cloud cover, visibility, and sea state.
    (B) All visual surveillance activities shall be conducted by Navy 
personnel trained in visual surveillance. At least one member of the 
mitigation team shall have completed the Navy's marine mammal training 
program for Lookouts.
    (C) In addition to the overflights, the exclusion zone shall be 
monitored by passive acoustic means, when assets are available. This 
passive acoustic monitoring shall be maintained throughout the exercise. 
Potential assets include sonobuoys, which can be utilized to detect any 
vocalizing marine mammals (particularly sperm whales) in the vicinity of 
the exercise. The sonobuoys shall be re-seeded as necessary throughout 
the exercise. Additionally, if submarines are present, passive sonar 
onboard submarines may be utilized to detect any vocalizing marine 
mammals in the area. The OCE shall be informed of any aural detection of 
marine mammals and shall include this information in the determination 
of when it is safe to commence the exercise.
    (D) On each day of the exercise, aerial surveillance of the 
exclusion and

[[Page 227]]

safety zones shall commence 2 hours prior to the first firing.
    (E) The results of all visual, aerial, and acoustic searches shall 
be reported immediately to the OCE. No weapons launches or firing may 
commence until the OCE declares the safety and exclusion zones free of 
marine mammals.
    (F) If a marine mammal is observed within the exclusion zone, firing 
shall be delayed until the animal is re-sighted outside the exclusion 
zone, or 30 minutes have elapsed. After 30 minutes, if the animal has 
not been re-sighted it can be assumed to have left the exclusion zone. 
The OCE shall determine if the marine mammal is in danger of being 
adversely affected by commencement of the exercise.
    (G) During breaks in the exercise of 30 minutes or more, the 
exclusion zone shall again be surveyed for any marine mammal. If marine 
mammals are sighted within the exclusion zone or buffer zone, the OCE 
shall be notified, and the procedure described above shall be followed.
    (H) Upon sinking of the vessel, a final surveillance of the 
exclusion zone shall be monitored for 2 hours, or until sunset, to 
verify that no marine mammals were harmed.
    (iv) Aerial surveillance shall be conducted using helicopters or 
other aircraft based on necessity and availability.
    (v) Where practicable, the Navy shall conduct the exercise in sea 
states that are ideal for marine mammal sighting, Beaufort Sea State 3 
or less. In the event of a Beaufort Sea State 4 or above, survey efforts 
shall be increased within the zones. This shall be accomplished through 
the use of an additional aircraft, if available, and conducting tight 
search patterns.
    (vi) The exercise shall not be conducted unless the exclusion zone 
can be adequately monitored visually.
    (vii) In the event that any marine mammals are observed to be harmed 
in the area, NMFS shall be notified as soon as feasible following the 
stranding communication protocol. A detailed description of the animal 
shall be taken, the location noted, and if possible, photos taken of the 
marine mammal. This information shall be provided to NMFS via the Navy's 
regional environmental coordinator for purposes of identification (see 
the draft Stranding Plan for detail).
    (viii) An after action report detailing the exercise's time line, 
the time the surveys commenced and terminated, amount, and types of all 
ordnance expended, and the results of survey efforts for each event 
shall be submitted to NMFS.
    (5) Surface-to-Surface Gunnery (up to 5-inch Explosive Rounds):
    (i) For exercises using targets towed by a vessel, target-towing 
vessels shall maintain a trained Lookout for marine mammals when 
feasible. If a marine mammal is sighted in the vicinity, the tow vessel 
shall immediately notify the firing vessel, which shall suspend the 
exercise until the area is clear.
    (ii) A 600-yd (585 m) radius buffer zone shall be established around 
the intended target.
    (iii) From the intended firing position, trained Lookouts shall 
survey the buffer zone for marine mammals prior to commencement and 
during the exercise as long as practicable. Due to the distance between 
the firing position and the buffer zone, Lookouts are only expected to 
visually detect breaching whales, whale blows, and large pods of 
dolphins and porpoises.
    (iv) The exercise shall be conducted only when the buffer zone is 
visible and marine mammals are not detected within it.
    (6) Surface-to-Surface Gunnery (non-explosive rounds):
    (i) A 200-yd (183 m) radius buffer zone shall be established around 
the intended target.
    (ii) From the intended firing position, trained Lookouts shall 
survey the buffer zone for marine mammals prior to commencement and 
during the exercise as long as practicable.
    (iii) If available, target-towing vessels shall maintain a Lookout 
(unmanned towing vessels will not have a Lookout available). If a marine 
mammal is sighted in the vicinity of the exercise, the tow vessel shall 
immediately notify the firing vessel in order to secure gunnery firing 
until the area is clear.
    (iv) The exercise shall be conducted only when the buffer zone is 
visible and marine mammals are not detected

[[Page 228]]

within the target area and the buffer zone.
    (7) Surface-to-Air Gunnery (Explosive and Non-explosive Rounds):
    (i) Vessels shall orient the geometry of gunnery exercises in order 
to prevent debris from falling in the area of sighted marine mammals.
    (ii) Vessels shall expedite the attempt to recover any parachute 
deploying aerial targets to reduce the potential for entanglement of 
marine mammals.
    (iii) Target-towing aircraft shall maintain a Lookout if feasible. 
If a marine mammal is sighted in the vicinity of the exercise, the tow 
aircraft shall immediately notify the firing vessel in order to secure 
gunnery firing until the area is clear.
    (8) Air-to-Surface Gunnery (Explosive and Non-explosive Rounds):
    (i) A 200-yd (183 m) radius buffer zone shall be established around 
the intended target.
    (ii) If surface vessels are involved, Lookout(s) shall visually 
survey the buffer zone for marine mammals prior to commencement and 
during the exercise.
    (iii) Aerial surveillance of the buffer zone for marine mammals 
shall be conducted prior to commencement of the exercise. Aerial 
surveillance altitude of 500 ft to 1,500 ft (152-456 m) is optimum. 
Aircraft crew/pilot shall maintain visual watch during exercises. 
Release of ordnance through cloud cover is prohibited; aircraft must be 
able to actually see ordnance impact areas.
    (iv) The exercise shall be conducted only if marine mammals are not 
visible within the buffer zone.
    (9) Small Arms Training (Grenades, Explosive and Non-explosive 
Rounds)--Lookouts shall visually survey for marine mammals. Weapons 
shall not be fired in the direction of known or observed marine mammals.
    (10) Air-to-Surface At-sea Bombing Exercises (explosive bombs and 
rockets):
    (i) If surface vessels are involved, trained Lookouts shall survey 
for marine mammals. Ordnance shall not be targeted to impact within 
1,000 yd (914 m) of known or observed marine mammals.
    (ii) A 1,000-yd (914 m) radius buffer zone shall be established 
around the intended target.
    (iii) Aircraft shall visually survey the target and buffer zone for 
marine mammals prior to and during the exercise. The survey of the 
impact area shall be made by flying at 1,500 ft (457 m) or lower, if 
safe to do so, and at the slowest safe speed. Release of ordinance 
through cloud cover is prohibited: Aircraft must be able to see ordnance 
impact areas. Survey aircraft shall employ most effective search tactics 
and capabilities.
    (iv) The exercise shall be conducted only if marine mammals are not 
visible within the buffer zone.
    (11) Air-to-Surface At-Sea Bombing Exercises (Non-explosive Bombs 
and Rockets):
    (i) If surface vessels are involved, trained Lookouts shall survey 
for marine mammals. Ordnance shall not be targeted to impact within 
1,000 yd (914 m) of known or observed marine mammals.
    (ii) A 1,000-yd (914 m) radius buffer zone shall be established 
around the intended target.
    (iii) Aircraft shall visually survey the target and buffer zone for 
marine mammals prior to and during the exercise. The survey of the 
impact area shall be made by flying at 1,500 ft (457 m) or lower, if 
safe to do so, and at the slowest safe speed. Release of ordnance 
through cloud cover is prohibited: Aircraft must be able to actually see 
ordnance impact areas. Survey aircraft shall employ most effective 
search tactics and capabilities.
    (iv) The exercise shall be conducted only if marine mammals and are 
not visible within the buffer zone.
    (12) Air-to-Surface Missile Exercises (explosive and non-explosive):
    (i) Aircraft shall visually survey the target area for marine 
mammals. Visual inspection of the target area shall be made by flying at 
1,500 ft (457 m) or lower, if safe to do so, and at the slowest safe 
speed. Firing or range clearance aircraft must be able to actually see 
ordnance impact areas.
    (ii) Explosive ordnance shall not be targeted to impact within 1,800 
yd (1646 m) of sighted marine mammals.

[[Page 229]]

    (13) Aircraft Training Activities Involving Non-Explosive Devices:
    (i) Non-explosive devices such as some sonobuoys and inert bombs 
involve aerial drops of devices that have the potential to hit marine 
mammals if they are in the immediate vicinity of a floating target. The 
exclusion zone (200 yd), therefore, shall be clear of marine mammals and 
around the target location.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (14) Extended Echo Ranging/Improved Extended Echo Ranging (EER/
IEER):
    (i) Crews shall conduct visual reconnaissance of the drop area prior 
to laying their intended sonobuoy pattern. This search shall be 
conducted at an altitude below 500 yd (457 m) at a slow speed, if 
operationally feasible and weather conditions permit. In dual aircraft 
operations, crews are allowed to conduct coordinated area clearances.
    (ii) Crews shall conduct a minimum of 30 minutes of visual and aural 
monitoring of the search area prior to commanding the first post 
detonation. This 30-minute observation period may include pattern 
deployment time.
    (iii) For any part of the intended sonobuoy pattern where a post 
(source/receiver sonobuoy pair) shall be deployed within 1,000 yd (914 
m) of observed marine mammal activity, the Navy shall deploy the 
receiver ONLY and monitor while conducting a visual search. When marine 
mammals are no longer detected within 1,000 yd (914 m) of the intended 
post position, the Navy shall co-locate the explosive source sonobuoy 
(AN/SSQ-110A) (source) with the receiver.
    (iv) When operationally feasible, Navy crews shall conduct 
continuous visual and aural monitoring of marine mammal activity. This 
is to include monitoring of own-aircraft sensors from first sensor 
placement to checking off station and out of RF range of these sensors.
    (v) Aural Detection--If the presence of marine mammals is detected 
aurally, then that shall cue the Navy aircrew to increase the diligence 
of their visual surveillance. Subsequently, if no marine mammals are 
visually detected, then the crew may continue multi-static active 
search.
    (vi) Visual Detection--If marine mammals are visually detected 
within 1,000 yd (914 m) of the explosive source sonobuoy (AN/SSQ-110A) 
intended for use, then that payload shall not be detonated. Aircrews may 
utilize this post once the marine mammals have not been re-sighted for 
30 minutes, or are observed to have moved outside the 1,000-yd (914 m) 
safety buffer. Aircrews may shift their multi-static active search to 
another post, where marine mammals are outside the 1,000-yd (914 m) 
safety buffer.
    (vii) Aircrews shall make every attempt to manually detonate the 
unexploded charges at each post in the pattern prior to departing the 
operations area by using the ``Payload 1 Release'' command followed by 
the ``Payload 2 Release'' command. Aircrews shall refrain from using the 
``Scuttle'' command when two payloads remain at a given post. Aircrews 
shall ensure that a 1,000-yd (914 m) safety buffer, visually clear of 
marine mammals, is maintained around each post as is done during active 
search operations.
    (viii) Aircrews shall only leave posts with unexploded charges in 
the event of a sonobuoy malfunction, an aircraft system malfunction, or 
when an aircraft must immediately depart the area due to issues such as 
fuel constraints, inclement weather, and in-flight emergencies. In these 
cases, the sonobuoy shall self-scuttle using the secondary or tertiary 
method.
    (ix) The Navy shall ensure all payloads are accounted for. Explosive 
source sonobuoys (AN/SSQ-110A) that cannot be scuttled shall be reported 
as unexploded ordnance via voice communications while airborne, then 
upon landing via naval message.
    (x) Marine mammal monitoring shall continue until out of own-
aircraft sensor range.
    (15) The Navy shall abide by the letter of the ``Stranding Response 
Plan for Major Navy Training Exercises in the GoA TMAA'' (available at: 
http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/permits/incidental.htm), which is 
incorporated herein by reference, to include the following measures:

[[Page 230]]

    (i) Shutdown Procedures--When an Uncommon Stranding Event (USE--
defined in Sec. 216.271) occurs during a Major Training Exercise (MTE) 
(as defined in the Stranding Plan, meaning including Multi-strike group 
exercises, Joint Expeditionary exercises, and Marine Air Ground Task 
Force exercises in the GoA TMAA), the Navy shall implement the 
procedures described below.
    (A) The Navy shall implement a Shutdown (as defined in the Stranding 
Response Plan for GoA TMAA) when advised by a NMFS Office of Protected 
Resources Headquarters Senior Official designated in the GoA TMAA 
Stranding Communication Protocol that a USE (as defined in the Stranding 
Response Plan for the GoA TMAA) involving live animals has been 
identified and that at least one live animal is located in the water. 
NMFS and Navy shall communicate, as needed, regarding the identification 
of the USE and the potential need to implement shutdown procedures.
    (B) Any shutdown in a given area shall remain in effect in that area 
until NMFS advises the Navy that the subject(s) of the USE at that area 
die or are euthanized, or that all live animals involved in the USE at 
that area have left the area (either of their own volition or herded).
    (C) If the Navy finds an injured or dead marine mammal floating at 
sea during an MTE, the Navy shall notify NMFS immediately or as soon as 
operational security considerations allow. The Navy shall provide NMFS 
with the species or description of the animal(s), the condition of the 
animal(s) including carcass condition if the animal(s) is/are dead), 
location, time of first discovery, observed behavior(s) (if alive), and 
photo or video of the animal(s) (if available). Based on the information 
provided, NMFS shall determine if, and advise the Navy whether a 
modified shutdown is appropriate on a case-by-case basis.
    (D) In the event, following a USE, that: Qualified individuals are 
attempting to herd animals back out to the open ocean and animals are 
not willing to leave, or animals are seen repeatedly heading for the 
open ocean but turning back to shore, NMFS and the Navy shall coordinate 
(including an investigation of other potential anthropogenic stressors 
in the area) to determine if the proximity of MFAS/HFAS activities or 
explosive detonations, though farther than 14 nm from the distressed 
animal(s), is likely decreasing the likelihood that the animals return 
to the open water. If so, NMFS and the Navy shall further coordinate to 
determine what measures are necessary to further minimize that 
likelihood and implement those measures as appropriate.
    (ii) Within 72 hrs of NMFS notifying the Navy of the presence of a 
USE, the Navy shall provide available information to NMFS (per the GoA 
TMAA Communication Protocol) regarding the location, number and types of 
acoustic/explosive sources, direction and speed of units using MFAS/
HFAS, and marine mammal sightings information associated with training 
activities occurring within 80 nm (148 km) and 72 hrs prior to the USE 
event. Information not initially available regarding the 80 nm (148 km) 
and 72 hrs prior to the event shall be provided as soon as it becomes 
available. The Navy shall provide NMFS investigative teams with 
additional relevant unclassified information as requested, if available.
    (iii) Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)--The Navy and NMFS shall develop 
a MOA, or other mechanism, that will establish a framework whereby the 
Navy can (and provide the Navy examples of how they can best) assist 
NMFS with stranding investigations in certain circumstances.
    (b) [Reserved]

Sec. 218.173  Mitigation.

    When conducting RDT&E activities identified in Sec. 218.170(c), the 
mitigation measures contained in this subpart and subsequent Letters of 
Authorization issued under Sec. 216.106 of this chapter and Sec. 
218.176 must be implemented. These mitigation measures include, but are 
not limited to:
    (a) Marine mammal observers training:
    (1) All range personnel shall be trained in marine mammal 
recognition.
    (2) Marine mammal observer training shall be conducted by qualified 
organizations approved by NMFS.
    (b) Lookouts onboard vessels:
    (1) Vessels on a range shall use lookouts during all hours of range 
activities.
    (2) Lookout duties include looking for marine mammals.
    (3) All sightings of marine mammals shall be reported to the Range 
Officer in charge of overseeing the activity.
    (c) Visual surveillance shall be conducted just prior to all in-
water exercises.
    (1) Surveillance shall include, as a minimum, monitoring from all 
participating surface craft and, where available, adjacent shore sites.
    (2) When cetaceans have been sighted in the vicinity of the 
operation, all range participants increase vigilance and take reasonable 
and practicable actions to avoid collisions and activities that may 
result in close interaction of naval assets and marine mammals.
    (3) Actions may include changing speed and/or direction, subject to 
environmental and other conditions (e.g., safety, weather).
    (d) An ``exclusion zone'' shall be established and surveillance will 
be conducted to ensure that there are no marine mammals within this 
exclusion zone prior to the commencement of each in-water exercise.
    (1) For cetaceans, the exclusion zone shall extend out 1,000 yards 
(914.4 m) from the intended track of the test unit.
    (2) For pinnipeds, the exclusion zone shall extend out 100 yards (91 
m) from the intended track of the test unit.
    (e) Range craft shall not approach within 100 yards (91 m) of marine 
mammals, to the extent practicable considering human and vessel safety 
priorities. This includes marine mammals ``hauled-out'' on islands, 
rocks, and other areas such as buoys.
    (f) In the event of a collision between a Navy vessel and a marine 
mammal, NUWC Keyport activities shall notify immediately the Navy chain 
of Command, which shall notify NMFS immediately.
    (g) Passive acoustic monitoring for cetaceans will be implemented 
throughout the NUWC Keyport Range Complex during RDT&E testing 
activities involving active sonar transmissions when passive acoustic 
monitoring capabilities are being operated during the testing activity.

[[Page 238]]

    (h) Procedures for reporting marine mammal sightings on the NAVSEA 
NUWC Keyport Range Complex shall be promulgated, and sightings shall be 
entered into the Range Operating System and forwarded to NOAA/NMML 
Platforms of Opportunity Program.
    (i) If there is clear evidence that a marine mammal is injured or 
killed as a result of the proposed Navy RDT&E activities, the Naval 
activities shall be immediately suspended and the situation immediately 
reported by personnel involved in the activity to the Ranger Officer, 
who will follow Navy procedures for reporting the incident to NMFS 
through the Navy's chain-of-command.
    (j) For nighttime RDT&E activities of active acoustic transmissions 
in the Keyport Range proposed extension area, the Navy shall conduct 
passive acoustic monitoring within the Agate Pass and south of 
University Point in southern Port Orchard Reach. If Southern Resident 
killer whales are detected in the vicinity of the Keyport Range Site, 
the Range Office shall be notified immediately and the active acoustic 
sources must be shutdown if killer whales are confirmed to approach at 
1,000 yards from the source.


<R05>
Sec. 218.174  Requirements for monitoring and reporting.

    (a) The Holder of the Letter of Authorization issued pursuant to 
Sec. 216.106 of this chapter and Sec. 218.176 for activities described 
in Sec. 218.170(c) is required to cooperate with the NMFS when 
monitoring the impacts of the activity on marine mammals.
    (b) The Holder of the Authorization must notify NMFS immediately (or 
as soon as clearance procedures allow) if the specified activity 
identified in Sec. 218.170(c) is thought to have resulted in the 
mortality or injury of any marine mammals, or in any take of marine 
mammals not identified or authorized in Sec. 218.171(c).
    (c) The Navy must conduct all monitoring and required reporting 
under the Letter of Authorization, including abiding by the NAVSEA NUWC 
Keyport Range Complex Monitoring Plan, which is incorporated herein by 
reference, and which requires the Navy to implement, at a minimum, the 
monitoring activities summarized below:
    (1) Visual Surveys:
    (i) The Holder of this Authorization shall conduct a minimum of 2 
special visual surveys per year to monitor HFAS and MFAS respectively at 
the DBRC Range site.
    (ii) For specified events, shore-based and vessel surveys shall be 
used 1 day prior to and 1-2 days post activity.
    (A) Shore-based Surveys:
    (1) Shore-based monitors shall observe test events that are planned 
in advance to occur adjacent to near shore areas where there are 
elevated topography or coastal structures, and shall use binoculars or 
theodolite to augment other visual survey methods.
    (2) Shore-based surveys of the test area and nearby beaches shall be 
conducted for stranded marine animals following nearshore events. If any 
distressed, injured or stranded animals are observed, an assessment of 
the animal's condition (alive, injured, dead, or degree of 
decomposition) shall be reported immediately to the Navy and the 
information shall be transmitted immediately to NMFS through the 
appropriate chain of command.
    (B) Vessel-based Surveys:
    (1) Vessel-based surveys shall be designed to maximize detections of 
marine mammals near mission activity event.
    (2) Post-analysis shall focus on how the location, speed and vector 
of the range craft and the location and direction of the sonar source 
(e.g. Navy surface vessel) relates to the animal.
    (3) Any other vessels or aircraft observed in the area shall also be 
documented.
    (iii) Surveys shall include the range site with special emphasis 
given to the particular path of the test run. When conducting a 
particular survey, the survey team shall collect the following 
information.
    (A) Species identification and group size;
    (B) Location and relative distance from the acoustic source(s);
    (C) The behavior of marine mammals including standard environmental 
and oceanographic parameters;

observation;

[[Page 239]]

    (E) Direction of travel relative to the active acoustic source; and
    (F) Duration of the observation.
    (iv) Animal sightings and relative distance from a particular active 
acoustic source shall be used post-survey to determine potential 
received energy (dB re 1 micro Pa-sec). This data shall be used, post-
survey, to estimate the number of marine mammals exposed to different 
received levels (energy based on distance to the source, bathymetry, 
oceanographic conditions and the type and power of the acoustic source) 
and their corresponding behavior.
    (2) Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM):
    (i) The Navy shall deploy a hydrophone array in the Keyport Range 
Complex Study Area for PAM.
    (ii) The array shall be utilized during the two special monitoring 
surveys in DBRC as described in Sec. 218.174(c)(1)(i).
    (iii) The array shall have the capability of detecting low frequency 
vocalizations (<1,000 Hz) for baleen whales and relatively high 
frequency (up to 30 kHz) for odontocetes.
    (iv) Acoustic data collected from the PAM shall be used to detect 
acoustically active marine mammals as appropriate.
    (3) Marine Mammal Observers on range craft or Navy vessels:
    (i) Navy Marine mammal observers (NMMOs) may be placed on a range 
craft or Navy platform during the event being monitored.
    (ii) The NMMO must possess expertise in species identification of 
regional marine mammal species and experience collecting behavioral 
data.
    (iii) NMMOs may be placed alongside existing lookouts during the two 
specified monitoring events as described in Sec. 218.174(c)(1)(i).
    (iv) NMMOs shall inform the lookouts of any marine mammal sighting 
so that appropriate action may be taken by the chain of command. NMMOs 
shall schedule their daily observations to duplicate the lookouts' 
schedule.
    (v) NMMOs shall observe from the same height above water as the 
lookouts, and they shall collect the same data collected by lookouts 
listed in Sec. 218.174(c)(1)(iii).
    (d) The Navy shall complete an Integrated Comprehensive Monitoring 
Program (ICMP) Plan in 2009. This planning and adaptive management tool 
shall include:
    (1) A method for prioritizing monitoring projects that clearly 
describes the characteristics of a proposal that factor into its 
priority.
    (2) A method for annually reviewing, with NMFS, monitoring results, 
Navy R&D, and current science to use for potential modification of 
mitigation or monitoring methods.
    (3) A detailed description of the Monitoring Workshop to be convened 
in 2011 and how and when Navy/NMFS will subsequently utilize the 
findings of the Monitoring Workshop to potentially modify subsequent 
monitoring and mitigation.
    (4) An adaptive management plan.
    (5) A method for standardizing data collection for NAVSEA NUWC 
Keyport Range Complex Extension and across range complexes.
    (e) Notification of Injured or Dead Marine Mammals--Navy personnel 
shall ensure that NMFS (regional stranding coordinator) is notified 
immediately (or as soon as clearance procedures allow) if an injured or 
dead marine mammal is found during or shortly after, and in the vicinity 
of, any Navy activities utilizing sonar. The Navy shall provide NMFS 
with species or description of the animal(s), the condition of the 
animal(s) (including carcass condition if the animal is dead), location, 
time of first discovery, observed behaviors (if alive), and photo or 
video (if available).
    (f) Annual Keyport Range Complex Monitoring Plan Report--The Navy 
shall submit a report annually by December 1 describing the 
implementation and results (through September 1 of the same year) of the 
Keyport Range Complex Monitoring Plan. Data collection methods will be 
standardized across range complexes to allow for comparison in different 
geographic locations. Although additional information will also be 
gathered, the NMMOs collecting marine mammal data pursuant to the 
Keyport Range Complex Monitoring Plan shall, at a minimum, provide the 
same marine mammal observation data required in Sec. 218.174(c).

[[Page 240]]

The Keyport Range Complex Monitoring Plan Report may be provided to NMFS 
within a larger report that includes the required Monitoring Plan 
Reports from Keyport Range Complex and multiple range complexes.
    (g) Keyport Range Complex 5-yr Comprehensive Report--The Navy shall 
submit to NMFS a draft comprehensive report that analyzes and summarizes 
all of the multi-year marine mammal information gathered during tests 
involving active acoustic sources for which individual reports are 
required in Sec. 218.174 (d)-(f). This report will be submitted at the 
end of the fourth year of the rule (June 2013), covering activities that 
have occurred through September 1, 2013.
    (h) The Navy shall respond to NMFS comments and requests for 
additional information or clarification on the Keyport Range Complex 
Extension Comprehensive Report, the Annual Keyport Range Complex 
Monitoring Plan Report (or the multi-Range Complex Annual Monitoring 
Report, it that is how the Navy chooses to submit the information) if 
submitted within 3 months of receipt. The report will be considered 
final after the Navy has addressed NMFS' comments, or three months after 
the submittal of the draft if NMFS does not comment by then.
    (i) In 2011, the Navy shall convene a Monitoring Workshop in which 
the Monitoring Workshop participants will be asked to review the Navy's 
Monitoring Plans and monitoring results and make individual 
recommendations (to the Navy and NMFS) of ways of improving the 
Monitoring Plans. The recommendations shall be reviewed by the Navy, in 
consultation with NMFS, and modifications to the Monitoring Plan shall 
be made, as appropriate.

for the activities identified in Sec. 218.170(c), the U.S. Navy must 
apply for and obtain either an initial Letter of Authorization in 
accordance with Sec. 218.176 or a renewal under Sec. 218.177.


<R05>
Sec. 218.176  Letters of Authorization.

    (a) A Letter of Authorization, unless suspended or revoked, will be 
valid for a period of time not to exceed the period of validity of this 
subpart, but may be renewed or modified sooner subject to the renewal 
conditions in Sec. 218.177 and the modification conditions in Sec. 
218.178.
    (b) Each Letter of Authorization will set forth:
    (1) Permissible methods of incidental taking;
    (2) Means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on the 
species, its habitat, and on the availability of the species for 
subsistence uses (i.e., mitigation); and
    (3) Requirements for mitigation, monitoring and reporting.
    (c) Issuance and renewal of the Letter of Authorization will be 
based on a determination that the total number of marine mammals taken 
by the activity as a whole will have no more than a negligible impact on 
the affected species or stock of marine mammal(s).

<R05>
Sec. 218.183  Mitigation.

    When conducting RDT&E activities identified in Sec. 218.180(c), the 
mitigation measures contained in this subpart and subsequent Letters of 
Authorization issued under Sec. Sec. 216.106 of this chapter and Sec. 
218.186 must be implemented. These mitigation measures include, but are 
not limited to:
    (a) Mitigation Measures for HFAS/MFAS Operations: (1) Personnel 
Training: (i) All marine observers onboard platforms involved in NSWC 
PCD RDT&E activities shall complete Marine Species Awareness Training 
(MSAT).
    (ii) Marine observers shall be trained in the most effective means 
to ensure quick and effective communication within the command structure 
in order to facilitate implementation of mitigation measures if marine 
species are spotted.
    (2) Marine Observer Responsibilities:
    (i) On the bridge of surface vessels, there shall always be at least 
one to three marine species awareness trained observer(s) on watch whose 
duties include observing the water surface around the vessel.
    (A) For vessels with length under 65 ft (20 m), there shall always 
be at least one marine observer on watch.
    (B) For vessels with length between 65-200 ft (20-61 m), there shall 
always be at least two marine observers on watch.
    (C) For vessels with length above 200 ft (61 m), there shall always 
be at least three marine observers on watch.
    (ii) Each marine observer shall have at their disposal at least one 
set of binoculars available to aid in the detection of marine mammals.
    (iii) On surface vessels equipped with AN/SQQ-53C/56, pedestal 
mounted ``Big Eye'' (20 x 110) binoculars shall be present and in good 
working order to assist in the detection of marine mammals in the 
vicinity of the vessel.
    (iv) Marine observers shall employ visual search procedures 
employing a scanning methodology in accordance with the Lookout Training 
Handbook (NAVEDTRA 12968-D).

[[Page 245]]

    (v) Marine observers shall scan the water from the vessel to the 
horizon and be responsible for ensuring that all contacts in their 
sector follow the below protocols:
    (A) In searching the assigned sector, the marine observer shall 
always start at the forward part of the sector and search aft (toward 
the back).
    (B) To search and scan, the marine observer shall hold the 
binoculars steady so the horizon is in the top third of the field of 
vision and direct the eyes just below the horizon.
    (C) The marine observer shall scan for approximately five seconds in 
as many small steps as possible across the field seen through the 
binoculars.
    (D) The marine observer shall search the entire sector in 
approximately five-degree steps, pausing between steps for approximately 
five seconds to scan the field of view.
    (E) At the end of the sector search, the glasses would be lowered to 
allow the eyes to rest for a few seconds, and then the marine observer 
shall search back across the sector with the naked eye.
    (vi) After sunset and prior to sunrise, marine observers shall 
employ Night Lookout Techniques in accordance with the Lookout Training 
Handbook.
    (vii) At night, marine observers shall scan the horizon in a series 
of movements that would allow their eyes to come to periodic rests as 
they scan the sector. When visually searching at night, marine observers 
shall look a little to one side and out of the corners of their eyes, 
paying attention to the things on the outer edges of their field of 
vision.
    (viii) Marine observers shall be responsible for reporting all 
objects or anomalies sighted in the water (regardless of the distance 
from the vessel) to the Test Director or the Test Director's designee.
    (3) Operating Procedures:
    (i) The Test Director or the Test Director's designee shall maintain 
the logs and records documenting RDT&E activities should they be 
required for event reconstruction purposes. Logs and records will be 
kept for a period of 30 days following completion of a RDT&E mission 
activity.
    (ii) A Record of Environmental Consideration shall be included in 
the Test Plan prior to the test event to further disseminate the 
personnel testing requirement and general marine mammal mitigation 
measures.
    (iii) Test Directors shall make use of marine species detection cues 
and information to limit interaction with marine species to the maximum 
extent possible consistent with safety of the vessel.
    (iv) All personnel engaged in passive acoustic sonar operation 
(including aircraft or surface vessels) shall monitor for marine mammal 
vocalizations and report the detection of any marine mammal to the Test 
Director or the Test Director's designee for dissemination and 
appropriate action.
    (v) During HFAS/MFAS mission activities, personnel shall utilize all 
available sensor and optical systems (such as Night Vision Goggles) to 
aid in the detection of marine mammals.
    (vi) Navy aircraft participating in RDT&E activities at sea shall 
conduct and maintain surveillance for marine species of concern as long 
as it does not violate safety constraints or interfere with the 
accomplishment of primary operational duties.
    (vii) Marine mammal detections shall be immediately reported to the 
Test Director or the Test Director's designee for further dissemination 
to vessels in the vicinity of the marine species as appropriate where it 
is reasonable to conclude that the course of the vessel will likely 
result in a closing of the distance to the detected marine mammal.
    (viii) Safety Zones--When marine mammals are detected by any means 
(aircraft, shipboard marine observer, or acoustically) the Navy will 
ensure that HFAS/MFAS transmission levels are limited to at least 6 dB 
below normal operating levels if any detected marine mammals are within 
1,000 yards (914 m) of the sonar source (the bow).
    (A) Vessels shall continue to limit maximum HFAS/MFAS transmission 
levels by this 6-dB factor until the marine mammal has been seen to 
leave the area, has not been detected for 30 minutes, or the vessel has 
transited more than 2,000 yards (1,828 m) beyond the location of the 
last detection.

[[Page 246]]

    (B) The Navy shall ensure that HFAS/MFAS transmissions will be 
limited to at least 10 dB below the equipment's normal operating level 
if any detected animals are within 500 yards (457 m) of the sonar 
source. Vessels will continue to limit maximum ping levels by this 10-dB 
factor until the marine mammal has been seen to leave the area, has not 
been detected for 30 minutes, or the vessel has transited more than 
2,000 yards (1,828 m) beyond the location of the last detection.
    (C) The Navy shall ensure that HFAS/MFAS transmissions are ceased if 
any detected marine mammals are within 200 yards (183 m) of the sonar 
source. HFAS/MFAS will not resume until the marine mammal has been seen 
to leave the area, has not been detected for 30 minutes, or the vessel 
has transited more than 2,000 yards (1,828 m) beyond the location of the 
last detection.
    (D) Special conditions applicable for dolphins only: If, after 
conducting an initial maneuver to avoid close quarters with dolphins, 
the Officer of the Deck concludes that dolphins are deliberately closing 
to ride the vessel's bow wave, no further mitigation actions are 
necessary while the dolphins continue to exhibit bow wave riding 
behavior.
    (E) If the need for power-down should arise as detailed in ``Safety 
Zones'' above, Navy shall follow the requirements as though they were 
operating at 235 dB--the normal operating level (i.e., the first power-
down will be to 229 dB, regardless of at what level above 235 sonar was 
being operated).
    (ix) Prior to start up or restart of active sonar, operators will 
check that the Safety Zone radius around the sound source is clear of 
marine mammals.
    (x) Sonar levels (generally)--Navy shall operate sonar at the lowest 
practicable level, not to exceed 235 dB, except as required to meet 
RDT&E objectives.
    (b) Mitigation Measures for Ordnance and Projectile Firing: (1) No 
detonations over 34 kg (75 lb) shall be conducted in territorial waters, 
except the line charge detonation, which is a 107 m (350 ft).
    (2) The number of live mine detonations shall be minimized and the 
smallest amount of explosive material possible to achieve test 
objectives will be used.
    (3) Activities shall be coordinated through the Environmental Help 
Desk to allow potential concentrations of detonations in a particular 
area over a short time to be identified and avoided.
    (4) Visual surveys and aerial surveys of the clearance zones 
specified in Sec. 218.183(b)(6)(i) through (iii) shall be conducted in 
accordance with Sec. 218.184(c) for all test operations that involve 
detonation events with large net explosive weight (NEW). Any protected 
species sighted will be reported.
    (5) Line charge tests shall not be conducted during the nighttime.
    (6) Additional mitigation measures shall be determined through the 
NSWC PCD's Environmental Review Process based on test activities 
including the size of detonations, test platforms, and environmental 
effects documented in the Navy's EIS/OEIS. Clearance zones must be 
determined based on the upper limit of different ranges of net explosive 
weight (NEW) used in the tests, as listed below:
    (i) NEW between 76-600 lb: clearance zone is 2,863 m (9,393 ft);
    (ii) NEW between 11-75 lb: clearance zone is 997 m (2,865 ft); and
    (iii) NEW less than 11 lb--clearance zone is 345 m (1,132 ft).
    (c) Mitigation Measures for Surface Operations: (1) While underway, 
vessels shall have at least one to three marine species awareness 
trained observers (based on vessel length) with binoculars. As part of 
their regular duties, marine observers shall watch for and report to the 
Test Director or Test Director's designee the presence of marine 
mammals.
    (i) For vessels with length under 65 ft (20 m), there shall always 
be at least one marine observer on watch.
    (ii) For vessels with length between 65-200 ft (20-61 m), there 
shall always be at least two marine observers on watch.
    (iii) For vessels with length above 200 ft (61 m), there shall 
always be at least three marine observers on watch.
    (2) Marine observers shall employ visual search procedures employing 
a scanning method in accordance with

[[Page 247]]

the Lookout Training Handbook (NAVEDTRA 12968-D).
    (3) While in transit, naval vessels shall be alert at all times, use 
extreme caution, and proceed at a ``safe speed'' (the minimum speed at 
which mission goals or safety will not be compromised) so that the 
vessel can take proper and effective action to avoid a collision with 
any marine animal and can be stopped within a distance appropriate to 
the prevailing circumstances and conditions.
    (4) When marine mammals have been sighted in the area, Navy vessels 
shall increase vigilance and shall implement measures to avoid 
collisions with marine mammals and avoid activities that might result in 
close interaction of naval assets and marine mammals. Actions shall 
include changing speed and/or direction and are dictated by 
environmental and other conditions (e.g., safety, weather).
    (5) Naval vessels shall maneuver to keep at least 500 yd (460 m) 
away from any observed whale and avoid approaching whales head-on. This 
requirement does not apply if a vessel's safety is threatened, such as 
when change of course will create an imminent and serious threat to a 
person, vessel, or aircraft, and to the extent vessels are restricted in 
their ability to maneuver. Vessels shall take reasonable steps to alert 
other Navy vessels in the vicinity of the whale.
    (6) Where operationally feasible and safe, vessels shall avoid 
closing to within 200-yd (183 m) of marine mammals other than whales.

Sec. 218.184  Requirements for monitoring and reporting.

    (a) The Holder of the Letter of Authorization issued pursuant to 
Sec. Sec. 216.106 and 218.186 for activities described in Sec. 
218.180(c) is required to cooperate with the NMFS when monitoring the 
impacts of the activity on marine mammals.
    (b) The Holder of the Authorization must notify NMFS immediately (or 
as soon as clearance procedures allow) if the specified activity 
identified in Sec. 218.180(c) is thought to have resulted in the 
mortality or injury of any marine mammals, or in any take of marine 
mammals not identified or authorized in Sec. 218.181(b).
    (c) The Holder of the Letter of Authorization must conduct all 
monitoring and required reporting under the Letter of Authorization, 
including abiding by the NSWC PCD Study Area Complex Monitoring Plan, 
which is incorporated herein by reference, and which requires the Navy 
to implement, at a minimum, the monitoring activities summarized below.
    (1) Visual Surveys--Vessel, Aerial and Shore-based: The Holder of 
this Authorization shall visually survey a minimum of 2 HFAS/MFAS 
activities and 2 explosive events per year. If the 53C sonar was being 
operated, such activity must be monitored as one of the HFAS/MFAS 
activities. For explosive events, one of the monitoring measures shall 
be focused on a multiple detonation event.
    (i) In accordance with all safety considerations, observations shall 
be maximized by working from all available platforms: Vessels, aircraft, 
land and/or in combination.
    (ii) Vessel and aerial surveys shall be conducted two days before, 
during, and one to five days after the NSWC PCD mission activities on 
commercial vessels and aircraft.
    (iii) Visual surveys shall be conducted during Navy mission 
activities that have been identified to provide the highest likelihood 
of success.
    (iv) The visual survey team shall collect the same data that are 
collected by Navy marine observers, including but not limited to:
    (A) Location of sighting;
    (B) Species (or to the lowest taxa possible);
    (C) Number of individuals;
    (D) Number of calves present, if any;
    (E) Duration of sighting;
    (F) Behavior of marine animals sighted;
    (G) Direction of travel;
    (H) Environmental information associated with sighting event 
including Beaufort sea state, wave height, swell direction, wind 
direction, wind speed, glare, percentage of glare, percentage of cloud 
cover; and
    (I) When in relation to Navy exercises did the sighting occur 
(before, during or after detonations/exercise).

[[Page 248]]

    (v) Animal sightings and relative distance from a particular 
activity site shall be used post survey to estimate the number of marine 
mammals exposed to different received levels (energy and pressure of 
discharge based on distance to the source, bathymetry, oceanographic 
conditions and the type and size of detonation) and their corresponding 
behavior.
    (vi) Any digital photographs that are taken of marine mammals during 
visual surveys shall be provided to local researchers for their regional 
research.
    (vii) The Holder of the Letter of Authorization shall, when 
conducting RDT&E activities in the NSWC PCD Study Area, implement the 
following monitoring methods:
    (A) Aerial surveys:
    (1) During NSWC PCD sonar related mission activities, an aerial 
survey team shall fly transects relative to a Navy surface vessel that 
is conducting the mission activities.
    (2) The aerial survey team shall collect both visual sightings and 
behavioral observations of marine animals.
    (3) These transect data shall provide an opportunity to collect data 
of marine mammals at different received levels and their behavioral 
responses and movement relative to the Navy vessel's position.
    (4) Aerial surveys shall include time with and without test events 
in order to compare density, geographical distribution and behavioral 
observations.
    (5) Behavioral observation methods shall involve three 
professionally trained marine mammal observers and a pilot. Two 
observers shall observe behaviors, one with hand-held binoculars and one 
with the naked eye.
    (6) Detailed behavioral focal observations of cetaceans shall be 
recorded including the following variables where possible: species (or 
to the lowest taxa possible), group size and composition (number of 
calves, etc.), latitude/longitude, surface and dive durations and times, 
number and spacing/times of respirations, conspicuous behaviors (e.g., 
breach, tail slap, etc.), behavioral states, orientation and changes in 
orientation, estimated group travel speed, inter-individual distances, 
defecation, social interactions, aircraft speed, aircraft altitude, 
distance to focal group (using the plane's radar) and any unusual 
behaviors or apparent reactions.
    (B) Vessel Surveys:
    (1) Vessel surveys shall be designed to maximize detections of any 
target species near mission activity event for focal follows.
    (2) Systematic transects shall be used to locate marine mammals. In 
the course of conducting these surveys, the vessel(s) shall deviate from 
transect protocol to collect behavioral data particularly if a Navy 
vessel is visible on the horizon or closer.
    (3) While the Navy vessels are within view, attempts shall be made 
to position the dedicated survey vessel in the best possible way to 
obtain focal follow data in the presence of the Navy mission activities. 
If Navy vessels are not in view, then the vessel shall begin a 
systematic line transect surveys within the area to assess marine mammal 
occurrence and observe behavior.
    (4) Post-analysis shall focus on how the location, speed and vector 
of the survey vessel and the location and direction of the sonar source 
(e.g. Navy surface vessel) relates to the animal.
    (5) Any other vessels or aircraft observed in the area shall also be 
documented.
    (C) Shore-based Surveys:
    (1) Shore-based monitors shall observe explosive events that are 
planned in advance to occur adjacent to nearshore areas where there are 
elevated coastal structures (e.g. lookout tower at Eglin Air Force Base) 
or topography, and shall use binoculars or theodolite to augment other 
visual survey methods.
    (2) Shore-based surveys of the detonation area and nearby beaches 
shall be conducted for stranded marine animals following nearshore 
events. If any distressed, injured or stranded animals are observed, an 
assessment of the animal's condition (alive, injured, dead, or degree of 
decomposition) shall be reported immediately to the Navy for appropriate 
action and the information shall be transmitted immediately to NMFS.
    (3) If animals are observed prior to or during an explosion, a focal 
follow of that individual or group shall be conducted to record 
behavioral responses.

[[Page 249]]

    (2) Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM): The Holder of this 
Authorization shall visually survey a minimum of 2 HFAS/MFAS activities 
and 2 explosive events per year. If the 53C sonar was being operated, 
such activity must be monitored as one of the HFAS/MFAS activities. For 
explosive events, one of the monitoring measures shall be focused on a 
multiple detonation event.
    (i) The Navy shall use towed or over-the-side passive acoustic 
monitoring device/hydrophone array when feasible in the NSWC PCD Study 
Area for PAM.
    (ii) The array shall be deployed for each of the days the ship is at 
sea.
    (iii) The array shall be able to detect low frequency vocalizations 
(less than 1,000 Hz) for baleen whales and relatively high frequency 
vocalizations (up to 30 kHz) for odontocetes.
    (iv) These buoys shall be left in place for a long enough duration 
(e.g. months) that data are collected before, during and outside of 
mission activities.
    (v) Acoustic data collected from the buoys shall be used in order to 
detect, locate, and potentially track calling whales/dolphins.
    (3) Marine Mammal Observers (MMOs) on Navy vessels:
    (i) Civilian MMOs aboard Navy vessels shall be used to research the 
effectiveness of Navy marine observers, as well as for data collection 
during other monitoring surveys.
    (ii) MMOs shall be field-experienced observers that are Navy 
biologists or contracted observers.
    (iii) MMOs shall be placed alongside existing Navy marine observers 
during a sub-set of RDT&E events.
    (iv) MMOs shall inform the Navy marine observer of any marine mammal 
sighting so that appropriate action may be taken by the chain of 
command. For less biased data, it is recommended that MMOs schedule 
their daily observations to duplicate the marine observers' schedule.
    (v) MMOs shall monitor for marine mammals from the same height above 
water as the Navy marine observers (e.g. bridge wings) and as all visual 
survey teams, and they shall collect the same data collected by Navy 
marine observers, including but not limited to:
    (A) Location of sighting;
    (B) Species;
    (C) Number of individuals;
    (D) Number of calves present, if any;
    (E) Duration of sighting;
    (F) Behavior of marine animals sighted;
    (G) Direction of travel;
    (H) Environmental information associated with sighting event 
including Beaufort sea state, wave height, swell direction, wind 
direction, wind speed, glare, percentage of glare, percentage of cloud 
cover; and
    (I) When in relation to Navy RDT&E activities did the sighting occur 
(before, during or after detonations/exercise).
    (d) General Notification of Injured or Dead Marine Mammals--Navy 
personnel shall ensure that NMFS (regional stranding coordinator) is 
notified immediately (or as soon as clearance procedures allow) if an 
injured or dead marine mammal is found during or shortly after, and in 
the vicinity of, any Navy's RDT&E activities utilizing underwater 
explosive detonations. The Navy shall provide NMFS with species or 
description of the animal(s), the condition of the animal(s) (including 
carcass condition if the animal is dead), location, time of first 
discovery, observed behaviors (if alive), and photo or video (if 
available).
    (e) If there is clear evidence that a marine mammal is injured or 
killed as a result of the proposed Navy RDT&E activities (e.g., 
instances in which it is clear that munitions explosions caused the 
injury or death) the Naval activities shall be immediately suspended and 
the situation immediately reported by personnel involved in the activity 
to the Test Director or the Test Director's designee, who will follow 
Navy procedures for reporting the incident to NMFS through the Navy's 
chain-of-command.
    (f) Annual NSWC PCD Report--The Navy shall submit a report annually 
on October 1 describing the RDT&E activities conducted and 
implementation and results of the NSWC PCD Monitoring Plan (through 
August 1 of the same year) and RDT&E activities. Although additional 
information will also be gathered, the MMOs collecting marine mammal 
data pursuant to the NSWC

terms, conditions, and requirements of these regulations and the 
appropriate Letter of Authorization.
    (b) The Holder of the Letter of Authorization must conduct the 
activities identified in Sec. 218.230 in a manner that minimizes, to 
the greatest extent practicable, any adverse impacts on marine mammals 
and their habitat.
    (c) The incidental take of marine mammals under the activities 
identified in Sec. 218.230 is limited to the species listed in Sec. 
218.230(b) by the method of take indicated in paragraphs (c)(2) through

    (1) The Navy must maintain a running calculation/estimation of takes 
of each species over the effective period of these regulations.
    (2) Level B harassment will not exceed 12 percent of any marine 
mammal stock listed in Sec. 218.230(b)(1) through (3) annually over the 
course of the five-

[[Page 254]]

year regulations. This annual per-stock cap of 12 percent applies 
regardless of the number of SURTASS LFA sonar vessels operating.
    (3) Level A harassment of no more than six mysticetes (total), of 
any of the species listed in Sec. 218.230(b)(1) over the course of the 
five-year regulations.
    (4) Level A harassment of no more than 25 odontocetes (total), of 
any of the species listed in Sec. 218.230(b)(2) over the course of the 
five-year regulations.
    (5) Level A harassment of no more than 25 pinnipeds (total), of any

five-year regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 218.233  Prohibitions.

    No person in connection with the activities described in Sec. 
218.230 may:
    (a) Take any marine mammal not specified in Sec. 218.230(b);
    (b) Take any marine mammal specified in Sec. 218.230 other than by 
incidental take as specified in Sec. 218.232(c)(2) through (5);
    (c) Take any marine mammal specified in Sec. 218.230 if NMFS makes 
a determination that such taking results in more than a negligible 
impact on the species or stocks of such marine mammal; or
    (d) Violate, or fail to comply with, any of the terms, conditions, 
or requirements of these regulations or a Letter of Authorization issued 
under Sec. Sec. 216.106 and 218.238 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 218.234  Mitigation.

    When conducting operations identified in Sec. 218.230, the 
mitigation measures described in this section and in any Letter of 
Authorization issued under Sec. Sec. 216.106 and 218.238 must be 
implemented.
    (a) Personnel Training--Lookouts: (1) The Navy shall train the 
lookouts in the most effective means to ensure quick and effective 
communication within the command structure in order to facilitate 
implementation of protective measures if they spot marine mammals.
    (2) The Navy will hire one or more marine mammal biologists 
qualified in conducting at-sea marine mammal visual monitoring from 
surface vessels to train and qualify designated ship personnel to 
conduct at-sea visual monitoring.
    (b) General Operating Procedures: (1) Prior to SURTASS LFA sonar 
operations, the Navy will promulgate executive guidance for the 
administration, execution, and compliance with these regulations and any 
Letters of Authorization issued.
    (2) The Holder of a Letter of Authorization will not transmit the 
SURTASS LFA sonar signal at a frequency greater than 500 Hertz (Hz).
    (c) LFA Sonar Mitigation Zone and 1-km Buffer Zone; Suspension and 
Delay: (1) Prior to commencing and during SURTASS LFA sonar 
transmissions, the Holder of a Letter of Authorization will determine 
the propagation of LFA sonar signals in the ocean and the distance from 
the SURTASS LFA sonar source to the 180-decibel (dB) re: 1 [micro]Pa 
isopleth.
    (2) The Holder of a Letter of Authorization will establish a 180-dB 
LFA sonar mitigation zone around the surveillance vessel that is equal 
in size to the 180-dB re: 1 [micro]Pa isopleth (i.e., the volume 
subjected to sound pressure levels of 180 dB or greater) as well as a 
one-kilometer (1-km) buffer zone around the LFA sonar mitigation zone.
    (3) If a marine mammal is detected, through monitoring required 
under Sec. 218.235, within or about to enter the LFA sonar mitigation 
zone plus the 1-km buffer zone, the Holder of the Letter of 
Authorization will immediately delay or suspend SURTASS LFA sonar 
transmissions.
    (d) Resumption of SURTASS LFA sonar transmissions: (1) The Holder of 
a Letter of Authorization will not resume SURTASS LFA sonar 
transmissions earlier than 15 minutes after:
    (i) All marine mammals have left the area of the SURTASS LFA sonar 
mitigation and buffer zones; and
    (ii) There is no further detection of any marine mammal within the 
LFA sonar mitigation and buffer zones as determined by the visual, 
passive, and high frequency monitoring described in Sec. 218.235.
    (e) Ramp-up Procedures for the high-frequency marine mammal 
monitoring (HF/M3) sonar required under Sec. 218.235: (1) The Holder of 
a Letter of Authorization will ramp up the HF/M3 sonar

[[Page 255]]

power level beginning at a maximum source sound pressure level of 180 dB 
re: 1 [micro]Pa at 1 meter in 10-dB increments to operating levels over 
a period of no less than five minutes:
    (i) At least 30 minutes prior to any SURTASS LFA sonar 
transmissions;
    (ii) Prior to any SURTASS LFA sonar calibrations or testing that are 
not part of regular SURTASS LFA sonar transmissions described in Sec. 
218.230; and
    (iii) Anytime after the HF/M3 active sonar source has been powered 
down for more than two minutes.
    (2) The Holder of a Letter of Authorization will not increase the 
HF/M3 active sonar system's sound pressure level once a marine mammal is 
detected; ramp-up may resume once marine mammals are no longer detected.
    (f) Geographic Restrictions on the SURTASS LFA Sonar Sound Field: 
(1) The Holder of a Letter of Authorization will not operate the SURTASS 
LFA sonar such that:
    (i) The SURTASS LFA sonar sound field exceeds 180 dB re: 1 [micro]Pa 
(rms) at a distance less than 12 nautical miles (nm) (22 kilometers 
(km)) from any coastline, including offshore islands;
    (ii) The SURTASS LFA sonar sound field exceeds 180 dB re: 1 
[micro]Pa (rms) at a distance less than 1 km (0.5 nm) seaward of the 
outer perimeter of any offshore biologically important area designated 
in Sec. 218.234(f)(2) during the period specified.
    (2) The Offshore Biologically Important Areas (OBIAs) for marine 
mammals (with specified periods) for SURTASS LFA sonar operations are 
the following:

transmission;
    (2) Continue between transmission pings; and
    (3) Continue either for at least 15 minutes after completion of the 
SURTASS LFA sonar transmission exercise or, if marine mammals are 
exhibiting unusual changes in behavioral patterns, for a period of time 
until behavior patterns return to normal or conditions prevent continued 
observations.
    (c) Holders of Letters of Authorization for activities described in 
Sec. 218.230 are required to cooperate with the National Marine 
Fisheries Service and any other federal agency for monitoring the 
impacts of the activity on marine mammals.
    (d) Holders of Letters of Authorization must designate qualified on-
site individuals to conduct the mitigation, monitoring and reporting 
activities specified in the Letter of Authorization.
    (e) Holders of Letters of Authorization will continue to assess data 
from the Marine Mammal Monitoring Program and work toward making some 
portion of that data, after appropriate security reviews, available to 
scientists with appropriate clearances. Any portions of the analyses 
conducted by these scientists based on these data that are determined to 
be unclassified after appropriate security reviews will be made 
publically available.
    (f) Holders of Letters of Authorization will continue to explore the 
feasibility of coordinating with other fleet assets and/or range 
monitoring programs to include the use of SURTASS towed horizontal line 
arrays to augment the collection of marine mammal vocalizations before, 
during, and after designated exercises.
    (g) Holders of Letters of Authorization will collect ambient noise 
data and will explore the feasibility of declassifying and archiving the 
ambient noise data for incorporation into appropriate ocean noise budget 
efforts.
    (h) Holders of Letters of Authorization will convene a Scientific 
Advisory Group (SAG) to analyze different types of monitoring/research 
that could increase the understanding of the potential effects of low-
frequency active sonar transmissions on beaked whales and/or harbor 
porpoises.
    (i) Holders of Letters of Authorization must conduct all monitoring 
required under the Letter of Authorization.


<R05>
Sec. 218.236  Requirements for reporting.

    (a) The Holder of the Letter of Authorization must submit classified 
and unclassified quarterly mission reports to the Director, Office of 
Protected Resources, NMFS, no later than 30 days after the end of each 
quarter beginning on the date of effectiveness of a Letter of 
Authorization or as specified in the appropriate Letter of 
Authorization. Each quarterly mission report will include all active-
mode missions completed during that quarter. At a minimum, each 
classified mission report must contain the following information:
    (1) Dates, times, and location of each vessel during each mission;
    (2) Information on sonar transmissions during each mission;
    (3) Results of the marine mammal monitoring program specified in the 
Letter of Authorization; and
    (4) Estimates of the percentages of marine mammal species and stocks 
affected (both for the quarter and cumulatively for the year) covered by 
the Letter of Authorization.
    (b) The Holder of a Letter of Authorization must submit an 
unclassified annual report to the Director, Office of Protected 
Resources, NMFS, no later than 45 days after the expiration of a Letter 
of Authorization. The reports must contain all the information required 
by the Letter of Authorization.
    (c) A final comprehensive report must be submitted to the Director, 
Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, at least 240 days prior to 
expiration of these regulations. In addition to containing all the 
information required by any final year Letter of Authorization, this 
report must contain an unclassified analysis of new passive sonar 
technologies and an assessment of whether such a system is feasible as 
an alternative to SURTASS LFA sonar.

[[Page 260]]

    (d) The Navy will continue to assess the data collected by its 
undersea arrays and work toward making some portion of that data, after 
appropriate security reviews, available to scientists with appropriate 
clearances. Any portions of the analyses conducted by these scientists 
based on these data that are determined to be unclassified after 
appropriate security reviews will be made publically available. The Navy 
will provide a status update to NMFS when they submit their annual 
application.
    (e) Following the Scientific Advisory Group's (SAG) submission of 
findings, and assuming the SAG recommends going forward with beaked 
whale and/or harbor porpoise monitoring/research, the Navy will either:
    (1) Draft a plan of action outlining their strategy for implementing 
the SAG's recommendations; or
    (2) Describe in writing why none of the SAG's recommendations are 
feasible and meet with NMFS to discuss any other potential options.

                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 221.1  What is the purpose of this part, and to what license 
proceedings does it apply?

    (a) Hearing process. (1) The regulations in subparts A and B of this 
part contain rules of practice and procedure applicable to hearings on 
disputed issues of material fact with respect to

[[Page 263]]

mandatory prescriptions that the Department of Commerce, acting through 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine 
Fisheries Service (NMFS) may develop for inclusion in a hydropower 
license issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) under 
subchapter I of the Federal Power Act (FPA), 16 U.S.C. 791 et seq. The 
authority to develop these prescriptions is granted by FPA section 18, 
16 U.S.C. 811, which authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to prescribe 
fishways.
    (2) The hearing process under this part does not apply to 
recommendations that the Department of Commerce may submit to FERC under 
FPA section 10(a) or (j), 16 U.S.C. 803(a), (j).
    (3) The FPA also grants the Department of Agriculture and Interior 
the authority to develop mandatory conditions, and the Department of the 
Interior the authority to develop mandatory prescriptions, for inclusion 
in a hydropower license. Where the Department of Commerce and either or 
both of these other Departments develop conditions or prescriptions to 
be included in the same hydropower license and where the Departments 
agree to consolidate the hearings under Sec. 221.23:
    (i) A hearing conducted under this part will also address disputed 
issues of material fact with respect to any condition or prescription 
developed by one of the other Departments; or
    (ii) A hearing requested under this part will be conducted by one of 
the other Departments, pursuant to 7 CFR 1.601 et seq. or 43 CFR 45.1 et 
seq., as applicable.
    (4) The regulations in subparts A and B of this part will be 
construed and applied to each hearing process to achieve a just and 
speedy determination, consistent with adequate consideration of the 
issues involved and the provisions of Sec. 221.60(a).
    (b) Alternatives process. The regulations in subparts A and C of 
this part contain rules of procedure applicable to the submission and 
consideration of alternative prescriptions under FPA section 33, 16 
U.S.C. 823d. That section allows any party to the license proceeding to 
propose an alternative to a fishway prescribed by NMFS under section 18.
    (c) Reservation of authority. Where NMFS notifies FERC that it is 
reserving its authority to develop one or more prescriptions during the 
term of the license, the hearing and alternatives processes under this 
part for such prescriptions will be available if and when NMFS exercises 
its reserved authority. NMFS will consult with FERC and notify the 
license parties regarding how to initiate the hearing process and 
alternatives process at that time.
    (d) Applicability. (1) This part applies to any hydropower license 
proceeding for which the license has not been issued as of November 17, 
2005 and for which one or more preliminary prescriptions or 
prescriptions have been or are filed with FERC.
    (2) If NMFS has already filed one or more preliminary prescriptions 
or prescriptions as of November 17, 2005, the special applicability 
provisions of Sec. 221.4 also apply.

Sec. 221.41  How may parties obtain discovery of information needed 
for the case?

    (a) General. By agreement of the parties or with the permission of 
the ALJ, a party may obtain discovery of information to assist the party 
in preparing or presenting its case. Available methods of discovery are:

    (3) Requests for production of designated documents or tangible 
things or for entry on designated land for inspection or other purposes.
    (b) Criteria. Discovery may occur only as agreed to by the parties 
or as authorized by the ALJ in a written order or during a prehearing 
conference. The ALJ may authorize discovery only if the party requesting 
discovery demonstrates:
    (1) That the discovery will not unreasonably delay the hearing 
process;
    (2) That the information sought:
    (i) Will be admissible at the hearing or appears reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence;
    (ii) Is not already in the license proceeding record or otherwise 
obtainable by the party;
    (iii) Is not cumulative or repetitious; and
    (iv) Is not privileged or protected from disclosure by applicable 
law;
    (3) That the scope of the discovery is not unduly burdensome;
    (4) That the method to be used is the least burdensome method 
available;

the discovery;
    (ii) Explains how the discovery meets the criteria in paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section; and

designated documents or tangible things or for entry on designated 
land).

through (b)(6) of this section.
    (f) Materials prepared for hearing. A party generally may not obtain 
discovery of documents and tangible things otherwise discoverable under 
paragraph (b) of this section if they were prepared in anticipation of 
or for the hearing by or for another party's representative (including 
the party's attorney, expert, or consultant).

    (i) That it has substantial need of the materials in preparing its 
own case; and
    (ii) That the party is unable without undue hardship to obtain the

showing has been made, the ALJ must protect against disclosure of the 
mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an 
attorney.
    (g) Experts. Unless restricted by the ALJ, a party may discover any 
facts known or opinions held by an expert concerning any relevant 
matters that are not privileged. Such discovery will be permitted only 
if:

    (2) The expert is relied on by another expert who is expected to be 
a witness at the hearing, and the party shows:
    (i) That it has a compelling need for the information; and

[[Page 274]]

    (ii) That it cannot practicably obtain the information by other 
means.

other source or by less burdensome means; and
    (ii) That the deposition would not significantly interfere with the 
employee's ability to perform his or her government duties.

25 days after the initial prehearing conference, unless the ALJ sets a 
different deadline.

Sec. 222.103  Federal/state cooperation in the conservation of 
endangered and threatened species.

    (a) Application for and renewal of cooperative agreements. (1) The 
Assistant Administrator may enter into a Cooperative Agreement with any 
state that establishes and maintains an active and adequate program for 
the conservation of resident species listed as endangered or threatened. 
In order for a state program to be deemed an adequate and active 
program, the Assistant Administrator must find, and annually reconfirm 
that the criteria of either sections 6(c)(1) (A) through (E) or sections 
6(c)(1) (i) and (ii) of the Act have been satisfied.
    (2) Following receipt of an application by a state for a Cooperative 
Agreement with a copy of a proposed state program, and a determination 
by the Assistant Administrator that the state program is adequate and 
active, the Assistant Administrator shall enter into an Agreement with 
the state.
    (3) The Cooperative Agreement, as well as the Assistant 
Administrator's finding upon which it is based, must be reconfirmed 
annually to ensure that it reflects new laws, species lists, rules or 
regulations, and programs and to demonstrate that it is still adequate 
and active.
    (b) Allocation and availability of funds. (1) The Assistant 
Administrator shall allocate funds, appropriated for the purpose of 
carrying out section 6 of the Act, to various states using the following 
as the basis for the determination:
    (i) The international commitments of the United States to protect 
endangered or threatened species;
    (ii) The readiness of a state to proceed with a conservation program 
consistent with the objectives and purposes of the Act;
    (iii) The number of federally listed endangered and threatened 
species within a state;
    (iv) The potential for restoring endangered and threatened species 
within a state; and
    (v) The relative urgency to initiate a program to restore and 
protect an endangered or threatened species in terms of survival of the 
species.
    (2) Funds allocated to a state are available for obligation during 
the fiscal year for which they are allocated and until the close of the 
succeeding fiscal year. Obligation of allocated funds occurs when an 
award or contract is signed by the Assistant Administrator.
    (c) Financial assistance and payments. (1) A state must enter into a 
Cooperative Agreement before financial assistance is approved by the 
Assistant Administrator for endangered or threatened species projects. 
Specifically, the Agreement must contain the actions that are to be 
taken by the Assistant Administrator and/or by the state, the benefits 
to listed species expected to be derived from these actions, and the 
estimated cost of these actions.
    (2) Subsequent to such Agreement, the Assistant Administrator may 
further agree with a state to provide financial assistance in the 
development and implementation of acceptable projects for the 
conservation of endangered and threatened species. Documents to provide 
financial assistance will consist of an application for Federal 
assistance and an award or a contract. The availability of Federal funds 
shall be contingent upon the continued existence of the Cooperative 
Agreement and compliance with all applicable Federal regulations for 
grant administration and cost accounting principles.
    (3)(i) The payment of the Federal share of costs incurred when 
conducting activities included under a contract or award shall not 
exceed 75 percent of the program costs as stated in the agreement. 
However, the Federal share may be increased to 90 percent when two or 
more states having a common interest in one or more endangered or 
threatened resident species, the conservation of which may be enhanced 
by cooperation of such states, jointly enter into an agreement with the 
Assistant Administrator.
    (ii) The state share of program costs may be in the form of cash or 
in-kind contributions, including real property, subject to applicable 
Federal regulations.

[[Page 290]]

    (4) Payments of funds, including payment of such preliminary costs 
and expenses as may be incurred in connection with projects, shall not 
be made unless all necessary or required documents are first submitted 
to and approved by the Assistant Administrator. Payments shall only be 
made for expenditures reported and certified by the state agency. 
Payments shall be made only to the state office or official designated 
by the state agency and authorized under the laws of the state to 
receive public funds for the state.

    (c) Any violation of the applicable provisions of parts 222, 223, or 
224 of this chapter, or of the Act, or of a condition of the certificate 
may subject the certificate holder to penalties provided in the Act and 
to suspension, revocation, or modification of the Certificate of 
Exemption, as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.


<R05>
Sec. 222.204  Administration of certificates.

    (a) The Certificate of Exemption covers the business or activity 
specified in the Certificate of Exemption at the address described 
therein. No Certificate of Exemption is required to cover a separate 
warehouse facility used by the certificate holder solely for storage of 
pre-Act endangered species parts, if the records required by this 
subpart are maintained at the address specified in the Certificate of 
Exemption served by the warehouse or storage facility.
    (b) Certificates of Exemption issued under this subpart are not 
transferable. However, in the event of the lease, sale, or other 
transfer of the operations or activity authorized by the Certificate of 
Exemption, the successor is not required to obtain a new Certificate of 
Exemption prior to commencing such operations or activity. In such case, 
the successor will be treated as a purchaser and must comply with the 
record and reporting requirements set forth in Sec. 222.201(d).
    (c) The Certificate of Exemption holder must notify the Assistant 
Administrator, in writing, of any change in address, in trade name of 
the business, or in activity specified in the certificate. The Assistant

and within 30 days of a change in trade name. The certificate with the 
change of address or in trade name must be endorsed by the Assistant 
Administrator, who shall provide an amended certificate to the person to 
whom it was issued. A certificate holder who seeks amendment of a 
certificate may continue all authorized activities while awaiting action 
by the Assistant Administrator.
    (d) A Certificate of Exemption issued under this subpart confers no 
right or privilege to conduct a business or an activity contrary to 
state or other law. Similarly, compliance with the provisions of any 
state or other law affords no immunity under any Federal laws or 
regulations of any other Federal agency.
    (e) Any person authorized to enforce the Act may enter the premises 
of any Certificate of Exemption holder or of any purchaser during 
business hours, including places of storage, for the purpose of 
inspecting or of examining any records or documents and any endangered 
species parts.
    (f) The records pertaining to pre-Act endangered species parts 
prescribed by this subpart shall be in permanent form and shall be 
retained at the address shown on the Certificate of Exemption or at the 
principal address of a purchaser in the manner prescribed by this 
subpart.
    (g)(1) Holders of Certificates of Exemption must maintain records of 
all pre-Act endangered species parts they receive, sell, transfer, 
distribute or dispose of otherwise. Purchasers of pre-Act endangered 
species parts, unless ultimate users, as defined in Sec. 222.201(d), 
must similarly maintain records of all such parts or products they 
receive.
    (2) Such records referred to in paragraph (g)(1) of this section may 
consist of invoices or other commercial records, which must be filed in 
an orderly manner separate from other commercial records maintained and 
be readily available for inspection. Such records must show the name and 
address of the purchaser, seller, or other transferor; show the type, 
quantity, and identity of the part or product; show the date of such 
sale or transfer; and be retained, in accordance with the requirements 
of this subpart, for a period of not less than 3 years following the 
date of sale or transfer. Each pre-Act endangered species part will be 
identified by its number on the updated inventory required to renew a 
Certificate of Exemption.
    (i) Each Certificate of Exemption holder must submit a quarterly 
report (to the address given in the certificate) containing all record 
information required by paragraph (g)(2) of this section, on all 
transfers of pre-Act endangered species parts made in the previous 
calendar quarter, or such other

[[Page 293]]

record information the Assistant Administrator may specify from time to 
time.
    (ii) Quarterly reports are due on January 15, April 15, July 15, and 
October 15.
    (3) The Assistant Administrator may authorize the record information 
to be submitted in a manner other than that prescribed in paragraph 
(g)(2) of this section when the record holder demonstrates that an 
alternate method of reporting is reasonably necessary and will not 
hinder the effective administration or enforcement of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 222.205  Import and export requirements.

    (a) Any fish and wildlife subject to the jurisdiction of the 
National Marine Fisheries Service and is intended for importation into 
or exportation from the United States, shall not be imported or exported 
except at a port(s) designated by the Secretary of the Interior. 
Shellfish and fishery products that are neither endangered nor 
threatened species and that are imported for purposes of human or animal 
consumption or taken in waters under the jurisdiction of the United 
States or on the high seas for recreational purposes are excluded from 
this requirement. The Secretary of the Interior may permit the 
importation or exportation at nondesignated ports in the interest of the 
health or safety of the species for other reasons if the Secretary deems 
it appropriate and consistent with the purpose of facilitating 
enforcement of the Act and reducing the costs thereof. Importers and 
exporters are advised to see 50 CFR part 14 for importation and 
exportation requirements and information.
    (b) No pre-Act endangered species part shall be imported into the 
United States. A Certificate of Exemption issued in accordance with the 
provisions of this subpart confers no right or privilege to import into 
the United States any such part.
    (c)(1) Any person exporting from the United States any pre-Act 
endangered species part must possess a valid Certificate of Exemption 
issued in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. In addition, 
the exporter must provide to the Assistant Administrator, in writing, 
not less than 10 days prior to shipment, the following information: The 
name and address of the foreign consignee, the intended port of 
exportation, and a complete description of the parts to be exported. No 
shipment may be made until these requirements are met by the exporter.
    (2) The exporter must send a copy of the Certificate of Exemption, 
and any endorsements thereto, to the District Director of Customs at the 
port of exportation, which must precede or accompany the shipment in 
order to permit the appropriate inspection prior to lading. Upon 
receipt, the District Director may order such inspection, as deemed 
necessary; the District will clear the merchandise for export, prior to 
the lading of the merchandise. If they are satisfied that the shipment 
is proper and complies with the information contained in the certificate 
and any endorsement thereto. The certificate, and any endorsements, will 
be forwarded to the Chief of the Office of Enforcement for NMFS.
    (3) No pre-Act endangered species part in compliance with the 
requirements of this subpart may be exported except at a port or ports 
designated by the Secretary of the Interior, pursuant to Sec. 222.103.
    (4) Notwithstanding any provision of this subpart, it shall not be 
required that the Assistant Administrator authorizes the transportation 
in interstate or foreign commerce of pre-Act endangered species parts.

    Effective Date Note: At 64 FR 14054, Mar. 23, 1999, part 222 was 
revised, effective Mar. 23, 1999, with the exception of Sec. 222.205, 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (2), which contain information collection and 
recordkeeping requirements and will not become effective until approval 
has been given by the Office of Management and Budget.

Sec. 222.301  General requirements.

    (a)(1) The regulations in this subpart C provide uniform rules and 
procedures for application, issuance, renewal, conditions, and general 
administration of permits issuable pursuant to parts 222, 223, and 224 
of this chapter. While this

[[Page 294]]

section provides generic rules and procedures applicable to all permits, 
other sections may provide more specific rules and procedures with 
respect to certain types of permits. In such cases, the requirements in 
all applicable sections must be satisfied.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Assistant 
Administrator may approve variations from the requirements of parts 222, 
223, and 224 of this chapter when the Assistant Administrator finds that 
an emergency exists and that the proposed variations will not hinder 
effective administration of those parts and will not be unlawful. Other 
sections within parts 222, 223, and 224 of this chapter may allow for a 
waiver or variation of specific requirements for emergency situations, 
upon certain conditions. In such cases, those conditions must be 
satisfied in order for the waiver or variation to be lawful.
    (b) No person shall take, import, export or engage in any other 
prohibited activity involving any species of fish or wildlife under the 
jurisdiction of the Secretary of Commerce that has been determined to be 
endangered under the Act, or that has been determined to be threatened 
and for which the prohibitions of section 9(a)(1) of the Act have been 
applied by regulation, without a valid permit issued pursuant to these 
regulations. The permit shall entitle the person to whom it is issued to 
engage in the activity specified in the permit, subject to the 
limitations of the Act and the regulations in parts 222, 223, and 224 of 
this chapter, for the period stated on the permit, unless sooner 
modified, suspended or revoked.
    (c) Each person intending to engage in an activity for which a 
permit is required by parts 222, 223, and 224 of this chapter or by the 
Act shall, before commencing such activity, obtain a valid permit 
authorizing such activity. Any person who desires to obtain permit 
privileges authorized by parts 222, 223, and 224 of this chapter must 
apply for such permit in accordance with the requirements of these 
sections. If the information required for each specific, permitted 
activity is included, one application may be accepted for all permits 
required, and a single permit may be issued.
    (d)(1) Any permit issued under these regulations must be in the 
possession of the person to whom it is issued (or of an agent of such 
person) while any animal subject to the permit is in the possession of 
such person or agent. Specifically, a person or his/her agent must be in 
possession of a permit during the time of the authorized taking, 
importation, exportation, or of any other act and during the period of 
any transit incident to such taking, importation, exportation, or to any 
other act.
    (2) A duplicate copy of the issued permit must be physically 
attached to the tank, container, package, enclosure, or other means of 
containment, in which the animal is placed for purposes of storage, 
transit, supervision, or care.
    (e) The authorizations on the face of a permit setting forth 
specific times, dates, places, methods of taking, numbers and kinds of 
fish or wildlife, location of activity, authorize certain circumscribed 
transactions, or otherwise permit a specifically limited matter, are to 
be strictly construed and shall not be interpreted to permit similar or 
related matters outside the scope of strict construction.
    (f) Permits shall not be altered, erased, or mutilated, and any 
permit which has been altered, erased, or mutilated shall immediately 
become invalid.
    (g) Any permit issued under parts 222, 223, and 224 of this chapter 
shall be displayed for inspection, upon request, to an authorized 
officer, or to any other person relying upon its existence.
    (h) Permittees may be required to file reports of the activities 
conducted under the permit. Any such reports shall be filed not later 
than March 31 for the preceding calendar year ending December 31, or any 
portion thereof, during which a permit was in force, unless the 
regulations of parts 222, 223, or 224 of this chapter or the provisions 
of the permit set forth other reporting requirements.
    (i) From the date of issuance of the permit, the permittee shall 
maintain complete and accurate records of any taking, possession, 
transportation, sale, purchase, barter, exportation, or importation of 
fish or wildlife pursuant to such permit. Such records shall be

[[Page 295]]

kept current and shall include the names and addresses of persons with 
whom any fish or wildlife has been purchased, sold, bartered, or 
otherwise transferred, and the date of such transaction, and such other 
information as may be required or appropriate. Such records, unless 
otherwise specified, shall be entered in books, legibly written in the 
English language. Such records shall be retained for 5 years from the 
date of issuance of the permit.
    (j) Any person holding a permit pursuant to parts 222, 223, and 224 
of this chapter shall allow the Assistant Administrator to enter the 
permit holder's premises at any reasonable hour to inspect any fish or 
wildlife held or to inspect, audit, or copy any permits, books, or 
records required to be kept by these regulations or by the Act. Such 
person shall display any permit issued pursuant to these regulations or 
to the Act upon request by an authorized officer or by any other person 
relying on its existence.


<R05>
Sec. 222.302  Procedure for obtaining permits.

    (a) Applications must be submitted to the Assistant Administrator, 
by letter containing all necessary information, attachments, 
certification, and signature, as specified by the regulations in parts 
222, 223, and 224 of this chapter, or by the Act. In no case, other than 
for emergencies pursuant to Sec. 222.301(a)(2), will applications be 
accepted either orally or by telephone.
    (b) Applications must be received by the Assistant Administrator at 
least 90 calendar days prior to the date on which the applicant desires 
to have the permit made effective, unless otherwise specified in the 
regulations or guidelines pertaining to a particular permit. The 
National Marine Fisheries Service will attempt to process applications 
deemed sufficient in the shortest possible time, but does not guarantee 
that the permit will be issued 90 days after notice of receipt of the 
application is published in the Federal Register.
    (c)(1) Upon receipt of an insufficiently or improperly executed 
application, the applicant shall be notified of the deficiency in the 
application. If the applicant fails to supply the deficient information 
or otherwise fails to correct the deficiency within 60 days following 
the date of notification, the application shall be considered abandoned.
    (2) The sufficiency of the application shall be determined by the 
Assistant Administrator in accordance with the requirements of this 
part. The Assistant Administrator, however, may waive any requirement 
for information or require any elaboration or further information deemed 
necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 222.303  Issuance of permits.

    (a)(1) No permit may be issued prior to the receipt of a written 
application unless an emergency pursuant to Sec. 222.301(a)(2) exists, 
and a written variation from the requirements is recorded by the 
National Marine Fisheries Service.
    (2) No representation of an employee or agent of the United States 
shall be construed as a permit unless it meets the requirements of a 
permit defined in Sec. 222.102.
    (3) Each permit shall bear a serial number. Upon renewal, such a 
number may be reassigned to the permittee to whom issued so long as the 
permittee maintains continuity of renewal.
    (b) When an application for a permit received by the Assistant 
Administrator is deemed sufficient, the Assistant Administrator shall, 
as soon as practicable, publish a notice in the Federal Register. 
Information received by the Assistant Administrator as a part of the 
application shall be available to the public as a matter of public 
record at every stage of the proceeding. An interested party, within 30 
days after the date of publication of such notice, may submit to the 
Assistant Administrator written data, views, or arguments with respect 
to the taking, importation, or to other action proposed in the 
application, and may request a hearing in connection with the action to 
be taken thereon.
    (c) If a request for a hearing is made within the 30-day period 
referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, or if the Assistant 
Administrator determines that a hearing would otherwise be advisable, 
the Assistant Administrator may, within 60 days after the date of 
publication of the notice referred to in

[[Page 296]]

paragraph (b) of this section, afford to such requesting party or 
parties an opportunity for a hearing. Such hearing shall also be open to 
participation by any interested members of the public. Notice of the 
date, time, and place of such hearing shall be published in the Federal 
Register not less than 15 days in advance of such hearing. Any 
interested person may appear at the hearing in person or through a 
representative and may submit any relevant material, data, views, 
comments, arguments, or exhibits. A summary record of the hearing shall 
be kept.
    (d) Except as provided in subpart D to 15 CFR part 904, as soon as 
practicable but not later than 30 days after the close of the hearing. 
If no hearing is held, as soon as practicable but not later than 30 days 
from the publication of the notice in the Federal Register, the 
Assistant Administrator shall issue or deny issuance of the permit. 
Notice of the decision of the Assistant Administrator shall be published 
in the Federal Register within 10 days after the date of the issuance or 
denial and indicate where copies of the permit, if issued, may be 
obtained.
    (e)(1) The Assistant Administrator shall issue the permit unless:
    (i) Denial of the permit has been made pursuant to subpart D to 15 
CFR part 904;
    (ii) The applicant has failed to disclose material or information 
required, or has made false statements as to any material fact, in 
connection with the application;
    (iii) The applicant has failed to demonstrate a valid justification 
for the permit or a showing of responsibility;
    (iv) The authorization requested potentially threatens a fish or 
wildlife population; or
    (v) The Assistant Administrator finds through further inquiry or 
investigation, or otherwise, that the applicant is not qualified.
    (2) The applicant shall be notified in writing of the denial of any 
permit request, and the reasons thereof. If authorized in the notice of 
denial, the applicant may submit further information or reasons why the 
permit should not be denied. Such further information shall not be 
considered a new application. The final action by the Assistant 
Administrator shall be considered the final administrative decision of 
the Department of Commerce.
    (f) If a permit is issued under Sec. 222.308, the Assistant 
Administrator shall publish notice thereof in the Federal Register, 
including the Assistant Administrator's finding that such permit--
    (1) Was applied for in good faith;
    (2) Will not operate to the disadvantage of such endangered species; 
and
    (3) Will be consistent with the purposes and policy set forth in 
section 2 of the Act.
    (g) The Assistant Administrator may waive the 30-day period in an 
emergency situation where the health or life of an endangered animal is 
threatened and no reasonable alternative is available to the applicant. 
Notice of any such waiver shall be published by the Assistant 
Administrator in the Federal Register within 10 days following the 
issuance of the permit.


<R05>
Sec. 222.304  Renewal of permits.

    When the permit is renewable and a permittee intends to continue the 
activity described in the permit during any portion of the year ensuing 
its expiration, the permittee shall, unless otherwise notified in 
writing by the Assistant Administrator, file a request for permit 
renewal, together with a certified statement, verifying that the 
information in the original application is still currently correct. If 
the information is incorrect the permittee shall file a statement of all 
changes in the original application, accompanied by any required fee at 
least 30 days prior to the expiration of the permit. Any person holding 
a valid renewable permit, who has complied with the foregoing provision 
of this section, may continue such activities as were authorized by the 
expired permit until the renewal application is acted upon.


<R05>
Sec. 222.305  Rights of succession and transfer of permits.

    (a)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, permits issued 
pursuant to parts 222, 223, and 224 of this chapter are not transferable 
or assignable. In the event that a permit authorizes certain business 
activities in connection

[[Page 297]]

with a business or commercial enterprise, which is then subject to any 
subsequent lease, sale or transfer, the successor to that enterprise 
must obtain a permit prior to continuing the permitted activity, with 
the exceptions provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section.
    (2) Certain persons, other than the permittee, are granted the right 
to carry on a permitted activity for the remainder of the term of a 
current permit, provided that they furnish the permit to the issuing 
officer for endorsement within 90 days from the date the successor 
begins to carry on the activity. Such persons are the following:
    (i) The surviving spouse, child, executor, administrator, or other 
legal representative of a deceased permittee, and
    (ii) The receiver or trustee in bankruptcy or a court designated 
assignee for the benefit of creditors.
    (3) Incidental take permits issued under Sec. 222.307, and 
enhancement permits issued under Sec. 222.308, as part of a Safe Harbor 
Agreement with Assurances or Candidate Conservation Agreement with 
Assurances, may be transferred in whole or in part through a joint 
submission by the permittee and the proposed transferee, or in the case 
of a deceased permittee, the deceased permittee's legal representative 
and the proposed transferee, provided NMFS determines in writing that:
    (i) The proposed transferee meets all of the qualifications under 
parts 222, 223, or 224 (as applicable) for holding a permit;
    (ii) The proposed transferee has provided adequate written 
assurances that it will provide sufficient funding for the conservation 
plan or other agreement or plan associated with the permit and will 
implement the relevant terms and conditions of the permit, including any 
outstanding minimization and mitigation requirements; and
    (iii) The proposed transferee has provided such other information as 
NMFS determines is relevant to process the transfer.
    (b) Except as otherwise stated on the face of the permit, any person 
who is under the direct control of the permittee, or who is employed by 
or under contract to the permittee for purposes authorized by the 
permit, may carry out the activity authorized by the permit.

[64 FR 14054, Mar. 23, 1999, as amended at 67 FR 57973, Sept. 13, 2002]

    Effective Date Note: At 64 FR 14054, Mar. 23, 1999, part 222 was 
revised, effective Mar. 23, 1999, with the exception of Sec. 222.305, 
paragraph (a), which contains information collection and recordkeeping 
requirements and will not become effective until approval has been given 
by the Office of Management and Budget.


<R05>
Sec. 222.306  Modification, amendment, suspension, cancellation, 
and revocation of permits.

    (a) When circumstances have changed so that an applicant or a 
permittee desires to have any term or condition of the application or 
permit modified, the applicant or permittee must submit in writing full 
justification and supporting information in conformance with the 
provisions of this part and the part under which the permit has been 
issued or requested. Such applications for modification are subject to 
the same issuance criteria as original applications.
    (b) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
section, a permittee may change the mailing address or trade name under 
which business is conducted without obtaining a new permit or being 
subject to the same issuance criteria as original permits. The permittee 
must notify the Assistant Administrator, in writing within 30 days, of 
any change in address or of any change in the trade name for the 
business or activity specified in the permit. The permit with the change 
of address or in trade name must be endorsed by the Assistant 
Administrator, who shall provide an amended permit to the person to whom 
it was issued.
    (c) All permits are issued subject to the condition that the 
National Marine Fisheries Service reserves the right to amend the 
provisions of a permit for just cause at any time during its term. Such 
amendments take effect on the date of notification, unless otherwise 
specified.
    (d) When any permittee discontinues the permitted activity, the 
permittee shall, within 30 days thereof, mail the

[[Page 298]]

permit and a request for cancellation to the issuing officer, and the 
permit shall be deemed void upon receipt. No refund of any part of an 
amount paid as a permit fee shall be made when the operations of the 
permittee are, for any reason, discontinued during the tenure of an 
issued permit.
    (e) Any violation of the applicable provisions of parts 222, 223, or 
224 of this chapter, or of the Act, or of a term or condition of the 
permit may subject the permittee to both the penalties provided in the 
Act and suspension, revocation, or amendment of the permit, as provided 
in subpart D to 15 CFR part 904.


<R05>
Sec. 222.307  Permits for incidental taking of species.

    (a) Scope. (1) The Assistant Administrator may issue permits to take 
endangered and threatened species incidentally to an otherwise lawful 
activity under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act. The regulations in this 
section apply to all endangered species, and those threatened species 
for which the prohibitions of section 9(a)(1) of the Act, under the 
jurisdiction of the Secretary of Commerce, apply.
    (2) If the applicant represents an individual or a single entity, 
such as a corporation, the Assistant Administrator will issue an 
individual incidental take permit. If the applicant represents a group 
or organization whose members conduct the same or a similar activity in 
the same geographical area with similar impacts on listed species for 
which a permit is required, the Assistant Administrator will issue a 
general incidental take permit. To be covered by a general incidental 
take permit, each individual conducting the activity must have a 
certificate of inclusion issued under paragraph (f) of this section.
    (b) Permit application procedures. Applications should be sent to 
the Assistant Administrator. The Assistant Administrator shall determine 
the sufficiency of the application in accordance with the requirements 
of this section. At least 120 days should be allowed for processing. 
Each application must be signed and dated and must include the 
following:
    (1) The type of application, either:
    (i) Application for an Individual Incidental Take Permit under the 
Act; or
    (ii) Application for a General Incidental Take Permit under the Act;
    (2) The name, address, and telephone number of the applicant. If the 
applicant is a partnership or a corporate entity or is representing a 
group or an organization, the applicable details;
    (3) The species or stocks, by common and scientific name, and a 
description of the status, distribution, seasonal distribution, habitat 
needs, feeding habits and other biological requirements of the affected 
species or stocks;
    (4) A detailed description of the proposed activity, including the 
anticipated dates, duration, and specific location. If the request is 
for a general incidental take permit, an estimate of the total level of 
activity expected to be conducted;
    (5) A conservation plan, based on the best scientific and commercial 
data available, which specifies the following:
    (i) The anticipated impact (i.e., amount, extent, and type of 
anticipated taking) of the proposed activity on the species or stocks;
    (ii) The anticipated impact of the proposed activity on the habitat 
of the species or stocks and the likelihood of restoration of the 
affected habitat;
    (iii) The steps (specialized equipment, methods of conducting 
activities, or other means) that will be taken to monitor, minimize, and 
mitigate such impacts, and the funding available to implement such 
measures;
    (iv) The alternative actions to such taking that were considered and 
the reasons why those alternatives are not being used; and
    (v) A list of all sources of data used in preparation of the plan, 
including reference reports, environmental assessments and impact 
statements, and personal communications with recognized experts on the 
species or activity who may have access to data not published in current 
literature.
    (c) Issuance criteria. (1) In determining whether to issue a permit, 
the Assistant Administrator will consider the following:
    (i) The status of the affected species or stocks;

[[Page 299]]

    (ii) The potential severity of direct, indirect, and cumulative 
impacts on the species or stocks and habitat as a result of the proposed 
activity;
    (iii) The availability of effective monitoring techniques;
    (iv) The use of the best available technology for minimizing or 
mitigating impacts; and
    (v) The views of the public, scientists, and other interested 
parties knowledgeable of the species or stocks or other matters related 
to the application.
    (2) To issue the permit, the Assistant Administrator must find 
that--
    (i) The taking will be incidental;
    (ii) The applicant will, to the maximum extent practicable, monitor, 
minimize, and mitigate the impacts of such taking;
    (iii) The taking will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the 
survival and recovery of the species in the wild;
    (iv) The applicant has amended the conservation plan to include any 
measures (not originally proposed by the applicant) that the Assistant 
Administrator determines are necessary or appropriate; and
    (v) There are adequate assurances that the conservation plan will be 
funded and implemented, including any measures required by the Assistant 
Administrator.
    (d) Permit conditions. In addition to the general conditions set 
forth in this part, every permit issued under this section will contain 
such terms and conditions as the Assistant Administrator deems necessary 
and appropriate, including, but not limited to the following:
    (1) Reporting requirements or rights of inspection for determining 
whether the terms and conditions are being complied with;
    (2) The species and number of animals covered;
    (3) The authorized method of taking;
    (4) The procedures to be used to handle or dispose of any animals 
taken; and
    (5) The payment of an adequate fee to the National Marine Fisheries 
Service to process the application.
    (e) Duration of permits. The duration of permits issued under this 
section will be such as to provide adequate assurances to the permit 
holder to commit funding necessary for the activities authorized by the 
permit, including conservation activities. In determining the duration 
of a permit, the Assistant Administrator will consider the duration of 
the proposed activities, as well as the possible positive and negative 
effects on listed species associated with issuing a permit of the 
proposed duration, including the extent to which the conservation plan 
is likely to enhance the habitat of the endangered species or to 
increase the long-term survivability of the species.
    (f) Certificates of inclusion. (1) Any individual who wishes to 
conduct an activity covered by a general incidental take permit must 
apply to the Assistant Administrator for a Certificate of Inclusion. 
Each application must be signed and dated and must include the 
following:
    (i) The general incidental take permit under which the applicant 
wants coverage;
    (ii) The name, address, and telephone number of the applicant. If 
the applicant is a partnership or a corporate entity, the applicable 
details;
    (iii) A description of the activity the applicant seeks to have 
covered under the general incidental take permit, including the 
anticipated dates, duration, and specific location; and
    (iv) A signed certification that the applicant has read and 
understands the general incidental take permit and the conservation 
plan, will comply with their terms and conditions, and will fund and 
implement applicable measures of the conservation plan.
    (2) To issue a Certificate of Inclusion, the Assistant Administrator 
must find that:
    (i) The applicant will be engaged in the activity covered by the 
general permit, and
    (ii) The applicant has made adequate assurances that the applicable 
measures of the conservation plan will be funded and implemented.
    (g) Assurances provided to permittee in case of changed or 
unforeseen circumstances. The assurances in this paragraph (g) apply 
only to incidental take permits issued in accordance with paragraph (c) 
of this section where the

[[Page 300]]

conservation plan is being properly implemented, and apply only with 
respect to species adequately covered by the conservation plan. These 
assurances cannot be provided to Federal agencies. This rule does not 
apply to incidental take permits issued prior to March 25, 1998. The 
assurances provided in incidental take permits issued prior to March 25, 
1998, remain in effect, and those permits will not be revised as a 
result of this rulemaking.
    (1) Changed circumstances provided for in the plan. If additional 
conservation and mitigation measures are deemed necessary to respond to 
changed circumstances and were provided for in the plan's operating 
conservation program, the permittee will implement the measures 
specified in the plan.
    (2) Changed circumstances not provided for in the plan. If 
additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed necessary to 
respond to changed circumstances and such measures were not provided for 
in the plan's operating conservation program, NMFS will not require any 
conservation and mitigation measures in addition to those provided for 
in the plan without the consent of the permittee, provided the plan is 
being properly implemented.
    (3) Unforeseen circumstances. (i) In negotiating unforeseen 
circumstances, NMFS will not require the commitment of additional land, 
water, or financial compensation or additional restrictions on the use 
of land, water, or other natural resources beyond the level otherwise 
agreed upon for the species covered by the conservation plan without the 
consent of the permittee.
    (ii) If additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed 
necessary to respond to unforeseen circumstances, NMFS may require 
additional measures of the permittee where the conservation plan is 
being properly implemented. However, such additional measures are 
limited to modifications within any conserved habitat areas or to the 
conservation plan's operating conservation program for the affected 
species. The original terms of the conservation plan will be maintained 
to the maximum extent possible. Additional conservation and mitigation 
measures will not involve the commitment of additional land, water, or 
financial compensation or additional restrictions on the use of land, 
water, or other natural resources otherwise available for development or 
use under the original terms of the conservation plan without the 
consent of the permittee.
    (iii) NMFS has the burden of demonstrating that unforeseen 
circumstances exist, using the best scientific and commercial data 
available. These findings must be clearly documented and based upon 
reliable technical information regarding the status and habitat 
requirements of the affected species. NMFS will consider, but not be 
limited to, the following factors:
    (A) Size of the current range of the affected species;
    (B) Percentage of range adversely affected by the conservation plan;
    (C) Percentage of range conserved by the conservation plan;
    (D) Ecological significance of that portion of the range affected by 
the conservation plan;
    (E) Level of knowledge about the affected species and the degree of 
specificity of the species' conservation program under the conservation 
plan; and
    (F) Whether failure to adopt additional conservation measures would 
appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of the 
affected species in the wild.
    (h) Nothing in this rule will be construed to limit or constrain the 
Assistant Administrator, any Federal, State, local, or Tribal government 
agency, or a private entity, from taking additional actions at his or 
her own expense to protect or conserve a species included in a 
conservation plan.


<R05>
Sec. 222.308  Permits for scientific purposes or for the enhancement
of propagation or survival of species.

    (a) Scope. The Assistant Administrator may issue permits for 
scientific purposes or for the enhancement of the propagation or 
survival of the affected endangered or threatened species in accordance 
with the regulations in parts 222, 223, and 224 of this chapter and 
under such terms and conditions as the

[[Page 301]]

Assistant Administrator may prescribe, authorizing the taking, 
importation, or other acts otherwise prohibited by section 9 of the Act. 
Within the jurisdication of a State, more restrictive state laws or 
regulations in regard to endangered species shall prevail in regard to 
taking. Proof of compliance with applicable state laws will be required 
before a permit will be issued.
    (b) Application procedures. Any person desiring to obtain such a 
permit may make application therefor to the Assistant Administrator. 
Permits for marine mammals shall be issued in accordance with the 
provisions of part 216, subpart D of this chapter. Permits relating to 
sea turtles may involve the Fish and Wildlife Service, in which case the 
applicant shall follow the procedures set out in Sec. 222.309. The 
following information will be used as the basis for determining whether 
an application is complete and whether a permit for scientific purposes 
or for enhancement of propagation or survival of the affected species 
should be issued by the Assistant Administrator. An application for a 
permit shall provide the following information and such other 
information that the Assistant Administrator may require:
    (1) Title, as applicable, either--
    (i) Application for permit for scientific purposes under the Act; or
    (ii) Application for permit for the enhancement of the propagation 
or survival of the endangered species Under the Act.
    (2) The date of the application.
    (3) The identity of the applicant including complete name, address, 
and telephone number. If the applicant is a partnership or a corporate 
entity, set forth the details. If the endangered species is to be 
utilized by a person other than the applicant, set forth the name of 
that person and such other information as would be required if such 
person were an applicant.
    (4) A description of the purpose of the proposed acts, including the 
following:
    (i) A detailed justification of the need for the endangered species, 
including a discussion of possible alternatives, whether or not under 
the control of the applicant; and
    (ii) A detailed description of how the species will be used.
    (5) A detailed description of the project, or program, in which the 
endangered species is to be used, including the following:
    (i) The period of time over which the project or program will be 
conducted;
    (ii) A list of the names and addresses of the sponsors or 
cooperating institutions and the scientists involved;
    (iii) A copy of the formal research proposal or contract if one has 
been prepared;
    (iv) A statement of whether the proposed project or program has 
broader significance than the individual researcher's goals. For

Sec. 222.309  Permits for listed species of sea turtles involving the
Fish and Wildlife Service.

    (a) This section establishes specific procedures for issuance of the 
following permits: scientific purposes or to enhance the propagation or 
survival of endangered or threatened species of sea

[[Page 304]]

turtles; zoological exhibition or educational purposes for threatened 
species of sea turtles; and permits that requires coordination with the 
Fish and Wildlife Service. The National Marine Fisheries Service 
maintains jurisdiction for such species in the marine environment. The 
Fish and Wildlife Service maintains jurisdiction for such species of sea 
turtles in the land environment.
    (b) For permits relating to any activity in the marine environment 
exclusively, permit applicants and permittees must comply with the 
regulations in parts 222, 223, and 224 of this chapter.
    (c) For permits relating to any activity in the land environment 
exclusively, permit applicants must submit applications to the Wildlife 
Permit Office (WPO) of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in accordance 
with either 50 CFR 17.22(a), if the species is endangered, or 50 CFR 
17.32(a), if the species is threatened.
    (d) For permits relating to any activity in both the land and marine 
environments, applicants must submit applications to the WPO. WPO will 
forward the application to NMFS for review and processing of those 
activities under its jurisdiction. Based on this review and processing, 
WPO will issue either a permit or a letter of denial in accordance with 
its own regulations.
    (e) For permits relating to any activity in a marine environment and 
that also requires a permit under the Convention on International Trade 
in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (TIAS 8249, July 
1, 1975) (50 CFR part 23), applicants must submit applications to the 
WPO. WPO will forward the application to NMFS for review and processing, 
after which WPO will issue a combination ESA/CITES permit or a letter of 
denial.


<R05>
Sec. 222.310  Permit authority for designated agents and employees of
specified Federal and state agencies.

    (a) This section constitutes a programmatic permit, pursuant to 16 
U.S.C. 1539(a)(1)(A), that authorizes activities by agents and employees 
of Federal and state agencies, as described in paragraph (b) of this 
section, to aid stranded endangered sea turtles, and to salvage, collect 
data from, and dispose of, dead carcasses of endangered sea turtles in 
the marine environment. For purposes of this section, 'stranded' means 
endangered sea turtles, in the marine environment, that are alive but 
sick, injured, or entangled.
    (b) If any member of any endangered species of sea turtle is found 
stranded or dead in the marine environment, any agent or employee of the 
National Marine Fisheries Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the 
U.S. Coast Guard, or any other Federal land or water management agency, 
or any agent or employee of a state agency responsible for fish and 
wildlife who is designated by his or her agency for such purposes, may, 
when acting in the course of his or her official duties, take such 
endangered sea turtles if such taking is necessary to aid a stranded sea 
turtle, or dispose of or salvage a dead sea turtle, or collect data from 
a dead sea turtle which may be useful for scientific and educational 
purposes. Live turtles will be handled as described in Sec. 
223.206(d)(1). Whenever possible, live sea turtles shall be returned to 
their aquatic environment as soon as possible. The following data 
collection activities for live turtles while they are in the marine 
environment are allowed:
    (1) Turtles may be flipper and passive integrated transponder (PIT) 
tagged, prior to release. Flipper tags would be applied to the trailing 
edge of either the front or rear flippers with standard tagging 
applicators after the tagging area has been cleaned with alcohol or 
iodine solution. PIT tags would be inserted according to best practice, 
approved scientific protocols, after cleaning the insertion site with 
alcohol or iodine solution. Before application of flipper tags or 
insertion of PIT tags, all flippers and the neck/shoulder area will be 
examined and scanned for the presence of any pre-existing flipper or PIT 
tags.
    (2) Turtles may also be weighed, measured, and photographed prior to 
release.
    (3) When handling turtles exhibiting fibropapilloma, all equipment 
(tagging equipment, tape measures, etc.) that comes in contact with the 
turtle shall be cleaned with a mild bleach solution.

[[Page 305]]

    (c) Every action shall be reported in writing to the Assistant 
Administrator, or authorized representative, via the agency or 
institution designated by the state to record such events. Reports shall 
contain the following information:
    (1) Name and position of the official or employee involved;
    (2) Description of the sea turtle(s) involved including species and 
condition of the animal;
    (3) When applicable, description of entangling gear, its location on 
the turtle, and the amount of gear left on the turtle at release;
    (4) Method, date and location of disposal of the sea turtle(s), 
including, if applicable, where the sea turtle(s) has been retained in 
captivity; and
    (5) Such other information as the Assistant Administrator, or 
authorized representative, may require.

                     Subpart D_Observer Requirement

    Source: 72 FR 43185, Aug. 3, 2007, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 222.401  Observer requirement.

    Any United States fishing vessel, either commercial or recreational, 
which operates within the territorial seas or exclusive economic zone of 
the United States or on the high seas, or any fishing vessel that is 
otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, operating in 
a fishery that is identified through the annual determination process 
specified in Sec. 222.402 must carry aboard a NMFS-approved observer 
upon request by the NMFS Assistant Administrator, in consultation with 
NMFS Regional Administrators and Science Center Directors, as 
appropriate. NMFS and/or interested cooperating entities will pay direct 
costs for the observer. Owners and operators must comply with observer 
safety requirements specified at 50 CFR 600.725 and 50 CFR 600.746 and 
the terms and conditions specified in the written notification.


<R05>
Sec. 222.402  Annual determination of fisheries to be observed; 
notice and comment.

    (a) The Assistant Administrator, in consultation with Regional 
Administrators and Science Center Directors, will make an annual 
determination identifying which fisheries the agency intends to observe. 
This determination will be based on the extent to which:
    (1) The fishery operates in the same waters and at the same time as 
sea turtles are present;
    (2) The fishery operates at the same time or prior to elevated sea 
turtle strandings; or
    (3) The fishery uses a gear or technique that is known or likely to 
result in incidental take of sea turtles based on documented or reported 
takes in the same or similar fisheries; and
    (4) NMFS intends to monitor the fishery and anticipates that it will 
have the funds to do so.
    (b) The Assistant Administrator shall publish the proposed 
determination and any final determination in the Federal Register. 
Public comment will be sought at the time of publication of the proposed 
determination. In addition, a written notification of the final 
determination will be sent to the address specified for the vessel in 
either the NMFS or state fishing permit application, or to the address 
specified for registration or documentation purposes, or such 
notification will be otherwise served on the owners or operator of the 
vessel. Additionally, NMFS will notify state agencies and provide 
notification through publication in local newspapers, radio broadcasts, 
and any other means as appropriate. The proposed and any final 
determinations will include, to the extent practicable, information on 
fishing sector, targeted gear type, target fishery, temporal and 
geographic scope of coverage, or other information, as appropriate.
    (c) Fisheries listed on the most recent annual Marine Mammal 
Protection Act List of Fisheries in any given year, in accordance with 
16 U.S.C. 1387, will serve as the comprehensive set of commercial 
fisheries to be considered for inclusion in the annual determination. 
Recreational fisheries may also be included in the annual determination.

[[Page 306]]

    (d) Publication of the proposed and final determinations should be 
coordinated to the extent possible with the annual Marine Mammal 
Protection Act List of Fisheries process as specified at 50 CFR 229.8.
    (e) Inclusion of a fishery in a proposed or final determination does 
not constitute a conclusion by NMFS that those participating in the 
fishery are illegally taking sea turtles.


<R05>
Sec. 222.403  Duration of selection; effective date.

    (a) Fisheries included in the final annual determination in a given 
year will remain eligible for observer coverage under this rule for five 
years, without need for NMFS to include the fishery in the intervening 
proposed annual determinations, to enable the design of an appropriate 
sampling program and to ensure collection of scientific data. If NMFS 
wishes to continue observations beyond the fifth year, NMFS must include 
the fishery in the proposed annual determination and seek comment, prior 
to the expiration of the fifth year.
    (b) A 30-day delay in effective date for implementing observer 
coverage will follow the annual notification, except for those fisheries 
that were included in a previous determination within the preceding five 
years or where the AA has determined that there is good cause pursuant 
to the Administrative Procedure Act to make the rule effective without a 
30-day delay.


<R05>
Sec. 222.404  Observer program sampling.

    (a) During the program design, NMFS would be guided by the following 
standards in the distribution and placement of observers among fisheries 
and vessels in a particular fishery:
    (1) The requirements to obtain the best available scientific 
information;
    (2) The requirement that assignment of observers is fair and 
equitable among fisheries and among vessels in a fishery;
    (3) The requirement that no individual person or vessel, or group of 
persons or vessels, be subject to inappropriate, excessive observer 
coverage; and
    (4) The need to minimize costs and avoid duplication, where 
practicable.
    (b) Consistent with 16 U.S.C. 1881(b), vessels where the facilities 
for accommodating an observer or carrying out observer functions are so 
inadequate or unsafe (due to size or quality of equipment, for example) 
that the health or safety of the observer or the safe operation of the 
vessel would be jeopardized, would not be required to take observers 
under this rule.

<R05>
Sec. 223.203  Anadromous fish.

    Available guidance documents cited in the regulatory text are listed 
in Appendix A to this section.
    (a) Prohibitions. The prohibitions of section 9(a)(1) of the ESA (16 
U.S.C. 1538(a)(1)) relating to endangered species apply to fish with an 
intact adipose fin that are part of the threatened species of salmonids 
listed in Sec. 223.102(c)(3) through (c)(25).
    (b) Limits on the prohibitions. The limits to the prohibitions of 
paragraph (a) of this section relating to threatened species of 
salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(c)(3) through (c)(25) are described in 
the following paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(13):
    (1) The exceptions of section 10 of the ESA (16 U.S.C. 1539) and 
other exceptions under the Act relating to endangered species, including 
regulations in part 222 of this chapter implementing such exceptions, 
also apply to the threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 
223.102(a).
    (2) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened Puget Sound steelhead listed in Sec. 223.102(c)(23) do not 
apply to:
    (i) Activities specified in an application for a permit for 
scientific purposes

[[Page 349]]

or to enhance the conservation or survival of the species, provided that 
the application has been received by the Assistant Administrator for 
Fisheries, NOAA (AA), no later than November 14, 2008. The prohibitions 
of this section apply to these activities upon the AA's rejection of the 
application as insufficient, upon issuance or denial of a permit, or 
June 1, 2009, whichever occurs earliest, or
    (ii) Steelhead harvested in tribal or recreational fisheries prior 
to June 1, 2009, so long as the harvest is authorized by the State of 
Washington or a tribe with jurisdiction over steelhead harvest. If NMFS 
does not receive a fishery management plan for Puget Sound steelhead by 
November 14, 2008, subsequent take by harvest will be subject to the 
take prohibitions.
    (3) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) do not apply 
to any employee or designee of NMFS, the United States Fish and Wildlife 
Service, any Federal land management agency, the Idaho Department of 
Fish and Game (IDFG), Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), 
the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW), California Department 
of Fish and Game (CDFG), or of any other governmental entity that has 
co-management authority for the listed salmonids, when the employee or 
designee, acting in the course of his or her official duties, takes a 
threatened salmonid without a permit if such action is necessary to:
    (i) Aid a sick, injured, or stranded salmonid,
    (ii) Dispose of a dead salmonid, or
    (iii) Salvage a dead salmonid which may be useful for scientific 
study.
    (iv) Each agency acting under this limit on the take prohibitions of 
paragraph (a) of this section is to report to NMFS the numbers of fish 
handled and their status, on an annual basis. A designee of the listed 
entities is any individual the Federal or state fishery agency or other 
co-manager has authorized in writing to perform the listed functions.
    (4) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) do not apply 
to fishery harvest activities provided that:
    (i) Fisheries are managed in accordance with a NMFS-approved Fishery 
Management and Evaluation Plan (FMEP) and implemented in accordance with 
a letter of concurrence from NMFS. NMFS will approve an FMEP only if it 
clearly defines its intended scope and area of impact and sets forth the 
management objectives and performance indicators for the plan. The plan 
must adequately address the following criteria:
    (A) Define populations within affected listed ESUs, taking into 
account spatial and temporal distribution, genetic and phenotypic 
diversity, and other appropriate identifiably unique biological and life 
history traits. Populations may be aggregated for management purposes 
when dictated by information scarcity, if consistent with survival and 
recovery of the listed ESU. In identifying management units, the plan 
shall describe the reasons for using such units in lieu of population 
units, describe how the management units are defined, given biological 
and life history traits, so as to maximize consideration of the 
important biological diversity contained within the listed ESU, respond 
to the scale and complexity of the ESU, and help ensure consistent 
treatment of listed salmonids across a diverse geographic and 
jurisdictional range.
    (B) Utilize the concepts of ``viable'' and ``critical'' salmonid 
population thresholds, consistent with the concepts contained in the 
technical document entitled ``Viable Salmonid Populations (NMFS, 
2000b).'' The VSP paper provides a framework for identifying the 
biological requirements of listed salmonids, assessing the effects of 
management and conservation actions, and ensuring that such actions 
provide for the survival and recovery of listed species. Proposed 
management actions must recognize the significant differences in risk 
associated with viable and critical population threshold states and 
respond accordingly to minimize the long-term risks to population 
persistence. Harvest actions impacting populations that are functioning 
at or above the viable threshold must be designed to maintain the 
population or

[[Page 350]]

management unit at or above that level. For populations shown with a 
high degree of confidence to be above critical levels but not yet at 
viable levels, harvest management must not appreciably slow the 
population's achievement of viable function. Harvest actions impacting 
populations that are functioning at or below critical threshold must not 
be allowed to appreciably increase genetic and demographic risks facing 
the population and must be designed to permit the population's 
achievement of viable function, unless the plan demonstrates that the 
likelihood of survival and recovery of the entire ESU in the wild would 
not be appreciably reduced by greater risks to that individual 
population.
    (C) Set escapement objectives or maximum exploitation rates for each 
management unit or population based on its status and on a harvest 
program that assures that those rates or objectives are not exceeded. 
Maximum exploitation rates must not appreciably reduce the likelihood of 
survival and recovery of the ESU. Management of fisheries where 
artificially propagated fish predominate must not compromise the 
management objectives for commingled naturally spawned populations.
    (D) Display a biologically based rationale demonstrating that the 
harvest management strategy will not appreciably reduce the likelihood 
of survival and recovery of the ESU in the wild, over the entire period 
of time the proposed harvest management strategy affects the population, 
including effects reasonably certain to occur after the proposed actions 
cease.
    (E) Include effective monitoring and evaluation programs to assess 
compliance, effectiveness, and parameter validation. At a minimum, 
harvest monitoring programs must collect catch and effort data, 
information on escapements, and information on biological 
characteristics, such as age, fecundity, size and sex data, and 
migration timing.
    (F) Provide for evaluating monitoring data and making any revisions 
of assumptions, management strategies, or objectives that data show are 
needed.
    (G) Provide for effective enforcement and education. Coordination 
among involved jurisdictions is an important element in ensuring 
regulatory effectiveness and coverage.
    (H) Include restrictions on resident and anadromous species 
fisheries that minimize any take of listed species, including time, 
size, gear, and area restrictions.
    (I) Be consistent with plans and conditions established within any 
Federal court proceeding with continuing jurisdiction over tribal 
harvest allocations.
    (ii) The state monitors the amount of take of listed salmonids 
occurring in its fisheries and provides to NMFS on a regular basis, as 
defined in NMFS' letter of concurrence for the FMEP, a report 
summarizing this information, as well as the implementation and 
effectiveness of the FMEP. The state shall provide NMFS with access to 
all data and reports prepared concerning the implementation and 
effectiveness of the FMEP.
    (iii) The state confers with NMFS on its fishing regulation changes 
affecting listed ESUs to ensure consistency with the approved FMEP. 
Prior to approving a new or amended FMEP, NMFS will publish notification 
in the Federal Register announcing its availability for public review 
and comment. Such an announcement will provide for a comment period on 
the draft FMEP of not less than 30 days.
    (iv) NMFS provides written concurrence of the FMEP which specifies 
the implementation and reporting requirements. NMFS' approval of a plan 
shall be a written approval by NMFS Southwest or Northwest Regional 
Administrator, as appropriate. On a regular basis, NMFS will evaluate 
the effectiveness of the program in protecting and achieving a level of 
salmonid productivity commensurate with conservation of the listed 
salmonids. If it is not, NMFS will identify ways in which the program 
needs to be altered or strengthened. If the responsible agency does not 
make changes to respond adequately to the new information, NMFS will 
publish notification in the Federal Register announcing its intention to 
withdraw the limit for activities associated with that FMEP. Such an 
announcement will provide for

[[Page 351]]

a comment period of not less than 30 days, after which NMFS will make a 
final determination whether to withdraw the limit so that the 
prohibitions would then apply to those fishery harvest activities. A 
template for developing FMEPs is available from NMFS Northwest Region's 
website (www.nwr.noaa.gov).
    (v) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of steelhead listed in Sec. 223.102 (a)(5) through 
(a)(9), (a)(14), and (a)(15) do not apply to fisheries managed solely by 
the states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and California until January 8, 
2001.
    (5) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) do not apply 
to activity associated with artificial propagation programs provided 
that:
    (i) A state or Federal Hatchery and Genetics Management Plan (HGMP) 
has been approved by NMFS as meeting the following criteria:
    (A) The HGMP has clearly stated goals, performance objectives, and 
performance indicators that indicate the purpose of the program, its 
intended results, and measurements of its performance in meeting those 
results. Goals shall address whether the program is intended to meet 
conservation objectives, contribute to the ultimate sustainability of 
natural spawning populations, and/or intended to augment tribal, 
recreational, or commercial fisheries. Objectives should enumerate the 
results desired from the program that will be used to measure the 
program's success or failure.
    (B) The HGMP utilizes the concepts of viable and critical salmonid 
population threshold, consistent with the concepts contained in the 
technical document entitled ``Viable Salmonid Populations'' (NMFS, 
2000b). Listed salmonids may be purposefully taken for broodstock 
purposes only if the donor population is currently at or above the 
viable threshold and the collection will not impair its function; if the 
donor population is not currently viable but the sole objective of the 
current collection program is to enhance the propagation or survival of 
the listed ESU; or if the donor population is shown with a high degree 
of confidence to be above critical threshold although not yet 
functioning at viable levels, and the collection will not appreciably 
slow the attainment of viable status for that population.
    (C) Taking into account health, abundances, and trends in the donor 
population, broodstock collection programs reflect appropriate 
priorities. The primary purpose of broodstock collection programs of 
listed species is to reestablish indigenous salmonid populations for 
conservation purposes. Such programs include restoration of similar, at-
risk populations within the same ESU, and reintroduction of at-risk 
populations to underseeded habitat. After the species' conservation 
needs are met and when consistent with survival and recovery of the ESU, 
broodstock collection programs may be authorized by NMFS such for 
secondary purposes, as to sustain tribal, recreational, and commercial 
fisheries.
    (D) The HGMP includes protocols to address fish health, broodstock 
collection, broodstock spawning, rearing and release of juveniles, 
deposition of hatchery adults, and catastrophic risk management.
    (E) The HGMP evaluates, minimizes, and accounts for the propagation 
program's genetic and ecological effects on natural populations, 
including disease transfer, competition, predation, and genetic 
introgression caused by the straying of hatchery fish.
    (F) The HGMP describes interrelationships and interdependencies with 
fisheries management. The combination of artificial propagation programs 
and harvest management must be designed to provide as many benefits and 
as few biological risks as possible for the listed species. For programs 
whose purpose is to sustain fisheries, HGMPs must not compromise the 
ability of FMEPs or other management plans to conserve listed salmonids.
    (G) Adequate artificial propagation facilities exist to properly 
rear progeny of naturally spawned broodstock, to maintain population 
health and diversity, and to avoid hatchery-influenced selection or 
domestication.
    (H) Adequate monitoring and evaluation exist to detect and evaluate 
the success of the hatchery program and

[[Page 352]]

any risks potentially impairing the recovery of the listed ESU.
    (I) The HGMP provides for evaluating monitoring data and making any 
revisions of assumptions, management strategies, or objectives that data 
show are needed;
    (J) NMFS provides written concurrence of the HGMP which specifies 
the implementation and reporting requirements. For Federally operated or 
funded hatcheries, the ESA section 7 consultation will achieve this 
purpose.
    (K) The HGMP is consistent with plans and conditions set within any 
Federal court proceeding with continuing jurisdiction over tribal 
harvest allocations.
    (ii) The state monitors the amount of take of listed salmonids 
occurring in its hatchery program and provides to NMFS on a regular 
basis a report summarizing this information, and the implementation and 
effectiveness of the HGMP as defined in NMFS' letter of concurrence. The 
state shall provide NMFS with access to all data and reports prepared 
concerning the implementation and effectiveness of the HGMP.
    (iii) The state confers with NMFS on a regular basis regarding 
intended collections of listed broodstock to ensure congruity with the 
approved HGMP.
    (iv) Prior to final approval of an HGMP, NMFS will publish 
notification in the Federal Register announcing its availability for 
public review and comment for a period of at least 30 days.
    (v) NMFS' approval of a plan shall be a written approval by NMFS 
Southwest or Northwest Regional Administrator, as appropriate.
    (vi) On a regular basis, NMFS will evaluate the effectiveness of the 
HGMP in protecting and achieving a level of salmonid productivity 
commensurate with the conservation of the listed salmonids. If the HGMP 
is not effective, the NMFS will identify to the jurisdiction ways in 
which the program needs to be altered or strengthened. If the 
responsible agency does not make changes to respond adequately to the 
new information, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register 
announcing its intention to withdraw the limit on activities associated 
with that program. Such an announcement will provide for a comment 
period of no less than 30 days, after which NMFS will make a final 
determination whether to withdraw the limit so that take prohibitions, 
likeall other activity not within a limit, would then apply to that 
program. A template for developing HGMPs is available from NMFS 
Northwest Region's website (www.nwr.noaa.gov).
    (6) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) do not apply 
to actions undertaken in compliance with a resource management plan 
developed jointly by the States of Washington, Oregon and/or Idaho and 
the Tribes (joint plan) within the continuing jurisdiction of United 
States v. Washington or United States v. Oregon, the on-going Federal 
court proceedings to enforce and implement reserved treaty fishing 
rights, provided that:
    (i) The Secretary has determined pursuant to 50 CFR 223.209 and the 
government-to-government processes therein that implementing and 
enforcing the joint tribal/state plan will not appreciably reduce the 
likelihood of survival and recovery of affected threatened ESUs.
    (ii) The joint plan will be implemented and enforced within the 
parameters set forth in United States v. Washington or United States v. 
Oregon.
    (iii) In making that determination for a joint plan, the Secretary 
has taken comment on how any fishery management plan addresses the 
criteria in Sec. 223.203(b)(4), or on how any hatchery and genetic 
management plan addresses the criteria in Sec. 223.203(b)(5).
    (iv) The Secretary shall publish notice in the Federal Register of 
any determination whether or not a joint plan, will appreciably reduce 
the likelihood of survival and recovery of affected threatened ESUs, 
together with a discussion of the biological analysis underlying that 
determination.
    (v) On a regular basis, NMFS will evaluate the effectiveness of the 
joint plan in protecting and achieving a level of salmonid productivity 
commensurate with conservation of the listed salmonids. If the plan is 
not effective, then NMFS will identify to the

[[Page 353]]

jurisdiction ways in which the joint plan needs to be altered or 
strengthened. If the responsible agency does not make changes to respond 
adequately to the new information, NMFS will publish notification in the 
Federal Register announcing its intention to withdraw the limit on 
activities associated with that joint plan. Such an announcement will 
provide for a comment period of no less than 30 days, after which NMFS 
will make a final determination whether to withdraw the limit so that 
take prohibitions would then apply to that joint plan as to all other 
activity not within a limit.
    (7) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) do not apply 
to scientific research activities provided that:
    (i) Scientific research activities involving purposeful take is 
conducted by employees or contractors of the ODFW, WDFW (Agencies), 
IDFG, or CDFG (Agencies), or as a part of a monitoring and research 
program overseen by or coordinated with that Agency.
    (ii) The Agencies provide for NMFS' review and approval a list of 
all scientific research activities involving direct take planned for the 
coming year, including an estimate of the total direct take that is 
anticipated, a description of the study design, including a 
justification for taking the species and a description of the techniques 
to be used, and a point of contact.
    (iii) The Agencies annually provide to NMFS the results of 
scientific research activities directed at threatened salmonids, 
including a report of the direct take resulting from the studies and a 
summary of the results of such studies.
    (iv) Scientific research activities that may incidentally take 
threatened salmonids are either conducted by agency personnel, or are in 
accord with a permit issued by the Agency.
    (v) The Agencies provide NMFS annually, for its review and approval, 
a report listing all scientific research activities it conducts or 
permits that may incidentally take threatened salmonids during the 
coming year. Such reports shall also contain the amount of incidental 
take of threatened salmonids occurring in the previous year's scientific 
research activities and a summary of the results of such research.
    (vi) Electrofishing in any body of water known or suspected to 
contain threatened salmonids is conducted in accordance with NMFS 
``Guidelines for Electrofishing Waters Containing Salmonids Listed Under 
the Endangered Species Act'' (NMFS, 2000a).
    (vii) NMFS' approval of a research program shall be a written 
approval by NMFS Northwest or Southwest Regional Administrator.
    (8) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) do not apply 
to habitat restoration activities, as defined in paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of 
this section, provided that the activity is part of a watershed 
conservation plan, and:
    (i) The watershed conservation plan has been certified by the State 
of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, or California (State) to be consistent 
with the state's watershed conservation plan guidelines.
    (ii) The State's watershed conservation plan guidelines have been 
found by NMFS to provide for plans that:
    (A) Take into account the potential severity of direct, indirect, 
and cumulative impacts of proposed activities in light of the status of 
affected species and populations.
    (B) Will not reduce the likelihood of either survival or recovery of 
listed species in the wild.
    (C) Ensure that any taking will be incidental.
    (D) Minimize and mitigate any adverse impacts.
    (E) Provide for effective monitoring and adaptive management.
    (F) Use the best available science and technology, including 
watershed analysis.
    (G) Provide for public and scientific review and input.
    (H) Include any measures that NMFS determines are necessary or 
appropriate.
    (I) Include provisions that clearly identify those activities that 
are part of plan implementation.

[[Page 354]]

    (J) Control risk to listed species by ensuring funding and 
implementation of the above plan components.
    (iii) NMFS will periodically review state certifications of 
Watershed Conservation Plans to ensure adherence to approved watershed 
conservation plan guidelines.
    (iv) ``Habitat restoration activity'' is defined as an activity 
whose primary purpose is to restore natural aquatic or riparian habitat 
conditions or processes. ``Primary purpose'' means the activity would 
not be undertaken but for its restoration purpose.
    (v) Prior to approving watershed conservation plan guidelines under 
paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section, NMFS will publish notification in 
the Federal Register announcing the availability of the proposed 
guidelines for public review and comment. Such an announcement will 
provide for a comment period on the draft guidelines of no less than 30 
days.
    (9) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) do not apply 
to the physical diversion of water from a stream or lake, provided that:
    (i) NMFS' engineering staff or any resource agency or tribe NMFS 
designates (authorized officer) has agreed in writing that the diversion 
facility is screened, maintained, and operated in compliance with 
Juvenile Fish Screen Criteria, National Marine Fisheries Service, 
Northwest Region, Revised February 16, 1995, with Addendum of May 9, 
1996, or in California with NMFS' Southwest Region ``Fish Screening 
Criteria for Anadromous Salmonids, January 1997'' or with any subsequent 
revision.
    (ii) The owner or manager of the diversion allows any NMFS engineer 
or authorized officer access to the diversion facility for purposes of 
inspection and determination of continued compliance with the criteria.
    (iii) On a case by case basis, NMFS or an Authorized Officer will 
review and approve a juvenile fish screen design and construction plan 
and schedule that the water diverter proposes for screen installation. 
The plan and schedule will describe interim operation measures to avoid 
take of threatened salmonids. NMFS may require a commitment of 
compensatory mitigation if implementation of the plan and schedule is 
terminated prior to completion. If the plan and schedule are not met, or 
if a schedule modification is made that is not approved by NMFS or 
Authorized Officer, or if the screen installation deviates from the 
approved design, the water diversion will be subject to take 
prohibitions and mitigation.
    (iv) This limit on the prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section 
does not encompass any impacts of reduced flows resulting from the 
diversion or impacts caused during installation of the diversion device. 
These impacts are subject to the prohibition on take of listed 
salmonids.
    (10) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) do not apply 
to routine road maintenance activities provided that:
    (i) The activity results from routine road maintenance activity 
conducted by ODOT employees or agents that complies with ODOT's 
Transportation Maintenance Management System Water Quality and Habitat 
Guide (July, 1999); or by employees or agents of a state, county, city 
or port that complies with a program substantially similar to that 
contained in the ODOT Guide that is determined to meet or exceed the 
protections provided by the ODOT Guide; or by employees or agents of a 
state, county, city or port that complies with a routine road 
maintenance program that meets proper functioning habitat conditions as 
described further in subparagraph (ii) following. NMFS' approval of 
state, city, county, or port programs that are equivalent to the ODOT 
program, or of any amendments, shall be a written approval by NMFS 
Northwest or Southwest Regional Administrator, whichever is appropriate. 
Any jurisdiction desiring its routine road maintenance activities to be 
within this limit must first commit in writing to apply management 
practices that result in protections equivalent to or better than those 
provided by the ODOT Guide, detailing how it will assure adequate 
training, tracking, and reporting, and

[[Page 355]]

describing in detail any dust abatement practices it requests to be 
covered.
    (ii) NMFS finds the routine road maintenance activities of any 
state, city, county, or port to be consistent with the conservation of 
listed salmonids' habitat when it contributes, as does the ODOT Guide, 
to the attainment and maintenance of properly functioning condition 
(PFC). NMFS defines PFC as the sustained presence of natural habitat-
forming processes that are necessary for the long-term survival of 
salmonids through the full range of environmental variation. Actions 
that affect salmonid habitat must not impair properly functioning 
habitat, appreciably reduce the functioning of already impaired habitat, 
or retard the long-term progress of impaired habitat toward PFC. 
Periodically, NMFS will evaluate an approved program for its 
effectiveness in maintaining and achieving habitat function that 
provides for conservation of the listed salmonids. Whenever warranted, 
NMFS will identify to the jurisdiction ways in which the program needs 
to be altered or strengthened. Changes may be identified if the program 
is not protecting desired habitat functions, or where even with the 
habitat characteristics and functions originally targeted, habitat is 
not supporting population productivity levels needed to conserve the 
ESU. If any jurisdiction within the limit does not make changes to 
respond adequately to the new information in the shortest amount of time 
feasible, but not longer than one year, NMFS will publish notification 
in the Federal Register announcing its intention to withdraw the limit 
so that take prohibitions would then apply to the program as to all 
other activity not within a limit. Such an announcement will provide for 
a comment period of no less than 30 days, after which NMFS will make a 
final determination whether to subject the activities to the ESA section 
9(a)(1) prohibitions.
    (iii) Prior to implementing any changes to a program within this 
limit the jurisdiction provides NMFS a copy of the proposed change for 
review and approval as within this limit.
    (iv) Prior to approving any state, city, county, or port program as 
within this limit, or approving any substantive change in a program 
within this limit, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal 
Register announcing the availability of the program or the draft changes 
for public review and comment. Such an announcement will provide for a 
comment period of not less than 30 days.
    (v) Pesticide and herbicide spraying is not included within this 
limit, even if in accord with the ODOT guidance.
    (11) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) do not apply 
to activities within the City of Portland, Oregon Parks and Recreation 
Department's (PP&R) Pest Management Program (March 1997), including its 
Waterways Pest Management Policy updated December 1, 1999, provided 
that:
    (i) Use of only the following chemicals is included within this 
limit on the take prohibitions: Round Up, Rodeo, Garlon 3A, Surfactant 
LI-700, Napropamide, Cutrine Plus, and Aquashade.
    (ii) Any chemical use is initiated in accord with the priorities and 
decision processes of the Department's Pest Management Policy, including 
the Waterways Pest Management Policy, updated December 1, 1999.
    (iii) Any chemical use within a 25 ft. (7.5 m) buffer complies with 
the buffer application constraints contained in PP&R's Waterways Pest 
Management Policy (update December 1, 1999).
    (iv) Prior to implementing any changes to this limit, the PP&R 
provides NMFS with a copy of the proposed change for review and approval 
as within this limit.
    (v) Prior to approving any substantive change in a program within 
this limit, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register 
announcing the availability of the program or the draft changes for 
public review and comment. Such an announcement will provide for a 
comment period of no less than 30 days.
    (vi) NMFS' approval of amendments shall be a written approval by 
NMFS Northwest Regional Administrator.

[[Page 356]]

    (vii) NMFS finds the PP&R Pest Management Program activities to be 
consistent with the conservation of listed salmonids' habitat by 
contributing to the attainment and maintenance of properly functioning 
condition (PFC). NMFS defines PFC as the sustained presence of a 
watershed's natural habitat-forming processes that are necessary for the 
long-term survival of salmonids through the full range of environmental 
variation. Actions that affect salmonid habitat must not impair properly 
functioning habitat, appreciably reduce the functioning of already 
impaired habitat, or retard the long-term progress of impaired habitat 
toward PFC. Periodically, NMFS will evaluate the effectiveness of an 
approved program in maintaining and achieving habitat function that 
provides for conservation of the listed salmonids. Whenever warranted, 
NMFS will identify to the jurisdiction ways in which the program needs 
to be altered or strengthened. Changes may be identified if the program 
is not protecting desired habitat functions, or where even with the 
habitat characteristics and functions originally targeted, habitat is 
not supporting population productivity levels needed to conserve the 
ESU. If any jurisdiction within the limit does not make changes to 
respond adequately to the new information in the shortest amount of time 
feasible, but not longer than 1 year, NMFS will publish notification in 
the Federal Register announcing its intention to withdraw the limit so 
that take prohibitions would then apply to the program as to all other 
activity not within a limit. Such an announcement will provide for a 
comment period of no less than 30 days, after which NMFS will make a 
final determination whether to subject the activities to the ESA section 
9(a)(1) prohibitions.
    (12) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) do not apply 
to municipal, residential, commercial, and industrial (MRCI) development 
(including redevelopment) activities provided that:
    (i) Such development occurs pursuant to city, county, or regional 
government ordinances or plans that NMFS has determined are adequately 
protective of listed species; or within the jurisdiction of the Metro 
regional government in Oregon and pursuant to ordinances that Metro has 
found comply with its Urban Growth Management Functional Plan 
(Functional Plan) following a determination by NMFS that the Functional 
Plan is adequately protective. NMFS approval or determinations about any 
MRCI development ordinances or plans, including the Functional Plan, 
shall be a written approval by NMFS Northwest or Southwest Regional 
Administrator, whichever is appropriate. NMFS will apply the following 
12 evaluation considerations when reviewing MRCI development ordinances 
or plans to assess whether they adequately conserve listed salmonids by 
maintaining and restoring properly functioning habitat conditions:
    (A) MRCI development ordinance or plan ensures that development will 
avoid inappropriate areas such as unstable slopes, wetlands, areas of 
high habitat value, and similarly constrained sites.
    (B) MRCI development ordinance or plan adequately avoids stormwater 
discharge impacts to water quality and quantity or to the hydrograph of 
the watershed, including peak and base flows of perennial streams.
    (C) MRCI development ordinance or plan provides adequately 
protective riparian area management requirements to attain or maintain 
PFC around all rivers, estuaries, streams, lakes, deepwater habitats, 
and intermittent streams. Compensatory mitigation is provided, where 
necessary, to offset unavoidable damage to PFC due to MRCI development 
impacts to riparian management areas.
    (D) MRCI development ordinance or plan avoids stream crossings by 
roads, utilities, and other linear development wherever possible, and, 
where crossings must be provided, minimize impacts through choice of 
mode, sizing, and placement.
    (E) MRCI development ordinance or plan adequately protects 
historical stream meander patterns and channel migration zones and 
avoids hardening of stream banks and shorelines.

[[Page 357]]

    (F) MRCI development ordinance or plan adequately protects wetlands 
and wetland functions, including isolated wetlands.
    (G) MRCI development ordinance or plan adequately preserves the 
hydrologic capacity of permanent and intermittent streams to pass peak 
flows.
    (H) MRCI development ordinance or plan includes adequate provisions 
for landscaping with native vegetation to reduce need for watering and 
application of herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizer.
    (I) MRCI development ordinance or plan includes adequate provisions 
to prevent erosion and sediment run-off during construction.
    (J) MRCI development ordinance or plan ensures that water supply 
demands can be met without impacting flows needed for threatened 
salmonids either directly or through groundwater withdrawals and that 
any new water diversions are positioned and screened in a way that 
prevents injury or death of salmonids.
    (K) MRCI development ordinance or plan provides necessary 
enforcement, funding, reporting, and implementation mechanisms and 
formal plan evaluations at intervals that do not exceed 5 years.
    (L) MRCI development ordinance and plan complies with all other 
state and Federal environmental and natural resource laws and permits.
    (ii) The city, county or regional government provides NMFS with 
annual reports regarding implementation and effectiveness of the 
ordinances, including: any water quality monitoring information the 
jurisdiction has available; aerial photography (or some other graphic 
display) of each MRCI development or MRCI expansion area at sufficient 
detail to demonstrate the width and vegetation condition of riparian 
set-backs; information to demonstrate the success of stormwater 
management and other conservation measures; and a summary of any flood 
damage, maintenance problems, or other issues.
    (iii) NMFS finds the MRCI development activity to be consistent with 
the conservation of listed salmonids' habitat when it contributes to the 
attainment and maintenance of PFC. NMFS defines PFC as the sustained 
presence of a watershed's habitat-forming processes that are necessary 
for the long-term survival of salmonids through the full range of 
environmental variation. Actions that affect salmonid habitat must not 
impair properly functioning habitat, appreciably reduce the functioning 
of already impaired habitat, or retard the long-term progress of 
impaired habitat toward PFC. Periodically, NMFS will evaluate an 
approved program for its effectiveness in maintaining and achieving 
habitat function that provides for conservation of the listed salmonids. 
Whenever warranted, NMFS will identify to the jurisdiction ways in which 
the program needs to be altered or strengthened. Changes may be 
identified if the program is not protecting desired habitat functions, 
or where even with the habitat characteristics and functions originally 
targeted, habitat is not supporting population productivity levels 
needed to conserve the ESU. If any jurisdiction within the limit does 
not make changes to respond adequately to the new information in the 
shortest amount of time feasible, but not longer than 1 year, NMFS will 
publish notification in the Federal Register announcing its intention to 
withdraw the limit so that take prohibitions would then apply to the 
program as to all other activity not within a limit. Such an 
announcement will provide for a comment period of no less than 30 days, 
after which NMFS will make a final determination whether to subject the 
activities to the ESA section 9(a)(1) prohibitions.
    (iv) Prior to approving any city, county, or regional government 
ordinances or plans as within this limit, or approving any substantive 
change in an ordinance or plan within this limit, NMFS will publish 
notification in the Federal Register announcing the availability of the 
ordinance or plan or the draft changes for public review and comment. 
Such an announcement will provide for a comment period of no less than 
30 days.
    (13) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a) do not apply 
to non-Federal

[[Page 358]]

forest management activities conducted in the State of Washington 
provided that:
    (i) The action is in compliance with forest practice regulations 
adopted and implemented by the Washington Forest Practices Board that 
NMFS has found are at least as protective of habitat functions as are 
the regulatory elements of the Forests and Fish Report dated April 29, 
1999, and submitted to the Forest Practices Board by a consortium of 
landowners, tribes, and state and Federal agencies.
    (ii) All non-regulatory elements of the Forests and Fish Report are 
being implemented.
    (iii) Actions involving use of herbicides, pesticides, or fungicides 
are not included within this limit.
    (iv) Actions taken under alternative plans are included in this 
limit provided that the Washington Department of Natural Resources 
(WDNR) finds that the alternate plans protect physical and biological 
processes at least as well as the state forest practices rules and 
provided that NMFS, or any resource agency or tribe NMFS designates, has 
the opportunity to review the plan at every stage of the development and 
implementation. A plan may be excluded from this limit if, after such 
review, WDNR determines that the plan is not likely to adequately 
protect listed salmon.
    (v) Prior to determining that regulations adopted by the Forest 
Practice Board are at least as protective as the elements of the Forests 
and Fish Report, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register 
announcing the availability of the Report and regulations for public 
review and comment.
    (vi) NMFS finds the activities to be consistent with the 
conservation of listed salmonids' habitat by contributing to the 
attainment and maintenance of PFC. NMFS defines PFC as the sustained 
presence of a watershed's natural habitat-forming processes that are 
necessary for the long-term survival of salmonids through the full range 
of environmental variation. Actions that affect salmonid habitat must 
not impair properly functioning habitat, appreciably reduce the 
functioning of already impaired habitat, or retard the long-term 
progress of impaired habitat toward PFC. Programs must meet this 
biological standard in order for NMFS to find they qualify for a 
habitat-related limit. NMFS uses the best available science to make 
these determinations. NMFS may review and revise previous findings as 
new scientific information becomes available. NMFS will evaluate the 
effectiveness of the program in maintaining and achieving habitat 
function that provides for conservation of the listed salmonids. If the 
program is not adequate, NMFS will identify to the jurisdiction ways in 
which the program needs to be altered or strengthened. Changes may be 
identified if the program is not protecting desired habitat functions or 
where even with the habitat characteristics and functions originally 
targeted, habitat is not supporting population productivity levels 
needed to conserve the ESU. If Washington does not make changes to 
respond adequately to the new information, NMFS will publish 
notification in the Federal Register announcing its intention to 
withdraw the limit on activities associated with the program. Such an 
announcement will provide for a comment period of no less than 30 days, 
after which NMFS will make a final determination whether to subject the 
activities to the ESA section 9(a)(1) take prohibitions.
    (vii) NMFS approval of regulations shall be a written approval by 
NMFS Northwest Regional Administrator.
    (c) Affirmative Defense. In connection with any action alleging a 
violation of the prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section with 
respect to the threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 
223.102(a), any person claiming the benefit of any limit listed in 
paragraph (b) of this section or Sec. 223.204(a) shall have a defense 
where the person can demonstrate that the limit is applicable and was in 
force, and that the person fully complied with the limit at the time of 
the alleged violation. This defense is an affirmative defense that must 
be raised, pleaded, and proven by the proponent. If proven, this defense 
will be an absolute defense to liability under section 9(a)(1)(G) of the 
ESA with respect to the alleged violation.
    (d) Severability. The provisions of this section and the various 
applications

[[Page 359]]

thereof are distinct and severable from one another. If any provision or 
the application thereof to any person or circumstances is stayed or 
determined to be invalid, such stay or invalidity shall not affect other 
provisions, or the application of such provisions to other persons or 
circumstances, which can be given effect without the stayed or invalid 
provision or application.

         Appendix A to Sec. 223.203--List of Guidance Documents

    The following is a list of documents cited in the regulatory text.

Sec. 223.204  Tribal plans.

    (a) Limits on the prohibitions. The prohibitions of Sec. 223.203(a) 
of this subpart relating to threatened species of salmonids listed in 
Sec. 223.102 do not apply to any activity undertaken by a tribe, tribal 
member, tribal permittee, tribal employee, or tribal agent in compliance 
with a Tribal resource management plan (Tribal Plan), provided that the 
Secretary determines that implementation of such Tribal Plan will not 
appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of the listed 
salmonids. In making that determination the Secretary shall use the best 
available biological data (including any tribal data and analysis) to 
determine the Tribal Plan's impact on the biological requirements of the 
species, and will assess the effect of the Tribal Plan on survival and 
recovery, consistent with legally enforceable tribal rights and with the 
Secretary's trust responsibilities to tribes.
    (b) Consideration of a Tribal Plan. (1) A Tribal Plan may include 
but is not limited to plans that address fishery harvest, artificial 
production, research, or water or land management, and may be developed 
by one tribe or jointly with other tribes. The Secretary will consult on 
a government-to-government basis with any tribe that so requests and 
will provide to the maximum extent practicable technical assistance in 
examining impacts on listed salmonids and other salmonids as tribes 
develop Tribal resource management plans that meet the management 
responsibilities and needs of the tribes. A Tribal Plan must specify the 
procedures by which the tribe will enforce its provisions.
    (2) Where there exists a Federal court proceeding with continuing 
jurisdiction over the subject matter of a Tribal Plan, the plan may be 
developed and implemented within the ongoing Federal Court proceeding. 
In such circumstances, compliance with the Tribal Plan's terms shall be 
determined within that Federal Court proceeding.
    (3) The Secretary shall seek comment from the public on the 
Secretary's pending determination whether or not implementation of a 
Tribal Plan will appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and 
recovery of the listed salmonids.
    (4) The Secretary shall publish notification in the Federal Register 
of any determination regarding a Tribal Plan and the basis for that 
determination.

<R05>
Sec. 223.206  Exceptions to prohibitions relating to sea turtles.

    (a) Permits--(1) Scientific research, education, zoological 
exhibition, or species enhancement permits. The Assistant Administrator 
may issue permits authorizing activities which would otherwise be 
prohibited under Sec. 223.205(a) for scientific or educational 
purposes, for zoological exhibition, or to enhance the propagation or 
survival of threatened species of sea turtles, in accordance with and 
subject to the conditions of part 222, subpart C--General Permit 
Procedures.
    (2) Incidental-take permits. The Assistant Administrator may issue 
permits authorizing activities that would otherwise be prohibited under 
Sec. 223.205(a) in accordance with section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act (16 
U.S.C. 1539(a)(1)(B)), and in accordance with, and subject to, the 
implementing regulations in part 222 of this chapter. Such permits may 
be issued for the incidental taking of threatened and endangered species 
of sea turtles.
    (b) Exception for injured, dead, or stranded specimens. If any 
member of any threatened species of sea turtle is found injured, dead, 
or stranded, any agent or employee of the National Marine Fisheries 
Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Coast Guard, or any 
other Federal land or water management agency, or any agent or employee 
of a state agency responsible for fish and wildlife who is designated by 
his or her agency for such purposes, may, when acting in the course of 
his or her official duties, take such specimens without a permit if such 
taking is necessary to aid a sick, injured, or stranded specimen or 
dispose of a dead specimen or salvage a dead specimen which may be 
useful for scientific study. Whenever possible, live specimens shall be 
returned to their aquatic environment as soon as possible. Every action 
shall be reported in writing to the Assistant Administrator within 30 
days, and reports of further occurrence shall be made as deemed 
appropriate by the Assistant Administrator until the specimen is either 
returned to its environment or disposed of. Reports shall be mailed by 
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Assistant 
Administrator and shall contain the following information:
    (1) Name and position of the official or employee involved;
    (2) Description of the specimen(s) involved;
    (3) Date and location of disposal;
    (4) Circumstances requiring the action;
    (5) Method of disposal;
    (6) Disposition of the specimen(s), including, where the specimen(s) 
has been retained in captivity, a description of the place and means of 
confinement, and the measures taken for its maintenance and care; and
    (7) Such other information as the Assistant Administrator may 
require.
    (c) Exception for research or conservation. Any employee or agent of 
the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, or 
a state fish and wildlife agency operating a conservation program 
pursuant to the terms of a Cooperative Agreement with the National 
Marine Fisheries Service or the Fish and Wildlife Service in accordance 
with section 6(c) of the Act, designated by his or her agency for such 
purposes, may, when acting in the course of his or her official duties, 
take any threatened species to carry out scientific research or 
conservation programs. All such takings shall be reported within 30 days 
of the taking to the Assistant Administrator who may request additional 
reports of the taking and research at the Assistant Administrator's 
discretion.
    (d) Exception for incidental taking. The prohibitions against taking 
in

[[Page 362]]

Sec. 223.205(a) do not apply to the incidental take of any member of a 
threatened species of sea turtle (i.e., a take not directed towards such 
member) during fishing or scientific research activities, to the extent 
that those involved are in compliance with all applicable requirements 
of paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(11) of this section, or in compliance 
with the terms and conditions of an incidental take permit issued 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (1) Handling and resuscitation requirements. (i) Any specimen taken 
incidentally during the course of fishing or scientific research 
activities must be handled with due care to prevent injury to live 
specimens, observed for activity, and returned to the water according to 
the following procedures:
    (A) Sea turtles that are actively moving or determined to be dead as 
described in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section must be released 
over the stern of the boat. In addition, they must be released only when 
fishing or scientific collection gear is not in use, when the engine 
gears are in neutral position, and in areas where they are unlikely to 
be recaptured or injured by vessels.
    (B) Resuscitation must be attempted on sea turtles that are 
comatose, or inactive, as determined in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, by:
    (1) Placing the turtle on its bottom shell (plastron) so that the 
turtle is right side up and elevating its hindquarters at least 6 inches 
(15.2 cm) for a period of 4 up to 24 hours. The amount of the elevation 
depends on the size of the turtle; greater elevations are needed for 
larger turtles. Periodically, rock the turtle gently left to right and 
right to left by holding the outer edge of the shell (carapace) and 
lifting one side about 3 inches (7.6 cm) then alternate to the other 
side. Gently touch the eye and pinch the tail (reflex test) periodically 
to see if there is a response.
    (2) Sea turtles being resuscitated must be shaded and kept damp or 
moist but under no circumstance be placed into a container holding 
water. A water-soaked towel placed over the head, carapace, and flippers 
is the most effective method in keeping a turtle moist.
    (3) Sea turtles that revive and become active must be released over 
the stern of the boat only when fishing or scientific collection gear is 
not in use, when the engine gears are in neutral position, and in areas 
where they are unlikely to be recaptured or injured by vessels. Sea 
turtles that fail to respond to the reflex test or fail to move within 4 
hours (up to 24, if possible) must be returned to the water in the same 
manner as that for actively moving turtles.
    (C) A turtle is determined to be dead if the muscles are stiff 
(rigor mortis) and/or the flesh has begun to rot; otherwise the turtle 
is determined to be comatose or inactive and resuscitation attempts are 
necessary.
    (ii) In addition to the provisions of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
section, a person aboard a vessel in the Atlantic, including the 
Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, that has pelagic or bottom 
longline gear on board and that has been issued, or is required to have, 
a limited access permit for highly migratory species under Sec. 635.4 
of this title, must comply with the handling and release requirements 
specified in Sec. 635.21 of this title.
    (iii) Any specimen taken incidentally during the course of fishing 
or scientific research activities must not be consumed, sold, landed, 
offloaded, transshipped, or kept below deck.
    (2) Gear requirements for trawlers--(i) TED requirement for shrimp 
trawlers. Any shrimp trawler that is in the Atlantic Area or Gulf Area 
must have an approved TED installed in each net that is rigged for 
fishing. A net is rigged for fishing if it is in the water, or if it is 
shackled, tied, or otherwise connected to any trawl door or board, or to 
any tow rope, cable, pole or extension, either on board or attached in 
any manner to the shrimp trawler. Exceptions to the TED requirement for 
shrimp trawlers are provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Exemptions from the TED requirement--(A) Alternative tow-time 
restrictions. A shrimp trawler is exempt from the TED requirements of 
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section if it complies with the alternative 
tow-time restrictions in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section and if it:

[[Page 363]]

    (1) Has on board no power or mechanical-advantage trawl retrieval 
system (i.e., any device used to haul any part of the net aboard);
    (2) Is a bait shrimper that retains all live shrimp on board with a 
circulating seawater system, if it does not possess more than 32 lb. 
(14.5 kg) of dead shrimp on board, if it has a valid original state 
bait-shrimp license, and if the state license allows the licensed vessel 
to participate in the bait shrimp fishery exclusively;
    (3) Has only a pusher-head trawl, skimmer trawl, or wing net rigged 
for fishing;
    (4) Is in an area during a period for which tow-time restrictions 
apply under paragraphs (d)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section, if it 
complies with all applicable provisions imposed under those paragraphs; 
or
    (5) Is using a single test net (try net) with a headrope length of 
12 ft (3.6 m) or less and with a footrope length of 15 ft (4.6 m) or 
less, if it is pulled immediately in front of another net or is not 
connected to another net in any way, if no more than one test net is 
used at a time, and if it is not towed as a primary net, in which case 
the exemption under this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) applies to the test 
net.
    (B) Exempted gear or activities. The following fishing gear or 
activities are exempted from the TED requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(i) 
of this section:
    (1) A beam or roller trawl, if the frame is outfitted with rigid 
vertical bars, and if none of the spaces between the bars, or between 
the bars and the frame, exceeds 4 inches (10.2 cm); and
    (2) A shrimp trawler fishing for, or possessing, royal red shrimp, 
if royal red shrimp constitutes at least 90 percent (by weight) of all 
shrimp either found on board, or offloaded from that shrimp trawler.
    (iii) Gear requirement--summer flounder trawlers--(A) TED 
requirement. (1) Any summer flounder trawler in the summer flounder 
fishery-sea turtle protection area must have an approved TED installed 
in each net that is rigged for fishing. A net is rigged for fishing if 
it is in the water, or if it is shackled, tied, or otherwise connected 
to any trawl door or board, or to any tow rope, cable, pole or 
extension, either on board or attached in any manner to the summer 
flounder trawler. Exceptions to the TED requirement for summer flounder 
trawlers are provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.
    (2) Any approved hard TED or special hard TED installed in a summer 
flounder trawl must be installed in a TED extension. The TED extension 
is a cylindrical piece of webbing distinct from the main trawl's body, 
wings, codend, and any other net extension(s). The TED extension must be 
constructed of webbing no larger than 3.5 inch (8.9 cm) stretched mesh. 
The TED extension must extend at least 24 inches (61.0 cm) but not more 
than 36 inches (91.4 cm) forward of the leading edge of the TED and aft 
of the trailing edge of the grid.
    (B) Exemptions from the TED requirement. Any summer flounder trawler 
north of 35[deg]46.1[min] N. lat. (Oregon Inlet, NC) from January 15 
through March 15 annually is exempt from the TED requirement of 
paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, unless the Assistant 
Administrator determines that TED use is necessary to protect sea 
turtles or ensure compliance, pursuant to the procedures of paragraph 
(d)(4) of this section.
    (C) Monitoring. Summer flounder trawlers must carry onboard a NMFS-
approved observer if requested by the Southeast Regional Administrator 
or the Northeast Regional Administrator. A written notification will be 
sent to the address specified for the vessel in either the NMFS or state 
fishing permit application, or to the address specified for registration 
or documentation purposes, or upon written notification otherwise served 
on the owner or operator of the vessel. Owners and operators must comply 
with the terms and conditions specified in such written notification. 
All NMFS-approved observers will report any violations of this section, 
or other applicable regulations and laws. Information collected by 
observers may be used for enforcement purposes.
    (D) Additional sea turtle conservation measures. The Assistant 
Administrator may impose other such restrictions upon summer flounder 
trawlers as the Assistant Administrator deems necessary or appropriate 
to protect sea

[[Page 364]]

turtles and ensure compliance, pursuant to the procedures of paragraph 
(d)(4) of this section. Such measures may include, but are not limited 
to, a requirement to use TEDs in areas other than summer flounder 
fishery-sea turtle protection area, a requirement to use limited tow-
times, and closure of the fishery.
    (3) Tow-time restrictions--(i) Duration of tows. If tow-time 
restrictions are utilized pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii), (d)(3)(ii), 
or (d)(3)(iii) of this section, a shrimp trawler must limit tow times. 
The tow time is measured from the time that the trawl door enters the 
water until it is removed from the water. For a trawl that is not 
attached to a door, the tow time is measured from the time the codend 
enters the water until it is removed from the water. Tow times may not 
exceed:
    (A) 55 minutes from April 1 through October 31; and
    (B) 75 minutes from November 1 through March 31.
    (ii) Alternative--special environmental conditions. The Assistant 
Administrator may allow compliance with tow-time restrictions, as an 
alternative to the TED requirement of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this 
section, if the Assistant Administrator determines that the presence of 
algae, seaweed, debris or other special environmental conditions in a 
particular area makes trawling with TED-equipped nets impracticable.
    (iii) Substitute--ineffectiveness of TEDs. The Assistant 
Administrator may require compliance with tow-time restrictions, as a 
substitute for the TED requirement of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this 
section, if the Assistant Administrator determines that TEDs are 
ineffective in protecting sea turtles.
    (iv) Notice; applicability; conditions. The Assistant Administrator 
will publish notification concerning any tow-time restriction imposed 
under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section in the Federal 
Register and will announce it in summary form on channel 16 of the 
marine VHF radio. A notification of tow-time restrictions will include 
findings in support of these restrictions as an alternative to, or as 
substitute for, the TED requirements. The notification will specify the 
effective dates, the geographic area where tow-time restrictions apply, 
and any applicable conditions or restrictions that the Assistant 
Administrator determines are necessary or appropriate to protect sea 
turtles and ensure compliance, including, but not limited to, a 
requirement to carry observers, to register vessels in accordance with 
procedures at paragraph (d)(5) of this section, or for all shrimp 
trawlers in the area to synchronize their tow times so that all trawl 
gear remains out of the water during certain times. A notification 
withdrawing tow-time restrictions will include findings in support of 
that action.
    (v) Procedures. The Assistant Administrator will consult with the 
appropriate fishery officials (state or Federal) where the affected 
shrimp fishery is located in issuing a notification concerning tow-time 
restrictions. An emergency notification can be effective for a period of 
up to 30 days and may be renewed for additional periods of up to 30 days 
each if the Assistant Administrator finds that the conditions 
necessitating the imposition of tow-time restrictions continue to exist. 
The Assistant Administrator may invite comments on such an action, and 
may withdraw or modify the action by following procedures similar to 
those for implementation. The Assistant Administrator will implement any 
permanent tow-time restriction through rulemaking.
    (4) Limitations on incidental takings during fishing activities--(i) 
Limitations. The exemption for incidental takings of sea turtles in 
paragraph (d) of this section does not authorize incidental takings 
during fishing activities if the takings:
    (A) Would violate the restrictions, terms, or conditions of an 
incidental take statement or biological opinion;
    (B) Would violate the restrictions, terms, or conditions of an 
incidental take permit; or
    (C) May be likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a species 
listed under the Act.
    (ii) Determination; restrictions on fishing activities. The 
Assistant Administrator may issue a determination that incidental 
takings during fishing activities are unauthorized. Pursuant thereto, 
the Assistant Administrator

[[Page 365]]

may restrict fishing activities in order to conserve a species listed 
under the Act, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the 
fishing activities of vessels subject to paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section. The Assistant Administrator will take such action if the 
Assistant Administrator determines that restrictions are necessary to 
avoid unauthorized takings that may be likely to jeopardize the 
continued existence of a listed species. The Assistant Administrator may 
withdraw or modify a determination concerning unauthorized takings or 
any restriction on fishing activities if the Assistant Administrator 
determines that such action is warranted.
    (iii) Notice; applicability; conditions. The Assistant Administrator 
will publish a notification of a determination concerning unauthorized 
takings or a notification concerning the restriction of fishing 
activities in the Federal Register. The Assistant Administrator will 
provide as much advance notice as possible, consistent with the 
requirements of the Act, and will announce the notification in summary 
form on channel 16 of the marine VHF radio. Notification of a 
determination concerning unauthorized takings will include findings in 
support of that determination; specify the fishery, including the target 
species and gear used by the fishery, the area, and the times, for which 
incidental takings are not authorized; and include such other conditions 
and restrictions as the Assistant Administrator determines are necessary 
or appropriate to protect sea turtles and ensure compliance. 
Notification of restriction of fishing activities will include findings 
in support of the restriction, will specify the time and area where the 
restriction is applicable, and will specify any applicable conditions or 
restrictions that the Assistant Administrator determines are necessary 
or appropriate to protect sea turtles and ensure compliance. Such 
conditions and restrictions may include, but are not limited to, 
limitations on the types of fishing gear that may be used, tow-time 
restrictions, alteration or extension of the periods of time during 
which particular tow-time requirements apply, requirements to use TEDs, 
registration of vessels in accordance with procedures at paragraph 
(d)(5) of this section, and requirements to provide observers. 
Notification of withdrawal or modification will include findings in 
support of that action.
    (iv) Procedures. The Assistant Administrator will consult with the 
appropriate fisheries officials (state or Federal) where the fishing 
activities are located in issuing notification of a determination 
concerning unauthorized takings or notification concerning the 
restriction of fishing activities. An emergency notification will be 
effective for a period of up to 30 days and may be renewed for 
additional periods of up to 30 days each, except that emergency 
placement of observers will be effective for a period of up to 180 days 
and may be renewed for an additional period of 60 days. The Assistant 
Administrator may invite comments on such action, and may withdraw or 
modify the action by following procedures similar to those for 
implementation. The Assistant Administrator will implement any permanent 
determination or restriction through rulemaking.
    (5)-(6) [Reserved]
    (7) Restrictions applicable to gillnet fisheries in North Carolina. 
No person may fish with gillnet fishing gear which has a stretched mesh 
size larger than 4 \1/4\ inches (10.8 cm), annually from September 1 
through December 15, in the inshore waters of Pamlico Sound, North 
Carolina, and all contiguous tidal waters, bounded on the north by 
35[deg]46.3[min] N. lat., on the south by 35[deg]00[min] N. lat., and on 
the west by 76[deg]30[min] W. long.
    (8) Restrictions applicable to large mesh gillnet fisheries in the 
mid-Atlantic region. No person may fish with or possess on board a boat, 
any gillnet with a stretched mesh size 7-inches (17.8 cm) or larger, 
unless such gillnets are covered with canvas or other similar material 
and lashed or otherwise securely fastened to the deck or the rail, and 
all buoys larger than 6-inches (15.2 cm) in diameter, high flyers, and 
anchors are disconnected. This restriction applies in the Atlantic 
Exclusive Economic Zone (as defined in 50 CFR 600.10) during the 
following time periods and in the following area:

[[Page 366]]

    (i) Waters north of 33[deg] 51.0[min] N. (North Carolina/South 
Carolina border at the coast) and south of 35[deg] 46.0[min] N. (Oregon 
Inlet) at any time;
    (ii) Waters north of 35[deg] 46.0[min] N. (Oregon Inlet) and south 
of 3[deg] 22.5[min] N. (Currituck Beach Light, NC) from March 16 through 
January 14;
    (iii) Waters north of 36[deg] 22.5[min] N. (Currituck Beach Light, 
NC) and south of 37[deg] 34.6[min] N. (Wachapreague Inlet, VA) from 
April 1 through January 14; and
    (iv) Waters north of 37[deg] 34.6[min] N. (Wachapreague Inlet, VA) 
and south of 37[deg] 56.0[min] N. (Chincoteague, VA) from April 16 
through January 14.
    (9) Restrictions applicable to Pacific pelagic longline vessels. In 
addition to the general prohibitions specified in Sec. 600.725 of 
chapter VI of this title, it is unlawful for any person who is not 
operating under a western Pacific longline permit under Sec. 665.801 of 
this title to do any of the following on the high seas of the Pacific 
Ocean east of 150[deg] W. long. and north of the Equator (0[deg] N. 
lat.):
    (i) Direct fishing effort toward the harvest of swordfish (Xiphias 
gladius) using longline gear.
    (ii) Possess a light stick on board a longline vessel. A light stick 
as used in this paragraph is any type of light emitting device, 
including any fluorescent glow bead, chemical, or electrically powered 
light that is affixed underwater to the longline gear.
    (iii) An operator of a longline vessel subject to this section may 
land or possess no more than 10 swordfish from a fishing trip where any 
part of the trip included fishing east of 150[deg] W. long. and north of 
the equator (0[deg] N. lat.).
    (iv) Fail to employ basket-style longline gear such that the 
mainline is deployed slack when fishing.
    (v) When a conventional monofilament longline is deployed by a 
vessel, no fewer than 15 branch lines may be set between any two floats. 
Vessel operators using basket-style longline gear must set a minimum of 
10 branch lines between any 2 floats.
    (vi) Longline gear must be deployed such that the deepest point of 
the main longline between any two floats, i.e., the deepest point in 
each sag of the main line, is at a depth greater than 100 m (328.1 ft or 
54.6 fm) below the sea surface.
    (10) Restrictions applicable to pound nets in Virginia--(i) Offshore 
pound net leaders in Pound Net Regulated Area I. During the time period 
of May 6 through July 15 each year, any offshore pound net leader in 
Pound Net Regulated Area I must meet the definition of a modified pound 
net leader. Any offshore pound net leader in Pound Net Regulated Area I 
that does not meet the definition of a modified pound net leader must be 
removed from the water prior to May 6 and may not be reset until July 
16.
    (ii) Nearshore pound net leaders in Pound Net Regulated Area I and 
all pound net leaders in Pound Net Regulated Area II. During the time 
period of May 6 to July 15 each year, any nearshore pound net leader in 
Pound Net Regulated Area I and any pound net leader in Pound Net 
Regulated Area II must have only mesh size less than 12 inches (30.5 cm) 
stretched mesh and may not employ stringers. Any nearshore pound net 
leader in Pound Net Regulated Area I or any pound net leader in Pound 
Net Regulated Area II with stretched mesh measuring 12 inches (30.5 cm) 
or greater, or with stringers, must be removed from the water prior to 
May 6 and may not be reset until July 16. A pound net leader is exempt 
from these measures only if it meets the definition of a modified pound 
net leader.
    (iii) Protocol for measuring mesh size. This protocol applies to 
measuring mesh size in leaders described in 50 CFR 223.206(d)(10)(i) and 
223.206(d)(10)(ii). Mesh sizes are measured by a wedge-shaped gauge 
having a taper of 0.79 in. (2 cm) in 3.15 in. (8 cm) and a thickness of 
0.09 in. (2.3 mm) inserted into the meshes under a pressure or pull of 
11.02 lb. (5 kg). The mesh size is the average of the measurement of any 
series of 20 consecutive meshes. The mesh in the leader is measured at 
or near the horizontal and vertical center of a leader panel.
    (iv) Reporting requirement. At any time during the year, if a sea 
turtle is taken live and uninjured in a pound net operation, the 
operator of the vessel must report the incident to the NMFS Northeast 
Regional Office, (978) 281-

[[Page 367]]

9328 or fax (978) 281-9394, within 24 hours of returning from the trip 
in which the incidental take was discovered. The report shall include a 
description of the sea turtles condition at the time of release and the 
measures taken as required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. At any 
time during the year, if a sea turtle is taken in a pound net operation, 
and is determined to be injured, or if a turtle is captured dead, the 
operator of the vessel shall immediately notify NMFS Northeast Regional 
Office and the appropriate rehabilitation or stranding network, as 
determined by NMFS Northeast Regional Office.
    (v) Monitoring. Owners or operators of pound net fishing operations 
must allow access to the pound net gear so it may be observed by a NMFS-
approved observer if requested by the Northeast Regional Administrator. 
All NMFS-approved observers will report any violations of this section, 
or other applicable regulations and laws. Information collected by 
observers may be used for law enforcement purposes.
    (vi) Expedited modification of restrictions and effective dates. 
From May 6 to July 15 of each year, if NMFS receives information that 
one sea turtle is entangled alive or that one sea turtle is entangled 
dead, and NMFS determines that the entanglement contributed to its 
death, in pound net leaders that are in compliance with the restrictions 
described in paragraph (d)(10)(ii) of this section, NMFS may issue a 
final rule modifying the restrictions on pound net leaders as necessary 
to protect threatened sea turtles. Such modifications may include, but 
are not limited to, reducing the maximum allowable mesh size of pound 
net leaders and prohibiting the use of pound net leaders regardless of 
mesh size. In addition, if information indicates that a significant 
level of sea turtle entanglements, impingements or strandings will 
likely continue beyond July 15, NMFS may issue a final rule extending 
the effective date of the restrictions, including any additional 
restrictions imposed under this paragraph (d)(10)(vi), for an additional 
15 days, but not beyond July 30, to protect threatened sea turtles.
    (vii) Modified leader inspection program. Any fisherman planning to 
use a modified pound net leader in Pound Net Regulated Area I or Pound 
Net Regulated Area II at any time from May 6 through July 15 must make 
his/her leader available for inspection and tagging by NMFS according to 
the following procedures. At least 72 hours prior to deploying a 
modified pound net leader, the fisherman or his/her representative must 
call NMFS at 757-414-0128 between 7:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. local time and 
arrange for a mutually agreeable meeting date, time, and place. The 
fisherman must meet NMFS at such location at the designated time and 
allow NMFS to examine his or her gear to help ensure the leader is in 
compliance with the definition of a modified pound net leader. NMFS will 
ascertain whether the leader meets the following four criteria taken 
from that definition: (1) the lower portion of the leader is mesh and 
the upper portion consists of only vertical lines; (2) the mesh size is 
equal to or less than 8 inches (20.3 cm) stretched mesh; (3) the 
vertical lines are equal to or greater than \5/16\ inch (0.8 cm) in 
diameter and strung vertically at least every 2 feet (61 cm); and (4) 
the vertical lines are hard lay lines with a level of stiffness 
equivalent to the stiffness of a \5/16\ inch (0.8 cm) diameter line 
composed of polyester wrapped around a blend of polypropylene and 
polyethylene and containing approximately 42 visible twists of strands 
per foot of line. NMFS will also measure the height of the mesh in 
relation to the height of the entire leader. During the inspection, the 
fisherman must provide accurate and specific latitude and longitude 
coordinates of the location at which the leader will be deployed, as 
well as information on the low water depth at each end of the modified 
leader at the site at which it will be set. If the leader meets the four 
criteria previously described, the measurement of the height of the mesh 
in relation to the total height of the leader is recorded, and the low 
water depth and latitude and longitude coordinates of the specific 
location at which the leader will be deployed are provided and recorded, 
the leader will pass inspection. If it passes inspection, NMFS will tag 
the leader with one or more

[[Page 368]]

tamperproof tags. Removing or tampering with any tag placed on the 
leader by NMFS is prohibited. If a tag is damaged, destroyed, or lost 
due to any cause, the fisherman must call NMFS at 757-414-0128 within 48 
hours of discovery to report this incident. After the leader is 
determined to have passed inspection, NMFS will issue a letter to the 
fisherman indicating that the leader passed inspection. The fisherman 
must retain that letter on board his/her vessel tending the inspected 
leader at all times it is deployed. Modified pound net leaders must pass 
inspection prior to being used at any time during the time period from 
May 6 through July 15 of each year.
    (11) Restrictions applicable to sea scallop dredges in the mid-
Atlantic--(i) Gear Modification. During the time period of May 1 through 
November 30, any vessel with a sea scallop dredge and required to have a 
Federal Atlantic sea scallop fishery permit, regardless of dredge size 
or vessel permit category, that enters waters south of 41[deg] 9.0' N. 
latitude, from the shoreline to the outer boundary of the Exclusive 
Economic Zone must have on each dredge a chain mat described as follows. 
The chain mat must be composed of horizontal (``tickler'') chains and 
vertical (``up-and-down'') chains that are configured such that the 
openings formed by the intersecting chains have no more than 4 sides. 
The vertical and horizontal chains must be hung to cover the opening of 
the dredge bag such that the vertical chains extend from the back of the 
cutting bar to the sweep. The horizontal chains must intersect the 
vertical chains such that the length of each side of the openings formed 
by the intersecting chains is less than or equal to 14 inches (35.5 cm) 
with the exception of the side of any individual opening created by the 
sweep. The chains must be connected to each other with a shackle or link 
at each intersection point. The measurement must be taken along the 
chain, with the chain held taut, and include one shackle or link at the 
intersection point and all links in the chain up to, but excluding, the 
shackle or link at the other intersection point.
    (ii) Any vessel that enters the waters described in paragraph 
(d)(11)(i) of this section and that is required to have a Federal 
Atlantic sea scallop fishery permit must have the chain mat 
configuration installed on all dredges for the duration of the trip.
    (iii) Vessels subject to the requirements in paragraphs (d)(11)(i) 
and (d)(11)(ii) of this section transiting waters south of 
41[deg]9.0[min] N. latitude, from the shoreline to the outer boundary of 
the Exclusive Economic Zone, will be exempted from the chain-mat 
requirements provided the dredge gear is stowed in accordance with Sec. 
648.23(b) and there are no scallops on-board.

<R05>
Sec. 223.207  Approved TEDs.

    Any netting, webbing, or mesh that may be measured to determine 
compliance with this section is subject to measurement, regardless of 
whether it is wet or dry. Any such measurement will be of the stretched 
mesh size.
    (a) Hard TEDs. Hard TEDs are TEDs with rigid deflector grids and are 
categorized as ``hooped hard TEDs'' and ``single-grid hard TEDs'' such 
as the Matagorda and Georgia TED (Figures 3 & 4 to this part). Hard TEDs 
complying with the following generic design criteria are approved TEDs:
    (1) Construction materials--(i) Single-grid and inshore hooped hard 
TED. A single-grid hard TED or an inshore hooped hard TED must be 
constructed of one or a combination of the following materials, unless 
otherwise specifically restricted below, with minimum dimensions as 
follows:

[[Page 369]]

    (A) Solid steel rod with a minimum outside diameter of \1/4\ inch 
(0.64 cm);
    (B) Fiberglass or aluminum rod with a minimum outside diameter of 
\1/2\ inch (1.27 cm); or
    (C) Steel or aluminum round, oval, or rectangular tubing with a 
minimum outside diameter or width of \1/2\ inch (1.27 cm) and a minimum 
wall thickness of \1/8\ inch (0.32 cm; also known as schedule 40 
tubing).
    (D) Steel or aluminum flat bar with dimensions no less than \1/4\ 
inch (0.64 cm) in thickness by 1\1/2\ inches (3.85 cm) in depth. For 
flat bar less than \3/8\ inch (0.95 cm) in thickness, a horizontal brace 
bar to reinforce the deflector bars must be permanently attached to the 
frame and the rear face of each of the deflector bars within 4 inches 
(10.2 cm) of the midpoint of the TED frame. The horizontal brace bar 
must be constructed of approved material consistent with paragraph 
(a)(1)(i) of this section. The horizontal brace bar may be offset behind 
the deflector bars, using spacer bars, not to exceed 5 inches (12.7 cm) 
in length and constructed of the same size or larger flat bar as the 
deflector bars.
    (ii) Offshore hooped hard TED. An offshore hooped hard TED must be 
constructed of aluminum, with minimum dimensions as follows:
    (A) Solid rod with a minimum outside diameter of \5/8\ inch (1.59 
cm); or
    (B) Tubing with a minimum outside diameter of 1 inch (2.54 cm) and a 
minimum wall thickness of \1/8\ inch (0.32 cm).
    (2) Method of attachment. A hard TED must be sewn into the trawl 
around the entire circumference of the TED with heavy twine.
    (3) Angle of deflector bars. (i) The angle of the deflector bars 
must be between 30[deg] and 55[deg] from the normal, horizontal flow 
through the interior of the trawl, except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) For any shrimp trawler fishing in the Gulf SFSTCA or the 
Atlantic SFSTCA, a hard TED with the position of the escape opening at 
the bottom of the net when the net is in its deployed position, the 
angle of the deflector bars from the normal, horizontal flow through the 
interior of the trawl, at any point, must not exceed 55[deg], and the 
angle of the bottom-most 4 inches (10.2 cm) of each deflector bar, 
measured along the bars, must not exceed 45[deg] (Figures 14a and 14b to 
this part).
    (4) Space between bars. The space between deflector bars and the 
deflector bars and the TED frame must not exceed 4 inches (10.2 cm).
    (5) Direction of bars. The deflector bars must run from top to 
bottom of the TED, as the TED is positioned in the net, except that up 
to four of the bottom bars and two of the top bars, including the frame, 
may run from side to side of the TED. The deflector bars must be 
permanently attached to the TED frame or to the horizontal bars, if 
used, at both ends.
    (6) Position of the escape opening. The escape opening must be made 
by removing a rectangular section of webbing from the trawl, except for 
a TED with an escape opening size described at paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(A) 
for which the escape opening may alternatively be made by making a 
horizontal cut along the same plane as the TED. The escape opening must 
be centered on and immediately forward of the frame at either the top or 
bottom of the net when the net is in the deployed position. The escape 
opening must be at the top of the net when the slope of the deflector 
bars from forward to aft is upward, and must be at the bottom when such 
slope is downward. The passage from the mouth of the trawl through the 
escape opening must be completely clear of any obstruction or 
modification, other than those specified in paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (7) Size of escape opening--(i) Hooped hard TEDs--(A) Escape opening 
for inshore hooped hard TED. The inshore hooped hard TED escape opening 
must have a horizontal measurement of no less than 35 inches (89 cm) 
wide and a forward measurement of no less than 27 inches (69 cm). A 
hinged door frame may be used to partially cover the escape opening as 
provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this section. Alternatively, a webbing 
flap may be used as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. The 
resultant opening with a webbing flap must be a minimum width of 35 
inches (89 cm) and a minimum height

[[Page 370]]

of 20 inches (51 cm), with each measurement taken simultaneously. This 
opening may only be used in inshore waters, except it may not be used in 
the inshore waters of Georgia and South Carolina.
    (B) Escape opening for offshore hooped hard TED. The offshore hooped 
hard TED escape opening must have a horizontal measurement of no less 
than 40 inches (102 cm) wide and a forward measurement of no less than 
35 inches (89 cm). A hinged door frame may be used to partially cover 
the escape opening as provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this section. 
Alternatively, a webbing flap may be used as provided in paragraph 
(d)(3)(ii) of this section. The resultant escape opening with a webbing 
flap must have a stretched mesh circumference of no less than 142 inches 
(361 cm).
    (ii) Single-grid hard TEDs. On a single-grid hard TED, the 
horizontal cut(s) for the escape opening may not be narrower than the 
outside width of the TED frame minus 4 inches (10.2 cm) on both sides of 
the grid, when measured as a straight line width. Fore-and-aft cuts to 
remove a rectangular piece of webbing must be made from the ends of the 
horizontal cuts along a single row of meshes along each side. The 
overall size of the escape opening must match one of the following 
specifications:
    (A) 44-inch inshore opening. The escape opening must have a minimum 
width of 44 inches (112 cm) and a minimum height of 20 inches (51 cm) 
with each measurement taken separately. A webbing flap, as described in 
paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, may be used with this escape hole, 
so long as this minimum opening size is achieved. This opening may only 
be used in inshore waters, except it may not be used in the inshore 
waters of Georgia and South Carolina.
    (B) The 71-inch offshore opening: The two forward cuts of the escape 
opening must not be less than 26 inches (66 cm) long from the points of 
the cut immediately forward of the TED frame. The resultant length of 
the leading edge of the escape opening cut must be no less than 71 
inches (181 cm) with a resultant circumference of the opening being 142 
inches (361 cm) (Figure 12 to this part). A webbing flap, as described 
in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, may be used with this escape 
hole, so long as this minimum opening size is achieved. Either this 
opening or the one described in paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(C) of this section 
must be used in all offshore waters and in all inshore waters in Georgia 
and South Carolina, but may also be used in other inshore waters.
    (C) Double cover offshore opening. The two forward cuts of the 
escape opening must not be less than 20 inches (51 cm) long from the 
points of the cut immediately forward of the TED frame. The resultant 
length of the leading edge of the escape opening cut must be no less 
than 56 inches (142 cm)(Figure 16 to this part illustrates the 
dimensions of these cuts). A webbing flap, as described in paragraph 
(d)(3)(iii) of this section, may be used with this escape hole. Either 
this opening or the one described in paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(B) of this 
section must be used in all offshore waters but also in all inshore 
waters in Georgia and South Carolina, and may be used in other inshore 
waters.
    (D) Boone Wedge Cut opening. (Figure 17 to this part). The escape 
opening is made by making two cuts in the TED extension; one cut is fore 
and aft (i.e., along the length of the extension) and the other cut is 
horizontal to the extension. The horizontal cut is 50 meshes long and 
begins at a point 4 inches (10.2 cm) inward from the outside edge of the 
grid on one side and runs to the same point on the opposite side of the 
grid. The fore and aft cut begins in the middle of the horizontal cut 
and runs forward 49.5 inches (125.7 cm) toward the front edge of the TED 
extension. The added wedge of webbing is attached along its two leading 
edges to the edges of the fore and aft cut. The webbing wedge is made of 
1\7/8\ inch (4.8 cm) webbing and must have at least 41 meshes measuring 
at least 72 inches wide (182.9 cm) along its base (aft edge). The height 
of the wedge must measure at least 48.5 inches (123 cm). The top of the 
wedge is two bars across the leading edge then cut with a 1 point then 6 
bar taper. A webbing flap, as described in paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this 
section, may be used with this escape opening, so long as the minimum 
opening size is achieved.

[[Page 371]]

    (E) Large TED openings. (Figures 18a, 18b, and 18c to this part). 
Large TED escape openings may be utilized in the following 
configurations:
    (1) A triangular cut (Figure 18a to this part), where the base of 
the triangle is defined by a straight-line measurement of the opening 
between the webbing attachment points on the TED frame that is no less 
than 40 inches (102 cm). The two side cuts of the triangle must be an 
all-bar taper from the point at which the webbing attaches to the TED 
frame to the apex of the triangle cut. Each side cut of the triangle 
must measure no less than 53 inches (135 cm). The sum of the straight-
line base measurement and two side cuts must be no less than 147 inches 
(373 cm). The side cuts of the triangular opening may be reinforced 
using rib lines attached from the TED frame to the apex of the opening. 
A webbing flap, as described in either paragraph (d)(3)(ii) or 
(d)(3)(iii) of this section, may be used with this escape opening, so 
long as the minimum opening size is achieved.
    (2) All-bar or all-points side cuts and a horizontal leading edge 
cut (Figures 18b and 18c to this part), where the straight-line 
measurement of the opening between the webbing attachment points on the 
TED frame may not be less than 40 inches (102 cm), and the two side cuts 
of the escape opening must not be less than 26 inches (66 cm) long from 
the points of the cut immediately forward of the TED frame. Only all-bar 
or all-points side cuts may be used; no combination tapers may be used 
when making the side cuts. The sum of the straight-line base measurement 
and the stretched measurements of the side cuts and leading edge cut 
must be no less than 147 inches (373 cm). A webbing flap, as described 
in either paragraph (d)(3)(ii) or (d)(3)(iii) of this section, may be 
used with this escape opening, so long as the minimum opening size is 
achieved.
    (8) Size of hoop or grid--(i) Hooped hard TED--(A) Inshore hooped 
hard TED. The front hoop on an inshore hooped hard TED must have an 
inside horizontal measurement of at least 35 inches (89 cm) and an 
inside vertical measurement of at least 30 inches (76 cm). The minimum 
clearance between the deflector bars and the forward edge of the escape 
opening must be at least 20 inches (51 cm).
    (B) Offshore hooped hard TED. The front hoop on an offshore hooped 
hard TED must have an inside horizontal measurement of at least 40 
inches (102 cm) and an inside vertical measurement of at least 30 inches 
(76 cm). The minimum clearance between the deflector bars and the 
forward edge of the escape opening must be at least 23\1/4\ inches (59 
cm).
    (ii) Single-grid hard TED. A single-grid hard TED must have a 
minimum outside horizontal and vertical measurement of 32 inches (81 
cm). The required outside measurements must be at the mid-point of the 
deflector grid.
    (9) Flotation. Floats must be attached to the top one-half of all 
hard TEDs with bottom escape openings. The floats may be attached either 
outside or inside the net, but not to a flap. Floats attached inside the 
net must be behind the rear surface of the TED. Floats must be attached 
with heavy twine or rope. Floats must be constructed of aluminum, hard 
plastic, expanded polyvinyl chloride, or expanded ethylene vinyl acetate 
unless otherwise specified. The requirements of this paragraph may be 
satisfied by compliance with either the dimension requirements of 
paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section, or the buoyancy requirements of 
paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section, or the buoyancy-dimension 
requirements of paragraph (a)(9)(iii) of this section. If roller gear is 
used pursuant to paragraph (d)(5) of this section, the roller gear must 
be included in the circumference measurement of the TED or the total 
weight of the TED.
    (i) Float dimension requirements. (A) For hard TEDs with a 
circumference of 120 inches (304.8 cm) or more, a minimum of either one 
round, aluminum or hard plastic float, no smaller than 9.8 inches (25.0 
cm) in diameter, or two expanded polyvinyl chloride or expanded ethylene 
vinyl acetate floats, each no smaller than 6.75 inches (17.2 cm) in 
diameter by 8.75 inches (22.2 cm) in length, must be attached.
    (B) For hard TEDs with a circumference of less than 120 inches 
(304.8 cm), a minimum of either one round, aluminum or hard plastic 
float, no

[[Page 372]]

smaller than 9.8 inches (25.0 cm) in diameter, or one expanded polyvinyl 
chloride or expanded ethylene vinyl acetate float, no smaller than 6.75 
inches (17.2 cm) in diameter by 8.75 inches (22.2 cm) in length, must be 
attached.
    (ii) Float buoyancy requirements. Floats of any size and in any 
combination must be attached such that the combined buoyancy of the 
floats, as marked on the floats, equals or exceeds the weight of the 
hard TED, as marked on the TED. The buoyancy of the floats and the 
weight of the TED must be clearly marked on the floats and the TED as 
follows:
    (A) Float buoyancy markings. Markings on floats must be made in 
clearly legible raised or recessed lettering by the original 
manufacturer. The marking must identify the buoyancy of the float in 
water, expressed in grams or kilograms, and must include the metric unit 
of measure. The marking may additionally include the buoyancy in English 
units. The marking must identify the nominal buoyancy for the 
manufactured float.
    (B) TED weight markings. The marking must be made by the original 
TED manufacturer and must be permanent and clearly legible. The marking 
must identify the in-air, dry weight of the TED, expressed in grams or 
kilograms, and must include the metric unit of measure. The marking may 
additionally include the weight in English units. The marked weight must 
represent the actual weight of the individual TED as manufactured. 
Previously manufactured TEDs may be marked upon return to the original 
manufacturer. Where a TED is comprised of multiple detachable 
components, the weight of each component must be separately marked.
    (iii) Buoyancy-dimension requirements. Floats of any size and in any 
combination, provided that they are marked pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(9)(ii)(A) of this section, must be attached such that the combined 
buoyancy of the floats equals or exceeds the following values:
    (A) For floats constructed of aluminum or hard plastic, regardless 
of the size of the TED grid, the combined buoyancy must equal or exceed 
14 lb (6.4 kg);
    (B) For floats constructed of expanded polyvinyl chloride or 
expanded ethylene vinyl acetate, where the circumference of the TED is 
120 inches (304.8 cm) or more, the combined buoyancy must equal or 
exceed 20 lb (9.1 kg); or
    (C) For floats constructed of expanded polyvinyl chloride or 
expanded ethylene vinyl acetate, where the circumference of the TED is 
less than 120 inches (304.8 cm), the combined buoyancy must equal or 
exceed 10 lb (4.5 kg).
    (b) Special Hard TEDs. Special hard TEDs are hard TEDs which do not 
meet all of the design and construction criteria of the generic 
standards specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The following 
special hard TEDs are approved TEDs:
    (1) Flounder TED. (Figure 10 to this part). The Flounder TED is 
approved for use only in the Atlantic summer flounder bottom trawl 
fishery. The Flounder TED is not an approved TED for use by shrimp 
trawlers. The Flounder TED must be constructed of at least 1\1/4\ inch 
(3.2 cm) outside diameter aluminum or steel pipe with a wall thickness 
of at least \1/8\ inch (0.3 cm). It must have a rectangular frame with 
outside dimensions which can be no less than 51 inches (129.5 cm) in 
length and 32 inches (81.3 cm) in width. It must have at least five 
vertical deflector bars, with bar spacings of no more than 4 inches 
(10.2 cm). The vertical bars must be connected to the top of the frame 
and to a single horizontal bar near the bottom. The horizontal bar must 
be connected at both ends to the sides of the frame and parallel to the 
bottom bar of the frame. There must be a space no larger than 10 inches 
(25.4 cm) between the horizontal bar and the bottom bar of the frame. 
One or more additional vertical bars running from the bottom bar to the 
horizontal bar must divide the opening at the bottom into two or more 
rectangles, each with a maximum height of 10 inches (25.4 cm) and a 
maximum width of 14\1/2\ inches (36.8 cm). This TED must comply with 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The angle of the deflector bars must 
be between 30 and 55 from the normal, horizontal flow through the 
interior of the trawl. The entire width of

[[Page 373]]

the escape opening from the trawl must be centered on and immediately 
forward of the frame at the top of the net when the net is in its 
deployed position. The escape opening must be at the top of the net and 
the slope of the deflector bars from forward to aft is upward. The 
escape opening must be cut horizontally along the same plane as the TED, 
and may not be cut in a fore-and-aft direction. The cut in the trawl 
webbing for the escape opening cannot be narrower than the outside width 
of the grid minus 4 inches (10.2 cm) on both sides of the grid, when 
measured as a straight line width. The resulting escape opening in the 
net webbing must measure at least 35 inches (88.9 cm) in horizontal taut 
length and, simultaneously, 12 inches (30.5 cm) in vertical taut height. 
The vertical measurement must be taken at the midpoint of the horizontal 
measurement. This TED may not be configured with a bottom escape 
opening. Installation of an accelerator funnel is not permitted with 
this TED.
    (2) Weedless TED. The weedless TED must meet all the requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section for single-grid hard TEDs, with the 
exception of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(5) of this section. The weedless 
TED must be constructed of at least 1-1/4 inch (3.2 cm) outside diameter 
aluminum with a wall thickness of at least \1/8\ inch (0.3 cm). The 
deflector bars must run from top to bottom of the TED, as the TED is 
positioned in the net. The ends of the deflectors bars on the side of 
the frame opposite to the escape opening must be permanently attached to 
the frame. The ends of the deflector bars nearest the escape opening are 
not attached to the frame and must lie entirely forward of the leading 
edge of the outer frame. The ends of the unattached deflector bars must 
be no more than 4 inches (10.2 cm) from the frame and may not extend 
past the frame. A horizontal brace bar to reinforce the deflector bars, 
constructed of the same size or larger pipe as the deflector bars, must 
be permanently attached to the frame and the rear face of each of the 
deflector bars at a position anywhere between the vertical mid-point of 
the frame and the unattached ends of the deflector bars. The horizontal 
brace bar may be offset behind the deflector bars, using spacer bars, 
not to exceed 5 inches (12.7 cm) in length and constructed of the same 
size or larger pipe as the deflector bars. See Figure 15.
    (3) Boone Big Boy TED. The Boone Big Boy TED is a single-grid hard 
TED with a minimum outside horizontal and vertical measurement of 36.5 
inches (92.7 cm) and 48 inches (121.9 cm), respectively. The frame must 
be constructed of steel rod with a minimum outside diameter of \3/8\ 
inch (0.95 cm). The deflector bars must be constructed of steel rod with 
a minimum outside diameter of \1/4\ inch (0.64 cm). The space between 
the deflector bars must not exceed 4 inches (10.2 cm). A horizontal 
brace bar constructed of at least \1/4\-inch (0.64-cm) steel rod must be 
permanently attached to the frame and the rear face of each of the 
deflector bars within 4 inches (10.2 cm) of the midpoint of the TED 
frame. The horizontal brace bar may be offset behind the deflector bars, 
using spacer bars, not to exceed 5 inches (12.7 cm) in length and must 
be constructed of the same size or larger material as the deflector 
bars. The Boone Big Boy TED must be used with the Boone Wedge Cut escape 
opening specified in (a)(7)(ii)(D) of this section. The angle of the 
deflector bars must be between 30[deg] and 55[deg] from the normal, 
horizontal flow through the interior of the trawl. The Boone Big Boy TED 
is exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, 
and may be installed at 55[deg] when fishing in the Gulf SFSTCA or the 
Atlantic SFSTCA.
    (4) Modified flounder TED. (Figure 11 to this part). The modified 
flounder TED is approved for use only in the Atlantic summer flounder 
bottom trawl fishery. The modified flounder TED is not an approved TED 
for use by shrimp trawlers. The modified flounder TED incorporates two 
separate grid frames that are attached together. The frames of the grids 
must be constructed of at least 1\1/4\ inch (3.2 cm) outside diameter 
aluminum or steel pipe with a wall thickness of at least \1/8\ inch 
(0.32 cm). Each of the two grids of the modified flounder TED must have 
outside dimensions of at least 36 inches (91.4 cm) in height and at 
least 48 inches (121.9 cm) in width. The upper grid is

[[Page 374]]

equipped with vertical deflector bars, which must be constructed of 
aluminum or steel flat bar with a minimum depth of 1\1/4\ inches (3.2 
cm) and a minimum thickness of \3/8\ inch (0.95 cm). Vertical deflector 
bars must be connected to the top and bottom of the upper grid. The 
space between the deflector bars of the upper grid must not exceed 4 
inches (10.2 cm). The lower grid is fabricated with both horizontal and 
vertical deflector bars, creating four narrow horizontal openings at the 
top, and three large rectangular openings along the bottom of the grid. 
The lower grid must have at least three horizontal deflector bars, 
constructed of aluminum or steel flat bar with a minimum depth of 1\1/2\ 
inches (3.8 cm) and a minimum thickness of \3/8\ inch (0.95 cm), which 
are connected to each side of the grid and angled at 30[deg] from the 
horizontal plane. Below this, a fourth horizontal deflector bar must be 
constructed of aluminum or steel pipe with a wall thickness of at least 
\1/8\ inch (0.32 cm) and with a 1\1/4\ inch (3.2 cm) outside diameter. 
These horizontal deflector bars must yield maximum spacings of 4\1/2\ 
inches (11.4 cm), 5\1/2\ inches (14.0 cm), 5\1/2\ inches (14.0 cm), and 
4\1/2\ inches (11.4 cm), as constructed from top to bottom and measured 
between the leading edges of adjacent deflector bars. There must be a 
maximum 10-inch (25.4 cm) space between the bottom-most horizontal 
deflector pipe bar and the grid frame bottom. Two additional vertical 
pipe sections running from the bottom of the grid frame to the bottom-
most horizontal deflector pipe bar must divide the opening at the bottom 
into three rectangles, each with a maximum height of 10 inches (25.4 cm) 
and a maximum width of 14 inches (35.6 cm). This TED must comply with 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The upper and lower grids of this TED 
must be laced together with heavy twine no less than \1/4\ inch (0.64 
cm) in diameter in order to maintain a consistent angle in both 
sections. There may be a gap between the two sections not to exceed 1 
inch (2.54 cm). The angle of the entire TED frame must be between 
30[deg] and 45[deg] from the normal, horizontal flow through the 
interior of the trawl. The entire width of the escape opening from the 
trawl must be centered on and immediately forward of the frame at the 
top of the net when the net is in its deployed position. The slope of 
the grids and the vertical deflector bars from forward to aft is upward. 
The modified flounder TED must use an escape opening consistent with 
paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(B), (C), (D), or (E) of this section. A webbing 
flap, as described in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this 
section, may be used with this escape opening, so long as the minimum 
opening size is achieved. This TED may not be configured with a bottom 
escape opening. Installation of an accelerator funnel is not permitted 
with this TED.
    (c) Soft TEDs. Soft TEDs are TEDs with deflector panels made from 
polypropylene or polyethylene netting. The following soft TEDs are 
approved TEDs:
    (1) Parker TED. The Parker TED is a soft TED, consisting of a single 
triangular panel, composed of webbing of two different mesh sizes, that 
forms a complete barrier inside a trawl and that angles toward an escape 
opening in the top of the trawl.
    (i) Excluder Panel. (Figure 5 to this part) The excluder panel of 
the Parker TED must be constructed of a single triangular piece of 8-
inch (20.3 cm) stretched mesh webbing and two trapezoidal pieces of 4-
inch (10.2-cm) stretched mesh webbing. The webbing must consist of 
number 48 (3-mm thick) or larger polypropylene or polyethylene webbing 
that is heat-set knotted or braided. The leading edge of the 8-inch 
(20.3-cm) mesh panel must be 36 meshes wide. The 8-inch (20.3-cm) mesh 
panel must be tapered on each side with all-bar cuts to converge on an 
apex, such that the length of each side is 36 bars. The leading edges of 
the 4-inch (10.2-cm) mesh panels must be 8 meshes wide. The edges of the 
4-inch (10.2-cm) mesh panels must be cut with all-bar cuts running 
parallel to each other, such that the length of the inner edge is 72 
bars and the length of the outer edge is 89 bars and the resulting fore-
and-aft edge is 8 meshes deep. The two 4-inch (10.2-cm) mesh panels must 
be sewn to the 8-inch (20.3-cm) mesh panel to create a single triangular 
excluder panel. The 72-bar edge of each 4-

[[Page 375]]

inch (10.2-cm) mesh panel must be securely joined with twine to one of 
the 36-bar edges of the 8-inch (20.3-cm) mesh panel, tied with knots at 
each knot of the 4-inch (10.2-cm) webbing and at least two wraps of 
twine around each bar of 4-inch (10.2-cm) mesh and the adjoining bar of 
the 8-inch (20.3-cm) mesh. The adjoining fore-and-aft edges of the two 
4-inch (10.2-cm) mesh panels must be sewn together evenly.
    (ii) Limitations on which trawls may have a Parker TED installed. 
The Parker TED must not be installed or used in a two-seam trawl with a 
tongue, nor in a triple-wing trawl (a trawl with a tongue along the 
headrope and a second tongue along the footrope). The Parker TED may be 
installed and used in any other trawl if the taper of the body panels of 
the trawl does not exceed 4b1p and if it can be properly installed in 
compliance with paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (iii) Panel installation--(A) Leading edge attachment. The leading 
edge of the excluder panel must be attached to the inside of the bottom 
of the trawl across a straight row of meshes. For a two-seam trawl or a 
four-seam, tapered-wing trawl, the row of meshes for attachment to the 
trawl must run the entire width of the bottom body panel, from seam to 
seam. For a four-seam, straight-wing trawl, the row of meshes for 
attachment to the trawl must run the entire width of the bottom body 
panel and half the height of each wing panel of the trawl. Every mesh of 
the leading edge of the excluder panel must be evenly sewn to this row 
of meshes; meshes may not be laced to the trawl. The row of meshes for 
attachment to the trawl must contain the following number of meshes, 
depending on the stretched mesh size used in the trawl:
    (1) For a mesh size of 2\1/4\ inches (5.7 cm), 152-168 meshes;
    (2) For a mesh size of 2\1/8\ inches (5.4 cm), 161-178 meshes;
    (3) For a mesh size of 2 inches (5.1 cm), 171-189 meshes;
    (4) For a mesh size of 1\7/8\ inches (4.8 cm), 182-202 meshes;
    (5) For a mesh size of 1\3/4\ inches (4.4 cm), 196-216 meshes;
    (6) For a mesh size of 1\5/8\ inches (4.1 cm), 211-233 meshes;
    (7) For a mesh size of 1\1/2\ inches (3.8 cm), 228-252 meshes;
    (8) For a mesh size of 1\3/8\ inches (3.5 cm), 249-275 meshes; and
    (9) For a mesh size of 1\1/4\ inches (3.2 cm), 274-302 meshes.
    (B) Apex attachment. The apex of the triangular excluder panel must 
be attached to the inside of the top body panel of the trawl at the 
centerline of the trawl. The distance, measured aft along the centerline 
of the top body panel from the same row of meshes for attachment of the 
excluder panel to the bottom body panel of the trawl, to the apex 
attachment point must contain the following number of meshes, depending 
on the stretched mesh size used in the trawl:
    (1) For a mesh size of 2\1/4\ inches (5.7 cm), 78-83 meshes;
    (2) For a mesh size of 2\1/8\ inches (5.4 cm), 83-88 meshes;
    (3) For a mesh size of 2 inches (5.1 cm), 87-93 meshes;
    (4) For a mesh size of 1\7/8\ inches (4.8 cm), 93-99 meshes;
    (5) For a mesh size of 1\3/4\ inches (4.4 cm), 100-106 meshes;
    (6) For a mesh size of 1\5/8\ inches (4.1 cm), 107-114 meshes;
    (7) For a mesh size of 1\1/2\ inches (3.8 cm), 114-124 meshes;
    (8) For a mesh size of 1\3/8\ inches (3.5 cm), 127-135 meshes; and
    (9) For a mesh size of 1\1/4\ inches (3.2 cm), 137-146 meshes.
    (C) Side attachment. The sides of the excluder panel must be 
attached evenly to the inside of the trawl from the outside attachment 
points of the excluder panel's leading edge to the apex of the excluder 
panel. Each side must be sewn with the same sewing sequence, and, if the 
sides of the excluder panel cross rows of bars in the trawl, the 
crossings must be distributed evenly over the length of the side 
attachment.
    (iv) Escape opening. The escape opening for the Parker soft TED must 
match one of the following specifications:
    (A) Inshore opening. This opening is the minimum size opening that 
may be used in inshore waters, except it may not be used in the inshore 
waters of Georgia and South Carolina, in which a larger minimum opening 
is required. A slit at least 56 inches (1.4 m) in taut

[[Page 376]]

length must be cut along the centerline of the top body panel of the 
trawl net immediately forward of the apex of the panel webbing. The slit 
must not be covered or closed in any manner. The edges and end points of 
the slit must not be reinforced in any way; for example, by attaching 
additional rope or webbing or by changing the orientation of the 
webbing.
    (B) Offshore opening. A horizontal cut extending from the attachment 
of one side of the deflector panel to the trawl to the attachment of the 
other side of the deflector panel to the trawl must be made in a single 
row of meshes across the top of the trawl and measure at least 96 inches 
(243.8 cm) in taut width. All trawl webbing above the deflector panel 
between the 96-inch (243.8-cm) cut and edges of the deflector panel must 
be removed. A rectangular flap of nylon webbing not larger than 2-inch 
(5.1-cm) stretched mesh may be sewn to the forward edge of the escape 
opening. The width of the flap must not be larger than the width of the 
forward edge of the escape opening. The flap must not extend more than 
12 inches (30.5 cm) beyond the rear point of the escape opening. The 
sides of the flap may be attached to the top of the trawl but must not 
be attached farther aft than the row of meshes through the rear point of 
the escape opening. One row of steel chain not larger than \1/4\ inch 
(0.64 cm) may be sewn evenly to the back edge of the flap. The stretched 
length of the chain must not exceed 96 inches (244 cm). A Parker TED 
using the escape opening described in this paragraph meets the 
requirements of Sec. 223.206(d)(2)(iv)(B). This opening or one that is 
larger must be used in all offshore waters and in the inshore waters of 
Georgia and South Carolina. It also may be used in other inshore 
waters..
    (2) [Reserved]
    (d) Allowable modifications to hard TEDs and special hard TEDs. 
Unless otherwise prohibited in paragraph (b) of this section, only the 
following modifications may be made to an approved hard TED or an 
approved special hard TED:
    (1) Floats. In addition to floats required pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(9) of this section, floats may be attached to the top one-half of 
the TED, either outside or inside the net, but not to a flap. Floats 
attached inside the net must be behind the rear surface at the top of 
the TED.
    (2) Accelerator funnel. An accelerator funnel may be installed in 
the trawl, if it is made of net webbing material with a stretched mesh 
size of not greater than 1\5/8\ inches (4 cm), if it is inserted in the 
net immediately forward of the TED, and if its rear edge does not extend 
past the bars of the TED. The trailing edge of the accelerator funnel 
may be attached to the TED on the side opposite the escape opening if 
not more than one-third of the circumference of the funnel is attached, 
and if the inside horizontal opening as described above in maintained. 
In a bottom opening TED only the top one-third of the circumference of 
the funnel may be attached to the TED. In a top opening TED only the 
bottom one-third of the circumference of the funnel may be attached to 
the TED.
    (i) In inshore waters, other than the inshore waters of Georgia and 
South Carolina in which a larger opening is required, the inside 
horizontal opening of the accelerator funnel must be at least 44 inches 
(112 cm).
    (ii) In offshore waters and the inshore waters of Georgia and South 
Carolina, the inside horizontal opening of the accelerator funnel must 
be at least 71 inches (180 cm).
    (3) Webbing flap. A webbing flap may be used to cover the escape 
opening under the following conditions: No device holds it closed or 
otherwise restricts the opening; it is constructed of webbing with a 
stretched mesh size no larger than 2 inches (5.1 cm); it lies on the 
outside of the trawl; it is attached along its entire forward edge 
forward of the escape opening; it is not attached on the sides beyond 
the row of meshes that lies 6 inches (15.2 cm) behind the posterior edge 
of the grid; the sides of the flap are sewn on the same row of meshes 
fore and aft; and the flap does not overlap the escape hole cut by more 
than 5 inches (12.7 cm) on either side.
    (i) 44-inch inshore TED flap. This flap may not extend more than 24 
inches (61 cm) beyond the posterior edge of the grid.

[[Page 377]]

    (ii) 71-inch offshore TED Flap. The flap must be a 133-inch (338-cm) 
by 52-inch (132-cm) piece of webbing. The 133-inch (338-cm) edge of the 
flap is attached to the forward edge of the opening (71-inch (180-cm) 
edge). The flap may extend no more than 24 inches (61 cm) behind the 
posterior edge of the grid (Figure 12 to this part illustrates this 
flap).
    (iii) Double cover offshore TED flap. This flap must be composed of 
two equal size rectangular panels of webbing. Each panel must be no less 
than 58 inches (147.3 cm) wide and may overlap each other no more than 
15 inches (38.1 cm). The panels may only be sewn together along the 
leading edge of the cut. The trailing edge of each panel must not extend 
more than 24 inches (61 cm) past the posterior edge of the grid (Figure 
16 to this part). Each panel may be sewn down the entire length of the 
outside edge of each panel. Paragraph (d)(3) of this section 
notwithstanding, this flap may be installed on either the outside or 
inside of the TED extension. For interior installation, the flap may be 
sewn to the interior of the TED extension along the leading edge and 
sides to a point intersecting the TED frame; however, the flap must be 
sewn to the exterior of the TED extension from the point at which it 
intersects the TED frame to the trailing edge of the flap. Chafing 
webbing described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section may not be used 
with this type of flap.
    (iv) Boone Wedge Cut opening flap. (Figure 17 to this part). This 
escape opening flap is attached to the trailing edge of the horizontal 
cut and the wedge. The flap is made from a piece of 1\7/8\ inch (4.8 cm) 
webbing that is trapezoid in shape. The leading edge must be at least 94 
meshes wide, stretching to at least 164.5 inches (417.8 cm). The 
trailing edge is at least 87 meshes wide and at least 152 inches (386.1 
cm). The two sides are at least 8 meshes long and at least 15 inches 
(38.1 cm). The escape opening flap is attached only to the leading edge 
of the escape opening cut and is not attached along its sides.
    (A) Edge lines. Optional edge lines can be used in conjunction with 
this flap. The line must be made of polyethylene with a maximum diameter 
of \3/8\ inches (.95 cm). A single length of line must be used for each 
flap panel. The line must be sewn evenly to the unattached, inside edges 
and trailing edges, of each flap panel. When edge lines are installed, 
the outside edge of each flap panel must be attached along the entire 
length of the flap panel.
    (B) [Reserved]
    (4) Chafing webbing. A single piece of nylon webbing, with a twine 
size no smaller than size 36 (2.46 mm in diameter), may be attached 
outside of the escape opening webbing flap to prevent chafing on bottom 
opening TEDs. This webbing may be attached along its leading edge only. 
This webbing may not extend beyond the trailing edge or sides of the 
existing escape opening webbing flap, and it must not interfere or 
otherwise restrict the turtle escape opening.
    (5) Roller gear. Roller gear may be attached to the bottom of a TED 
to prevent chafing on the bottom of the TED and the trawl net. When a 
webbing flap is used in conjunction with roller gear, the webbing flap 
must be of a length such that no part of the webbing flap can touch or 
come in contact with any part of the roller gear assembly or the means 
of attachment of the roller gear assembly to the TED, when the trawl net 
is in its normal, horizontal position. Roller gear must be constructed 
according to one of the following design criteria:
    (i) A single roller consisting of hard plastic shall be mounted on 
an axle rod, so that the roller can roll freely about the axle. The 
maximum diameter of the roller shall be 6 inches (15.24 cm), and the 
maximum width of the axle rod shall be 12 inches (30.4 cm). The axle rod 
must be attached to the TED by two support rods. The maximum clearance 
between the roller and the TED shall not exceed 1 inch (2.5 cm) at the 
center of the roller. The support rods and axle rod must be made from 
solid steel or solid aluminum rod no larger than \1/2\ inch (1.28 cm) in 
diameter. The attachment of the support rods to the TED shall be such 
that there are no protrusions (lips, sharp edges, burrs, etc.) on the 
front face of the grid. The axle rod and support rods must lie entirely 
behind the plane of the face of the TED grid.

[[Page 378]]

    (ii) A single roller consisting of hard plastic tubing shall be 
tightly tied to the back face of the TED grid with rope or heavy twine 
passed through the center of the roller tubing. The roller shall lie 
flush against the TED. The maximum outside diameter of the roller shall 
be 3\1/2\ inches (8.0 cm), the minimum outside diameter of the roller 
shall be 2 inches (5.1 cm), and the maximum length of the roller shall 
be 12 inches (30.4 cm). The roller must lie entirely behind the plane of 
the face of the grid.
    (6) Water deflector fin for hooped hard TEDs. On a hooped hard TED, 
a water deflector fin may be welded to the forward edge of the escape 
opening. The fin must be constructed of a flat aluminum bar, up to \3/8\ 
inch (0.95 cm) thick and up to 4 inches (10.2 cm) deep. The fin may be 
as wide as the width of the escape opening, minus 1 inch (2.5 cm). The 
fin must project aft into the TED with an angle between 5[deg] and 
45[deg] from the normal, horizontal plane of the trawl. On an inshore 
hooped hard TED, the clearance between the deflector bars and the 
posterior edge of the deflector fin must be at least 20 inches (51 cm). 
On an offshore hooped hard TED, the clearance between the deflector bars 
and the posterior edge of the deflector fin must be at least 23-1/4 
inches (59 cm).
    (7) Hinged door frame for hooped hard TEDs. A hinged door frame may 
be attached to the forward edge of the escape opening on a hooped hard 
TED. The door frame must be constructed of materials specified at 
paragraphs (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this section for inshore and 
offshore hooped hard TEDs, respectively. The door frame may be covered 
with a single panel of mesh webbing that is taut and securely attached 
with twine to the perimeter of the door frame, with a mesh size not 
greater than that used for the TED extension webbing. The door frame 
must be at least as wide as the TED escape opening. The door frame may 
be a maximum of 24 inches (61 cm) long. The door frame must be connected 
to the forward edge of the escape opening by a hinge device that allows 
the door to open outwards freely. The posterior edge of the door frame, 
in the closed position, must lie at least 12 inches (30 cm) forward of 
the posterior edge of the escape opening. A water deflector fin may be 
welded to the posterior edge of the hinged door frame. The fin must be 
constructed of a flat aluminum bar, up to \3/8\ inch (0.95 cm) thick and 
up to four inches (10.2 cm) deep. The fin may be as wide as the width of 
the escape opening, minus one inch (2.5 cm). The fin must project aft 
into the TED with an angle between 5[deg] and 45[deg] from the normal, 
horizontal plane of the trawl, when the door is in the closed position. 
The clearance between the posterior edge of the escape opening and the 
posterior edge of the door frame or the posterior edge of the water 
deflector fin, if installed, must be no less than 12 inches (30 cm), 
when the door is in the closed position. Two stopper ropes or a hinge 
limiter may be used to limit the maximum opening height of the hinged 
door frame, as long as they do not obstruct the escape opening in any 
way or restrict the free movement of the door to its fully open 
position. When the door is in its fully open position, the minimum 
clearance between any part of the deflector bars and any part of the 
door, including a water deflector fin if installed, must be at least 20 
inches (51 cm) for an inshore hooped hard TED and at least 23\1/4\ 
inches (59 cm) for an offshore hooped hard TED. The hinged door frame 
may not be used in combination with a webbing flap specified at 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section or with a water deflection fin 
specified at paragraph (d)(6) of this section.
    (8) Chauvin shrimp deflector. (Figures 19a and 19b to this part). 
The Chauvin shrimp deflector may be used on any approved TED design, but 
its installation must not reduce the minimum stretched measurements of 
the TED opening. The Chauvin shrimp deflector may not be installed with 
a bottom escape opening. The Chauvin shrimp deflector is constructed 
from a single piece of 3-inch (7.6-cm) inside diameter PVC pipe which 
measures 30 inches (76.2 cm) in length; the ends of the PVC pipe are 
left uncapped. A webbing or mesh bag is made and is used to encase the 
PVC pipe (Figure 19a to this part). The mesh bag is created using a 
single piece of 1\5/8\ inch (4.1 cm) stretched-mesh webbing made of 
nylon or polyethylene with dimensions 57 meshes

[[Page 379]]

wide by 10 meshes deep. The leading edge of the 57-mesh piece of webbing 
is attached around the PVC pipe and back to the row of meshes located 7 
meshes down the 10-mesh length. The ends of the webbing are sewn 
together on each end forming a webbing bag to assure the PVC pipe 
remains encased in the webbing. This leaves a 3-mesh tail hanging from 
the encased PVC pipe. The 3-mesh tail of the encased PVC pipe is then 
sewn to a single row of meshes on the inside of the trawl along the 57-
mesh edge, 3 meshes ahead of the forward cut of the TED escape opening. 
This would allow a 3-mesh overlap to the left and right of the forward 
cut (Figure 19b to this part).
    (9) Brace bar. (Figure 14a of this part). A horizontal brace bar may 
be added to a TED if the brace bar is constructed of aluminum or steel 
rod or tubing specified in 50 CFR 223.207(a)(1)(i)(A) through (C), or 
flat bar \3/8\-inch (0.95 cm) or more in thickness, and is permanently 
attached to the rear of the outer frame; for TEDs constructed of flat 
bar less than \3/8\-inch (0.95 cm) in thickness, the regulations 
specified in 50 CFR 223.207(a)(1)(i)(D) apply. The horizontal brace bar 
may be permanently secured to the rear face of each of the deflector 
bars. The horizontal brace bar may be offset behind the deflector bars, 
using spacer bars attached to the rear face of each of the deflector 
bars, not to exceed 5 inches (12.7 cm) in length, and must be 
constructed of the same size or larger material as the deflector bars.
    (e) Revision of generic design criteria, and approval of TEDs, of 
allowable modifications of hard TEDs, and of special hard TEDs. (1) The 
Assistant Administrator may revise the generic design criteria for hard 
TEDs set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, may approve special 
hard TEDs in addition to those listed in paragraph (b) of this section, 
may approve allowable modifications to hard TEDs in addition to those 
authorized in paragraph (d) of this section, or may approve other TEDs, 
by regulatory amendment, if, according to a NMFS-approved scientific 
protocol, the TED demonstrates a sea turtle exclusion rate of 97 percent 
or greater (or an equivalent exclusion rate). Two such protocols have 
been published by NMFS (52 FR 24262, June 29, 1987; and 55 FR 41092, 
October 9, 1990) and will be used only for testing relating to hard TED 
designs. Testing under any protocol must be conducted under the 
supervision of the Assistant Administrator, and shall be subject to all 
such conditions and restrictions as the Assistant Administrator deems 
appropriate. Any person wishing to participate in such testing should 
contact the Director, Southeast Fisheries Science Center, NMFS, 75 
Virginia Beach Dr., Miami, FL 33149-1003.
    (2) Upon application, the Assistant Administrator may issue permits, 
subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Assistant 
Administrator deems appropriate, authorizing public or private 
experimentation aimed at improving shrimp retention efficiency of 
existing approved TEDs and at developing additional TEDs, or conducting 
fishery research, that would otherwise be subject to Sec. 
223.206(d)(2). Applications should be made to the Southeast Regional 
Administrator (see Sec. 222.102 definition of ``Southeast Regional 
Administrator'').

sediments, that reestablish self-sustaining habitats for the Southern 
DPS, if:
    (i) The activity complies with required state and Federal reviews 
and permits;
    (ii) Those carrying out the activity submit a detailed description 
of the restoration activity to the NMFS Southwest Regional Office in 
Long Beach at least 60 days prior to the start of the restoration 
project, or, for ongoing studies, by August 31, 2010, which includes: 
the geographic area affected; when activities will occur; how they will 
be conducted; and the severity of direct, indirect, and cumulative 
impacts of activities on the Southern DPS; identification of funding 
sources; demonstration that all state and Federal regulatory 
requirements have been met; a description of methods used to ensure that 
the likelihood of survival or recovery of the listed species is not 
reduced; a plan for minimizing and mitigating any adverse impacts to 
Southern DPS spawning or rearing habitat; an estimate of the amount of 
incidental take of the listed species that may occur and a description 
of how that estimate was made; a plan for effective monitoring and 
adaptive management; a pledge to use best available science and 
technology when conducting restoration activities; and a point of 
contact;
    (iii) Those carrying out the activity submit progress reports that 
include the total number of Southern DPS fish taken, information 
regarding whether the take was lethal or non-lethal, a summary of the 
status of the project, and any changes in the methods being used, to the 
NMFS Southwest Regional Office in Long Beach on a schedule to be 
determined by NMFS; and
    (iv) An activity that involves action, permitting, or funding by a 
Federal agency complies with the requirements of ESA section 7(a)(2) in 
order to ensure that the action will not jeopardize the continued 
existence of the threatened Southern DPS.
    (c) Exemptions via ESA 4(d) Program Approval. Exemptions from the 
take prohibitions described in section 9(a)(1)(B) and (C) of the ESA (16 
U.S.C. 1538(a)(1)(B) and (C)) applied in paragraph (a) of this section 
to the threatened Southern DPS listed in Sec. 223.102(c) are described 
in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section.
    (1) Scientific Research and Monitoring Exemptions. The prohibitions 
of paragraph (a) of this section relating to the threatened Southern DPS 
listed in Sec. 223.102(c)(1) do not apply to ongoing or future state-
sponsored scientific research or monitoring activities that are part of 
a NMFS-approved, ESA-compliant state 4(d) research program conducted by, 
or in coordination with, state fishery management agencies (California 
Department of Fish and Game, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, 
Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, or Alaska Department of Fish 
and Game), or as part of a monitoring and research program overseen by, 
or coordinated by, one of these agencies. State 4(d) research programs 
must meet the following criteria:
    (i) Descriptions of the ongoing and future 4(d) research or 
monitoring activity, as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this 
section, must be received by the NMFS Southwest Regional Office in Long 
Beach during the mid-September through mid-October 2010 application 
period. This exception to the section 9 take prohibitions expires if the 
proposal is rejected as insufficient or is denied. If the state 4(d) 
research program package is received during the mid-September to mid-
October application period, ongoing state-supported scientific research 
activities may continue until NMFS issues a written decision of approval 
or denial. If approved, the state 4(d) program authorization will cover 
one calendar year and state-supported researchers would have to renew 
authorizations annually during subsequent application periods.
    (ii) Descriptions of ongoing and future state-supported research 
activities must include the following information and should be 
submitted to NMFS by the State: an estimate of total direct or 
incidental take; a description of the study design and methodology; a 
justification for take and the techniques employed; and a point of 
contact.
    (iii) NMFS will provide written approval of a state 4(d) research 
program.

[[Page 385]]

    (iv) The State agency will provide an annual report to NMFS that, at 
a minimum, summarizes the number of Southern DPS green sturgeon taken 
directly or incidentally, and summarizes the results of the project.
    (2) Fisheries Exemptions. The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this 
section relating to the threatened Southern DPS listed in Sec. 
223.102(c)(1) do not apply to fisheries activities that are conducted in 
accordance with a NMFS-approved Fishery Management and Evaluation Plan 
(FMEP). If NMFS finds that an FMEP meets the criteria listed below, a 
letter of concurrence which sets forth the terms of the FMEP's 
implementation and the duties of the parties pursuant to the FMEP, will 
be issued to the applicant.
    (i) An FMEP must prohibit retention of green sturgeon (i.e., zero 
bag limit); set maximum incidental take levels, include restrictions to 
minimize incidental take of the green sturgeon (e.g., temporal/spatial 
restrictions, size of fish, gear used); provide a biologically based 
rationale demonstrating that the incidental take management strategy 
will not significantly reduce the likelihood of survival or recovery of 
the Southern DPS; include effective monitoring and evaluation plans; 
provide for evaluating monitoring data and making revisions to the FMEP; 
provide for effective enforcement and education; provide a timeframe for 
FMEP implementation; and report the amount of incidental take and 
summarize the effectiveness of the FMEP to NMFS on a biannual basis.
    (ii) The ESA section 9(a)(1)(B) and (a)(1)(C) take prohibitions will 
not apply to ongoing commercial and recreational fisheries activities 
until September 30, 2010 if a letter of intent to develop an FMEP that 
is protective of green sturgeon has been received by NMFS by July 2, 
2010. The exemption will expire if the letter of intent is rejected 
without further review of a FMEP. If the letter of intent is received by 
August 31, 2010, a draft FMEP must be received by NMFS within 6 months 
from the date of receipt of the letter of intent. A final FMEP must be 
received by NMFS within 3 months from the date of receipt of NMFS' 
comments on the draft FMEP. Ongoing commercial and recreational 
fisheries activities may continue until NMFS issues a letter of 
concurrence or denial for final FMEPs.
    (iii) NMFS will provide a public comment period (<ls-thn-eq>=30 
days) before approval of new or amended FMEPs; provide a letter of 
concurrence for approved FMEPs that specifies the implementation and 
reporting requirements; evaluate FMEPs every 5 years and identify 
changes that would improve their effectiveness; and provide a public 
comment period (<ls-thn-eq>=30 days) before withdrawing approval of an 
FMEP.
    (3) Tribal Exemptions. The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this 
section relating to the threatened Southern DPS listed in Sec. 
223.102(c)(1) do not apply to fishery harvest or other activities 
undertaken by a tribe, tribal member, tribal permittee, tribal employee, 
or tribal agent in Willapa Bay, WA, Grays Harbor, WA, Coos Bay, OR, 
Winchester Bay, OR, Humboldt Bay, CA, and any other area where tribal 
treaty fishing occurs, if those activities are compliant with a tribal 
resource management plan (Tribal Plan), provided that the Secretary 
determines that implementation of such Tribal Plan will not appreciably 
reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of the Southern DPS. In 
making that determination the Secretary shall use the best available 
biological data (including any tribal data and analysis) to determine 
the Tribal Plan's impact on the biological requirements of the species, 
and will assess the effect of the Tribal Plan on survival and recovery, 
consistent with legally enforceable tribal rights and with the 
Secretary's trust responsibilities to tribes.
    (i) A Tribal Plan may include, but is not limited to, plans that 
address fishery harvest, artificial production, research, or water or 
land management, and may be developed by one tribe or jointly with other 
tribes. The Secretary will consult on a government-to-government basis 
with any tribe that so requests and will provide, to the maximum extent 
practicable, technical assistance in examining impacts on the Southern 
DPS as tribes develop Tribal Plans. A Tribal Plan must specify the 
procedures by which the tribe will enforce its provisions.

[[Page 386]]

    (ii) Where there exists a Federal court proceeding with continuing 
jurisdiction over the subject matter of a Tribal Plan, the plan may be 
developed and implemented within the ongoing Federal Court proceeding. 
In such circumstances, compliance with the Tribal Plan's terms shall be 
determined within that Federal Court proceeding.
    (iii) The Secretary shall seek comment from the public on the 
Secretary's pending determination whether implementation of a Tribal 
Plan will appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of 
the listed Southern DPS.
    (iv) The Secretary shall publish notification in the Federal 
Register of any determination regarding a Tribal Plan and the basis for 
that determination.
    (d) The exceptions of section 10 of the ESA (16 U.S.C. 1539) and 
other exceptions under the ESA relating to endangered species, including 
regulations in part 222 of this chapter II implementing such exceptions, 
also apply to the threatened Southern DPS of North American green 
sturgeon listed in Sec. 223.102(c)(1). Federal, state, and private-
sponsored research activities for scientific research or enhancement 
purposes that are not covered under Scientific Research and Monitoring 
Exceptions as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or 
Scientific Research and Monitoring Exemptions as described in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, may take Southern DPS fish pursuant to the 
specifications of an ESA section 10 permit. Section 9(a)(1)(B) and 
(a)(1)(C) take prohibitions would not apply to ongoing research 
activities if an application for an ESA section 10(a)(1)(A) permit is 
received by NMFS, preferably through the NMFS online application Web 
site https://apps.nmfs.noaa.gov, no later than November 29, 2010. The 
take prohibitions would take effect if the permit application is 
rejected as insufficient or a permit is denied. If the permit 
application is received by November 29, 2010, ongoing research 
activities may continue without take prohibitions until NMFS issues or 
denies a permit.
    (e) Affirmative Defense. In connection with any action alleging a 
violation of the prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section with 
respect to the threatened Southern DPS of North American green sturgeon 
listed in Sec. 223.102(c)(1), any person claiming that his or her take 
is authorized via methods listed in paragraph (b) of this section shall 
have a defense where the person can demonstrate that the take 
authorization is applicable and was in force, and that the person fully 
complied with the take authorization requirements at the time of the 
alleged violation. This defense is an affirmative defense that must be 
raised, pleaded, and proven by the proponent. If proven, this defense 
will be an absolute defense to liability under section 9(a)(1)(G) of the 
ESA with respect to the alleged violation.

to commit, to attempt to commit, to solicit another to commit, or to 
cause to be committed, within 200 nautical miles (370.4 km) of the 
Islands of Hawaii, any of the following acts with respect to humpback 
whales (Megaptera novaeangliae):
    (1) Operate any aircraft within 1,000 feet (300 m) of any humpback 
whale;
    (2) Approach, by any means, within 100 yard (90 m) of any humpback 
whale;
    (3) Cause a vessel or other object to approach within 100 yd (90 m) 
of a humpback whale; or
    (4) Disrupt the normal behavior or prior activity of a whale by any 
other act or omission. A disruption of normal behavior may be manifested 
by, among other actions on the part of the whale, a rapid change in 
direction or speed; escape tactics such as prolonged diving, underwater 
course changes, underwater exhalation, or evasive swimming patterns; 
interruptions of breeding, nursing, or resting activities, attempts by a 
whale to shield a calf from a vessel or human observer by tail swishing 
or by other protective movement; or the abandonment of a previously 
frequented area.
    (b) Approaching humpback whales in Alaska--(1) Prohibitions. Except 
as provided under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, it is unlawful for 
any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to commit, 
to attempt to commit, to solicit another to commit, or to cause to be 
committed, within 200 nautical miles (370.4 km) of Alaska, or within 
inland waters of the state, any of the acts in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) 
through (b)(1)(iii) of this section with respect to humpback whales 
(Megaptera novaeangliae):
    (i) Approach, by any means, including by interception (i.e., placing 
a vessel in the path of an oncoming humpback whale so that the whale 
surfaces within 100 yards (91.4 m) of the vessel), within 100 yards 
(91.4 m) of any humpback whale;
    (ii) Cause a vessel or other object to approach within 100 yards 
(91.4 m) of a humpback whale; or
    (iii) Disrupt the normal behavior or prior activity of a whale by 
any other act or omission, as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section.
    (2) Exceptions. The following exceptions apply to this paragraph 
(b), but any person who claims the applicability of an exception has the 
burden of proving that the exception applies:
    (i) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply if an approach 
is authorized by the National Marine Fisheries Service through a permit 
issued under part 222, subpart C, of this chapter (General Permit 
Procedures) or through a similar authorization.
    (ii) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to the extent 
that a vessel is restricted in her ability to maneuver and, because of 
the restriction, cannot comply with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (iii) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to commercial 
fishing vessels lawfully engaged in actively setting, retrieving or 
closely tending commercial fishing gear. For purposes of this paragraph 
(b), commercial fishing means taking or harvesting fish or fishery 
resources to sell, barter, or

[[Page 406]]

trade. Commercial fishing does not include commercial passenger fishing 
operations (i.e. charter operations or sport fishing activities).
    (iv) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to state, 
local, or Federal government vessels operating in the course of official 
duty.
    (v) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not affect the rights of 
Alaska Natives under 16 U.S.C. 1539(e).
    (vi) These regulations shall not take precedence over any more 
restrictive conflicting Federal regulation pertaining to humpback 
whales, including the regulations at 36 CFR 13.65 that pertain 
specifically to the waters of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve.
    (3) General measures. Notwithstanding the prohibitions and 
exceptions in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, to avoid 
collisions with humpback whales, vessels must operate at a slow, safe 
speed when near a humpback whale. ``Safe speed'' has the same meaning as 
the term is defined in 33 U.S.C. 2006 and the International Regulations 
for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972 (see 33 U.S.C. 1602), with respect 
to avoiding collisions with humpback whales.
    (c) Approaching right whales--(1) Prohibitions. Except as provided 
under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, it is unlawful for any person 
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to commit, attempt to 
commit, to solicit another to commit, or cause to be committed any of 
the following acts:
    (i) Approach (including by interception) within 500 yards (460 m) of 
a right whale by vessel, aircraft, or any other means;
    (ii) Fail to undertake required right whale avoidance measures 
specified under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) Right whale avoidance measures. Except as provided under 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the following avoidance measures must 
be taken if within 500 yards (460 m) of a right whale:
    (i) If underway, a vessel must steer a course away from the right 
whale and immediately leave the area at a slow safe speed.
    (ii) An aircraft must take a course away from the right whale and 
immediately leave the area at a constant airspeed.
    (3) Exceptions. The following exceptions apply to this section, but 
any person who claims the applicability of an exception has the burden 
of proving that the exception applies:
    (i) Paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section do not apply if a 
right whale approach is authorized by the National Marine Fisheries 
Service through a permit issued under part 222, subpart C, of this 
chapter (General Permit Procedures) or through a similar authorization.
    (ii) Paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section do not apply where 
compliance would create an imminent and serious threat to a person, 
vessel, or aircraft.
    (iii) Paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section do not apply when 
approaching to investigate a right whale entanglement or injury, or to 
assist in the disentanglement or rescue of a right whale, provided that 
permission is received from the National Marine Fisheries Service or 
designee prior to the approach.
    (iv) Paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section do not apply to an 
aircraft unless the aircraft is conducting whale watch activities.
    (v) Paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not apply to the extent 
that a vessel is restricted in her ability to maneuver and, because of 
the restriction, cannot comply with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (d) Special prohibitions relating to endangered Steller sea lion 
protection. The regulatory provisions set forth in part 223 of this 
chapter, which govern threatened Steller sea lions, shall also apply to 
the western population of Steller sea lions, which consists of all 
Steller sea lions from breeding colonies located west of 144[deg] W. 
long.
    (e) Protective regulations for killer whales in Washington--(1) 
Applicability. The following restrictions apply to all motorized and 
non-motorized vessels in inland waters of the United States east of a 
line connecting Cape Flattery, Washington (48[deg]23[min]10[sec] N./
124[deg]43[min]32[sec] W.), Tatoosh Island, Washington 
(48[deg]23[min]30[sec] N./124[deg]44[min]12[sec] W.), and Bonilla Point, 
British Columbia (48[deg]35[min]30[sec] N./124[deg]43[min]00[sec] W.) 
and south of the U.S./Canada international boundary. The shoreline

[[Page 407]]

boundary is the charted mean high water line cutting across the mouths 
of all rivers and streams.
    (2) Prohibitions. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section, it is unlawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of 
the United States to:
    (i) Cause a vessel to approach, in any manner, within 200 yards 
(182.9 m) of any killer whale.
    (ii) Position a vessel to be in the path of any killer whale at any 
point located within 400 yards (365.8 m) of the whale. This includes 
intercepting a killer whale by positioning a vessel so that the 
prevailing wind or water current carries the vessel into the path of the 
whale.
    (3) Exceptions. The following exceptions apply to this section:
    (i) The prohibitions of paragraph (e)(2) of this section do not 
apply to
    (A) Federal Government vessels operating in the course of their 
official duty or state and local government vessels when engaged in 
official duties involving law enforcement, search and rescue, or public 
safety.
    (B) Vessels participating with a Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) and 
following a Traffic Separation Scheme or complying with a VTS Measure of 
Direction. This also includes support vessels escorting ships in the 
traffic lanes, such as tug boats.
    (C) Vessels engaged in an activity, such as scientific research, 
authorized through a permit issued by the National Marine Fisheries 
Service under part 222, subpart C, of this chapter (General Permit 
Procedures) or through a similar National Marine Fisheries Service 
authorization.
    (D) Vessels lawfully engaged in commercial or treaty Indian fishing 
that are actively setting, retrieving, or closely tending fishing gear.
    (E) Vessel operations necessary to avoid an imminent and serious 
threat to a person, vessel or the environment, including when necessary 
for overall safety of navigation and to comply with the Navigation 
Rules.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (4) Affirmative defense. In connection with any action alleging a 
violation of the prohibitions of paragraph (e)(2) of this section, any 
person claiming the benefit of any exception listed in paragraph (e)(3) 
of this section has the burden of raising, pleading, and proving such 
affirmative defense.
    (b) [Reserved]

or meteorological conditions severely restrict the maneuverability of 
the vessel and the need to operate at such speed is confirmed by the 
pilot on board or, when a vessel is not carrying a pilot, the master of 
the

[[Page 409]]

vessel. If a deviation from the ten-knot speed limit is necessary, the 
reasons for the deviation, the speed at which the vessel is operated, 
the latitude and longitude of the area, and the time and duration of 
such deviation shall be entered into the logbook of the vessel. The 
master of the vessel shall attest to the accuracy of the logbook entry 
by signing and dating it.

    (b) Critical habitat boundaries. Critical habitat includes the 
stream channels within the designated stream reaches, and includes a 
lateral extent as defined by the ordinary high-water line (33 CFR 
329.11). In areas where the ordinary high-water line has not been 
defined, the lateral extent will be defined by the bankfull elevation. 
Bankfull elevation is the level at which water begins to leave the 
channel and move into the floodplain and is reached at a discharge which 
generally has a recurrence interval of 1 to 2 years on the annual flood 
series. Critical habitat in estuaries (e.g. San Francisco-San Pablo-
Suisun Bay, Humboldt Bay, and Morro Bay) is defined by the perimeter of 
the water body as displayed on standard 1:24,000 scale topographic maps 
or the elevation of extreme high water, whichever is greater.
    (c) Primary constituent elements. Within these areas, the primary 
constituent elements essential for the conservation of these ESUs are 
those sites and habitat components that support one or more life stages, 
including:
    (1) Freshwater spawning sites with water quantity and quality 
conditions and substrate supporting spawning, incubation and larval 
development;
    (2) Freshwater rearing sites with:
    (i) Water quantity and floodplain connectivity to form and maintain 
physical habitat conditions and support juvenile growth and mobility;

[[Page 430]]

    (ii) Water quality and forage supporting juvenile development; and
    (iii) Natural cover such as shade, submerged and overhanging large 
wood, log jams and beaver dams, aquatic vegetation, large rocks and 
boulders, side channels, and undercut banks.
    (3) Freshwater migration corridors free of obstruction and excessive 
predation with water quantity and quality conditions and natural cover 
such as submerged and overhanging large wood, aquatic vegetation, large 
rocks and boulders, side channels, and undercut banks supporting 
juvenile and adult mobility and survival.
    (4) Estuarine areas free of obstruction and excessive predation 
with:
    (i) Water quality, water quantity, and salinity conditions 
supporting juvenile and adult physiological transitions between fresh- 
and saltwater;
    (ii) Natural cover such as submerged and overhanging large wood, 
aquatic vegetation, large rocks and boulders, side channels; and
    (iii) Juvenile and adult forage, including aquatic invertebrates and 
fishes, supporting growth and maturation.
    (d) Exclusion of Indian lands. Critical habitat does not include 
occupied habitat areas on Indian lands. The Indian lands specifically 
excluded from critical habitat are those defined in the Secretarial 
Order, including:
    (1) Lands held in trust by the United States for the benefit of any 
Indian tribe;
    (2) Land held in trust by the United States for any Indian Tribe or 
individual subject to restrictions by the United States against 
alienation;
    (3) Fee lands, either within or outside the reservation boundaries, 
owned by the tribal government; and
    (4) Fee lands within the reservation boundaries owned by individual 
Indians.
    (e) Land owned or controlled by the Department of Defense. 
Additionally, critical habitat does not include the following areas 
owned or controlled by the Department of Defense, or designated for its 
use, that are subject to an integrated natural resources management plan 
prepared under section 101 of the Sikes Act (16 U.S.C. 670a):
    (1) Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base;
    (2) Vandenberg Air Force Base;
    (3) Camp San Luis Obispo;
    (4) Camp Roberts; and
    (5) Mare Island Army Reserve Center.

    (b) Critical habitat boundaries. Critical habitat includes the 
stream channels within the designated stream reaches, and includes a 
lateral extent as defined by the ordinary high-water line (33 CFR 
319.11). In areas where ordinary high-water line has not been defined, 
the lateral extent will be defined by

[[Page 530]]

the bankfull elevation. Bankfull elevation is the level at which water 
begins to leave the channel and move into the floodplain and is reached 
at a discharge which generally has a recurrence interval of 1 to 2 years 
on the annual flood series. Critical habitat in lake areas is defined by 
the perimeter of the water body as displayed on standard 1:24,000 scale 
topographic maps or the elevation of ordinary high water, whichever is 
greater. In estuarine and nearshore marine areas critical habitat 
includes areas contiguous with the shoreline from the line of extreme 
high water out to a depth no greater than 30 meters relative to mean 
lower low water.
    (c) Primary constituent elements. Within these areas, the primary 
constituent elements essential for the conservation of these ESUs are 
those sites and habitat components that support one or more life stages, 
including:
    (1) Freshwater spawning sites with water quantity and quality 
conditions and substrate supporting spawning, incubation and larval 
development;
    (2) Freshwater rearing sites with:
    (i) Water quantity and floodplain connectivity to form and maintain 
physical habitat conditions and support juvenile growth and mobility;
    (ii) Water quality and forage supporting juvenile development; and
    (iii) Natural cover such as shade, submerged and overhanging large 
wood, log jams and beaver dams, aquatic vegetation, large rocks and 
boulders, side channels, and undercut banks.
    (3) Freshwater migration corridors free of obstruction and excessive 
predation with water quantity and quality conditions and natural cover 
such as submerged and overhanging large wood, aquatic vegetation, large 
rocks and boulders, side channels, and undercut banks supporting 
juvenile and adult mobility and survival;
    (4) Estuarine areas free of obstruction and excessive predation 
with:
    (i) Water quality, water quantity, and salinity conditions 
supporting juvenile and adult physiological transitions between fresh- 
and saltwater;
    (ii) Natural cover such as submerged and overhanging large wood, 
aquatic vegetation, large rocks and boulders, side channels; and
    (iii) Juvenile and adult forage, including aquatic invertebrates and 
fishes, supporting growth and maturation.
    (5) Nearshore marine areas free of obstruction and excessive 
predation with:
    (i) Water quality and quantity conditions and forage, including 
aquatic invertebrates and fishes, supporting growth and maturation; and
    (ii) Natural cover such as submerged and overhanging large wood, 
aquatic vegetation, large rocks and boulders, and side channels.
    (6) Offshore marine areas with water quality conditions and forage, 
including aquatic invertebrates and fishes, supporting growth and 
maturation.
    (d) Exclusion of Indian lands. Critical habitat does not include 
habitat areas on Indian lands. The Indian lands specifically excluded 
from critical habitat are those defined in the Secretarial Order, 
including:
    (1) Lands held in trust by the United States for the benefit of any 
Indian tribe;
    (2) Land held in trust by the United States for any Indian Tribe or 
individual subject to restrictions by the United States against 
alienation;
    (3) Fee lands, either within or outside the reservation boundaries, 
owned by the tribal government; and
    (4) Fee lands within the reservation boundaries owned by individual 
Indians.
    (e) Land owned or controlled by the Department of Defense. Critical 
habitat does not include any areas subject to an approved Integrated 
Natural Resource Management Plan or associated with Department of 
Defense easements or right-of-ways. In areas within Navy security zones 
identified at 33 CFR 334 that are outside the areas described above, 
critical habitat is only designated within a narrow nearshore zone from 
the line of extreme high tide down to the line of mean lower low water. 
The specific sites addressed include:
    (1) Naval Submarine Base, Bangor;
    (2) Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Keyport;
    (3) Naval Ordnance Center, Port Hadlock (Indian Island);
    (4) Naval Radio Station, Jim Creek;

    (f) Land subject to the Washington Department of Natural Resources 
Habitat Conservation Plan. Critical habitat is excluded on lands covered 
by the incidental take permit issued by NMFS under section 10(a)(1)(B) 
of the ESA to the Washington Department of Natural Resources.
    (g) Land subject to the Green Diamond Company Habitat Conservation 
Plan. Critical habitat is excluded on lands covered by the incidental 
take permit issued by NMFS under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the ESA to the 
Green Diamond Resources Company (formerly Simpson Timber Company).
    (h) Land subject to the West Fork Timber Company Habitat 
Conservation Plan. Critical habitat is excluded on lands covered by the 
incidental take permit issued by NMFS under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the 
ESA to the West Fork Timber Company (formerly Murray Pacific 
Corporation).

Sec. 226.214  Critical habitat for Gulf sturgeon.

    Gulf sturgeon is under the joint jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service (FWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). The 
FWS will maintain primary responsibility for recovery actions and NMFS 
will assist in and continue to fund recovery actions pertaining to 
estuarine and marine habitats. In riverine units, the FWS will be 
responsible for all consultations regarding Gulf sturgeon and critical 
habitat. In estuarine units, we

[[Page 774]]

will divide responsibility based on the action agency involved. The FWS 
will consult with the Department of Transportation, the Environmental 
Protection Agency, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. NMFS will consult with the Department of Defense, 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Minerals Management Service and any other 
Federal agencies not mentioned here explicitly. In marine units, NMFS 
will be responsible for all consultations regarding Gulf sturgeon and 
critical habitat. Any Federal projects that extend into the jurisdiction 
of both the Services will be consulted on by the FWS with internal 
coordination with NMFS. Each agency will conduct its own intra-agency 
consultations as necessary.
    The primary constituent elements essential for the conservation of 
Gulf sturgeon are those habitat components that support feeding, 
resting, and sheltering, reproduction, migration, and physical features 
necessary for maintaining the natural processes that support these 
habitat components. The primary constituent elements include: abundant 
prey items within riverine habitats for larval and juvenile life stages, 
and within estuarine and marine habitats and substrates for juvenile, 
subadult, and adult life stages; riverine spawning sites with substrates 
suitable for egg deposition and development, such as limestone outcrops 
and cut limestone banks, bedrock, large gravel or cobble beds, marl, 
soapstone or hard clay; riverine aggregation areas, also referred to as 
resting, holding, and staging areas, used by adult, subadult, and/or 
juveniles, generally, but not always, located in holes below normal 
riverbed depths, believed necessary for minimizing energy expenditures 
during fresh water residency and possibly for osmoregulatory functions; 
a flow regime (i.e., the magnitude, frequency, duration, seasonality, 
and rate-of-change of fresh water discharge over time) necessary for 
normal behavior, growth, and survival of all life stages in the riverine 
environment, including migration, breeding site selection, courtship, 
egg fertilization, resting, and staging; and necessary for maintaining 
spawning sites in suitable condition for egg attachment, eggs 
sheltering, resting, and larvae staging; water quality, including 
temperature, salinity, pH, hardness, turbidity, oxygen content, and 
other chemical characteristics, necessary for normal behavior, growth, 
and viability of all life stages; sediment quality, including texture 
and other chemical characteristics, necessary for normal behavior, 
growth, and viability of all life stages; and safe and unobstructed 
migratory pathways necessary for passage within and between riverine, 
estuarine, and marine habitats (e.g. a river unobstructed by any 
permanent structure, or a dammed river that still allows for passage).
    The river reaches within Units 1 to 7 as critical habitat lie within 
the ordinary high water line. As defined in 33 CFR 329.11, the ordinary 
high water line on non-tidal rivers is the line on the shore established 
by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics 
such as a clear, natural line impressed on the bank; shelving; changes 
in the character of soil; destruction of terrestrial vegetation; the 
presence of litter and debris; or other appropriate means that consider 
the characteristics of the surrounding areas.
    The downstream limit of the riverine units is the mouth of each 
river. The mouth is defined as rkm 0 (rmi 0). Although the interface of 
fresh and saltwater, referred to as the saltwater wedge, occurs within 
the lower-most reach of a river, for ease in delineating critical 
habitat units, we are defining the boundary between the riverine and 
estuarine units as rkm 0 (rmi 0).
    Regulatory jurisdiction in coastal areas extends to the line on the 
shore reached by the plane of the mean (average) high water (MHW) (33 
CFR 329.12(a)(2)). All bays and estuaries within Units 8 to 14, 
therefore, lie below the MHW lines. Where precise determination of the 
actual location becomes necessary, it must be established by survey with 
reference to the available tidal datum, preferably averaged over a 
period of 18.6 years. Less precise methods, such as observation of the 
``apparent shoreline'' which is determined by reference to physical 
markings, lines of vegetation, may be used only where an estimate is 
needed

[[Page 775]]

of the line reached by the mean high water.
    The term 72 COLREGS is defined as demarcation lines which delineate 
those waters upon which mariners shall comply with the International 
Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 and those waters upon 
which mariners shall comply with the Inland Navigation Rules (33 CFR 
80.01). The waters inside of these lines are Inland Rules waters and the 
waters outside the lines are COLREGS waters. These lines are defined in 
33 CFR part 80, and have been used for identification purposes to 
delineate boundary lines of the estuarine and marine habitat Units 8, 9, 
11, and 12.
    Critical habitat does not include existing developed sites such as 
dams, piers, marinas, bridges, boat ramps, exposed oil and gas 
pipelines, oil rigs, and similar structures or designated public 
swimming areas.
    Critical habitat units are depicted for Louisiana, Mississippi, 
Alabama and Florida on the maps below. The textual unit descriptions 
below are definitive sources for determining the critical habitat 
boundaries. General location maps by unit are provided for general 
guidance purposes only, and not as a definitive source for determining 
critical habitat boundaries.

Sec. 226.216  Critical habitat for elkhorn (Acropora palmata) and staghorn
(A. cervicornis) corals.

    Critical habitat is designated for both elkhorn and staghorn corals 
as described in this section. The textual descriptions of critical 
habitat in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are the definitive 
source for determining the critical habitat boundaries. The overview 
maps in paragraph (d) of this section are provided for general guidance 
purposes only, and not as a definitive source for determining critical 
habitat boundaries.
    (a) Physical Feature Essential to the Conservation of Threatened 
Corals. The physical feature essential to the conservation of elkhorn 
and staghorn corals is: substrate of suitable quality and availability 
to support larval settlement and recruitment, and reattachment and 
recruitment of asexual fragments. ``Substrate of suitable quality and 
availability'' is defined as natural consolidated hard substrate or dead 
coral skeleton that is free from fleshy or turf macroalgae cover and 
sediment cover.
    (b) Critical Habitat Areas. Critical habitat includes one specific 
area of the Atlantic Ocean offshore of Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade, 
and Monroe counties, Florida, and three specific areas of the Atlantic 
Ocean and Caribbean Sea offshore of the U.S. Territories of Puerto Rico 
and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The boundaries of each specific critical 
habitat area are described below. Except as specified below, the seaward 
boundary is the 98-ft (30-m) depth contour and the shoreward boundary is 
the line of mean low water (MLW; 33 CFR 2.20). Within these boundaries, 
discrete areas of water deeper than 98 ft (30 m) are not included.
    (1) Florida Area: The Florida area contains three sub-areas.
    (i) The shoreward boundary for Florida sub-area A begins at the 6-ft 
(1.8 m) contour at the south side of Boynton Inlet, Palm Beach County at 
26[deg] 32[min] 42.5[sec] N; then runs due east to the point of 
intersection with the 98-ft (30 m) contour; then follows the 98-ft (30 
m) contour to the point of intersection with latitude 25[deg] 45[min] 
55[sec] N, Government Cut, Miami-Dade County; then runs due west to the 
point of intersection with the 6-ft (1.8 m) contour, then follows the 6-
ft (1.8 m) contour to the beginning point.
    (ii) The shoreward boundary of Florida sub-area B begins at the MLW 
line at 25[deg] 45[min] 55[sec] N, Government Cut, Miami-Dade County; 
then runs due east to the point of intersection with the 98-ft (30 m) 
contour; then follows the 98-ft (30 m) contour to the point of 
intersection with longitude 82[deg] W; then runs due north to the point 
of intersection with the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council 
(SAFMC) boundary at 24[deg] 31[min] 35.75[sec] N; then follows the SAFMC 
boundary to a point of intersection with the MLW line at Key West, 
Monroe County; then follows the MLW line, the SAFMC boundary (see 50 CFR 
600.105(c)), and the COLREGS line (see 33 CFR 80.727. 730, 735, and 740) 
to the beginning point.
    (iii) The seaward boundary of Florida sub-area C (the Dry Tortugas) 
begins at the northern intersection of the 98-ft (30 m) contour and 
longitude 82[deg] 45' W; then follows the 98-ft (30 m) contour west 
around the Dry Tortugas, to the southern point of intersection with 
longitude 82[deg] 45' W; then runs due north to the beginning point.
    (2) Puerto Rico Area: All areas surrounding the islands of the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 98 ft (30 m) in depth and shallower, 
seaward of the COLREGS line (see 33 CFR 80.738).

St. Thomas and St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands, and smaller surrounding 
islands, 98 ft (30 m) in depth and shallower.
    (4) St. Croix Area: All areas surrounding the island of St. Croix, 
U.S. Virgin Islands, 98 ft (30 m) in depth and shallower.
    (c) Areas not included in critical habitat. Critical habitat does 
not include the following particular areas where they overlap with the 
areas described in paragraph (b) of this section:
    (1) Pursuant to ESA section 4(a)(3)(B), all areas subject to the 
2008 Naval Air Station Key West Integrated Natural Resources Management 
Plan.
    (2) Pursuant to ESA section 3(5)(A)(i), all areas containing 
existing (already constructed) federally authorized or permitted man-
made structures

[[Page 821]]

such as aids-to-navigation (ATONs), artificial reefs, boat ramps, docks, 
pilings, maintained channels, or marinas.
    (3) Pursuant to ESA section 3(5)(A)(i), all waters identified as 
existing (already constructed) federally authorized channels and harbors 
as follows:
    (i) Palm Beach Harbor.
    (ii) Hillsboro Inlet.
    (iii) Port Everglades.
    (iv) Miami Harbor.
    (v) Key West Harbor.
    (vi) Arecibo Harbor.
    (vii) San Juan Harbor.
    (viii) Fajardo Harbor.
    (ix) Ponce Harbor.
    (x) Mayaguez Harbor.
    (xi) St. Thomas Harbor.
    (xii) Christiansted Harbor.
    (d) Areas excluded from critical habitat. Pursuant to ESA Section 
4(b)(2), all waters of the Restricted Anchorage Area as described at 33 
CFR 334.580, beginning at a point located at 26[deg] 05[min] 30'' N, 80 
03[min] 30'' W.; proceed west to 26[deg] 05[min] 30[sec] N, 80[deg] 
06[min] 30[sec] W; thence, southerly to 26[deg] 03[min] 00[sec] N, 
longitude 80[deg] 06[min] 42[sec] W; thence, east to latitude 26[deg] 
03[min] 00[sec] N, 80[deg] 05[min] 44[sec] W.; thence, south to 26[deg] 
01[min] 36[sec] N, 80[deg] 05[min] 44[sec] W.; thence, east to 26[deg] 
01[min] 36[sec] N, 80[deg] 03[min] 30[sec] W; thence, north to the point 
of beginning.

Sec. 226.217  Critical habitat for the Gulf of Maine Distinct
Population Segment of Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar).

    Critical habitat is designated to include all perennial rivers, 
streams, and estuaries and lakes connected to the marine environment 
within the range of the Gulf of Maine Distinct Population Segment of 
Atlantic Salmon (GOM DPS), except for those particular areas within the 
range which are specifically excluded. Within the GOM DPS, the primary 
constituent elements

[[Page 826]]

(PCEs) for Atlantic salmon include sites for spawning and incubation, 
sites for juvenile rearing, and sites for migration. The essential 
physical and biological features of habitat are those features that 
allow Atlantic salmon to successfully use sites for spawning and rearing 
and sites for migration. These features include substrate of suitable 
size and quality; rivers and streams of adequate flow, depth, water 
temperature and water quality; rivers, streams, lakes and ponds with 
sufficient space and diverse, abundant food resources to support growth 
and survival; waterways that allow for free migration of both adult and 
juvenile Atlantic salmon; and diverse habitat and native fish 
communities in which salmon interact with while feeding, migrating, 
spawning, and resting.
    (a) The GOM DPS is divided into three salmon habitat recovery units 
(SHRUs) within the range of the GOM DPS: These are the Downeast Coastal 
SHRU, the Penobscot Bay SHRU, and the Merrymeeting Bay SHRU. Critical 
habitat is being considered only in specific areas currently occupied by 
the species. Critical habitat specific areas are identified by 
hydrological unit codes (HUC) and counties within the States of Maine. 
Hydrological units are those defined by the Department of Interior 
(DOI), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) publication, ``Hydrologic Unit 
Maps'' Water Supply Paper (Seaber et al., 1994) and the following DOI, 
USGS 1:500,000 scale hydrologic unit map: State of Maine. These 
documents are incorporated by reference. The incorporation by reference 
was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 
5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies of the USGS publication and 
the maps may be obtained from the USGS, Map Sales, Box 25286, Denver, CO 
80225. Copies may be inspected at NMFS, Protected Resources Division, 
Office of Protected Resources, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 
20910, or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). 
For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-
741-6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/Federal--register/code--of--
Federal--regulations/ibr--locations.html.
    (b) Critical habitat is designated in the Maine counties and towns 
for the three SHRUs described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this 
section. The textual descriptions of critical habitat for each SHRU are 
included in paragraphs (b)(3) through (6) of this section, and these 
descriptions are the definitive source for determining the critical 
habitat boundaries. A general location map (Figure 1) is provided at the 
end of paragraph (b)(2) and is for general guidance purposes only, and 
not as a definitive source for determining critical habitat boundaries.
    (1) Maine counties and towns affected. Critical habitat is 
designated for the following SHRUs in the following counties and towns.
    (i) Counties and towns partially or entirely within areas containing 
critical habitat in the Downeast Coastal SHRU:

    (2) Critical habitat boundaries. Critical habitat includes the 
stream channels within the designated stream reaches, and includes a 
lateral extent as defined by the ordinary high-water line (33 CFR 
329.11). In areas where the ordinary high-water line has not been 
defined, the lateral extent will be defined by the bankfull elevation. 
Bankfull elevation is the level at which water begins to leave the 
channel and move into the floodplain and is reached at a discharge which 
generally has a recurrence interval of 1 to 2 years on an annual flood 
series. Critical habitat in estuaries is defined by the perimeter of the 
water body as displayed on standard 1:24,000 scale topographic maps or 
the elevation of extreme high water, whichever is greater.

    (3) Primary constituent elements. Within the GOM DPS, the primary 
constituent elements (PCEs) for the conservation of Atlantic salmon 
include sites for spawning and incubation, sites for juvenile rearing, 
and sites for migration. The physical and biological features of the 
habitat that are essential to the conservation of Atlantic salmon are 
those features that allow Atlantic salmon to successfully use sites for 
spawning and rearing and sites for migration. These features include:
    (i) Deep, oxygenated pools and cover (e.g., boulders, woody debris, 
vegetation, etc.), near freshwater spawning sites, necessary to support 
adult migrants during the summer while they await spawning in the fall;
    (ii) Freshwater spawning sites that contain clean, permeable gravel 
and cobble substrate with oxygenated water and cool water temperatures 
to

[[Page 832]]

support spawning activity, egg incubation and larval development;
    (iii) Freshwater spawning and rearing sites with clean gravel in the 
presence of cool, oxygenated water and diverse substrate to support 
emergence, territorial development, and feeding activities of Atlantic 
salmon fry;
    (iv) Freshwater rearing sites with space to accommodate growth and 
survival of Atlantic salmon parr, and population densities needed to 
support sustainable populations;
    (v) Freshwater rearing sites with a combination of river, stream, 
and lake habitats, that accommodate parr's ability to occupy many niches 
and to maximize parr production;
    (vi) Freshwater rearing sites with cool, oxygenated water to support 
growth and survival of Atlantic salmon parr;
    (vii) Freshwater rearing sites with diverse food resources to 
support growth and survival of Atlantic salmon parr;
    (viii) Freshwater and estuary migratory sites free from physical and 
biological barriers that delay or prevent access to spawning grounds 
needed to support a recovered population;
    (ix) Freshwater and estuary migration sites with abundant, diverse 
native fish communities to serve as a protective buffer against 
predation;
    (x) Freshwater and estuary migration sites free from physical and 
biological barriers that delay or prevent emigration of smolts to the 
marine environment;
    (xi) Freshwater and estuary migration sites with sufficiently cool 
water temperatures and water flows that coincide with diurnal cues to 
stimulate smolt migration;
    (xii) Freshwater migration sites with water chemistry needed to 
support sea water adaptation of smolts; and

    (4) Habitat that meets the definition of critical habitat in 
occupied habitat areas on Passamaquoddy Tribal Indian lands and Fee 
lands or lands held in Trust by the Penobscot Indian Reservation within 
the range of the GOM DPS are excluded from designation. Per request of 
the Penobscot Tribe, critical habitat does include occupied habitat that 
makes up the Penobscot Indian Reservation. The Indian lands specifically 
excluded from critical habitat are those defined in the Secretarial 
Order 3206, including:
    (i) Lands held in Trust by the United States for the benefit of any

the critical habitat boundaries. The maps of the critical habitat units 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section are for illustrative purposes 
only.
    (a) Physical and biological features essential to the conservation 
of the endangered U.S. DPS of smalltooth sawfish. The physical and 
biological features essential to the conservation of the U.S. DPS of 
smalltooth sawfish, which provide nursery area functions are: red 
mangroves and shallow euryhaline habitats characterized by water depths 
between the Mean High Water line and 3 ft (0.9 m) measured at Mean Lower

[[Page 837]]

Low Water (MLLW). These features are included in critical habitat within 
the boundaries of the specific areas in paragraph (b) of this section, 
except where the features were not physically accessible to sawfish at 
the time of this designation (September 2009); for example, areas where 
existing water control structures prevent sawfish passage to habitats 
beyond the structure.
    (b) Critical habitat boundaries. Critical habitat includes two areas 
(units) located along the southwest coast of peninsular Florida. The 
northern unit is the Charlotte Harbor Estuary Unit and the southern unit 
is the Ten Thousand Islands/Everglades (TTI/E) Unit. The units encompass 
portions of Charlotte, Lee, Collier, Monroe, and Miami-Dade Counties.
    (1) Charlotte Harbor Estuary Unit. The Charlotte Harbor Estuary Unit 
is located within Charlotte and Lee Counties. The unit includes 
Charlotte Harbor, Gasparilla Sound, Pine Island Sound, Matlacha Pass, 
San Carlos Bay, Estero Bay, and the Caloosahatchee River. The unit is 
defined by the following boundaries. It is bounded by the Peace River at 
the eastern extent at the mouth of Shell Creek at 81[deg]59.467[min] W, 
and the northern extent of the Charlotte Harbor Preserve State Park at 
26[deg]58.933[min] N. At the Myakka River the unit is bounded by the SR-
776 Bridge and in Gasparilla Sound by the SR-771 Bridge. The COLREGS-72 
lines between Gasparilla Island, Lacosta Island, North Captiva Island, 
Captiva Island, Sanibel Island, and the northern point of Estero Island 
are used as the coastal boundary for the unit. The southern extent of 
the unit is the Estero Bay Aquatic Preserve, which is bounded on the 
south by the Lee/Collier County line. Inland waters are bounded by SR-
867 (McGregor Boulevard) from Punta Rassa Road to SR-80 near Fort Myers, 
then by SR-80 (Palm Beach Boulevard) to Orange River Boulevard, then by 
Orange River Boulevard to Buckingham Road, then by Buckingham Road to 
SR-80, and then following SR-80 until it is due south of the Franklin 
Lock and Dam (S-79), which is the eastern boundary on the Caloosahatchee 
River and a structural barrier for sawfish access. Additional inland 
water boundaries north and west of the lock are bounded by North 
Franklin Lock Road to North River Road, then by North River Road to SR-
31, then by SR-31 to SR-78 near Cape Coral, then by SR-78 to SR-765, 
then by SR-765 to US-41, then by US-41 to US-17 (Marion Avenue) in Punta 
Gorda, then by US-17 to Riverside Drive, and then by Riverside Drive to 
the eastern extent of the Peace River at 81[deg]59.467[min] W. From the 
northern extent of the Charlotte Harbor Preserve State Park at 
26[deg]58.933[min] N, inland waters are bounded westward along that 
latitude to Harbor View Road, then by Harbor View Road to US-41, then by 
US-41 to SR-776, then by SR-776 to the Myakka River Bridge.
    (2) Ten Thousand Islands/Everglades Unit (TTI/E). The TTI/E Unit is 
located within Collier, Monroe, and Miami-Dade Counties, Florida. The 
unit includes waters within Everglades National Park (ENP), including 
Florida Bay, in the vicinity of Everglades City, within the Cape Romano-
Ten Thousand Islands Aquatic Preserve (AP), and within the portion of 
Rookery Bay AP south of SR-92. The boundaries match the portion of 
Rookery Bay AP south of SR-92, and the Cape Romano-Ten Thousand Islands 
Aquatic Preserve AP. The unit boundaries also closely match the ENP 
boundaries with the following two exceptions: the unit boundary connects 
points 55 and 57 as illustrated in the critical habitat map that 
follows, which extend beyond the ENP boundary; and the unit boundary is 
located inside the ENP boundary between points 77 and 2, omitting the 
northeast portion of the ENP. The boundary of the unit is comprised of 
the following connected points, listed by point number in the ID field, 
degrees North latitude, degrees West longitude, and brief description of 
the boundary.

Sec. 226.219  Critical habitat for the Southern Distinct Population 
Segment of North American Green Sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris).

    Critical habitat is designated for the Southern Distinct Population 
Segment of North American green sturgeon (Southern DPS) as described in 
this section. The textual descriptions of critical habitat in this 
section are the definitive source for determining the critical habitat 
boundaries. The overview maps are provided for general guidance purposes 
only and not as a definitive source for determining critical habitat 
boundaries.
    (a) Critical habitat boundaries. Critical habitat in freshwater 
riverine areas includes the stream channels and a lateral extent as 
defined by the ordinary high-water line (33 CFR 329.11). In areas for 
which the ordinary high-water line has not been defined pursuant to 33 
CFR 329.11, the lateral extent will be defined by the bankfull 
elevation. Bankfull elevation is the level at which water begins to 
leave the channel and move into the floodplain and is reached at a 
discharge which generally has a recurrence interval of 1 to 2 years on 
the annual flood series. Critical habitat in bays and estuaries includes 
tidally influenced areas as defined by the elevation of mean higher high 
water. The boundary between coastal marine areas and bays and estuaries 
are delineated by the COLREGS lines (33 CFR 80). Critical habitat in 
coastal marine areas is defined by the zone between the 60 fathom (fm) 
depth bathymetry line and the line on shore reached by mean lower low 
water (MLLW), or to the COLREGS lines.
    (1) Coastal marine areas: All U.S. coastal marine waters out to the 
60 fm depth bathymetry line (relative to MLLW) from Monterey Bay, 
California (36[deg]38[min]12[sec] N./121[deg]56[min]13[sec] W.) north 
and east to include waters in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Washington. 
The Strait of Juan de Fuca includes all U.S. marine waters: in Clallam 
County east of a line connecting Cape Flattery (48[deg]23[min]10[sec]

124[deg]44[min]12[sec] W.), and Bonilla Point, British Columbia 
(48[deg]35[min]30[sec] N./124[deg]43[min]00[sec] W.); in Jefferson and 
Island counties north and west of a line connecting Point Wilson 
(48[deg]08[min]38[sec] N./122[deg]45[min]07[sec] W.) and Partridge Point 
(48[deg]13[min]29[sec] N./122[deg]46[min]11[sec] W.); and in San Juan 
and Skagit counties south of lines connecting the U.S.-Canada border

    (b) Primary constituent elements. The primary constituent elements 
essential for the conservation of the Southern DPS of green sturgeon 
are:
    (1) For freshwater riverine systems:
    (i) Food resources. Abundant prey items for larval, juvenile, 
subadult, and adult life stages.
    (ii) Substrate type or size (i.e., structural features of 
substrates). Substrates suitable for egg deposition and development 
(e.g., bedrock sills and shelves, cobble and gravel, or hard clean sand, 
with interstices or irregular surfaces to ``collect'' eggs and provide 
protection from predators, and free of excessive

[[Page 846]]

silt and debris that could smother eggs during incubation), larval 
development (e.g., substrates with interstices or voids providing refuge 
from predators and from high flow conditions), and subadults and adults 
(e.g., substrates for holding and spawning).
    (iii) Water flow. A flow regime (i.e., the magnitude, frequency, 
duration, seasonality, and rate-of-change of fresh water discharge over 
time) necessary for normal behavior, growth, and survival of all life 
stages.
    (iv) Water quality. Water quality, including temperature, salinity, 
oxygen content, and other chemical characteristics, necessary for normal 
behavior, growth, and viability of all life stages.
    (v) Migratory corridor. A migratory pathway necessary for the safe 
and timely passage of Southern DPS fish within riverine habitats and 
between riverine and estuarine habitats (e.g., an unobstructed river or 
dammed river that still allows for safe and timely passage).
    (vi) Depth. Deep (<ls-thn-eq>=5 m) holding pools for both upstream 
and downstream holding of adult or subadult fish, with adequate water 
quality and flow to maintain the physiological needs of the holding 
adult or subadult fish.
    (vii) Sediment quality. Sediment quality (i.e., chemical 
characteristics) necessary for normal behavior, growth, and viability of 
all life stages.
    (2) For estuarine habitats:
    (i) Food resources. Abundant prey items within estuarine habitats 
and substrates for juvenile, subadult, and adult life stages.
    (ii) Water flow. Within bays and estuaries adjacent to the 
Sacramento River (i.e., the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and the Suisun, 
San Pablo, and San Francisco bays), sufficient flow into the bay and 
estuary to allow adults to successfully orient to the incoming flow and 
migrate upstream to spawning grounds.
    (iii) Water quality. Water quality, including temperature, salinity, 
oxygen content, and other chemical characteristics, necessary for normal 
behavior, growth, and viability of all life stages.
    (iv) Migratory corridor. A migratory pathway necessary for the safe 
and timely passage of Southern DPS fish within estuarine habitats and 
between estuarine and riverine or marine habitats.
    (v) Depth. A diversity of depths necessary for shelter, foraging, 
and migration of juvenile, subadult, and adult life stages.
    (vi) Sediment quality. Sediment quality (i.e., chemical 
characteristics) necessary for normal behavior, growth, and viability of 
all life stages.
    (3) For nearshore coastal marine areas:
    (i) Migratory corridor. A migratory pathway necessary for the safe 
and timely passage of Southern DPS fish within marine and between 
estuarine and marine habitats.
    (ii) Water quality. Nearshore marine waters with adequate dissolved 
oxygen levels and acceptably low levels of contaminants (e.g., 
pesticides, organochlorines, elevated levels of heavy metals) that may 
disrupt the normal behavior, growth, and viability of subadult and adult 
green sturgeon.
    (iii) Food resources. Abundant prey items for subadults and adults, 
which may include benthic invertebrates and fishes.
    (c) Sites owned or controlled by the Department of Defense. Critical 
habitat does not include the following areas owned or controlled by the 
Department of Defense, or designated for its use, in the States of 
California, Oregon, and Washington:
    (1) Mare Island U.S. Army Reserve Center, San Pablo Bay, CA;

restricted area, WA;
    (3) Strait of Juan de Fuca and Whidbey Island naval restricted area, 
WA;
    (4) Admiralty Inlet naval restricted area, Strait of Juan de Fuca, 
WA; and
    (5) Navy 3 operating area, Strait of Juan de Fuca, WA.
    (d) Indian lands. Critical habitat does not include any Indian lands 
of the following Federally-recognized Tribes in the States of 
California, Oregon, and Washington:
    (1) Cachil DeHe Band of Wintun Indians of the Colusa Indian 
Community, California;

Sec. 226.220  Critical habitat for the Cook Inlet beluga whale 
(Delphinapterus leucas).

    Critical habitat is designated in Cook Inlet, Alaska, for the Cook 
Inlet beluga whale as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section. The textual description of this critical habitat is the 
definitive source for determining the critical habitat boundaries. 
General location maps are provided for general guidance purposes only, 
and not as a definitive source for determining critical habitat 
boundaries. Critical habitat does not include manmade structures and the 
land on which they rest within the designated boundaries described in 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section that were in existence as of 
May 11, 2011.
    (a) Critical Habitat Boundaries. Critical habitat includes two 
specific marine areas in Cook Inlet, Alaska. These areas are bounded on 
the upland by Mean High Water (MHW) datum, except for the lower reaches 
of four tributary rivers. Critical habitat shall not extend into the 
tidally-influenced channels of tributary waters of Cook Inlet, with the 
exceptions noted in the descriptions of each critical habitat area.
    (1) Area 1. All marine waters of Cook Inlet north of a line from the 
mouth of Threemile Creek (61[deg]08.5[min] N., 151[deg]04.4[min] W.) 
connecting to Point Possession (61[deg]02.1[min] N., 150[deg]24.3[min] 
W.), including waters of the Susitna River south of 61[deg]20.0[min] N., 
the Little Susitna River south of 61[deg]18.0[min] N., and the 
Chickaloon River north of 60[deg]53.0[min] N.
    (2) Area 2. All marine waters of Cook Inlet south of a line from the 
mouth of Threemile Creek (61[deg]08.5[min] N., 151[deg]04.4[min] W.) to 
Point Possession (61[deg]02.1[min] N., 150[deg]24.3[min] W.) and north 
of 60[deg]15.0[min]N., including waters within 2 nautical miles seaward 
of MHW along the western shoreline of Cook Inlet between 
60[deg]15.0[min] N. and the mouth of the Douglas River (59[deg]04.0[min] 
N., 153[deg]46.0[min] W.); all waters of Kachemak Bay east of 
151[deg]40.0[min] W.; and waters of the Kenai River below the Warren 
Ames bridge at Kenai, Alaska.
    (b) A map of the designated critical habitat for Cook Inlet beluga 
whale follows (Figure 1).

    (c) Primary constituent elements. The primary constituent elements 
essential to the conservation of the Cook Inlet beluga whale are:
    (1) Intertidal and subtidal waters of Cook Inlet with depths <30 
feet (MLLW) and within 5 miles of high and medium flow anadromous fish 
streams.

[[Page 853]]

    (2) Primary prey species consisting of four species of Pacific 
salmon (Chinook, sockeye, chum, and coho), Pacific eulachon, Pacific 
cod, walleye pollock, saffron cod, and yellowfin sole.
    (3) Waters free of toxins or other agents of a type and amount 
harmful to Cook Inlet beluga whales.
    (4) Unrestricted passage within or between the critical habitat 
areas.
    (5) Waters with in-water noise below levels resulting in the 
abandonment of critical habitat areas by Cook Inlet beluga whales.
    (d) Sites owned or controlled by the Department of Defense, or of 
interest to national security. Critical habitat does not include the 
following areas owned by the Department of Defense or for which the 
Secretary has determined to exclude for reasons of national security:
    (1) All property and overlying waters of Joint Base Elmendorf-
Richardson between Mean Higher High Water and Mean High Water; and

Sec. 226.221  Critical habitat for black abalone 
(Haliotis cracherodii).

    Critical habitat is designated for black abalone as described in 
this section. The textual descriptions of critical habitat in this 
section are the definitive source for determining the critical habitat 
boundaries. The overview maps are provided for general guidance purposes 
only and not as a definitive source for determining critical habitat 
boundaries.
    (a) Critical habitat boundaries--(1) Coastal Marine Areas: The 
critical habitat designation for black abalone within each coastal 
marine area below along the California coast is defined by four latitude 
and longitude coordinates that set the northern and southern boundaries, 
as well as by bathymetric specifications that set the shoreward and 
seaward boundaries. The northern boundary is the straight line between 
the northern coordinates and the southern boundary is the straight line 
between the southern coordinates, extending out as far as the seaward 
boundary, defined by the -6 m depth bathymetry line (relative to mean 
lower low water (MLLW)), and the shoreward boundary, defined by the line 
that marks mean higher high water (MHHW). Critical habitat only includes 
rocky intertidal and subtidal habitats within these areas from the MHHW 
line to a depth of -6 m relative to MLLW, as well as the marine waters 
above the rocky habitats.

[[Page 854]]

boundary that extends offshore to the -6m depth bathymetry line 
(relative to MLLW), and a shoreward boundary that is the line marking 
MHHW. Critical habitat only includes rocky intertidal and subtidal 
habitats from MHHW to a depth of -6 m relative to MLLW, including the 
marine waters above the rocky substrate.
    (i) Farallon Islands, San Francisco County, California.
    (ii)A[ntilde]o Nuevo Island, San Mateo County, California.
    (iii) San Miguel Island, Santa Barbara County, California.
    (iv) Santa Rosa Island, Santa Barbara County, California.
    (v) Santa Cruz Island, Santa Barbara County, California.
    (vi) Anacapa Island, Ventura County, California.
    (vii) Santa Barbara Island, Santa Barbara County, California.
    (viii) Santa Catalina Island, Los Angeles County, California.
    (b) Primary constituent elements. The primary constituent elements 
essential for the conservation of the black abalone are:
    (1) Rocky substrate. Suitable rocky substrate includes rocky benches 
formed from consolidated rock of various geological origins (e.g., 
igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary) that contain channels with macro- 
and micro-crevices or large boulders (greater than or equal to 1 m in 
diameter) and occur from MHHW to a depth of -6 m relative to MLLW. All 
types of relief (high, medium and low; 0.5 to greater than 2 m vertical 
relief) support black abalone.
    (2) Food resources. Abundant food resources including bacterial and 
diatom films, crustose coralline algae, and a source of detrital 
macroalgae, are required for growth and survival of all stages of black 
abalone. The primary macroalgae consumed by juvenile and adult black 
abalone are giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) and feather boa kelp 
(Egregia menziesii) in southern California (i.e., south of Point 
Conception) habitats, and bull kelp (Nereocystis leutkeana) in central 
and northern California habitats (i.e., north of Santa Cruz), although 
Macrocystis and Egregia may be more prominent in the habitat and diet in 
areas south of Santa Cruz. Southern sea palm (Eisenia arborea), elk kelp 
(Pelagophycus porra), stalked kelp (Pterygophora californica), and other 
brown kelps (Laminaria sp.) may also be consumed by black abalone.
    (3) Juvenile settlement habitat. Rocky intertidal and subtidal 
habitat containing crustose coralline algae and crevices or cryptic 
biogenic structures (e.g., urchins, mussels, chiton holes, conspecifics, 
anemones) is important for successful larval recruitment and juvenile 
growth and survival of black abalone less than approximately 25 mm shell 
length. Adult abalone may facilitate larval settlement and metamorphosis 
by grazing down algal competitors and thereby promoting the maintenance 
of substantial substratum cover by crustose coralline algae, 
outcompeting encrusting sessile invertebrates (e.g. tube worms and tube 
snails) for space and thereby promoting the maintenance of substantial 
substratum cover by crustose coralline algae as well as creating space 
for settling abalone, and emitting chemical cues that may induce 
settlement of abalone larvae.
    (4) Suitable water quality. Suitable water quality includes 
temperature (i.e., tolerance range: 12 to 25 [deg]C; optimal range: 18 
to 22 [deg]C), salinity (i.e., 30 to 35 ppt), pH (i.e., 7.5 to 8.5), and 
other chemical characteristics necessary for normal settlement, growth, 
behavior, and viability of black abalone.
    (5) Suitable nearshore circulation patterns. Suitable circulation 
patterns are those that retain eggs, sperm, fertilized eggs, and ready-
to-settle larvae within 100 km from shore so that successful 
fertilization and settlement to shallow intertidal habitat can take 
place.
    (c) Overview maps of black abalone critical habitat follow:

Sec. 226.222  Critical habitat for the southern Distinct Population 
Segment of eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus).

    Critical habitat is designated for the southern Distinct Population 
Segment of eulachon (southern DPS) as described in this section. The 
textual descriptions of critical habitat in this section are the 
definitive source for determining the critical habitat boundaries. The 
overview maps are provided for general guidance only and not as a 
definitive source for determining critical habitat boundaries. In 
freshwater areas, critical habitat includes the stream channel and a 
lateral extent as

[[Page 857]]

defined by the ordinary high-water line (33 CFR 329.11). In areas where 
the ordinary high-water line has not been defined, the lateral extent 
will be defined by the bankfull elevation. Bankfull elevation is the 
level at which water begins to leave the channel and move into the 
floodplain and is reached at a discharge which generally has a 
recurrence interval of 1 to 2 years on the annual flood series. In 
estuarine areas, critical habitat includes tidally influenced areas as 
defined by the elevation of mean higher high water.
